Death Row
That's where motherfuckers is endin up
Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I rob my adversaries, but Slick done left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch, or make the nigga rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin', and talkin' behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin' trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
Whip out the nine, now I'ma dive and pump your ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch, and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin, but swear I'm nothin' nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
I listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers
And fuck five-oh, blaow blaow... turn 'em into forty-niners
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where they find me? 16 on Death Row
Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, 'cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my set, is 16 is wet
It's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin' Hell
I shouldn'ta let him catch me
Instead of livin' sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin' torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin' sheep, niggaz countin' cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
'Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me? 16 on Death Row
Dear mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin' every breath
I'm bitter 'cause I'm dyin', so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that motherfucker never cared for me
He's only here to be sure
I don't drop a dime to God 'bout the crimes he's committin
On the poor, and how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
To keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin motherfuckers
Steer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin for the chair
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where we live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me? 16 on Death Row
16 on Death Row
It's to all my partners in the penitentiaries
16 on Death Row

I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I, think I got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker
Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side

Niggaz with a death wish step in with a Tec and I'll wet this

Two to one I'm writing representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm must run

That old deadly shit. Aiyyo Treach where you at?

And if another doubts I blow your fuckin' mother out
And that's the street scarred style
I shout I'm-de-MC-wit-de-nasty-mouf, and kick the bitch out
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin' pounds more

Pickin' pockets with a razor stoppin' Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin shop
Once you sound hot, 'cause if you ain't a perfect ten
My sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin' styles in em
Like women I did 'em I'm in for deadly ready venom
Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Maj
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin 'em down, I make 'em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Rob and steal and runnin' from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin' bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leavin' trails of brains and bladders
Blowin' 'em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, somethin' that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit em, I lit him
He's out! A poison, a deadly venom
Yeah Maj, fuck that! You know how we do.
KnowhatI'msayin? Squad in effect, YG'z in effect.
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent
Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggaz can't touch me when I wreckin G you better flee
'Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggaz back to the stomping grounds
Line 'em up single file, dome runnin' in em
A nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom
Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin? Fuck that!
I told you, we takin' over, yo 'Pac.
Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggaz don't even worry me, see

Fuck the cops cause my gauge gets me... PAID
As I sit and reminesce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey

Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight

We takin' this motherfucker over. TRUST. We out.
When your hero falls from grace, all fairy tales are uncovered
Myth exposed and pain magnified, the grace pays uncovered
He told me to be strong, but I confused to see it so weak
You say never to give up, and it hurts to see what comes to be
When your hero falls solely the stars, and so does the reception of tomorrow
Without my hero, there's only me alone, to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work, and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do, when your only hero falls
As long as some suffer, the river flows forever
As long as there is pain, the river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be, the river will flow forever
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together
We'll ride, the river together, as long as, you are with me
The river, will flow forever, as long as, you are with me
The river, will flow forever, as long as, you are with me

Jewellery, fast cars and known for flashing

A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was working for the feds, same crime different trials
Niggas picture what he said, and did I mention?
Promised a payback, Jimmy Henchmen, in due time

21 Gun Salute to my niggas that died in the lines of duty
Represent to the fullest and be a souljah
The military minds that play the rules of the game
21 Gun Salute
I salute you my niggas
Stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you
It's on for you
'Cause all you bitch made niggas
Are coming for me
Against all odds
I don't care who you fuck with
You touch me I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers don't think I forgot
Hell na I ain't forgot nigga
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war till I got my money right
Now I got my money right
Now I want war
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Picutes of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time on California crime
Watching for thievin I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin
Puttin' a bullet in mutherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, 'cause we ain't hard to find
I got my locs on hard hat goin' to war
Breakin them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch 'em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, Tupac and the Click, smokin' blunts, loadin clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a hoe, a hoe
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'
Down the steps
Abandonded broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the drama play
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake although mine was first to ask niggaz
Motherfuckers didn't think I wasn't going do somethin', ask niggaz
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga, threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride, double-edgin for the other side
But now, my glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental keep my name out your dental
Nigga, if your gum bleedin, and you needin
Mo' than twenty sticthes, you behaved like dem bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game, check the resident it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find
Why them niggaz actin' like they can't find us
Like like they can't see us and
Like we don't be at the same spots they be at
It's the same congregation, Young Pac is back
YouknowhatImean?
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to fine
Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some hurricane
Sideways to the next light...
It's all about you
YouknowhatI'msayin?
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh
You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
But how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' Boo, is this is all about you
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
With the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
'Cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you... hahaha, yeah nigga
It's all about you
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you? Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean... god damn, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm sittin' back, watchin Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in, my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy Tupac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin?
And then yaknahmsayin what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in, the homeboy Warren G video
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same hoe
Don't get mad, I'm only bein real
Yeah
It's all about you
YouknowhatI'msayin?
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh
You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
But how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life

I'm caught between my women, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as we dip
I'm lost in the land, with no plan, living life flawless
Crime Boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm taking off on the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tek
Devoted to serving this, Moet and pay checks
Like a kite sailin' nigga I'm forever Ballin'

Sucka duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handling my business nigga keep on coastin'

Steady flaunting against the grain nigga still don't know me

Will I survive, will I die, come on lets picture the possibilities
Giving me charges, lawyers making a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, alone, as a teenager, on the mobile
Calling big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, balllin' in the fast lane
Hustle till the morning, never stopped until the cash came
I live my life as a Thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa
'Cause we be getting high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down now its time to floss my shit

Fuck these fed Niggas Pac
Do it, Do it, Do it.
Come hell or high water
Down to slaughter opposes
Just another lost soul stuck callin Jehova
Outlaw till it's over
Brandish my strap, back like a cobra
I stay drunk 'cause I'ma mad man
We're never sober
On a one man mission
My ambitions to hold up the rap game
While I plug holes in niggas like doughnuts
And still
Down to die for all my souljahs, like hillbillies
They don't feel me
So we fued
Bringin' war to the city
With each breath
Death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me
No apologies, your honor
A general in war I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers quick to move shit, heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam
Sometimes I question Hussein
Like fiends fighting for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sand storms
Then transform
Watch me, I take a figga of thirty niggaz, who all got me
While bitches wondering, who shot me, no love
Keep a grudge, shooting slugs like Muammar Qadaafi
Murdered my friend built a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi
Gon fly now
Nigga like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper
Bustin' caps at Jay-Z
And still avoid capture
While you all caught up in the rapture
Still after me I'm in Jamaica sippin' daiquiris
No doubt
We used to havin' nothing
Then grabbin something and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga
That my old man wasn't
I came to a fear catchin' cases, litigation
Niggaz playa hatin'
Got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screaming Death Row
Throwing Westside
Ain't no thang
We was raised off drive-by's
Brought up to bang
We claim mob
M-O-B., if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this
I'm hard to kill
When I bill with this live spot
Father
How the hell did I survive, these 5 shots?
Live it up or give it up and like demons
Late night, hear 'em screaming
We going All Out
We going All Out
Bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route
Without a doubt
War, which means, we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle ya own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay
Nigga go all out
Busta's playing with your papes
Better go all out
Trying to see the next day
Nigga go all out
Obstacles in your way
Better go all out
I'm on my land sled
Walking through the belly of the beast
Feeling like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, who are mob niggas hiding in bushes
Claiming that they ride but they softer than cushion
They softer than bitches in worst way drowning in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers I'd die for these thugs
Say hi to these slugs
It's a shame how some niggas on the west coast
Who was riding with Pac
But when he died they went pop
I mob the Jers' to the fullest lots of west coast love
But after Pac stopped rapping ain't no west coast thugs
Just west coast what?
To my real niggaz stuck in these street game
These rappers like Jay-Z
Who be pumping Kool-Aid through their veins
It's true what I'm saying
Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my 4-4 put three holes in your dome
I Ride or Die
While these other fag niggas be biting this
It's all from my heart when I was writing this
Now it's All Out
We all ride
And down to die
Who with us?
Speak up
Or get treated like you coming to kill us
They nothing but squealers
In this rap game swearing they rough
Tattoo'd up
And now them nigga swearing they Pac
Stop that and watch your back
We ain't forgot about cha
These glocks hot
And when shot would bring the bitch up out cha
It's me, Kastro
With the goatee
Walking like an OG
Cause all these fag mother fuckas owe me
I pray to thug lords, like the mother fuckers holy
Frontline soldier, till the heavens, hold me
I go all out
And if you real you real
Feel what I'm talking 'bout cause this game is real
I live it
Forbidden fruit and shoot till they feel it
Living proof Pac breed niggaz they can't deal with
Holler back, right back, and watch your mouth
Or get blood in it
What, we going all out nigga
Fool, you better go all out
Keep going all out
All my niggaz going all out

Ey, you niggaz just gone think you gon be a, talking slick on all these mother fucking records

You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah...
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, Fuck it, cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, Go to the tele hoe
You put what money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggaz is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin' attention
To my amibitions as a ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
But they can't do nuttin to a G
Peep it... it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
Spittin' at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they catchin me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
Gettin' much mail in jail, niggaz tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me,
And all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Got the police bustin' at me

Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
Gettin' much mail in jail, niggaz tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me,
And all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah
This one is all about love
Love, love, oh no
This one is for my baby boo
Now what's about baby
Red Rat will always love you, always
Yo bean or not molest me of you
Prepare to die or say you want me too
I would do anything for make you my baby boo
Remember that I still love you
Yo bean or not molest me of you
Prepare to die or say you want me too
I want to hear my baby boo
And this one is just for you, just for you
I would jump all my girls for you
Walk around the world for you
Fly around like the birds for you
That's why I wrote these words for you
I don't have everything
I sometimes wonder why
I don't have anything
From my heart
Yo, accept the G of a better day
And you tell me find my way
But be the man I'm sure to make me stay
But to keep you, I'll do all it takes
Of course, yeah
Men you think you're nor'
Hold you but you're cloa'
Give me a chance for sure and I'll show
I'm really the one you know
This is not a flo'
Can we stick to the Red Cross? Yo
And if it meant that my love was really true
I'd gladly die and watch over you
I wish you know how much I cared
You'd see my love is true, that love we'd share
Believe that yo
Even if you change your mind
And said our love was through
I'll die, I would cry but I'll still love you
Yo, yo bean or not molest me of you
Prepare to die or say you want me too
I would do anything to make you my baby boo
If it don't work I still love you
It's for our love, no matter what
I'll still love you
As the world turns...
As the world turns my niggaz grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Niggaz die and mommas cry
Niggaz got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggaz fame, as the world turns...
Though I walk through the valley of hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build, and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
If we search deeper, god bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deeper inside
We we ride plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin them fakes smile plastic tears
Like last year, niggaz stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the Mob, M-O-B
Killin' bustaz is my motherfuckin job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, niggaz reported missin'
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns...
My niggaz grow and grow and grow
And gettin' dough and dough and dough
From this state to that state
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns... and steady turnin'
As the world turn burnin paths, starin' through my rearview
It's a war goin' on, and the President is in too
I hear Tu-Pac sayin', Watch 'em they'll kill you
Sippin Thug Passion, scrub actin' like he feel you
Steady plottin, ready or not; Outlawz lost
But not forgotten, from Gittere to Compton
A spitter of the hotness, long timeness
So like six I ain't never been rich
I need cream, to buy Ellene a dream house
She no longer fiend out y'all, Outlawww
Another lonely nigga with a 12-gage pump
With a 12-hour rush to run and get this money, fuck these punks
Road rules I swim in the dirt, I stay in some skirt
I hit where it hurts, I ride or die for my turf
I ride or die for Makaveli the legendary war thug nigga
Kadafi betta unslug this nigga, Seike betta undrug this nigga
Out of the buildin we street children with no souls
Our hearts gon' stay cold, the war gon' stay on
We serve em, like Pac told us to, catch 'em wet with the tec
Hit 'em in the neck and watch him die like he supposed to
Napoleon the front line soldier, front times over
Rider for the mightly dollar rather drunk or sober
Nigga talkin' thug walkin' all through yo' squad
Y'all niggaz scared by a dog, I got my fo'-fo' for y'all
It's like a hot, heated day homie, warfare don't play homie
Better be prepared than try to dunk away from these strays homie
Worlds turn, thangs burn, all in one shot
Rest in peace to the fallen soldiers, all that we got
As the world turns...
Niggaz gettin' swoll out
And it don't stop and it don't quit
That real shit! As the world turns...
Niggaz die for
How many you niggaz try for this? As the world turns
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns... and steady turnin'
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns...
Only haters caught feelings, when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin'
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin' our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas - mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin armies ridin' soldiers, gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nuttin left to earn
October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my Mack-11 hit the block playin'
Only five years up in this bitch, poppa runnin' from the Feds
Puttin' peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin straight shots of Cristal Brothers
Hundred dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns
Hahaha... as the world turns...
And turns and turns and turns... haha
This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin to bubble, keep on hustlin, as the world turns
Money come and go, hoes come and go, foes come and go
Friends come and go... my soldiers, stay eternal
Outlaw Immortalz, dedicated
I send this to black Jesus, only he can feed us
When you need us, as the world turns
Throw this shit in the deck, hahah
Niggaz gettin' chin checked
From the East to the West best to wear a vest
Nigga we ain't the ones to test, fuck you
As the world turns
Outlaw ridahs, Mutah right beside us
Camillion, wanna make a million
Haha legit, as the world turns... haha...
Burn baby burn
A lot of niggaz get burned as the world turns
A lot of niggaz gettin' burned as the world turns...
Gettin' burned as the world turns
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat, so when she asked me
What would you do if it was you?
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggaz grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain, Lord come and take me
Four niggaz violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No, you got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies
Baby, please don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry
I ain't no hater but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
And never your feelings, he's chasin millions fo' sho'
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much, mo', livin' to do I'm spittin' this to you,
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she
Got 'em all stuck standin' still when she come through
Baby, take a little mo' time, love'll find you
And show us the sky's blue somebody other than me
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Baby, don't cry
I'm tryin' to do all that I can, from jump
Now you losin', you was choosin' the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homey roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her, Pampers and food, just to stop through
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Shoulda chose me, she 'bout to O.D. from the pressure
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Baby, don't cry, I gotta keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
Yeah, Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Its just the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
This is the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Ballad of a Dead Soulja
The plan to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded to be the man it was planned
All my road dogs official mob figures love to act up
The first to bomb when we rob niggas
I could be lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thoughts gripping chrome nines
Niggaz get tossed up war scars battle field memories
Swore saw the Devil in my empty glass of Hennessy
Talking to a nigga on a tight leash
Screaming fuck the police as I ride through the night streets
Little child running wild towards his danger
What's the cause don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a mad man a pistol grabbing nigga
Unleash the sand man
Promise a merciless retaliation nothing is colder
Close your eyes hear the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Its just the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Close your eyes, hear the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
This just the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Close your eyes
Completely lost revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch switch now the tricks crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screaming bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what ya see now
A blind man and a dead body I'm meant to leave town
And get my cash though hook up wit Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers try to play us out 'member that
They took my money and my stash time to get it them back
Haha I pull my secret arrival
Death to my rivals tell me what you want lord?
Nobody laugh after the death of a drug lord
Haha the situation's critical nothing is colder
Than hearing the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Be a coward put your hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out them niggas came out BOOM
Who wanna see me in a challenge
So merciless I'm terrifying niggas in my ballad do you feel me?
Capo or capitan one day I'll be the Don
Until then I remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Busting at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facing sixty years
Shedding tattoo tears another suicidal on the tier
Take a private plane trying to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All they promised us is death nigga
Take a breath could be the last one left nigga
Its real now, uh feel it and fantasize ain't nothing colder
Listen you can hear it, the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
This go out to Kato 'n' Mental
All the niggaz that have passed away
Mutulu, Geronimo, Seyku
All the down ass ridahz
All the niggaz that put it down
All the souljaz
All the niggaz that go through that day to day struggle
All the niggaz that passed on
All the niggaz with ambition and money in their heart
All the niggaz want some and that don't take none, hahaha
The police is so scared of us
All the feds, they aware of us
They wanna see us dead,
They got pictures of a nigga hit
Try and see me in chains
Shit, them niggaz will never breath again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole mutha fucken block
Fuck the cops
The police? We run these streets nigga
Heh, these niggaz can't see me
Half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionare
Shit, it ain't fair
But nigga-you know
It's the ballad of a dead soulja
Looking for these better dayz
'Better Dayz'
Heey
'Better Dayz'
Got me thinking bout better dayz
'Better Dayz', 'Better Dayz', 'Better Dayz'
Heey
'Better Dayz'
Got me thinking bout 'Better Dayz'
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smoking weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids wanna try now
Then lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches them clocking, the evil men do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearing victims screaming
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semen's
Cause even our birthdays, are cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beasts
And only we can change, it's up to us to clean up the streets
It ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Pass by his family but what could I say?
Keep your head up and try to keep the faith and pray for 'Better Dayz'
Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Thinking bout better dayz
Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Got me thinking bout better dayz
Thinking back as an adolescent
Who would have guessed, that in my future years I'd be stressing
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Trying to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slanging yayo all day long
Saving up for some Jordan's, 'cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too
And so am I, I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So we argue and playfight, all day and night
Making passionate love till the day light
Plus we bout to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
You tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressing looking for them 'Better Dayz'
Better dayz
Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Thinking bout better dayz
Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Got me thinking bout better dayz
Now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school we was true, me and you
Only part of us separated we stay faded
Affiliated with gang bangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressing like grown men, when rolling
Out in the dark, smoking Newports, gaming marks
Gotta place in my heart, homie stay smart
Locked you up in the pen and gave you 3 to 10
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hoping you well, I know it's Hell
Doing time in the cell you need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doing cool
I've settled down had a family, working and night school
Every once in awhile, I reminisce
And wonder how we ever came to this
I miss the 'Better Dayz'
Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Thinking bout better dayz
Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Got me thinking bout better dayz

Black Cotton
Black Cotton
Black Cotton - A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Robbin' Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak
Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Answer that then answer this too-
Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Dum dum diddy is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Nobody don't care
Nobody don't care
Nobody don't care
Nobody don't care
Nobody don't care
In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know
I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did
To what's Bebe's kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet
Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit
They shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind
And we ain't stop, its cutains, you try to rise and
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Runnin' up, Gun cocked like nasty gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove
No love
Waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
Biblicle times good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton - I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton - I ain't stoppin' till they givin' me mine
Black Cotton
Searching for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin jewels and shit, yaknahmean?
Straight tatted up, no doubt, no doubt
Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off nigga...
What?
I do my shootin's on a knob, prayin' to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
Like I'm jailin, shots hittin up my spot like midnight rains hailin
Got me bailin to stacks more green; Gods ain't tryin' to be trapped
On no block slangin no rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
Gods words all cursed like crack
Shai-tan's way of gettin' us back
Or just another one of my Black Jesus traps
Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin' up in silence
Dark prayer, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
'Cause I swear, they tryin' to break my will
I'm on the edge lookin' down at this bottomless pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin' souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus, hahahahaha
He's like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
Outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
Rebellin against the system, commence to lynchin
The President ain't even listenin to the pain of the youth
We make music for eternity, forever the truth
Political prisoner, the two choices that they givin' us
Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin new
In school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true
Black Jesus
To this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggaz pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggaz play together
We die clutchin glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wishes nigga smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin, hopin for possibilities
I'll mob on, why they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hatin' the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast till they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin Black Jesus
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin' souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
Some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
Trapped, black, scarred and barred
Searching for truth, where it's hard to find God
I play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer
Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties
Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums
This ain't livin'... Jesus
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!
Searchin for Black Jesus
It's hard, it's hard
We need help out here
So we searchins for Black Jesus
It's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect, you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt
Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we coming from
That's who we pray to
We need help y'all
Against all odds, I'm still here nigga
Aiy, I got to get my props for 2Pacalypse
O.P.D. -- what??!
When this album come out, niggaz can kiss my ass
Did you think I'd fall?
You think you could stop a motherfucker like me?
Introducing you to my criminal crew
Treach, A.D., Apache, Essential
You got to deal with me on a whole new level motherfucker
Above the Law, Lench Mob, the Underground
'Cause I'm gettin' paid
Gets around and we down in this bitch
And the more you try to keep niggaz away from me
The more I unite with mo' niggaz and mo' niggaz and mo' niggaz
Extra special thanks to my nigga Big John Major
And it's a ghetto in every city and a nigga in every ghetto
I owe him, thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of out fathers
Motherfucker we are unstoppable
And uh, I'm not goin' alive!
My family tree, consists of drug dealers thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle screamin' fuck they feelin's
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this
Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know, niggaz gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now rule one, get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, 'cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one, watch for phonies
Keep yo', enemies close nigga, watch yo' homies
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels bein' handed, to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Promise if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nothin' free, give back what you earn, no doubt
Gettin' higher than a motherfucker, bless me please
This thug life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my pops told me, blasphemy
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
We probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowin'
Everybody kissin' ass to go to heaven ain't goin'
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin' devil niggaz daily
Plus the media be crucifyin' brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mama a virgin
We got addicted had to leave the burbs, back in the ghetto
Doin' wild shit, lookin' at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, waitin' for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one, I'm deadly
Babylon beware, comin' for the Pharoahe's kids, retaliation
Makin' legends off the shit we did, still bullshittin'
Niggaz in Jerusalem, waitin' for signs
God's comin', she's just takin' her time, haha
Livin' by the Nile while the water flows
I'm contemplatin' plots wonderin' where the door to go
Brothas getting shot, comin' back resurrected
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
The preacher want me buried why, 'cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead, pass eternal fire
Why you got these kids minds, thinkin' that they evil
While the preacher bein' freaky you say honor God's people
Should we cry, when the Pope died, my request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop
Waitin' to beat my ass if I don't go pop
Memories of a past time, givin' up cash to the leaders
Knowin' damn well, it ain't gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain, times in B.C.
It's hard enough to live now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man, well he should understand
Times in this crime land, my Thug Nation
Do what you gotta do but know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? And my people say
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain

Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us, from evil.
For God, is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever, and ever, and ever.
In today's music news, the ever controversial Tupac Shakur has
Just released another album under the alias Makaveli
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
Street dates, in fear of a wipe out in retail inter chart movement
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row records as well
Nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at Tupac
Excuse me Makaveli's verbal assault
On Mobb Sleep, Notorious B.I.G. and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z of Hawaiian Soapy fame, Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release
The question everybody wants to know is
Why'd they get this nigga started?
Tupac, rather Makaveli was not available for comment
But released this statement
It's not about East or West
It's about niggaz and bitches
Power and money, riders and punks
Which side are you on?
Gun cocked, six shots, bullets hit ground
These niggaz is still fuckin' talkin'?
You nigga still breathin'?
Fuckin' roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid on you
All day
You punk muthafuckas
The shit nigga
Killuminati Style
Makaveli the Don
Solo shit
Bring It
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0 my .45 gun's
Next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes 'cause they breath freely - see me ride?
Located world wide, like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude's shitty
Bolder than a dope-fiend's titty
And every city you'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, nahmean?
I hit the scene, niggas ducking from my guillotine stare
I'm right there - my every word, a fucking nightmare
Get me high; let me see the sun rise and fall
This is for my dogs - down to die for y'all
Extreme venom - no mercy when we all up in 'em
Cut 'em down - to hell is where we send 'em
Murder motherfuckers lyrically, and I'm not gonna cry
Me - a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big Pits, I call 'em Mobb Bitch-Nigga Eaters
And I don't whimper till I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins, so I'm strong
Bye, bye, bye, let's get high and ride
O how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep, nigga when I find you...
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me, yay yay
West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya
Should have never fucked wit' me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest till my road-dog's free
Bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life
And I'm 'a bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life
And I'm 'a bomb first
For so many days and some many ways, we've been ducking strays
They deliver, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nothing to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Deathrow
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli, be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission, set to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes I'll die for the cause
Ya best believe if I leave this bitch I'm dying with choice
Kamikaze sicker than a motherfucking Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made Paparazzi
Tell me if you ain't in this rap game, for the motherfucking cash man
Then what is ya motherfucking purpose, none for service
E.D.I. Mean born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, biatch
Yer style wack as ever, like you was rocking patent leather
Cause a massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't terrel
Half rapper, half drug kingpin, yer telling fairy-tales, son
King of New York like you the motherfucking one
But I'm from Jers we don't play that shit
From the Claire down to North Bricks, all my niggas flippin' chips
Getting rich, even though it's hard
With no warnin' signs 'cause yo my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the nine ready to put in my time
Shoot first, look at their head burst, bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize
And bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize
And bomb first
Who be the last mother fucker breathin
Tell me nigga
Tell Me
Who be the last mother fucker breathin
Stressed
I'm busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last mother fucker breathin
Bustin'
My automatic rounds catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last mother fucker breathin
Woke up with 50 enemies plottin my death
All 50 seeing visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest na nigga I was stressed
Had me creeping round corners
Homies, sleeping in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block
Call the cops, a thug nigga screaming west side busting double glocks
Hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got my driving up on the curb
Hand on the steering wheel swerving
Bless me father I'm a sinner
I'm living in hell, just let me live on these streets
Cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Getting world wide exposure
With a bunch of niggaz that don't give a fuck, riding as my souljahs
I'm just released, I'm on a war path,
Not your average dealer
West side, outlaw, bad boy killer
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin'
I murdered all them bustas
Now I'm the last mother fucker breathin'
Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
For all my souljahs gone, we burnin' the earth
Outlawz world-wide, we pack the block
Shoot rocks at the kidups, bust back for Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here, stale down here
To many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me
Young Noble
Outlaw till these mother fuckers kill me
I'm still breathin'
We was raised, fuck this life
I rose my right
Holding on a tight grip with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm sinner too
Sleepwalking is it true?
Walkin' round town with a pound full of bitter food,
Came a long way from my born day
Dead away, with this war play
Fuck friends, I'll say
Rather die for my AK
With these fag ass niggaz
See through glass ass niggaz
Only ride my dick and scared of my mash ass niggaz
Breathin'
I walk around, with a knife in my back
Talk about a bad day I live a life like that
It's severe
And I'm losing my hair
Bless a hooligan
Catch me, I'm falling out flat
Yo I'm ruining
Breathin in sewer stench
No one give a fuck about me
I learned to like it like that
When I was still in mommy
Beside a seed that the Devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still we breathin'
Totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest, man if one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one mother fucker, bout to do it again
Shit, Pac still doin' it
You hoes can't ruin it
Two million every time we drop
I know you fuckers losing it
We moving in, for the kill
For a mil', holding steel
Hold the wheel
I'm bout to give these niggaz something they can feel
Fakin' real
But we the raw and uncut
Style biting
Thug Line niggaz
Give it Up
We Hit Em Up
And we still real
And we still real
Baby
Brenda's
Baby
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now, Brenda really never knew her moms, and her dad
Was a junky, went in debt into his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought-my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out, and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old, guess she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy
And yet in all, she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of 'em are together,
Whatever, he left her, and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor, and didn't know so
She didn't know what to throw away, and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up, and threw him in a trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heep, ballin'
Mama can't help him, but it hurts to hear him callin'
Brenda wants to run away, Mama say
You making me lose pay, a social worker's here everyday
Now, Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitters, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack, but ended up gettin' robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as her way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby
Baby
Don't you know she's got a baby
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a babe
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a

Bury me a G
Thug Life for life
Thinkin' back
Reminiscing on my teens
A young G
Gettin' paid over dope fiends
Fuckin' off cash that I make
Nigga, what's tha sense of workin hard
If you never get to play
I'm hustlin'
Stayin' out till it's dawn
And commin' home
At 6 o'clock in tha mornin'
Hand's on my glock
Eye's on tha prize
Finger on tha trigga when a nigga ride
Shootin' craps
Bustin' niggas out tha door
Pick my money off tha floor
God bless tha trife folks
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sippin' on Gin
With a couple of friends
Sayin' them thug life niggas be like major pimps
And if I die
Let it be
But when they come for me
Bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G
More Trouble than tha average
Just made 25 and I'm livin' like a savage
Bein a G ain't no easy thing
Cause you could fuck around get crossed
And get stuck in tha game
And for tha rest of your life you will sit and reminicse
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to tha G's you can feel my pain
Till tha mothafucka gets born again
You thought I was a game kid
I'm not tha nigga for playin' games
I let my buckshots rang
When I pull tha trigga on my gauge
I'm on a rampage
Makin' runs for tha devil
Ain't nothin' on my mind
But gettin' in some trouble
I'm tryin' to ride
No more loves
For me hard to figure
Get a nigga for some blunts
I gives a fuck nigga
Stuck outta luck
When I bust
Put me to my death
But I'm a G till the end of me
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G
I got nothin' ta loose so I choose to be a killer
Went from bangin' and slangin'
Now I'm a dope dealer
All my life paid tha price to be tha boss
Back in school
Broke tha rules I'm getten' tossed
Poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time
Pack a 9 all the time
You wanna test mine?
Don't cry
I die before they play me
From tha cradle to tha grave
Bury me
Straight up
Kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
Gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts
A bitch said I'm no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in a dope spot
Never had no time for no bitch
Just slangin' rocks
And bustin' caps on your punk ass marks
Fake ass G's
Bitch niggaz with no heart
I'm stayin' real till I'm 6 feet deep
So when a nigga gone
Bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafuckin riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury Me a G
Stuck on Full
Tangaray got a nigga high
Lord knows I don't need another DUI
I led a Thug Life
Heartless hustler
Just 'cause I fucked
Don't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibratin'
Can't sleep
So I'm mobbin' to tha ho's house
Pumpin' Isely
Is it cool ta fuck is what I'm askin
Bitch recognize game and start laughin'
Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
'Cause I'll fuck and get up and let ya know
I'll be a 10 minute brotha for a $2 ho
Lots a ho's get mad and shit
I let a trick be a trick
You can have that bitch
'Cause I doubt if I change
Tha games a mothafucker
Real niggas turn ta bustas
Bury Me a G

California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean, mean, money-making machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-I-A

Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing hoochies screamin'
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player, where cowards die
And it's all war
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks, not Ballies 
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution; we collide with other crews
Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know The Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-Town
The Bay Area and back down

California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean, mean, money-making machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-I-A

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing hoochies screamin'
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player, where cowards die
And it's all war
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks, not Ballies 
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution; we collide with other crews
Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know The Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-Town
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love
California

Throw it up, y'all, throw it up, throw it up, I can't see you
This song is dedicated
To the mothers and the children of the revolution
From Tupac, to Afeni Shakur
And many many more
This is for you
One love, one life
Can you see... the pride of the panther
As she nurtures... her young all alone
It's the seed... that must grow regardless
Of the fact that, it's been planted in stone
Can you see... the pride of the panther
In the concrete jungle, alone with her cub
It's the seed... that must come to harvest
It's the tree... that must grow out of love
Can you see the pride in the panther
As he glows in splendor and grace?
Topling obstacles placed
In the way of the progression of his race?
Can you see the pride in the panther
As she nurtures her young, all alone?
The seed must grow regardless
Of the fact that it's planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers
As they unify, as one?
The flower blooms with brilliance and
Outshines all the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Carries out like the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Shines bright like a new day begun
Can you see the pride in the panther
As he glows in splendor and grace?
Topling the obstacles placed
In the way of the progression of his race
Can you see the pride in the panther
As she nurtures her young all alone?
The seed must grow, regardless
Of the fact that it's been planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers
As they unify as one?
The flower blooms, with brilliance
And outshines all the rays of the sun
It outshines all the rays of the sun
And keeps high like a new day begun
Shines bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keeps high like a new day begun
Carry out like the rays of the sun
Keep on like a new day begun, say
Shine bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keep high like a new day begun, say
Keep high like a new day begun, say
Shine bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keep high like a new day begun, yes
Keep it high like the new day begin say
Carry out like a new day begun
A new day begun, a new day begun
A new day begun begun begun begun
Begun begun begun... hoo!
Love is the people's power
Let me come swoop you up.
But he ain't gon' if I take you out.
I'll have you back before he even get home;
Before anybody see.
Why you got on glasses?
Ever since I met ya I could beat depression
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't 'bout no suckin and touchin, just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations -- would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
But anticipation of love makin'
Got you shakin when I'm standin near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate -- but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon... let's go... can you get away?
Can you get away?
... Can you get away?
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin' for these hoochies that be on me 'cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
'Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
When he ain't lookin', now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?
I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
'Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
Stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- 'cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?
All I really know, can you get away?
You could get away
You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
I ain't tryin' to put you in a position
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
You need but now... he ain't even takin' care of you
He beatin' on you and shit; look how you look
She motherfuckin wanna be with that nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
YaknowhatI'msayin? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin' to Hawaii, seein the world
Seein what this world got to offer you
Not goin' to, yaknowhatI'msayin?
The emergency room, gettin' stitches
Cause this nigga done got jealous
Don't cry, it's all good
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeah
The blind stares
Of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see
The P
Give me my money in stacks
And lace my bitches with 9 figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel plated 9 triggas
Must see my enemies defeated
I'm cashin'
While they coughed up and weeded
Open fire
Now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh
And test
And get your chest blown
Straight out tha west, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like ho's
Open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe?
Nigga you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money
But baby I got to gets mo'
You scream and go
'2Pac'
And I ain't stopin'
Till I'm well paid
Bails paid
Now nigga, look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens
Niggas open fire
Buncha Thug Life niggas on tha rise
Until I die
Ask me why I'm a Boss Playa gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by
Niggas Can't C Me
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't C Me...
Been getten worried that
These square muthafuckers with nerves
Sayin' they can get with us
But picture me gettin' served
My own mama say I'm thuged out
My shit be bumpin out tha record store
As if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what?
It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was
A young nigga with heart
Ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools
You know the rules
D-R-E you got me heated
My words like a penatentary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed
Alazay and Hennesse
To my Thug niggas in lock down
Witness me
Bail on these ho's in floss mode
Tha life of a Boss Playa
Fuck what ya thought tho'
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch
When my album hit tha streetz
Niggas Can't C Me
Niggas Can't C Me
Which way did he go George

You niggas made a mistake
You shoulda never put my rhymes with Dre
Them Thug niggas have arrived and it's Judgement Day
Hey Homie if ya feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me

Look to the star

Cross this nigga here, now Biggie, tell me who do you fear?
Ain't a livin' soul breathin' shall pump no fear here
My last four flashed then I mashed his ass
Bastard, fuck with me, bet I blast your ass
So many follow but can't reach me, caught in a maze
Catch 'em mimickin' my style, tryin' to walk this way
Impossible, my posse droppin' you, we Death Row riders
No need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us
Feeling blessed, the richer I get the more I stress
Smokin' lye watchin' time fly, waitin' for death
Dear God, I been feelin' like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me
Watchin' niggas catch strays, shake, choke an' bleed me
A mercenary for the streets, check my pedigree
Bustin' motherfuckers, it's the thug in me
Now niggas talk a lotta bad boy shit
Then get to squealin'
Bitch made catchin' feelin'
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screamin', Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound

But that ain't me, dog, my mind's now clear
An' that ain't fair, dog, your heart pump fear
In the state I guess
You better hide nigga truth is near
An' you know just as well I do
You ain't no killer, so kill that you wouldn't kill if you had to
We might wobble but we don't fall down
We take the gospel from Makaveli, pass it around
Ah, shit, we gonna taste the power
We started the thug trend, the game is ours
Now we coast together, put our thoughts together
Won't question will we die together
'Cause the hour is soon to come
Kadafi trained soldier, I show you how to use your gun, bring it
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down

Screamin', Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Ride or die niggas, an' we huntin' you down
Representin' all the real niggas stuck in the trap
Bangin' out with the po' po', tryin' to get to some mo'
Street life, young strugglers racin' the clock
Ain't no tellin' when it all can end, roll or rock
Ain't no world with feelings, this a man's world, youngin'
But the bitches' in business, so learn a lil' somethin'
And stop runnin' your mouth, you're on the verge of squealin'
Bitch made catchin' feelings, nigga

Screamin', Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catchin' feelins uh
Everybody's a gangsta but don't put in work
Instead of puttin' on the armor, niggas put on skirts
These drugs ain't helpin', it only makin' it worse
An' the streets ain't got nothin' for me but herbs
I can't trust the church or the mobs
I can only trust God an' to tell you the truth
I gotta ride, I only roll with the real
'Cause rollin' with the fake got my loved ones killed
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?

Catchin' feelins
Shit, I'm a changed man
Hey turn the lights up
Still ballin', 2Pac up in this bitch
You know how we swing this shit
By age 16 I sold to dope fiends
Not a drug dealer but I watched them closely
Until they noticed me
I got the feds wondering who broke the law
Fuck too inhibited for gun smoke I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fucking diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggas trippin' homie, when we riding?
Fuck 'em slowly like Jodeci
I'd stick a needle in my eye
If I don't live and die for M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one
Last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys
Ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches
Who do you fear?
The game plan of a changed man
So what I'm saying is ...
I changed gears but I'm still the same old ridah
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it up
All my real thug niggas go and get your hands up now, your gonna flip your hands up
Changed man, you dealing with a changed man
In drop top
Glock cocked
Got rocks in ma socks
Cops spot Watt niggas
But hard to stop niggas
Not if the gat niggas
Doughboys and hot niggas
Who might have shot niggas
But only by strolling
Out for respect
Now days they expect me to be in a Ferrari or the old Lexus
But anything you see flashin past and can't tell
That's me
Gauge on the Escalade back seat
Don't creep
But what you think
T.I. be in them suites?
But don't sleep
Get you hit from your head to feet
Hey you don't know me
I'm fittin' to introduce you to the old me
You walk in, explode it and leave reload
You don't like a record nigga - buck you, blow
But you will respect me
Or get it in your neck piece chief
No grief nigga still gonna let me be
Or get your insides exposed to the streets, nigga
I changed plans but I'm still the same old ridah
Slanging new dope to the world but the people still buy it up
All my real thug niggas go and get your hands up now, your gonna flip your hands up
Changed man, you dealing with a changed man
A niggas so cold when I flow
Bow down to death row
Three wheel motion
Coming through coasting
Who's that nigga in the g-ride
Screaming out m.o.b
Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick up kid
Number one in the nation
I fucked the world
The judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weights
Slanging to the whole nation
Give me mine or I'm blastin';
On every song
Murder my enemies
I'm mashing until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggas
And fuck a bitch cause a truce is to love niggas
Throw your hands in the air close your eyes and hope
You ever come against a mass of smoke
On Death Row
My adversaries bleed
But fuck 'em all till the talk cease
Fucking with a changed man
I changed plans but I'm still the same old ridah
Slanging new dope to the world but the people still buy it up
All my real thug niggas go and get your hands up now, your gonna flip your hands up
Changed man, you dealing with a changed man
Haha, everybody think they understand a nigga
Shit you niggas don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap songs
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3d
Westside
I ain't the same, you fucking with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fucking with a changed man
We ain't the same, fucking with a changed man
Changed man ...
Come on, come on
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship them dope and let them deal the brothers
Give them guns, step back, watch them kill each other
It's time to fight back, that's what 
 said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start making changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Oh, yeah
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
'Cause both black and white is smoking crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you staying in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
Being real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
I made a G today, But you made it in a sleazy way
Selling crack to the kids, I gotta get paid,
Well hey, that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Oh, yeah
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you
Don't let them jack you up, back you up,
Crack you up and pimp smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry about the paybacks
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Coming back after all these years
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
That's the way it is, uh
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Oh, yeah
You're my brother, you're my sister
Things will never be the same
You're my brother, you're my sister
That's the way it is
Oh, yeah
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Call Suge, call all the niggaz tell 'em to meet me downstairs
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggaz drivin' or y'all flyin back, whassup?
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
Aw nigga, damn
Now I'm up early in the mornin breath stinkin as I'm yawnin
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alize and Hennessee
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, till you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy trying to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time
Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shoe, 'cause we out this motherfucker
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true, with Janet on, I'm in a Escapade
But did it all end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room, so I assume
Since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's Trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak into your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
Cause there's someone else who deserves my atttention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause busting bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time
Aiyyo man 'Pac ay where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin'
The only one not to leave
Yo man it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
You seem them bitches?
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece! Yo nigga whassup?
Hey I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin but I'm checkin' out later
My behaviour is crazy, from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin your thoughts, 'cause I'm livin' Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashin the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream, and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight, for 'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time
Ay, it's check out time
Ay 'Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin, where my shoes go nigga?
Where my motherfuckin drawers and shit at man?
Man y'all niggaz was in here partyin too fuckin' much
What the fuck y'all doin' nigga?
Kurupt, go tell Daz man and Bogart and the rest of them niggaz
C'mon man, niggaz is trippin' man
Front desk all callin me tellin' me to get the hell outta here man
I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred
From tha Cradle to the Grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto. Ooh
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
June 16,1971
Mama gave birth
To a hell raisin' heavanly son.
See the doctor tried to smack me
But I smacked him back,
My first words were thug for life
And Papa pass the Mak.
I'm bustin' on these motha fuckas ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini 14 callin'.
From out the window of my drop top
I got my glock cocked
Bustin' at niggas
When will it stop?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
But even with this thug livin'
Will I escape prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance
And if you slang
Then you'd better have your nikes on
'Cause when we fight
It's in the middle of the night with no lights on.
Hey!
There must be a God 'cause I feel lucky,
Paranoid out my mind...
This muthafucka's tryin' to rush me.
Am I goin' to jail?
Look at me bailin'
Commin' out the court house
All about the male man
Never, never die
Be a hustlah mothafuckas
And makin' thugs out you suckas.
From the cradle to the grave.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't nevah been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cardle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave
Since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild.
Pop pop!
Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark with less spark.
Surveillance on a nigga every day,
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away.
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet.
So now a young nigga bein' raised by the streets.
And then the on other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
A straight thug.
Just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gatts
One black and one of chrome.
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got
So stop and walk a thin line.
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave,
From the cradle to the grave.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say
I made it this far.
Many G's died hard
And all they got was their name here up on a wall.
It's sad thinkin' about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land...
As the warzone I got no home
Don't have no friends neither.
It's just me by my lonely so I married my nina.
I keeps her wherever I go,
I love my hoe.
Never leave home without my sugar.
I'm hafta plug a nigga.
Mama told me not to trust no punks,
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me.
Since then I been known.
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
'Cause I stay shootin' at marks,
Get twisted up in police reports.
Since the cradle, I've been ungreatful.
My first toy was a gun
I got sprung and learn to love weapons.
But now I'm through with money
And through with street fame.
Somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
March 18th
A rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth.
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb.
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum.
I tried to cope loc
But my family's broke
And my pocket's short
So now I gotta sling dope.
In a game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame,
The white man got a motha fucka slingin' cane.
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I get my serve on.
Always in the spot with my glock slingin' rocks at the rocks.
This shit don't stop I'm steady dodgin' cops.
I never flip flop
Hear my glock cock
Thug till I drop.
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk reminiscing about the good times.
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doing dirt,
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
Time's movin' fast
Will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A.K.
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did
Wishin' someone help me
But they never did.
I can't take it
Will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage.
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way my Daddy raised me
Crazy.
Do or die. Nigga pull the triggah don't give a fuck.
You'd rather be in jail than get your ass bucked.
Nobody cares, it's me against the world.
Keepin' murdah on my mind and my tech-9.
I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high
Then my mission is a walk-by.
You better jet when I hit your set 'cause I'm commin'.
Start runnin' yellin' evil mind as I'm gunnin'.
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside,
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died.
The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave.
Chorus till fade
A smokin' ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a TEC-9 now his smokin' ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin' now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin' quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said, Freeze!
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk... please...
Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin like a bitch, cause you don't know how to... hush...
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me... body...
One to the chest, another to his fuckin' dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggaz
Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick steppin to the niggaz with the props
And any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin weight the shit is real smooth
A nigga's tryin' to play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin' on ten keys, I'ma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac, got the fuckin' Glock cocked, and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
Welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get-a-WAY!
Niggaz got PAID!
And yet another sleepin' ass nigga got slayed, word up
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch...
Crooked ass niggaz
Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rollin' with my crew, watch what crooked niggaz, do!
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin' mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke till I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit 'em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggaz knew, I'm a crooked nigga too
Crooked ass niggaz come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbin's what they specialize in
They'll try to getcha, they'll sweatcha to get in the picture
And then they hitcha, son of a bitch! Now he's richer
Crooked ass nigga...
Criminal, criminal, crim
Crim-criminal behaviour
Criminal behaviour, criminal behaviour...
Criminal, criminal, crim
Crim-criminal behaviour
Criminal beha... crima-crima-crima
Crim-crim, criminal behaviour
Criminal behaviour...
Yeah nigga
Yo, I heard you got beat up by the police
Niggaz just wanna know if your still gonna be on some crooked ass nigga shit
Please tell me what's a nigga to do and it's true
Ain't nuttin' new so I do what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK47 layin on my hips so don't trip
One motherfucker from the underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggaz if they fuck around
Yo, why y'all got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch them motherfuckers gotta beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin the finger at police instead of motherfuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when them punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
You can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too
You know you really can't say that you blame niggaz
Fuck bein' tame, set a flame, tryin' to aim triggaz
2pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
So save two, run for cover
And other bitches from the clan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
Genuine draft ganja ganja and my fuckin' Tec-9
Cobra - And niggaz will take the world over
I'll be a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

Pardon me, ?? has been God and try me
I'll be damned if I die come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
Now it's the rebel and the devil and one of us is goin' to hell
I got the whole place covered with loc'ed out brothers
And nothing but love for eachother
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop
See it's cool to shoot a nigga but they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on deathrow
But I learned to look ahead of me
Stay strapped, watch your back, keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and ooh you can't fuck with the crew
A crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

Y'all gon' stop fuckin' with me
You are appreciated
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary
Hey, I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it? 
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to ya
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin home after work, late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
You're just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough, you're alone
Tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are fulla all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be all right if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

He's just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' AK all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't,
You don't do a goddamn thing
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the corner, any day
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self,
But I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner,
The pressure's getting to me
I no longer trust my homies,
Them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
Got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest,
Under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived,
Straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
That was buggin'
My homie told me once,
Don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
But they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
Who done passed away screamin', please
Young nigga, make Gs
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless,
I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner
I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor till you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin' on them niggas till they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
'Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
Them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you till you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin' high was a way of gettin' free
I see death around the corner
This is for all the real mothafuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
We all gotta go, ya know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there,
All right
I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead
I want him dead, I don't care
He's just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' AK all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't,
You don't do a goddamn thing
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the corner, any day
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self,
But I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner,
The pressure's getting to me
I no longer trust my homies,
Them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
Got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest,
Under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived,
Straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
That was buggin'
My homie told me once,
Don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
But they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
Who done passed away screamin', please
Young nigga, make Gs
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless,
I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner
I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor till you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin' on them niggas till they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
'Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
Them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you till you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin' high was a way of gettin' free
I see death around the corner
This is for all the real mothafuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
We all gotta go, ya know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there,
All right
I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead
I want him dead, I don't care
Nobody's, closing me out of my business
I played the cards I was given, thank God I'm still livin'
Pack my nine till it's time to go to prison
As I'm bailin down the block that I come from, still gotta pack a gun
Case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
I guess I live life forever jugglin
But I'll be hustlin till the early mornin 'cause I'm strugglin
Like drinkin' liquor make the money come quicker
Gettin' pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
I ain't in love with her, I just wanna be the one to hit her
Drop off and let the next nigga get her
That's the way it goes, it's time to shake a hoe, make the dough
Break a hoe when it's time to make some mo'
I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock
And spittin' game through my mobile phone
The type of shit to get them hoes to bone
My Definition of a Thug Nigga
Tis the season, to be servin' What you doin'?
Mob-mobbin like a motherfucker
Tis the season, to be servin'
Well I roll with a crew of zoo niggaz
They're quick to pulle a nine when it's time do niggaz
Comin' through like I'm two niggaz, a true nigga fuck a Zig Zag
Roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga
I'm drivin' drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy
Lookin' for a new face to skeeze me
Everybody's lookin' for a nut but I'm searchin for the big bucks
Give a fuck, rather die than be stuck
In a one-room shack, and, kickin back
So how's that from the mind of a Thug Nigga
Bought a fo'-five 'cause I heard that the slug's bigger
Figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself
Gettin' swept off his feet by the pump
I put that on my moms, word to the motherfuckin trigger
Before I go broke I'll be a drug dealer, a Thug Nigga
Short than a motherfucker snatched up by one-time
Make a phone call and be back to ball by lunchtime
So here we go, we in the inner city
I keep my hand on my gat and stay cool, my attitude is shitty
Niggaz don't like me 'cause I'm makin' ends
Roll in a Benz and I blaze a blunt, 'cause I'm all in
And any nigga trying to take what I got'll
So here we go, I can't be faded
Happy in the motherfucker, finally made it
Got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
And I ain't takin' shit from no niggaz
I'm just tryin' to make some money right
Put some motherfuckin food in my tummy right
I'm feelin' good like I'm supposed to, ready to ball
Find a spot and we can serve 'em all
My Definition of a Thug Nigga
Tis the season, to be servin'
Mobbin like a motherfucker, every single day
Tis the season, to be servin'
Nobody's, closing me out of my business
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the staaaaaart
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, don't wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
... That's right, sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do?
So now I'm back
To makin' promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin' low, losin control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucka for love
... Damn, sucka for love... sucka for love
... Sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Now he left you with scars
Tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost
Trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry 'bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision 'cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
... Sucka for love
Know you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
... I'ma sucka for love, sucka for love
... Sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Just 'cause a nigga come in he got style
Don't think I won't flip it
Don't pull your file
But I got enough bullshit to deal with
I'm rollin' with the thugs so
You must be on drugs to the head
Get your ass break down
Broken half baby
I'm a feelin' like a motherfuckin psychopathic
And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer
I'm no joke
Mopreme straight loc
And you could get smoked
You hook the shit you get stroked
And all of that
And later be back for your motherfuckin dope sack
Kid it ain't the type of day to play doughnut
Don't get your ass sewn up
Why you leakin on my blown out
Hey, you're mixed up like a bowl of nuts
You fuck around and got it twisted up
Boy, don't get it twisted
It's the Macadoshis coming from the dark side
The park side where the O.G.s do ride
Ain't nothing but killers in the park
As many niggas lost they's heart
When my gat sparks
I'll bust a cap in that ass
Don't get it twisted
When I'm on a mission, niggas come with Mishy
You busters gettin' disciplined
And you're comin' up short on your life
When I smoke you with this mac-10
When it's on it's on
Fuck it
I'm makin' niggas kick the bucket when I check em' by inducis
Ain't no think to let my shit spin
You on my shit list hope you got a death wish
I tried to warn you but you missed me
Don't get it twisted!
Niggas got problems about gettin' shit twisted
They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin their big clips
But don't front no shit that brought no shit that peace started
'Cause I'm a cold hearted rider straight dunkin'
Never through with my streets
Never hurt nobody but my heat
East side brothers don't hear me though
They'd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas when I caught 'em
Couldn't bust a drape if they wanted
They're soft like Charmin
But I don't sweat varmits
I suffer with my black group
Just a one-day murderer
On the motherfuckin Rudy Poop
I snapped his soul, son
Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy can't save you now
Cause you got the job twisted up
For fuckin' with a killer
Shit
When I enter the first zone worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy manifestin' military styles
Casually try da G when niggas battle me
My prophesied prediction, switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch and watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin' still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin', hell or prison
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world, me and the mob gettin' married
It seems all the fine screams pierce the dark
This is expected, a trick bitch where's your heart?
You mark, watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til it's none left, don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time
Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random
Rapidly wit' accuracy, they shouldn't've talk bad to me
It had to be a motherfuckin' murder
I'm glad to be a nigga that did the murder
So sad to see another motherfucker floatin'
In plastic reef, sleep wit' his head wide open
Rapid release, keep the police coastin'
Casualties warrant in deep east Oakland
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt, drove off to the hills
Positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the lex ruger, death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullet fly, kill and execute 'em
I blast first 'til they body me like my guns in varieties
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hand on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples nigga nothin' simple 'bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin', dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out ain't no easy way outs or easy exits, don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time
When I hit the street all I can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tear when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose then no crew standin' but mine
I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
Whateva you do shawty you betta think wisely
You might see me wit' a stack in the trap
I use my thoughts and pen similar to a saran wrap
A lil' lame nigga I'll neva be, yeah, I'ma keep it G
I'm from the Three and Scrap will neva sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep
Don't sleep
Don't sleep
Yeah...
All up in this bitch
Don't stop...
Don't stop...
Keep it goin', got my nigga Slip Capone
Hahahaha, hell yeah, lot of fakers is out there
Niggaz get around these backwoods
Get around they mommas, pull up they pants
Hide they rags and start to act good, hahahahaha!
Killin' willingly, who got the right to make a sound?
My sound break block, corners, avenues and drives
It's about time the mashin is arrived
I take you on a mission, be on a mission, I'm packin steel
I spend major loot on khaki suits
Nikes and kroker-saks to sweat suits, and leather boots
I box niggaz twice my size, I bust wit a fo'-five
Lick you up in yo' eye, blast, make the party live
I live the unusual, crucial life
So pay attention when I come through for you and your crew
As just a man and his music, I ain't afraid to use it
Bruise you badly, you want confusion, I mean it's useless
To step to this, we in effect, we dangerous
Contendin mental murderers and ain't afraid to diss
I give a fuck, what you thought, or who you brought witchu?
Better laugh now, then cry when I come to get you
I hit you with two glocks, and leave you with scar tissue
Let's go for dolo BIATCH, and watch me flow yo' shit
Mr., Makaveli movin pieces like telekenesis
Shots rang and niggaz brains were spilt
I hit the funeral and busted his folks
And leave the scene like a shadow in a blaze of smoke
Don't stop, keep goin'
Hardcore hooligan, verbal assault chopper
Lethal with mics like guns, bats and knives
Those who oppose are my foes, all stand in rows
Deadliest MC across the globe, Kurupt Capone
Too much pressure makes ya fold, so lo' and behold
Why you waitin for the poetical Satan?
Creatin' slaughters, runnin' through camps like Walter Payton
Who goes against the program, I'm the Man like Meth
The second I get a chance I'ma bust ya
No matter where, you could be in Russia I'ma touch ya
Shoot for the loot, brownies and black mags
Don't stop, don't stop
...
For everybody out there that got the humps in they Jeep
Big Suburbans, they Lexuses, they Beemers
We gon' break it down a lil' somethin' like this
For you to get yo' sub on throughout yo' neighborhood
Turn it up, check it out
Number one...
I ain't got time for this man I'm out
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?
Callin' up my house to hang it up You think that makes sense
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
Let's make it an even break don't make it scandalous
Try to be mature I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're saying I'm too busy I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but your lyin'
Fighting back the urge to start cryin'
I wipe away your tears come and hug me
I love you like you love me
Girl... don't you trust me?
I can't bare to hear you yellin' at me
Maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional you milk me
Comin' over crying just to get me feelin' guilty
You and me were met to be it yet
Just let me pack my things and I'll be outie
This time I'm breaking out you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
I get no room to sleep I hope it ceases 'cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
When I can give you more when you unsure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya
And I hope that you understand why I bust it
But girl don't you trust me?
Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
Not that I don't trust you
Who you are,

Young nation, no revolution and no cause,
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
Young nation just trying to get this
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get,
Out the window on some uptown anthem shit,
I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure, I been here before,
Fugitive taskforce at my girlfriends' door,
Now they checkin' in her bedroom, I ain't there,
Forty Cals, extended clips, still I ain't scared,
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive,
I'm different and I'mma prove it if it take me to die,
You think God had a plan for me?
But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me,
Maybe I'm brazen or paranoid than a bitch,
Me dyin', you think I'd let him see the joy from that shit?
Walking dead, angels spend their last days by me,
New Jersey Giant like Dave Tyree,
Young George or Jonathan Chat,
Your guns clap,
Mine will go 'br-r-r-r-att',
Soldier like Geronimo Pratt,
And come through cockin' tha black pound,
When they put the twin towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' 'em back down,
Poster child,
Air Force Ones, with the checks,

Money and murder is all I breathe in my life,

One Nation under a thug and bullet scar,
Young nation, no revolution and no cause,
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
Young nation just trying to get this
I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac,
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box,
You end up in the box 'cause them grave robbin' bastards,
Dig your grave up and snatched you out the casket,
Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage,
The flesh to the bones,
The bones to the ashes,
But I'm not dead,
I'm actually in a session with the Pac Keeper, Sha Money, progressing,
They don't really want no drama, I know they goons,
That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound,
This God given, he keep givin' me better music,
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement,
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin',
Songs of evolution,
If I load your gun for you and we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it,
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever, stupid,
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless,
You got the same bullets you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it,
The Nasareema dream, get ready for execution,
Papoose, Fatal and Pac
The revolution

One Nation under a thug and bullet scar,
Young nation, no revolution and no cause,
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,

But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin what you thinkin' but you musta been the ship
Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin the reverand from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't bout talkin' bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin' back, for everything you owe
I'm comin' collectin the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
How do I plead?
Yes sir, how do you plead?
Shit, you know how I plead
C'mon!
Psssh
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin' for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin' bout, Where is the quaaludes? What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed Nigga motherfucker
Dropped me to my knees I proceed to bleed
Sufferin a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin?
I grab his gat and bust in self - defense, my only option, God damn
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, reposessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self - defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin this in federal prison, givin' everything I owe
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery,
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery.
Picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushing permanent twisting I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screaming when I did
Steady yelling out spots for me to hit, and aww shit
Soon as I seen her saw us playing hide the Weiner
Wanna Freak Like Me, fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holler out my name when a thug nigga ride, can I come inside
Say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this
Penitentiary dick, the trot caught your eye
When I walked by, I said, Hi
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me going first, and that ain't no 'Fair Xchange'
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery,
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery,
Open your legs got me watching like it's a million
You tremble from the feelin' look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceiling
And if you willing, then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I bet you I can make you cum sixty-one times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
'Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? 'I Get Around', and I'm haunted by my temptations
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around acting like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doing me no favours, 'Fair Xchange'
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm getting pussy, but baby you getting dick!
And since you being laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of faking like you can't hear the bed shaking
In bed naked you so twisted think yoour legs breaking
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumping on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait till you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you acting like you did something, giving me a piece
I had you muffling your screams in the sheets, fucking with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustling bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another 'Fair Xchange'
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery

Only one thing that you can do for me
Baby you can treat me right
We can do it all night
Nothing more than a fair exchange
Don't stop
And make me scream your name
You can do what ever you want
Got what I want, and gone
Nothing more than a fair exchange
Open your legs got me watching like it's a million
You tremble from the feelin' look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceiling

Nigga done stick and wet his dick
And then get tricked out all his riches by a -- BITCH!

Think you alla that just 'cause she let a nigga toss her
It's like a motherfuckin priveledge

When she call ya, ask that little tramp whassup
And if she hesitates nigga hang up, worrrd up
And let that bitch meditate to the dial tone
And call me when you're ready to bone, and it's on
A motherfucking mack tonight
Stay that stay strapped cause my raps is tight
You fuckin' punks, I hate you snitches
Went against the grain and the game to be fake ass bitches
And expect them to accept it; girl your heard me it gets skanless.
I can't stand fake ass bitches
Lyin' ass niggaz and you punk ass snitches
Time to show these bustas who's boss
Run up on a real motherfucker and get tossed
The game is deep, and thicker than a motherfuckin jimmy
Broke hoes runnin' round yellin' Gimme!
I can't stand it, hoes talkin' bout they got a man
Shit all I wanted her to do is suck my DICK
So how about hittin a motherfucker on my pager
Busy now bitch but you can give me the pussy later
Fly how I fade her, played her like a game of Sega
Fuckin' with the player that made her, huh
And I ain't sleepin' caught you creepin' for my money
So get the bozack, knockin' hoes back, keep my dough stacked
So where the motherfuckin hoes at?
Punk niggaz can't fade the mack, livin' fat
Gettin' paid to rap, it's like that, you motherfuckin bitches
Yeah, yeah that's my motto
She educated a whole bunch of you old raggedy-ass niggaz
So y'all take that shit back to y'all camp and uh
You sleep on that there, it's like
Oh you too nigga, don't think we ain't talkin' bout your punk ass
You old fake ass nigga
Standin there wearin all them Pendletons and khakis and all that
You soft as a motherfuckin grape

Some of these niggaz is bitches too, man I tell ya
It's gonna be harder and harder to be a Thug in ninety-fo'
But we gonna do this shit
Y'all take this shit and you play this shit for every single
Fake ass bitch out there
And there's plenty of em
You probably got one sittin' next to you right now
Bobbin his fake ass head to this, dope ass shit that he listenin to
Fake ass motherfuckin bitch, die in ninety-four
And my niggas say
We want the FAAAAME
C'mon c'mon
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
It's been nothing but pain stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to g's
Stresses after battle with success comes greed
They got me hot When they shot me plotted my revenge
To increase my ends enemies getting dropped
Win or lose red or blue we must all stay true
Play the game nigga never let the game play you
And for the fame niggas change fast that's a shame
What's the game lost souls who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? the world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane I'm hoping we can change with time
I'm living blinded searching for refinement
Curse, I know death follows me but I murder him first
And worse yet with each breathe steps I take
Breathless ss there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes coaster crystal glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards with a ski mask
I'm the first one to warn them blast it
Ain't nothing left now treated like a stepchild
Be rocking beats fake in fame
Block run and shoot slugs
We throw them back like hardballs
Without the gloves
No love for these fake desperados
And thugs I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts
Sipping Henney
Drunk nights and hot days
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways
A wife on the run full of common blunts
Unconditionally married to my gun
Fulfillin' my destiny on knees
And ones desires be pulling all my cabbage like priors
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher
Fortune and fame
Searching for fortune and fame lost in the rain
A lose of the game with life the cost of the game
We forcing the change mother fuck flossing the chain
All the blame belongs to the part of the brain
That we never use nigga plus my heart is in pain
And if I ever lose homey bet I'm at it again
Outlaws don't die so united we stand
And if family come before all the fortune and fame
As I walk up in the crib laid to rest me head
Say some rhymes to angels hope they bless my bed
Hope they bless me the righteous way
Got a homie locked down outta town I sent him a kite today
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog
I was passed down the street fame like glocks clocked and keep aim
Was raised up with a clock box and I ran with the local street gang
They say the light is faded but still shine in the dark
You can easy been a man but you is a boy in your heart
And that's some game that I got from generation of game
In the road of life dog we need to switch up lanes
Think about it
I can't complain I've seen my fair share of the fame
It wont change me now I've got this piece of change
I feel strange I got so used to the hood
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me
Ghetto ain't made me I made myself
Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help
I pray for my health my mind and my family too
State of myself my grind and my family crew
Where one hand watches the other no we ain't blood
But we still real brothers the struggle is real
Nothing can steal what we build and that remains the same
Till that day we killed and that's real
Life that I was aimed to be love by my family tree
That's fame to me, how about it
Because we all spring from different trees
Does not mean we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
Or in the vast forest in which it breathes?
I find greatness in the tree, that grows against all odds
It blossoms in darkness, and gives birth to promising pods
I was that tree that grew from the weeds and wasn't meant to be
Ashamed I'm not, in fact I am proud, of my thriving, family, tree
The rose that grew from concrete, yeah
The tree that wasn't meant to be
Though I, struggle in my life, I never give up
And you, know that I, will always be by your side
My family tree, yeah a family tree
Yeah, my family tree, my family tree
I find, greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
It blossoms in, darkness, and gives birth to a promising pod
You'll never see me give up
I will press on, never hold my head alone
Never no, my family tree, my family tree yeah
My family tree, family tree
Because we all spring from different trees
Does not mean we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
Or in the vast forest in which it breathes?
The tree must fight to breathe
Among the evils of the weeds
I find greatness in the tree, that grows against all odds
Ashamed I'm not, in fact I am proud, of my thriving, family, tree
Ha ha ha... fuck all y'all... fuck all y'all... I don't need nobody
Fuck 'em... Fuck all y'all
Money gone fuck friends
I need a homie that know me
When all these muthafuckin' cops be on me
I got problems ain't nobody calling back
Now what the fuck is happenin' with my ballin' cats
Remember me I'm ya homie that was down to brawl
Sippin' Hennessy hanging with the clowns and
All we used to do is drink brew, screw and common knew
We had bitches by the dozens oh we fuckin' cousins
You can throw ya middle finger if ya feel me loc
A nigga just got paid and we still was broke
It took time but finally the cash was mine
All the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind
Look around and all I see is snakes and faces
Like scavengers waitin' to take a hustler's pape's
And when you stuck where the fuck is all ya friends
They straight busted and can't be trusted fuck y'all
Fuck all y'all 2x
I'm sippin' Tanqueray and juice and what's the use
'Cause I'm a hopeless thug
Ain't no love reminiscing on how close we was
Way back in the day before they put the crack in the way
And heey how much money can you stack in a day
It's gettin' rough collect calls from my niggas in court
I recollect we used to ball now just living's enough
I stand tall in the winter summer spring or fall
Thug for life scrawled all across the wall
And all about my dollars make me wanna holla
Drop an album sell a million give a fuck about tomorrow
I know it's gettin' crazy after dark
These marks keep on huffin' and puffin'
Ain't no fear in my heart
What's going on in the ghetto still struggle and strive
I still roll with the heater smokin' chocolate thai
In 94 I'll be going solo
Too many problems with my own
So I'm rolling do-do
Fuck all y'all
I went from rags to riches quick
To socializing with the baddest bitches
Went from a bucket to a rag with switches
I'm seein' death around the corner
I'm bumpin' Gloriaaaa doin' 90 'cause I wanna
I'm getting high like I said it with some chocolate thai
Mixed with some indonesia watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
Will I get caught another ticket get to kick it in court
Fuck the law give a shit I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
But I ain't worried still throwing these thangs
Got me locked in these chains
And hey nigga what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout
Soon as I hit the cell I'll be bailin' out
And when I hit the streets I'm in a rush to ball
I'm screaming Thug Life nigga fuck y'all
Repeat of intro
You a what? Bad Boy Killaz
Hahaha yeah nigga, fuck em' all
Fuck all you muthafuckers
Ay Yo Biggie Put your hands up
Now I can make it happen
My rappin' is similar to muthafuckers
When they scrappin'
Blast and watch em' back up
Notorious biggie killer
Affiliation with death row
Niggaz get their caps pealed back
Fool this the west coast
Fuck a misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks
That thought I quit
Then got a drop top jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack
I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggaz to trip
Cause bitch I love to scrap
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga
With love niggaz
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines
Writing raps and movies
I went from trustin
Oh, who hoo hoo
Live from the crazy house
You heard that shit nigga
Live from the crazy house
Yo that nigga be crazy as hell
My ghetto love song
Lets be friends
Approach you and posed a minute
All on my double R tinted
As you pass bye
Winkin' my eye
Freshly scented
What's the haps baby, look
Get with me and perhaps lady
You can help me multiply my stacks baby
Currency seems small I need companionship
Do with that scandalous shit
I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitating, actin' like your shit don't stink
Check out my diamonds
Bitch everyone gon' blink
This be a thug thing, outlaw
Nigga with riches cream dreamin' mutha fucka
On a mash for bitches
Check my resume, sippin' on crystal and alizee
Smoking on big weed, key'd the Cali way
Don't like trickin' but I'll buy you a fit
I can't stand no sneaker wearing, nappy haired bitch
Let my pedigree read briefly
Their so cheap
Puttin' bitch made bustas to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so called car
Who the man while I'm thuggin' on your main bitch hand
Understand this, ain't no nigga like me
Fuck Jay-Z
He broke and I smoke dearly

While you trickin' on them other hoes

I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded
But at last, it was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass, got me checking for you hardcore
Staring and watching
Me and you
One on one, picture countless options
Was it prophecy, clear as day?
Visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, would possess my body
Far from a crush
I wanna bust your guts
And touch everything inside you, from my head to my nuts
You got my sweatin' like a fat girl going for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess
Money and fame made ya used to me
What's up in 96?
Lying tricks in drag
Fuck Dre
Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
Back to you
My pretty ass, caramal queen

Was it me or the fame?
My dick or the game?
Bet I screamed west side when I came
Scream my name
Cause baby it's delicious
Got a weak spot for pretty bitches
Up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby let your back dip into it
Make it fluent
In and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high, let me come inside
Love it when you get on top, baby let me ride
Who wanna stop me?
In my top notch
Fucking player hating niggaz 'cause they cock block
You probably hate to see a real thug envisioned with the game
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good, in this world of g's
Baby got me fantasizing of seeing you naked
It's a fuck song, so check my record

Haha, what you say?
Who you callin rapist? Ain't that a bitch
You devils, are so two faceted
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
And gettin' stalked by these crooked cops a-gain
Fuckin' with the young black male, tryin' to stack bail
And umm, stay away from the packed jails
I told the judge I'm in danger
And that's why I had that fo'-five with one in the chamber
Fuck the world!
I woke up screamin, Fuck the world!
Just woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Uh, I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Just got up and screamed, Fuck the world!
When I was comin' up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin', threats to me, comin' from my enemies
And, in they dreams it's, Hell where they sendin me
Have I, lost control or just another soul
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Never take yo' eyes off the prize, and even if you gettin' high
Don't ever hesitate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin, niggaz we all in
Fuck the world!
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Just woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
I got up and screamed, Fuck the world!
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Man, fuck the world...
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
'Cause I'm sittin' here sippin on Guinness
Weighin 165, and these tricks should die
For bein jealous of a brother when he rides
I can see it in yo' eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin'
They hate to see a nigga ballin
Some of you suckers is rottin, plottin on what I got
Stop givin' game for free, you wanna hang with me
Like being a thug is the thang to be?
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, fuck the world!
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Got up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Haha, fuck the world! Fuck it
I hear my niggaz screamin fuck the world!
They wanna know if I claim the click, that I'm hangin' with
And if I'm down with this bangin' shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or 'Cause
Long as ya got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
I been through, Hell and back, and if I, fell black
Then it's, back to the corner where we sell crack
Some of you niggaz is bustas; you runnin' 'round
With these tramp=ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
Fuck the world!
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
I woke up screamin, Fuck the world!
Ha ha, niggas
Fucking with the wrong nigga
My seductive introduction
Be specific, still elusive
But exclusives what I give you when I kick it
And I'm still lifted
Niggas can't get with Mr.Wicked
Picture me flipping
My adversaries getting the dick swiftly
Niggas is swinging wild but they styles miss me
You can bring that bitch with your whole click
And still get treated shitty
Business never personal, I'm up before the sun come up
I'm tired
Just a ghetto star
A drop-top double R is what I'm riding
Nigga if you was half the man your bitch was
Bring your artillery
When you come for me 'cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast
'Cause Syke was busting
Plus Bo had 'em ducking screaming get they cash
So...
So now I got the law on me
My phones tapped, so I had to send word through my little homies
Tell them niggas just be here when they pull the trigger
Shit
This is what you get, for fucking with the wrong nigga
This is what you get when your
Fucking with the wrong nigga
Ha ha, yeah nigga
Peep
Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray
And thank the lord for giving me another fruitful day
I wanna be a peaceful man, but still
When niggas come for me, all I can see is getting 'em killed
For real, it's how I feel
Perfect my thoughts flowing on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel, they caps peel
We still cool, but you played yourself
Give 'em the mack and make 'em spray yourself
Hey
Falling legends, clutching chrome 3-5-7
Putting two bullets to they dome
Wanted to die in heaven
While calling shots nobody real as clear it's me
Ain't trying to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder my foes, get disposed of
We all homies till the death
So my true niggas show me love
God forgive me for my lifestyle
A negative figure
But why they fucking with the wrong nigga?
You know, it's like ...
Why you fucking with the wrong nigga?
I was raised by thugs
Schooled by killers
Learned my mathematic skills from real drug dealers
Tried to rise but they tried me
I guess they all had to die 'cause we tried peace
I die on these streets
Blast till they recognize
Still do or die
All my niggas getting high watching time fly
Best strategize on a way to profit
Best organize how you ride so they can't stop it
Then keep it popping a lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked your bitch and now this new shit gon' fade 'em all
My niggas ball, made a call for some backup
The little homies and my dogs in a black truck
Buck Buck was the sound
As they gats burst
No need for ambulance
Baby bring the black hearse
Shoulda never fucked around buster
How you figure making moves on the wrong nigga?
This what it sounds like
Bing, Bing, Bing
When you fucking with the wrong nigga
Niggas getting hit when they fucking with the wrong nigga
Fucking with the wrong nigga
Hit them with a lil' ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns
If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, Thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
In our days, things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth 'cause the truth looks strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin'
Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human
I hope we see the light before its ruined
My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns
Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Living out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess she's given birth to a baby
I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when its said and done
I bet this Brotha be a better one
If I'm upset, you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace in that war on the streets
My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns
Lord can you hear me speak!
To pay the price of being hell bound...
That live the life of a ghetto star
Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggaz is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn'ta tried
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces, they wrists and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter, eat a dick BEYOTCH!
Mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
Bring it on, fo' whoever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
I live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin' game tight
Mug niggaz, slug niggaz for the famed life
Laced with game, practiced on taking pain,
Quick to slang, and let it rain through your brain,
Street smart, proficient, intelligent,
And keep suckers hittin till snitches start smellin,
Movin niggaz with telekinesis,
Keeping Channel Seven at work filming different features,
Leadin niggaz to an early death with they head blown,
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue, was just dead and gone,
And hope niggaz got punished,
Kidnapped jacked in the back with macs to they neck,
Rats waitin to get done in,
Tossed his ass out, mob related,
One more nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth,
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfucking G
Now the next generation's looking up to me.
Walkin' through the cemetery
Talkin' to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid
Two shots rang from the plastic glock, wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard, time to notify, his family
Shiiit, ain't nuttin left to be identified
Evacuate the crime scene fast
Why I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass
Fly, I won't touch down till I see Tiajuana
Set up shop sellin them crooked cops marijuana
Label me a success, I made the switch
Retired from the life that never gave me shit
With cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star
Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down
Straight to the morgue 'cause I plan on, shut ya down
Born soldiers! -- Fucked him up with a mac folder
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga's shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh
'Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
Death, apparently they wasn't sucker free
'Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggaz in protective custody
I guess they heard that I got them birds
Thought I was a nerd till I fucked one of them to the curb
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich
With a team and clientele on my motherfuckin dick
And gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin riches
By givin' stitches, my life as a ghetto star
This goes out to all you motherfuckers
That STILL, have to kill to make that money
All you niggaz on the block, sellin rocks
Hand to hand, runnin' from the police
I see you - live your life as a ghetto star!
Talk to the hood, claimin you gettin' riches
Runnin' from the flags... live my life as a ghetto star
Niggaz with two strikes that don't wanna see the third, I feel you
The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm takin' back what's mine
You motherfuckers can't stop me
Even if I die, I'm gonna be a fuckin' problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin', joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Damn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so God damn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, can't peep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin' at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggaz slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My Mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin' drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
Every step could be death till you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
A seven-deuce full of niggaz goes by
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
But everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, kill a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggaz in the seven-deuce
A mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do?
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN' DIE, hope yo' ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin' cops now
Barely breathin' tryin' to keep from gettin' shot down
BOO-YOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin' like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm runnin' to my fuckin' block
Took a shot, tired of runnin' from the niggaz and the cops
Time to be a ghost
And then we'll be ghost
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
God
When I was alone, and had nothing
I asked for a friend to help me bear the pain
No one came, except God
When I needed a breath to rise, from my sleep
No one could help me, except God
When all I saw was sadness, and I needed answers
No one heard me, except God
So when I'm asked, who I give my unconditional love to?
I look for no other name, except God
Rest in peace to my mothafucka Biggie Smalls
That's right boy, it's goin' on
Right here, Thug Life
God bless the dead
God bless the dead and buried nigga
Don't worry if you see God first tell Him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you're representin the crew
And I can picture you in Heaven with a blunt & a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlas, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggie
Sayin' shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' mothafuckas plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin', never meant to do time
My epitaph will read Was the last of Gs
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucka wantin to hang
I can see 'em in my head, pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin' back in my yearbook all the years took
Half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die will they all shed tears
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin' in the mirror
Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
Fuck the police and all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin'
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin'
By keepin' gun and never run unless I'm comin' at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckas that passed too early
All the young motherfuckas that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin Gz, this one is for you
Yo Stretch, Biggie
Yo Big this is to you my nigga
Springfield Hollis crew, Thug Life, YGz
Sendin they respect, know I mean?
You my nigga for life, forever
You're always gonna be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget that
I pray before I go to sleep
Dear God save my place before I start to eat, cause times is hard
So I'm covered to my knees, oh why?
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock I buy?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, uzi weighin a ton
Niggas terrified of comin' from the young gun
Hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind blowin', so I'm flowin goin' crazy
Slip for cock the gun but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
For spunk is what he had, kid, I'd ratha attack Big
Now ya bout to smell the aftermath of what the mack did
Wannabe suckers wanna test, I'm tellin' you, yes
The teflon's bout to rip through your fuckin' vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
The spirit Biggie Smalls and the ??? clique, yeah
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
I was so money orientated initiated as a thug
Fiending for wicked adventures ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of living insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell me if I'm wrong, but saying fuck the world got ya deeper in my songs
Drinking till I hurl, spending money till it's gone, it's the good life
Baby niggaz got it going on
No maybe if I died and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways
Fuck a bitch
Bad boys eat a dick a day bumping this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wetting niggaz like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked as hood fights
But I'm a baller now
Nigga
I live the good life
This is the good life
Fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggaz
That trust the hoes
I found a way to stack money
Guaranteed to rise
I live the good good life
Cause thug niggaz don't die
No one knows, what the future holds, for you, huh huh
Listen closely
They say reach in your heart and you will find your mind
Everyday in these streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is now, peeping down the barrel of a fo'
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know, so
Who makes the call?
Will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
The desperation, constantly drinking and I can't sleep
Make deep tryin' to survive, some wanna die I wanna stay alive
Eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucka ducking season
Ya need a reason, why she turned into a softy
After living so loftly
It cost me my soul out of control in the Devil's world
Me, and my niggaz and my girl
Living the good life
I spend my days and nights, not knowing if strays in flight
Will finally catch me
It's the good life can ya hear me
Cleary, over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook doing way too much
But it's the fast lane on that, big dealing, big sinnin', all for the money
Some kill, some squeal, all for the money
Most ain't even real but we still call them homies
Now what the fuck is that fake love, fake thugs all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall, while I come up again
Outlaw never surrender is the call when the day is comin'
But this nigga get to running for my click get to gunnin
Str8 in the mist of all this stress and pain
We're trying to get a hold of the game
Living that good life
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin' motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I gets deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced witha mirage
Breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...
So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
We must be based on nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shakin
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitches planned it
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin your soul
You know, the way the games gettin' sold
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearing my throat
I got my mind made up, come on...
Get in get in too
Let it ride... tonight's tha night
Well I comes through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fuckin' sac won't collapse
Cause nowaday's, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin' bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like Sam Time
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin'
Why is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, stickin up Jews wit German lugers
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggaz best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast
Aiyyo, lyrical gas spittin' tha criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on ya whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, tha dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from tha rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold ya nose and blow out till ya ears pop
Since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Coly
Guess who's back?
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press, wreck on your tech, here we go, set pass the Moet
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin' to rob me
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceivin those we, believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, till there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound deaf
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, Hi, and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test... of givin'
But be thankful that you're livin'... blessed
Guess who's back, comin' back with the track supplied
By Special Ed and Ak, comin' right and exact
I'm fightin it back, now snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back
Tupac is ... back!
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
One minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin dicks, to makin' hits, bustin' flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, 'cause they hate my black take
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin' to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, why me?
No lie, nuckas cried when they try me
Givin' up the roughness, justice
I'ma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back? No longer trapped
'Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick, guess who's back?
Makaveli in this, Killuminati, all through your body
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me, eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggaz coming for me, and my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killing fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go
Deep inside the solitary mind of a madman who screams
In the dark evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggaz is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust
It's just as well Hail Mary
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers, never realize
The precious time the bitch niggaz is wastin', institutionalized
I lived my life a product, made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we ballin'
Catch me Father please, 'cause I'm fallin', in the liquor store
That's the Hennessey I hear ya callin', can I get some more
Hail till I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nothing to lose, just me and you
On a one way trip to prison, selling drugs
We all wrapped up in this living, life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max, doing they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off of Hennessey and Thai
Chronic, mixed it, now I'm twisted, blisted, and high
Visions of me thug livin' getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
On the regular mashing in a stolen black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds till the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preaching church, I gave you love now you eating dirt
Needing work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
'Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle till dawn
That's when sun came up, it's only one way up
Hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggaz get ya pay and weight up
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
We've been traveling on this weary road
Long time till I be take off this load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
We won't worry everything will come real
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everything will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary

Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers, never realize
The precious time the bitch niggaz is wastin', institutionalized
I lived my life a product, made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we ballin'
Catch me Father please, 'cause I'm fallin', in the liquor store
That's the Hennessey I hear ya callin', can I get some more
Hail till I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nothing to lose, just me and you
On a one way trip to prison, selling drugs
We all wrapped up in this living, life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max, doing they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off of Hennessey and Thai
Chronic, mixed it, now I'm twisted, blisted, and high
Visions of me thug livin' getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
On the regular mashing in a stolen black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds till the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preaching church, I gave you love now you eating dirt
Needing work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
'Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle till dawn
That's when sun came up, it's only one way up
Hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggaz get ya pay and weight up
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
We've been traveling on this weary road
Long time till I be take off this load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
We won't worry everything will come real
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everything will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la

Kiss me every time you see me step inside a room

Plus I love ya so I know your gonna make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine

To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God knowing you'll get scarred though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's mama made her my wife now
I'm trying hard y'all
Maybe in time, I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of together and forever we rise
If it would help our child grow then together we die
Why, question my love? It's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone

From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
When I deliver
Criminal lyrics
From a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Mackaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
Like a south paw you get let
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men
The Heartz of Men
My lyrical verse with so much pain
That to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us
It gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And five-o, get your lights on, fight long
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight
So we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'G' to this till the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if ya let me
I'll Muthafuck ya
If ya do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men
In The Heartz of Men
In The Heartz of Men
To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear
My pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year
Like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a Don
If niggas is having problems
Smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back,
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
Scar'd up
But still flowing
Energized and still going
Uh, can it be fate
That makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass coward 'cause they evil and fake
What will it take?
Give me that bass line
I'm feeling bombed
Deathrow baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent
'Cause I've been sent
The heartz of men
Ah, Suge what I tell you nigga,
When I come out of jail what was I gonna do

Heaven ain't hard to find
Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information, alleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smiling through your frown
I'm askin' Baby Boo are you down?
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation
Mr. I get around
My temptation got me dripping wet
Perspiration
I'm activated by the moves you making
Baby why you faking? strip naked get the love making
See it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wanting, never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what I'm missing
Stop with the beeper, baby Listen,
I know you're grown, but pay attention
Let me hypnotize you with my tongue kissin'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believing in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby you're moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug?
And have you ever made love with candles and bubbles sippin' in the tub
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This Thug Passion
Help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alizé
Come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends
Perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life
Baby and you'll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven Ain't Hard to Find
Heaven ain't hard to find
You think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you
Been talking since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact, I wink and you respond back
Look at me
What's all that ? Huh
It's like the closer you get, Baby the quicker I'm speaking
I gotta fly down to Cabo, lets kick it this weekend
I'm sipping Hennessey and coke
Tho' addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh god help me identify my truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion who would have thought
Come holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends
I can soup you in my Benz
We'll ride
I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin
Until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind baby
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
Oh, you tink life is yours?
Life ain't na somethin' you can rap with
Ooh come na ordinary game
Da game na somethin' you can rap with
Me's a player you know?
I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars, every time seen?
Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just tryin' to make a livin'
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin they riches on skanless bail
Who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass, playa-hatin' but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin' no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin through my pager, know me
Don't have no homies 'cause they jealous, I hustle solo
'Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas, listen
Ain't nothin' poppin' 'bout no work, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough
Heavy in the game
Who da bumba claat him a come try take mine?
Ooh, me see you rushin up
I throw 'I'm blood claat P.M. to A.M.
All, all da bumba come ya take dis ting
For ya take dis ting for joke?
Oh! Dat's right
Well lemme shoot some of this how heavy type of stuff...
Certain wanna stick to the game, yousea trick to the game
Waitin upon your turn, so when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, be twistin and takin' it
Puttin' they sack down, then puttin' they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Be yo' own, meanin' buy yo' own dope
Cause that front is punk, somethin' I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin and robbin, despisin your homie
Ain't healthy, endin up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewin somethin' major
So what I reap is boss -- that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young gangsta livin' residential
To a, young gangsta workin presidential
Me boy Tu-pac ALWAYS look good
You know that's true 'I'm look good every time
Ooh, war? Step up
Can yi know I'm servin' up blood claat
Playin' yi games
Ooh, we take game, we WON
Any by now, all, yi haffa forget fi we WON
Everytime
I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doin' dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustlin since junior high
No time for askin why, gettin' high, gettin' mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five sales
Cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these people I despise -- them loud talkin' cowards
Shootin guns into crowds, jeapordizin lives
Shoot 'em right between them thugz eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin' to make the news, people confused
Quit tryin' to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself, go with the grain
And come the riches and the girls and the fame
Heavy in the game
Boy, ya nah bitch!
Major that's true we look good every time
When we at Beers Diamond
And Tupac drives vintage car
And fi dem frame dem look good, oh no?
This whole world ya call on
Gonna mass on a face
For any, section of bumba ras claat, oh!
Flush it! ... Oh!
Nobody wan come test me y'know
True dem we a drive pretty car
Wanna no part of any ting
And now you wan come drown a gun
But ya see we know, you haffa show 'I'm MAXIMUM respect
For when a blood claat run or when a pussy walk up
We look good every time
Nuff dollars, DOLLARS
Y'know about dollars dem right?
But we nah talk no shit
We haffa walk de walk for we a talk, see it?
Cause action, action speak louder dan words
You know da record!
Don't blood claat ting at ALL
Get on yo' knees nigga
Get on yo' knees and pray
Huh, increase the doses, bustin' whoever closest
Thug livin', hell or prison, never losin my focus
I'm makin' money moves mandatory
In a discussion my past records tell a story
Picture niggaz we rushin and still bustin'
Till the cops come runnin', duck in abandoned buildings
Ditchin my gun, homeboy the motherfuckin villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legitless
So I laugh till I'm cryin, when the law come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga miss me, why plant seeds
In a dirty bitch, waitin to trick me, not the life for me
Livin' carefree, till I'm buried - and if they dare me
I'm bustin' on niggaz until they scurry, I'm clearly
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Sellin dope to all the fiends, at times I wanna cry
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin' if this game'll last, feelin' ashamed
Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin my soul?
Got tired of small time livin', niggaz tellin' me no
I got MINE, FUCK THEM OTHER SUCKERS, that's the mentality
Jealous-ass bustaz, make it hell for a hustla
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it hell 4 a hustler
Now in these last days and times I takes mines so serious
Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If I fail, then I suffer, bein broke is hell 4 a hustler
So I stay strugglin and jugglin with all the might I can muster
Since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in
One's five's and ten's was funny money
So I sets my sights bigger, four figures or mo'
Real nigga fo' sho', out in the cold for dough
What you thought? War is war, lost homies in plenty battles
Last two years shed plenty tears, and I'll send plenty at you
Let me catch you slippin, you soft niggaz is outta here
In case you forgot, we on the same shit that got us here
Yo, to every step I take, every foul I make
Every jail I break, every mill' I ate
Head to head, whoever hustle hardest
On the block duckin charges, nigga fuck the sergeant
He got a job, all my bottles got a pinch of coke
Listen tho' I'm missin' dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell naw, dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words
For all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as fuck son
Dyin' luck none supply us with much guns
I buck one, just to let you know that I can touch ya
Slangin cracks or raps, still hell 4 a hustler
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it hell 4 a hustler
No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef till I burn
Censor me and void your kids from the lessons I've learned
And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social
Niggaz shakin like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em
Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu
Niggaz do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin' for my dogs in the mornin
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? Gettin' blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walkin' close to my third, I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustaz
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell 4 a hustler
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it hell 4 a hustler
This is how we ride
Not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild till they all die
This is how we ride
Not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild
Until they all die, Outlaw
The Black Jesuz guide us through this
Weary weary weary weary
Only God can save us
Nuttin but boss players
Outlawz and thugs
Major! Hell motherfuckin yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Coolin, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellrazor...
Born thuggin'
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned
Not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons
A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin
I was ganked for sexin
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin' class
And I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
Mobbin through the overpass laughin'
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger in the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
And mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin' paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark till I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin' richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin' major, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor
Dear Lord can ya feel me
Stress gettin' major, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin'
Mama raised a hellrazor, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggaz
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies restin in the early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin' else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin' Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin' but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin' triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin' better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin' blunts
Gettin' drunk off that Tanqueray gin
Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin' pen
Mama raised a hellrazor, uh, yeah
C'mon, uh, mama raised a hellrazor
Uh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin' major
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, I cause shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high till they bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin' 'Tasha
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, Thug nigga
Stressin like a motherfuckin drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die

Now let me tell 'em who I be
Big ballin ass nigga named Trice
Now I was born in Detroit on the side that's west
Troubled child, commin up I had to ride I guess
Tried to apply myself, but niggas was ballin
My momma couldn't tell me shit, the streets was callin
I was often involved with niggaz breakin the law
I look back Pac nigga, we was bankin off raw
P Funk, got it pumpin, he had the connects
Through the sack to us little niggaz workin the set
And if you got it you getting wet, nigga bet on that
Don't come around hurr on that floss shit

She's so fine and she love Henn too
After a couple of shots she said, I could do what I wanna do
Till the break of dawn, gettin' it on, Hennessey
For the people partyin, till the mornin light
We keep on sippin, and sippin, and sippin
I speak
For all my niggaz livin' in the rush
Slow it down just a notch baby
It's goin' be all right, it's goin' be all right
Life in High Speed
Fuck the punishment, tie weed
I gonna buy me a gun
Fuck doin' time
I live life High Speed
Slightly disillusioned by weed
I breed thug muthafuckas even worse than me
When I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly, on me
My army, niggaz deceive swiftly
Look at you now, why you wanna hang out?
I pull the hammer back
Strike wit' a cannon and blow your muthafuckin' back out
They blast but I'm still standin'
Slightly scarred deep
Questions for the lord, why he don't like me, guard my soul
Though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb bomb less it's without protection for the boss
Rollin' in my double, raw, rugged, and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
And my crew, who could should be mistaken for Jews
We all about our past, blast if he break the rules
Fools done snitched for the D.A., be heaven sent
Switched like a stone-bitch, turned straight severed then, why?
Then they wonder why niggaz die
Put your family in danger just to get high
Now, what the hell can we get from jail?
More tricks for the crime rate, this is hell
Bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jailhouse
Open your safe count and take all your mail out
Whatever happens happens
Whoever falls dies
We fresh out of time, livin' blind, so we all ride
In times like these, chronic and tie weed
Puffin' through these High Speedz
And people say
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Verbal assassin, I hit the corner fast, blastin'
I plan to stretch your chest plate back like elastic
No need to push me to slippin'
I love beef, like pussy and pistols
For all you pussies that's soft as tissue
I ride plottin' like the fall guy out the roof
Bustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof
Gettin' your neck joints low to verdict wit' mine
Get that ass attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind
Grab your shots', callin'
Catchin niggaz while they snorin'
Kickin' his door in
And get your whole fucking' family a' mournin'
Plus all you itchy-bitchy types can't touch me
Frontin' like your hard
I'll play your fuckin' yard like a trussel
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
At times, I look through times wit' so much anger
Wonderin' why it keeps on passin' bringin' me the danger
No singal hard time is a good one
At times I'm amazed
Now what the mutha fuck a hood done
What we do to get paid
All day, for the almighty, dollar
Don't even bother to holla
We all destined to be swallowed
By the same thing we lust for
Threw away our morals in bags of dust, more
Niggaz is dying tomorrow
We, bet on all time
Nigga the clocks tickin'
Approachin' is the day you only know your glocks spittin'
Cops sittin', politicians passin' laws you ain't knowin'
Soon that money goin' be illegal when you got it
Keep your dough up
But I ain't goin' tell you, what?, to stop chasin' paper
Man, I'm just like y'all, I worry 'bout that shit later
Put the metal to the pedal, slash up nigga, blaze
Let's get blowed out High Speed till the end of my dayz
Now my people say
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
For my niggaz on the WestSide and the EastSide

From Compton to Jersey
Gettin' it real hard
From Atlanta, Georgia to Utah

Pictures of a young brother buried
Was it me
The Weed
Or this life I lead
If daytime is for suckas then tonight we breathe
Out for all that
Knowing that this world brings drawbacks
Look how they shiver
Once I deliver these war raps
Meet me at the cemetery dressed in black
Tonight we
Honor the dead, those who won't be back
So if I die do the same for me
Shed no tears
An Outlaw, thug living in this game for years
Why worry?
Hope to God
Get me high when I'm buried
Knowing deep inside only a few love me
Don't rush me through the gates of heaven
Let me picture for a while
How I lived from my days as a child
I wonder now
How do we outlast, always get cash
Stay strong if we all mash
Hold Your head
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Too many young black brothers are dying
Living fast, too fast
These felonies be like prophecies
Begging me to stop
'Cause these lawyers getting money every time they knock us
Snatch they pockets lyrically
Suckas flee when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli
Had the rap game closed
Expose foes, with my hocus pocus flows, they froze
Now suckas idolize my chosen blows
And more money, mean litigating
More playa hating
Got a cell at the Penn for me waiting
Is this my fate?
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinking
We fall back
Never had too much Tequilla drinking
We all that
Make them understand me
You lie to say my posse
Everyone roll with me is family
'Cause every bodies got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision
This life we living
Got us all meeting up in prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog
Written in blood
Saying Please show a young playa love
Hold your head
Hold it
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Too many young black brothers are dying
Living fast, too fast
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Too many young black brothers are dying
Living fast, too fast
God bless the child that can hold is own
Indeed
Enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last
To my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Currency means nothing if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days
Trouble comes naturally
Running from authorities
Till they capture me
And my aim, is to spread more smiles than tears
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe mama had it all right
Rest your head
Straight conversation all night
Bless the dead
To the homies that I used to have
That no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus, nobody knows my soul
Watching time pass
Through the glass of my drop top Rolls
Hold your head
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Too many young black brothers are dying
Living fast, too fast
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Too many young black brothers are dying
Living fast, too fast
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Hold on...
Yeah it's gonna be all right, don't trip baby
It'll get better...
Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to 'em bet
It's all good, uh
I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
Pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, 'cause they chasin me down
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you 'cause
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin' gettin' high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin' to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
I know them ain't tears comin' down your face
Wipe your eyes
In this world
Only the strong survive y'know
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
Welfare
AIDS, earthquakes
Muggings, carjackings
Yeah we got problems
But believe me when I tell you
Things always get better
God don't like ugly
And God don't like no quitters
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
God bless the child that can hold his own
Y'know?
You got to stand strong
And when these bustas try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face
Tell 'em hold on, and be strong
The game don't stop
Hmmm
This here is black main
If you don't never leave nothin', learn one thing
It don't stop, till the casket drop
Thug, for Life... feel me?
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin, hold on
I'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic
They try to playa hate
But they can't fade us tho'
We be mobbin' through tha neighborhood
Yeah
This goes out to you playa
You know... you know who you are
Gotta be careful, can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me nigga
Ya better Holla at me
Are you confused?
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside tha shoes
Of a nigga who don't have a thing to lose
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
How could you do me like that?
I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket
Made you a man again
And now you let tha fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape
It's a fools fate
Without your word
You're a shell of a man
I lost respect for you nigga
We can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do?
If it was up to you
I'd be dead now
I let tha world know nigga you a coward
You could never be live
Until you die
See tha mothafucken bitch in your eye
Type of Nigga, that let tha evil of tha money trap me
When ya see me nigga
Can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me nigga
Ya better Holla at me
So I gotta be careful, can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me nigga
Ya better holla at me
Courious
Spittin' lyrics
On tha verge of furious
I'm addicted to currency
Nigga that's why we're doin' this
I got shot up, I surprised tha niggas tha way I got up
And then
I hit the studio
It's time to blow tha block up
No hesitation
This information got you contemplatin'
Heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
Break him
And let him see tha face of a mental patient
It's a celebration
Of my criminal elevation
With the participation
I want members across tha fifty states
To keep tha nation anticipatin' until we break
Will I be great, is it my fate?
To live tha life of luxury
Some niggas bought my tapes
So much jelousy it scares me
So be prepared
Cause only tha strong survive
Probably never knew tha way it feels to die
So you figure fuck with me
I give that ass a try
Nigga, Holla at me
I shoulda saw tha signs
I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
So many brothas framed in this dirty game
It's a shame
So much pressure on my brain
While she blame me
Secrets in tha dark
Only her and I know
Now I'm sitten' in tha state pen
Doin' time for slow
Guess she made a bad decision
That got me livin'
Just like an animal
I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin'
Cause
Hell have no fury like a woman scorn
A cemetery full of mothafuckers got not knowin'
Picture my prophecy
Tha cops are attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from tha coppers
But never let'em stop me
'Cause I'm a soulja
Hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies
Of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid
Trust
A no no
Love is a mystery
Fuck tha po po,
Holla at me...
So when you see me nigga
You better holla at me...
They try to playa hate
But they can't fade us tho'
We be mobbin' through tha neighborhood
Yeah
Aww yeah, uh, uh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah!
Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin hearts and jackin marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin' down the barrel of my nine, get up
'Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got him in a smash, blast
How long will it last till the po' gettin' mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin' but be thankful that you're livin', blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me -
Hard! ... Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.
Tellin' you to hear it..
Hard! ... Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.
Tellin' you to hear it..

Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me - PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin' it up
One way or another you'll be givin' it up, huh
I guess 'cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin' dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin' my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin' in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin till other brothers bubble -
Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.
Tellin' you to hear it..
Hard! ... Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
Representin, never give up, on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -
Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.
Tellin' you to hear it..
Hard! ... Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.

Oh shit, caught that nigga alone
Ain't that a bitch
Hey, uh, this one here is, uh
For them niggaz that be Johnny Dangerous when they be fuckin' fifty deep
But they be fuckin' cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin' about
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Now
Now every time I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
Out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga it's a god damn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
How long will it last, nigga don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggaz aimin at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck motherfuckers I'm loc
They all duckin when my gun smoke
Cause you ain't shit without your homeboys
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggaz is punks
Without your homeboys, you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggaz is punks, you ain't shit without your homeboys
Nigga, punk ass motherfucker
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Throw your hands up you little trick, coward motherfucker
Like Yak said, how the fuck you gonna shoot me rocks
When you got the Outlaw 'Pac shittin ya box
You was lookin' real weak walkin' down the street
Now a nigga thirty deep, oh you wanna beef
Talk cheap, shoot a nigga the fair one
Your homies like fuck it, what's this you the only scared one
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw nigga played you out
We could have took it to the firfth I would I have laid you out
Niggaz be actin' all different when they dogs come around
Watch 'em act like bitches when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget
Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin' these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys, homeboy
You ain't shit without your homeboys
My thug niggaz, I love niggaz
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
My homeboys, the only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggaz to death, we ain't shit without our homeboys
... You know what time it is
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up nigga
Now I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggaz is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggaz cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers they all die
Been tryin' to make a million, by hustlin since my adolescense
From crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggaz fiendin, I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggaz be together
Ain't shit without your homeboys
Thug niggaz I love niggaz
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys, the only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggaz to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
Love my niggaz to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
Love you niggaz to death
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it, yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk, am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alizé, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, you'se a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggaz top that
They wanna censor me, they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss, nigga tell me how U want it
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Sky Pager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
Ha ha ha, but I'mma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it, how do U want it?
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alizé, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, you'se a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggaz top that
They wanna censor me, they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss, nigga tell me how U want it
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Sky Pager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
Ha ha ha, but I'mma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it, how do U want it?
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it, yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?

How long will they mourn me
Yeah! This for my nigga Kato
It's still on nigga
Thug Life, Thugs for life
Ha Ha yeah, how long will they mourn me
Yeah nigga
2Pac in this muthafucka
All my homies drinking liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide
But I can't cry
Instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
Retaliate and pull a 187
Do real niggas get to go to heaven?
How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'G'
Bitch don't wanna die
Then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me though, I'm trying hard to make amends
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me?
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
How long will they mourn me
Every muthafuckin' day homie
You stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigga you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'lac
And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day
Ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie
How long will they mourn me?
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
Damn a nigga tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of putting in work
I'm tired of cryin while watching my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace
How long will they mourn me?
Ya know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy
It's fuckin' with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone
How long will ya mourn me?
Yeah!
I wish it would have been another
Yeah, how long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my bother
I wish it would have been another
Yeah! How long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my brother
How long will ya mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will ya mourn my brother

Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggaz to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, nahmean?
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin up shit out there, kickin up dust
Givin' a motherfuck, heheheheheh
Yeah, niggaz
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roll
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the tip, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshitin
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that'd
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin, playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin, knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminsce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin 'n' grindin wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', Hell, I know one day I'll be back
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha
Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nuttin to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the Luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Till God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggaz just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha
Iiiiiiiii,
I ain't, mad at cha, no
I ain't mad at chaaaaahhhhhhhhmm
Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggaz to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Iiiiiiiii,
I ain't, mad at cha, no
I ain't mad at chaaaaahhhhhhhhmm
I just don't give a fuck
They done push me to the limit I'm all in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cops bragging about the nigga he's baggin
I see no justice
All I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast
Then watchin the hearse pass
Just another day in the life 'G'
Gotta step lightly 'cause cops tried to snipe me
The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man
But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my cheque
I get more respect from the mutha-fuckin' dope man
The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hos
They got dough but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down
Just can't understand why we getting respect now
Mama told me they're be days like this
But I'm pissed cause it stays like this
And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait
Gimme a break
How much shit can a nigga take
I ain't goin' nowhere, no how
What you wanna throw down
Better bring your guns pal
'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailin' hate I bail and spray with an A-K
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
From the mutha-fuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a phychopath
The truth didn't last
Before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who'd do yah figure!?
A mutha-fuckin' night nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up
I had enough and I just don't give a fuck
Niggas!, isn't just the blacks
Also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
Tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
They say niggas like to do niggas
Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
A street walkin' nigga and a beat walkin' nigga with a badge
I had to shoot ya and the pass for the blast take his cash
And bash his head in dump him at the dead in
And that's just his luck
Cause a nigga like me
Don't really give a fuck
Walked in the store what's everybody staring at
They act like they never seen a muthafucka wearing black
Following a nigga and shit
Ain't this a bitch
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere
But where?
Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need?
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if knows that my income is more than
His pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your jive ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as casanova
And count another quick meal
I'm getting paid for my traid but its still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Useta come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up
They know we fed up
But we they just don't give a fuck
They just don't give a fuck
I gotta give my fuck offs
Fuck you to the San Fransisco police department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff department
Fuck you to the F.B.I
Fuck you to the C.I.A
Fuck you to the B-u-s-h
Fuck you to the AmeriKKKa
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudiced motherfuckers
And fuck yah
Fuck Y'all
Punk, gay, sensitive, little-dicked bastards
2paclypse mutha fuckin' know
Y'all can kiss my ass and suck my dick
And my uncle Tommy's balls
Fuck Y'all
Punks, punks, punks, punks, punks
Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around
Well I've been hanging sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around
2Pacalypse now don't stop for hoes, I get around
Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please
Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips 'cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone till the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around
Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets

It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around
I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit 'cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault papa didn't plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Down the block, got a glock, and I clock grip
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and
Why must I sock a fella, just to live large like Rockefeller
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
God damn it's a motherfuckin riot
Black people only hate police so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right but it's long overdue
We can't have peace till the niggaz get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more
It's been goin' on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, when will the violence cease?
When your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street
Niggaz had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Word to God 'cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them, cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggaz burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
Predicted the shit, in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggaz, felt good
In the hood bein around the niggaz, yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro
Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
Mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz
I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Just think, if niggaz decide to retaliate
I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit 'cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class

Just think, if niggaz decide to retaliate
Get money nigga
Yeah - aw yeah
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers
That get up every motherfuckin mornin and put they work in
I see you - I see you boy
I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked
Niggaz laughed, till the first motherfucker got blas-ted
I put the nigga in his casket
And now they covering the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck when it counts
Tryin' to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin' ghost on the five-oh, fuck them hoes
Got a forty-five screamin out surviv-al
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some ya-yo
And holla five-oj when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen, I'm hittin fences
NARC's on a nigga back missin' me by inches
And they say how do you survive, weighin one-fifty-five
In the city where the little niggaz die
Tell mama don't cry, cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'
Kinda boomin round the way, think today I make a killin'
Dressin down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops
Gettin' high I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin' paid today, ha hah ha
I live Thug Life and let the money come to me
'Cause they can never take the game from a young G
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
At point blank range 'cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin the dice
Now roll 'em if you can't stand pain better hold em
Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G
Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock till his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me 'cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling whooped tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a hoe and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging till the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug till six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a liar
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to dig me a whole of a ??
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millometer
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
They say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffin weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facing
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the player hating tricks, while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But y'all some hoes, the game should be sewed
I'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me
Addicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
I'm ducking the cop, I hit the weed as I'm clutching my glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block, what if I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
Polishing pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
When I get to popping niggas is dropping then they done
Calling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse
He got it by killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method, whenever stepping keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales
Picture perfection pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversatin' like they still here, if I die tonight
Pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for Thug Living when I die
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto for Thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a player
Overdose of a dick, while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whipping these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me nigga I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading murdered to death, my last breath
Take a look picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand, if I die tonight
? Like a mother-fuckin' Jew throws cash
Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Sayin' we cousins, knowin' that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope gaaaane, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call
It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang cane on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' cane
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rappin' tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
'Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call
Well it's ninety-one and I'm livin' kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell pal
But life makin' records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected it's hectic it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take, my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call
Tell me I will be there
Tell me I will be there
Tell me I will be there
Yeah...
If there be pain
All you have to do is call on me
All you have to do is call on me
And before you hang up the phone
You will no longer be alone
Together we can never fall
Because our love will conquer all
If there be pain
Reach out for a helping hand
If there be pain
And I shall hold you wherever I am
Every breath I breathe will be into you
For without you here my joy is through
My life was lived through falling rain
So call on me if there be pain
If there be pain
Every breath I breathe will be into you
For without you here my joy is through
My life was lived through falling rain
So call on me if there be pain
If you need me
If you need me
Eternally Thug Nigga Hilfigger made by Tommy
So when I speak hope to reach my ?? Mamis
Or come to Papi I love it when its wet and sloppy
In and out the mouth piece till I cum no one can stop me
My bump and grind will do you every time
Come get a blast of this Thug passion and blow your mind
Hey, throw up your legs, wrap those shits around my back

Walkin' down 125 while I'm peepin out hotties

It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

Keepin' it real
I take a shot of Henessey now I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggaz on the, other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change
And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain
Arguements with my Boo is true
I spend mo' time with my niggaz than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game
I'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame
I'll be hustling to make a mill-ion, lord knows
Ain't no love for us ghetto children, so we cold
Rag top slowin down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass, uh
It ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin' Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin like I'm hopeless, I can't cope
Me and the homies smokin' roaches, 'cause we broke
Late night hangin' out till the sunrise gettin' high
Watchin the cops roll by
It ain't easy... that's right
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free
I can't sleep niggaz plottin on to kill me while I'm dreamin'
Wake up sweaty and screamin, 'cause I can hear them suckers schemin
Probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizin
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why this the way it is, even now
Lookin' out for these killer kids, 'cause they wild
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representin
Doin' twenty to life in San Quentin
Gettin' calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nuttin nice
Yo 'Pac, do something righteous witcha life
And even thou you innocent you still a nigga, so they figure
Rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'm hold ya down and holla Thug Life, lickin' shots
Till I see my niggaz free on the block
But no it ain't easy, hahahah
Till I see my niggaz free, on the block, oh
It ain't easy
Lately been reminiscin
Bout Peppermint Schnapps in Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while D-Boys slang rocks
It's the project kid without a conscience, I'm havin' dreams
Of hearin screams at my concerts, me all my childhood peers
Through the years tryin' to stack a little green
I was only seventeen, when I started servin' fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dollar
So my apoli', cause these hard times make me wanna holler
Will I live to see tomorrow, am I fallin' off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all
Ain't nobody down with me I'm thuggin', I can't go home
Cause muh-fuckers think I'm buggin, so now I'm in
This high powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail, what
Do I do in these county blues
Gettin' battered and bruised by the you know who
And these fakes get to shakin when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin' in this, livin' hell, listenin to niggaz yell
Tryin' to torture 'em to tell, I'm gettin' mail
But ain't nobody sayin' much, the same old nuts
Is makin' bucks while these sluts is gettin' fucked
They violated my probation, and it seems
I'll be goin' on a long vacation, meanwhile
It ain't easy
No it ain't easy
Outlaw

Her moms let her do what she please it seemed no one loved her
Her eyes shined love a diamond in the rough
The kind that you can love
Not yet touched
With so much, potential
Youngster, let me got your mental
Into a place, with the sourness of pain you'll never taste
By God's grace you were born with that face
Nothing but pure beauty
So for an eternity I feel it's my duty
To be a souljah, oh yeah baby I got plans to mold ya
And in the coldest nights is when I hold ya
Like I'm supposed to
As we roll closer
I'll take your hand gladly
Anything ya need ask me
Spoil my baby girl just like daddy
You alleviate the stress spending time with you, I feel blessed
When you gone feel the pain so strong
Deep in my chest
When I got arrested
Came so close to going to jail
Throwin' blows at the po-pos breakin they nails
Screamin loud goin' all out
Damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house
Watchin the kids, through the whole bid
In tha V-I
I seen ya daily
When my fake homies try ta fuck you
You run and tell me
That's why I stay committed
I thank God every time I hit it
Hoping you'll forgive me, for the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world
We untouchable
Screamin like ya dying every time I'm fuckin' you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity
And through the years
I know ya gave me your heart
Plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up
You still love me
Come to me anytime you want
Dedicate slow jams on the radio
Oh I

Never leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy
Boo would ya, die for me?
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin' high
With mean sounds tougher than bristles
Fool when you cry I'll be ya tissue
Back in the county writing letters how I miss you
Giving you credit, apologetic how I dis you
Get you for thinkin' like a minor and on a level of one
And sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dine ya
Lace ya for total vigina and still
We right behind ya tru
Life just me and you no tellin' what we could do
Getting high between the sheets
Make the shit right here discrete
Putting hickies on ya belly while we fucking on the beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy
Shorty I lend my hand out to help ya
Lost soul looking for shelter
On the late night accept it
Treat ya good won't disrespect ya
My age is young
Out of place binge days is done
From a trixy to a missy, you know I raised ya hon
Placed her under my wing
Showed her how we swing
Now she rollin' blunts for a king
One day labeled thug Mrs
The essence of my ghetto sistas
Hugs and kisses
That's just for me to be a father figure
Come to me anytime you want
Dedicate slow jams on the radio
Oh I
Know your happy I can feel ya passion
Looking out for ya just like daddy
Come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close your eyes, and feel the magic
Never leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy
Little somethin' for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corrine
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see em
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter
Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know it's funny when it rains and pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
They say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
There ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up
And uh
To all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin' down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't fall down this week
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please... you got to keep your head up
Little somethin' for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corrine
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare

Please... you got to keep your head up
Let it be prophesized; niggaz'll die because ya crew's goon
Around the way niggaz get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones
Niggaz is bold and they choose to roll
I kill 'em all, watch now nigga truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
Niggaz dyin' by my 30-yard, brains'll splatter
Wonder why these niggaz cross me
I'm certified crazy, so sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, every time I ride it's for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga 'cause I'm comin' back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation runnin' from drug cases
Lookin' at my congregation so full of thug faces
Momma gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin' niggaz watch they every step
Label me a threat
And I ain't even got started with this shit yet
Thug style baby, hands on my pistol, listen I'm a ridah
Every nigga breathin pay attention
Bout to show you motherfuckers how it feel, to drop a body
The simple gun to my lifestyle, Killuminati
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
After the fire comes the rain, after pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin again
Till I make it yo; my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to, bitches that scary, get too near me we rushin
Visions of over-packed prisons, fiends and niggaz thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heater ammunition it cranks, psssh
Move without a sound, as we slide down, pistols in place
They got me fiendin for currency, the money be callin
It's like I'm - dreamin', see in season me ballin
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked fo'-five, snatchin niggaz pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
God damn now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati
I spend most of my time bankin niggaz
Because they hate a nigga, comin' across fake niggaz
But we made niggaz, old school and I'm thinkin'
Y'all some bitch made niggaz and you steadily sinkin
O-U-T, L-A-W-Z ain't nuttin fuckin' with that
We bustin' back comin' back for the stacks
Laugh last cash cash, all I want is the paper
Givin' them fuckers tool whips, I rule haters
Y'all can't fade us, we kill steal and peal quickly
The boss niggaz, definitely, put it down strictly
E.D.I. Amin, until the law come for me
Kill 'em all for shortie, ninety-nine Killuminati
They got me thinkin' strugglin and hustling's my only fate
Toppin grams on the kichen plate, tryin' to keep that money straight
Times is rollin' three up these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed it hurts
Got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
Preocuppied by the greed, in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend, or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's simpin naughty thangs
Real as these tatt's on my body, and it's Killuminati
Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain
Hold it down, hold it down
Makaveli up in this bitch, worldwide mash, Westside
Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain
The question we ask, do you know what time it is?
Hold it down, hold it down
You know what type of shit we be
Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain
You want that hip-hop real

Hold it down, hold it down

Outlawz...
Roll me a cigarette dog
They got me feeling crazier than a motherfucker
I got Bad Azz in this motha fucka
Puffin on Lye
Hoping that it gets me high
They got a nigga goin' crazy
Time goes by
Puffin on lye
Hopin that it gets me high
They got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Last year was a hard one
But life goes on
I hold my head against the wall
Learning right from wrong
They say my ghetto instrumental
Detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery
In which they live
Lately, for the outcome, damn I'm reckless
Check it
You don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck living blinded
Hennessy got me feelin' bad
Time to stop drinkin'
Rollin', in my drop top Jag
What's that cops thinkin'?
Sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came along way but still I got so far to go
Dear mama, don't worry
I'm a watch for snakes
Tell Seikywa that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me and I cried for weeks
This is what came out, when I tried to speak
All I heard was
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
One, two, three, four
I see bloods and crips runnin' up in hell
Lookin' for a better way
My brothas and sistas it's time to bail
'Cause even thug niggas pray
Hoping God forgive me
I entered the game, look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent
Casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house
This your land
Your only son done became a man
I'm watchin time fly
I love my people do or die
But I wonder why
We scared to let each other fly
June 1-6 7-1
The day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me nigga get paid
No one can understand me
The black sheep, out-casted from my family
Now packin heat I run the streets
A young runaway live for the day
When we die
I could hear ya say
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
Krazy, Krazy, Krazy
God help me out here
'Cause I'm possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
This money's like a strong prescription drug
It's got me addicted to the pleasure and the pain it's inflicted
Something about the paper with the pictures of the presidents' head
Damn it's like a motherfucking plague that spreads
It's epidemic
Forgotten, forgot, and it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin' money 'cause it's cursed
Makin' money makes a difference day by day
So you gotta stay paid, no doubt
Day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin to live
No matter how hard you try, you see death
You gotta die
Alotta my Peers didn't make it to these years to come
Dear life doing right
Or dear life leaving dumb
Who has the answers?
I wonder
I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me
That there'll be light at the end of the road
Why?
'Cause they don't even know
A million thangs run through my mind
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time
You ain't gotta be in jail
Remember this tune
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
Feelin' fucked up in this bitch
Smoke half a ounce to the head.
Drop the top. Indo. Hawaiian. Lansbread. Buddha. All that shit.
I'm fucked up in this motha fucka.
And Hennessy don't help. And Hennessy don't help.
Thug passion in this motha fucka.
Makaveli the Don putting it down to the fullest.
Maximum overload. 3 day theory.
Killuminati to your body, with the impact of a 12 gauge shoty.
Doublized slugs. No love. Straight thugs.
One time for my niggas in the jail cell.
One time for my niggas doin' life in hell.
One time for my niggas in the jail cell.
One time for my niggas doin' life in hell.
One time for my niggas on Death Row.
One time for my niggas livin'... broke.

You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga
But they can't take us alll
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Keeping the smile off their white fakes
I ain't racist but lets trade places
Trace the hate 'n' face it
One nigga teach two niggas
Three teach four niggas
And them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz

Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin
Packed in a suburban, screamin outlaw runin on the curb
They never try me cause right behind me your killer team
I get a word cut the head off a nigga like a guillotine
This Hennessey'll keep me calm though
Sittin' in the back of the club, tradin convo
Livin' like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi, nigga watch me with the chrome nine
All the time drinkin' champagne
Walk through the crowd let the tramps hang
Niggas playa hate but do a damn thing
Picture me doin' eighty down a one way
Stuck in the trunk, caught with gun play
So I gotta keep my eyes open
Gettin' high, wonder why we gotta die smokin'
My alibi, I'm victory
Like them other vile men I'm marked for death
Spendin my nights like it's the last one left
I'm an outlaw
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin' on
Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet submission I'm the last one left
Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin' on
Last to leave until I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher, guess I'm the last one left
I got my back against the wall
Gat chillin' by my balls
Prior to war is rider nigga only five six tall
Napoleon only knows on we outlaws fuck fear
Better strap down to the feelins 'cause we out yeah
Thug passion all up in me
Feelin' like I took some Henne

Last niggas with our tape

Lookin' for niggas that was roofin that shit when I was locked back
Hands on the pump, makem jump when its cocked back

Hey Pac, it's yo boy
Hey man so far I've been listening to your album
And I ain't heard nothing you could kick back and smoke a beady to
You know?
Yeah like that
Some of that mellow shit
Some of that shit that make bitches drink
Make niggaz think
And help you check a fat-ass bank, hahahah
So why don't you kick some of that shit nigga only you know how
Hahahah, feel me?
I'm barely standing and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanours is a small thing
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Running through the street lights 'cause we like
Young nigga get your mob on show 'em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggaz popping, welcome to our casino
Cause you and me know hundred percent like a c-note
Looking for a bitch that's half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some Indo
Tongue-kissing on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm digging I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game tight love fucking bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right
The club be popping so I'm stopping at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try, in the 'Late Night'
Last night... last night changed it all
Last night...
Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain till my socks is damp
Ain't nothing like being a thug when I can just
Sit on the Row of Death straight knowing that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosing on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent the town
Last night was popping like like cocked glocks with hollow-tip rounds
From booty calls to bail sheets
It ain't no telling if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and the bitches up in the late night
Probably involves me coming up with just to see another day
Might, If me who ride the bullet in these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who trying to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage spitting my shells in a gauge
Deadly as aids niggaz getting crossed like a maze
Now picture me living my life like a king maybe one day
Chilling I'm living Monday through Sunday
Bringing the gun play for all these beefs and battles
When we collide I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night
Money and multiple gunshots are shown large amps are blown
Niggaz in low-lows, pursuing more hoes, then go home
The life of a California star
And when you see me in the drop-top Jag how many niggaz wanna be me?
Game is automatic mandatory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
'Cause when you gettin' some riches watch for dumb bitches
They have you labeled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin'
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
'Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated ride whenever needed
For my niggaz up in Clinton getting weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and ducking
Slapping niggaz known for telling bitches fuck-it in the late night
Yo Quiero
Yo Quiero Cojer
Yo Quiero Cojer
I'll let your ass have it
Take care of business
Oh for real
Ghetto chorette
Now you been acting like you want it for a long time
All up in a nigga face, giving me them strong vibes
Look in my eyes and you'll find peace

Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
As you pass bye wink in my eye, freshly scented
What's the haps baby? Come get with me and perhaps lady
You can help me multiply my stacks baby
Through with that - scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitating actin' like yo' shit don't stink
Check out my - diamonds bitch everyone gonna blink
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreaming motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my resume, sipping on Cristal and Alize
Smoking on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't like tricking but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand no sneaker-wearing nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree, re-breed me, they're so cheap
Putting bitch-made busters to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called comp, who the man?
While I'm tugging on yo' main bitch head
Understand this, ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z
He broke and I smoke daily baby let's be friends
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass, it was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass got me checkin' for you hardcore; staring and watching
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, we possess bubonics
Far from a crush I wanna bust your guts and touch
Everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweating like a fat girl goin' for mine
Just a skinny nigga fucking like she stole my mind
Back in time I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre, tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs now, let me in between as friends
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks
I got 'em ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame? My dick or the game?
Bet I scream WESTSIDE when I came
Scream my name, cause baby it's delicious got a weak spot
For pretty bitches up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby let your back get into it
Make it fluid, in and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high! Let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride!
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player hating niggaz 'cause they cock block
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good - in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizing, seeing you naked
It's the fuck song, so check my record
And let's be friends
Where my people at? Show me where my people at
Where my people at? Show me where my people at
All my niggaz now, just my niggaz come
Where my niggaz at? Just my niggaz now
Be friends, tell me where my niggaz at

Why you trickin on them other hoes?
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
To my unborn child
To my unborn, child
In case I don't make it
Just remember daddy loves you
I did everything I could to make things good for you
So don't worry about it
To my unborn
You know daddy loves you
Now ever since my birth, I been cursed since I was born to wile
In case I never get to holler at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison
Blessed to be still living
Trying to earn every penny that I'm gettin'
Reminiscin' to the beginning of my mission
When I was conceived and became to be in this position
My mama was a panther, loud
Single parent but she growled
When she witnessed baby boy ripping wild
I went to school but I dropped out
And left the house cause my momma says I'm good for nothing
So I'm out, since I only got one life to live
God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again
Or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wanting revenge for the agony they did to me
See my life ain't promised but it sure get better
Hope you understand my love letter
To my unborn child
I'm writing you a letter
This is for my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you
Wanna let you know I feel this way
I think about you every day
I have so much to say
So complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand till we trade places
Tell the world I been guilty to being anxious
Ain't no way in hell, that I could ever be a rapist
It's time to face this, cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot 5 times but I'm still breathing
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
God believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way
Dear mama I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own not a hand out
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace
When I gotta die
On these cold streets
Ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again
To my unborn child
I'm writing you a letter
This is for my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you
Wanna let you know I feel this way
I think about you every day
I have so much to say
Dear Lord can you hear me?
Tell me what to say to my unborn seed
In case I pass away will my child get to feel loved
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs
Cause being black hurts
And even worse if you speak first
Live my life as an outlaw
What could be worse
Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who am I kidding?
I'm a thug till I die
I'm a ride
Maintain, touch base
Eat lunch
In plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a heaven for true thugs
I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not being there
Just know, your daddy was a souljah
Me against the world
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord I'm eternal
Resting in peace
Please take care of all my seeds
And my unborn child
I'm writing you a letter
This is for my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you
Wanna let you know I feel this way
I think about you every day
I have so much to say
Please take care of all my kids
And my unborn child
To my unborn child
This letter goes out to my seeds that I might not get to see
Cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothing but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I
'Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age you'll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I'll see you if there's a ghetto in heaven
If there's a ghetto heaven I'll be there waiting for you
Take care
Run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes there's confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it, all day every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Snakes come a dime a dozen
Work hard
Study
Get your mind right
Uh... dear Mr. President
Whas happenin'?
I'm writin you because, shit is still real fucked up in my neighbourhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin' changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected...
... They ain't came true
Tell me what to do, these niggaz actin' up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
Tell me what to do, these niggaz actin' up in the hood
Send mo' troops...
Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggaz fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin' I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
'Cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
Yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed us
I guess it's 'cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
I ride for Mutulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Oh youse a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
Cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
And young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
Launch it, leave a nigga flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin' pay the day besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin' to drastic measures tryin' to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'fuckers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin' better
But you keep, tellin' us, that it is
While your motherfuckin troops keep killin' our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherfucker
Dear Mr. President, tell us what to do
These niggaz actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggaz lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin and things, squeakin on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Till y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's will freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President
Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
And it ain't gon' get better
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin' up...
Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin in my own blood
Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
Y'all sniffin blow and postin what they hittin fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin' sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
Till then we gonna keep it comin', Mr. President
And I meant every word in my letter to the President
Word motherfuckin life
Fuck this nigga think?

How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
But life goes on...
How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
But life goes on...
As I bail through tha empty halls
Breath stinkin' in my draws
Ring, ring, ring
Quiet y'all
Incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school
He's getting bye
It's time to bury another brotha nobody cry
Life as a baller
Alchol and booty calls
We usta do them as adolecents
Do you recall?
Raised as G's
Loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on tha roof
Let's get smoked out
And blaze with me
2 in tha morning
And we still high assed out
Screamin' 'thug till I die'
Before I passed out
But now that you're gone
I'm in the zone
Thinkin'
'I don't wanna die all alone'
But now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death
I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' ta make it last
I drank a 5th for that ass
When you passed...
Cause life goes on
Yeah nigga
I got tha word as hell
Blew trial and tha judge gave you
25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time
Won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict
That's getten' old
Plus with tha drama
We're lookin' out for your babies mama
Taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from beatin' on her...
Life in tha hood...
Is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at your party
Me and you
No true a two
While scheming on hits
And gettin' tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you buried
Rest nigga
'Cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry
Sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Tho' memories fade
I got your name tated on my arm
So we both ball till my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die
Bury me smilin'
With G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral
Let every rapper rock it
Let tha hoes that I usta know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of Gin
In case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die
We outlaws
Let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
Got police chasen' me
To my niggas from old blocks
From old crews
Niggas that guided me through
Back in tha old school
Pour out some liquor
Have a toast for tha homies
See we both gotta die
But ya chose to go before me
And brothas miss ya while you're gone
You left your nigga on his own
How long we mourn
Life goes on...
Life goes on homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya nigga, trust me
I feel ya
You know what I mean
Last year
We poured out liquor for ya
This year nigga, life goes on
We're gonna clock now
Get money
Evade bitches
Evade tricks
Give players plenty space
And basically just represent for you baby
Next time you see your niggas

'Goddamn, them niggas came up'
That's right baby
Life goes on...
And we up out this bitch
Hey Kato, Mental

And we up out this bitch
Hey Kato, Mental
Y'all niggas make sure it's popin' when we get up there
Don't front.
In the life we live as thugs
Everbody fuckin wit us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin wit my gun in hand
Why explain the game? Niggas ain't listenin
Stuck in positions. If victims can't stand the heat
Then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Have these bustas switchin, lookin at me mean
Itchin, givin suckas plenty space
Have these bitch niggas snitchin
Where are we now? Guns found daily
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me for sellin dope
They backwards, make tracks burst whenever I rap
Attack. Words bein known to explode on contact
Extreme at times. Blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me. Truely effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice. Got a death wish, bitch
Run up, face me and trace wit an infared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin you back. Explode the track to confetti
Unload it. 'Cause niggas ain't ready. The life of an outlaw
Chorus repeats
Code 3. Attack formation. Pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils 'cause they itchin to get you
Mercy to this madman screamin kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire makin all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream
Dope got me hatin fiends. Scheam wit my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives. Come closer. Exhale the fumes
We got memories fadin fast. A slave for cash
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now. How you like it, raw
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws. Never surrender
Death is for a son to stay free. I'm thugged out
Fuck the world 'cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin
Believe in me and you could see the victory
A warrior with jewels. Can you picture me?
Life of an outlaw
Chorus repeats
City under siege. It's like I can't even breathe
I'm from the state of car theives. G, deep from the street
Plenty beef. I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb Deep. This nigga from behind tryin to creep
No halfs wit no straps, jack
It's on to bounce back
And an ounce so fat, they snatch my style ???
Get this grip wit hollows to get cha
Snip wit clippers. Get the picture?
I wrote my life down like a scripture
And I'm still on lost in the land of the lonely
Where ain't nobody holy. A matter of a fact, we unholy
Everybody livin soley for themselves. Too ?? on a land hell
Somebody need me. You know we lost hope and we needin it
Wit the evil it's forever. But it might be low down, scandalouz
Like a tramp is. All for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit. 6 months in advaced to what we plotted
Approved to go on swole and now I got it
Un uh, crack my window. Knowin they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin
Attach a strap under my pillow and a hand like we freakin
Creepin deep into morning. Peepin out the weak
While they yawnin and let my cloud speak for it's self
No doubt. Outlaw. Outta my mind, outta time. You're all blind
Some kind of life of mine Kato don't mind
Findin it funny, matter of fact, 'cause it is
Perhaps finally I look at that true over the years as an outlaw
Eh, Noble
What's up nigga
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah
Would you kill for me?
On my grandmother, nigga
Ah yo
What's up
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now
Watch out
Well now they all say they roaches and parasites
Snakes and all they might
Thug Life break night
Drink till we fist fight
Life or death. But you can't win with a vest
But there won't be no breathing for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark
So chase ???
Hide your stash
Beware foolin marks
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left for PO's belly
And let me bust back to them niggas till they all sweaty
Fucking Lil' Homies
Everybody Ducking
My fucking Lil' Homies
Lil' Homies
Everybody Ducking
Just pay attention, here's a story bout my lil' homey
Str8 thuggin', lil bad young mother fucka, you gotta love him
You can catch him in his G-Ride clutching his glock
Educated on these cold streets
Getting money, making dummies out the police
Ain't no peace for an adolescent nigga to wild to be a thinker
Bud smoking 24-7, everyday drinking
I got my diploma but I never learned shit in school
Mo money, mo bitches, mo murder fool
Always the young niggaz getting in shit
She wouldn't stop to conversate so you called her a bitch
Bustin' on paper thin mother fuckas
Drinkin' gin before you get to sinnin' on them bustas
Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me
Everybody duckin'
My fucking lil' homies
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets
I remember, when we was just a little G
Flirting with death, playing Russian Roulette
Screaming Kill Me!
Hey there young nigga what you smoking on
Mad at the world cause you came from a broken home
Let us sob cause your mom's is sick
A bunch of adolescent young niggaz spittin' major shit
Tell me, young nigga if you died let me know
Would your heart feel pain, watching as your mother cry?
Would all your homies ride?
Or would they all get high, and talk about how you died?
Young niggaz on a mission to complete
Getting g's, packin' heat, bringin' havoc to the fuckin' streets
Nobody knows why he took a 4-4 and unloaded on the whole front row
Buck! buck!
Try to tell him but he act like he don't know me
Pull out his pistol and show
My lil homies
First to bomb, 16 on death row
Busting on them phony mother fuckas cause the big homey said so
Niggaz knew, I was a nutcase quick to blast
Living under age but he'll blaze on your bitch ass
Is there a heaven for a G?
And if there is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streetz ain't no peace
Shell shocked shows making money off of crack sales
Young black male
Unable to change, 'cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows, the evil that they might do
Lil' Moo, Big Yak, K-Kastro
Big Malc, Hussein call them Outlawz
Telling the world to be equipped, when these young mother fuckas rip shit
They don't quit, shoot down on me
Pull a pound on me
Bust like they didn't know me
My fucking lil' homies
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police

California Love
California love!
California... knows how to party
California... knows how to party
In the citay of L.A.
In the citay of good ol' Watts
In the citay, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'! We keep it rockin'!
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-makin-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for
Californ-i-a
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it mama
Shake it Cali
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it shake it shake it...
Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
The life of a west side playa where cowards die
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rose Grands
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sacktown
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love!
Now make it shake...
Uh, yeah, uh, longbeach in tha house, uh yeah
Oaktown, Oakland definitely in tha house hahaha
Frisko, Frisko

Let's show these fools how we do this on that west side
Cause you and I know it's tha best side

West coast, west coast
Uh, California Love
California Love
----
So Many Tears
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past, you wanna last
Be tha first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears
Ah, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now that I'm strugglin in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
Of leavin' here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial, and when I die,
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin, bout to go to pieces, screamin peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin a picture of my enemies killin' me, in my sleep
Will I survive till the mo'nin, to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come...
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord knows I... tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drivebys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door -- shed so many tears
Lord, I've lost so many years, and shed so many tears...
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Damn, another funeral, another motherfucker
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they shoulda killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin' crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
And if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm loosin hope, they got me stressin, can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennesey got me queasy
Don't wanna earl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
Don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
Slangin rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin' from the cops -- and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows...
The Lord knows
I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
And every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
And still a nigga stressin over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
Take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath,
It's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin niggaz, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard
In the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breath
Got me thinkin', what do Hell got?
'Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin' shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin game
And Lord knows...
Lord knows
Lord knows!
The Lord knows
One-time! One-time!
Fuck the five-oh 'cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let 'em capture me
Done lost too many niggaz to this gangbangin
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin', fucked up!
I had to tell him it was all right, and that's a lie
And he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin' up
I'm gettin' lost in the weed, man, gettin' high
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out, and if I wasn't high
Probably try to blow my brains out
Lord knows...
Lord knows!
Lord knows... Jesus...
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin' crazy after dark, these narcs
Be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin' up
I'm gettin' paid, pullin raises on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama
Busta, you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckerss since I lost my momma
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocked, G, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game
Without no doubt I ain't no slouch and it ain't time to back down
So I jumps in and try to stop-a and watch-a
Slap you cock-eyed like Popeye fucks spinach
Forgotten more shit than most crews ever know, or ever knew
Was born with 7 flows and only heaven knew
For beat the boot sex, the news breaks, the you shakes
Worse, they heard we got more nerve than a 2-fake
Yoo-hoo to you crew and you too so you knew
I'm from Jersey and I'm a teen so your block more than you do
Whose the new crew?
Show me your neck brotha, and here's another
Smack your mother's mamma's mother
In the first mob of all those other crack lovers
Back was bitch-ass, trick ass, cluk-clow-cluk-clow
How ya like me then, how ya like me, hey-ho, how ya like me now?
Ow, pow, hurt, don't it? Bow, bow, don't run up on it
The same thing minus P hangin' possies like an exponent
Oh yes, rock in slums, ya gots to run it
It makes no sense to smell like shit
If old ass George could be Washing-tons
Now I be loyal to my niggas on the blocks, just buckin the shots
And packin the glocks
And dodgin the cops, and takin' over niggas spots
Poppin' after poppin' the fools be droppin', the hoes be hoppin
On my thing cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim
You lookin' grim, is it me or him or him
Or be with me, we be together
So what's up? We can do whatever
Cause real niggas stick together
Till they make it up to heaven
Through the stress, through the hell, through the 1-8-7
The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga
The deeper they dig the ditch-a
The Naughty the Treach
Then through to the Pac I brings the glock I wets up
You fuckin' body, I'm like, Oh my Gody
Did I really shoot him? Yo I shot him
So got him, now I puts the crime behind me
And finds me, a place to lays my head low
I lives doin' my rap, but I dies for my hood row
So all you fuckin' fools better recognize, and know my fuckin' name
I be Riddler to my niggas and I'm loyal to the game
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin' crazy after dark, these NARC's
Be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin' up
I'm gettin' paid, pullin razors on niggaz when they runnin' up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cock D, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game
My mama say I'm crazy 'cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggaz swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggaz rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggaz feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin' that he tellin' get to me, no surprise, nigga
Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
I'm like loose rollin', I'm growin' until the diesel hit me
I'm badder than bruised, and madder havin' to choose
'Tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin' I'm talkin' cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin' by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin' back
From him scrappin when niggaz was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
Thugs known to bust on sight
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin' that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggaz in penitentiary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as a shorty was full of car chases
While runnin' with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don of my own crew
A million niggaz with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
'Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches
Nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
Nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
M.O.B.
And you know we keep it money over bitches
I blow you up on the spot, these glocks hot till you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police, peep what these streets do to me
Actin' all new to me I creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin' Crystal, start thinkin' 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the whole world it's Fatal dog against everybody
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
My shit's phenomenal, droppin' like domino
Comin' with the real yo and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggaz nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin G's
My niggas crosstown got keys
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
I'm hittin sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contrived to strive never laggin
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin' up but I don't give a fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin my mind why you sweatin me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin, I hope he awoken
Payin' my own that's tokin chokin off-a glocks smokin'
Money and power watch these bitches 'cause they skanless
Gettin' niggaz fucked 'n' stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops
Gettin' kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin' my money over all my bitches
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
That's right nigga
Money over motherfuckin bitches
MOB. on 'em nigga
Keep your motherfuckin mind on your money, fuck these hoes
You need some motherfuckin money
Get your mind right nigga, keep your game tight
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid fuck the fools
We up out of this bitch here
We gone
Biatch!
Young mothers
That's right
I know how it is
Don't nobody understand
I feel ya
She was born a heavy set girl with pig tails and curls
A heart full of gold, still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans, witnessed a man die
Was only 15, should have been a beauty queen
Still see here crying by the caskets when here parents got killed
Little girl don't cry, 'cause even though they died
You can best believe they watching over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery but look at what you getting
It's a blessing in disguise, when you find out your pregnant
No money, no home, and even though you all alone
You got to do this on your own, so baby go on
I wish you luck and if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand the way it feels when you fighting the world
Facing all this drama when mama's just A little girl
Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Given that she is or not
Time ain't on her side
Mama's just a little girl
She gotta hold her head up high
At 16 what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet black ebony queen
And who could tell she would get pregnant at an early age
Got violated by someone she dated
If this is fate I hate to see the seed she created
So we wait, though it takes time to build the body and the mind
She reclines 9 months then finally its time
What do we find?
A little groaning boy of mine with a tortured soul
Addicted to a life of crime had no time for the growing stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
'Cause mammas acting crazy at the hospital about to have another baby
Like the rose from concrete groaning within
Blessed with twins how the hell can mamma raise 3 men
So we began close as family such insanity
A happy home for one act inhumanity
Plus mamas said the seed was corrupted
Used the rub her belly begging us to breathe if she love us
Now mama sits quiet sipping peppermint schnapps
How could mama bring a thug like me into this world?
She ain't the cause of all the drama cause mommas just a little girl
Mama
Don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Liven if she is or not
Time ain't on her side
Cause ama's just a little girl
She gotta hold her head up high
Now would she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the cane spot
Now look here I see her clutching her son in her arms she hurt
Her heart bleeding as she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfil prophecy but who could stop the grief?
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top of me
Probably be an innocent man but still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse? nothing but pain
Since my birth, taught me functions at the pen
Cause everybody's in paying back society I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watched the drama occur my eyes blurred 'fore I jet it
I wonder why we all have to die before we get it
Though we shed tears so many peers I done buried
Worried and scared knowing I'ma see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world no one cares
No it ain't fair but we all there and do our share
In this land of underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga having g's in hand
Mamma told me not to be a punk
They ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mamma in this world
Cause you know I ain't mad at cha you' just a little girl
See mammas just a little girl
Mama
Don't know why
They asked us why we mutilate eachother like we do
To ask us why we turn from bad to worse, is to ignore from which we came
You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals
On the contrary - we would all celebrate its tenacity, we would all love its will to reach the sun
Well... we are the roses, this is the concrete, and these are my damaged petals
Heeey
It's just me against the world baby
It's just me against the world
Me against the world baby
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin while makin' millions
Witnessin killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children 'cause they're illin
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby
It's just me against the world baby
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stones, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall
Everday there's mo'death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin' sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world baby
It's just me against the world baby
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this supression
They punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world baby
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world baby
Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it
Me against the world
Me against the world
It's just me against the world baby
It's just me against the world
Me against the world baby
Can you picture my prophecy?

Shit, you motherfuckin' right
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, Westside
What! Bring it on
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind
Our childhood years, recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor, father forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin', fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steerin' wheel, blush, while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire, exorcisin' all demons
Mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I can hardly wait...
To bust freely. Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Made the front-page, prime-time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend may be .45 but she still live
One shot makin' niggas heart beats stop
What!
I'm bustin' on you punk-ass niggas - run, nigga, run!
I'm on your ass nigga! Run nigga - duck and hide!
Nigga I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga, yeah! Westside!
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!
My girlfriend - blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made, she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside baby-girl'll always be mine
Picked you up when you was nine
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned .22, it's true
Nothing compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'
Me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realise how to treat ya -
The secret to keep ya -
We closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly; I shoot blind
In time I clock figures
Dropping niggas as we rise
We all souljah's in God eyes
Now it's time for war
Never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid
Sleeping with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang wit' the fellas
I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waiting by the phone
This is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed but you the realest
If you need me, call
I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall
Me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
I love finger fuckin' you
All of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut
Niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours
Behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore
Everything I'm asking for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy, you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin' loud when I tell you, Be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you
So no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone
I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home
Me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this whirlwind
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in the whirlwind
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind

'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend...
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde

Stand in formation
My motherfucking real troopers
Let's do it like soldiers
All in together now
Ready?
Hell yeah
No retreat no surrender
Death before dishonour motherfucker
Do it to them
Come on
Never got thuggish
Yes yes YES
Say whut
Westide eastside ride
Where you at?, where you at?
Where my real thugs?
Where you at?, where you at?
Where my real thugs?
Where you at?, where you at?
Where my real thugs?
The cases of a drug dealer
Real thugs, where you at?
Yo a motherfucking army
Do it to them
Do it to them
They love the way we do it to them
We do it to them
Calvary
Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas now player what it be like?
When will niggas see they got us bleeding with 3 strikes
Can't seem to focus hopeless with violent thoughts
I wrote this got these devils petrified hiding from my hocus pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated clearly click a military mind
May god forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealing from the womb to the block
My live mind got me surviving 5 shots
My 45 got me fortified with live rounds
When shit stick we plot hits when our block spits
All hail out on bail wrath of '2pacalypse'
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw thug niggas never left the boot camp
I'm a nigga for assignment
Skilled in gorilla warfare
And blessed
Work with firearm
My rap shit
Contains sections of bomb sessions
Says I'm responsible for black Smith and Wessons
Putting up on ?? in the military state of mind
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Cocoa Brovas pan the borderline
That's the sound and your dead son
Man to man
Judo stance
First glance
Animal instincts
Intelligence of an assassin
Mask my ninja style
Surround me ready to attack I react swiftly
What father taught me sticks with me
Never forget the methods stick and move strictly
Shit be seeming like its closing in
With no regrets I hold position
'Cause I circles
Picture being put in position to move
And you can't move cause your move is blocked by the knight at 12 O'clock
That's when the madness beings so I start to focusing
And the law that we live by is to stay true to self
Why try everybody lie
About the block true soldier mentality
Stick and move
Time to show what kinda nigga
Move or get moved on
In the days of the strange where nothing stays the same
It's a call for re-adjustment fine tune your positions
What did you change to get a break in the world of snakes
And those who fake elimination I'm facing destruction
Outlaw till I duck down from po po's busting
No one to trust in rushing to the goal line
Catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole mine
No swine I'm a soldier told cha I control mine
Time to take you back into time follow this here
One way out
This black hole
For this black soul
Shit is outta control
I'm fighting for my position
To be a fetus in this world I am entering
And my face is sentencing for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consuming weed
Cause my mom's use to smoke back in the 70's
Maybe that's why in the 90's I drop g's when I drop degrees
When I ease across the block with Pac
And got all you niggas shot
You didn't think Boot Camp click would link
With the outlaw minded If you do you press rewind
And you can peep gorilla tactics in every line
Yeah
And this is how we do it
Where my real thugs?
Where they at?
Let me see my real thugs
Where you at
Wont you see my real thugs
Where you at
Let me see my real thugs
Where you at
Now
Where my real thugs
Let me see where you at
Tell me where my real thugs
Gots to see where you at
Where's my soldiers
Where you at
Where's my real soldiers
Where you at

When Bob Dole and Deloris Tucker wanna know, where my soldiers at
Code Fo'
Layin around sittin' about from Friday morning to Saturday evenings Monday morning x2
They got a nigga shedding tears, reminiscing on my past fears
Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death
My heartless breath, the underlying cause of my arrest
My life is stressed, and no rest forever weary
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm getting worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, 'cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggaz on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutching on a four-five
My neighbourhood ain't the same
Cause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggaz give me props
Forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block
Living life is but a dream
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still pray
But on our block we still pray
Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life
Staying strapped forever strapped in this drug life
God help me, 'cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism 'cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home... on my block
And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know you feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, staying strapped
Fantasies of a nigga living fat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losing focus... on my block
And block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break nine
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers balling
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggaz understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
Trying to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is that everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain
For all the niggaz that I lost to the game... from my block
Me and my closest road dogz
To my dog named Musolini, Big Syke, Thug Life baby
The return of the mashers, you know how we do it
Shit half the times we flaunt cause trouble
My closest road dog it was cool 'cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin' bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty - nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy - haired juveniles, livin' wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, 'cause they was killin' me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin' deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night
Murder murder Mr. Lucifer
Pictures of the devil DUCK when he shoot at cha, it's all political
Runnin' from the future, escapin in the fog
Live yo' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin' through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine
Haha... bring artillery and ROLL with a nigga
They could never take the soul of a M. O. B. soldier nigga
Cowards get rolled up, mob on 'em Makaveli
Boy youse a boss player, that's what all the bitches tell me
Even if I died now
I live my life eternally and never lie down, why cry now?
Fooled a few but never 'came a gamer, ain't tryin' to hear it
Evil spirits hide at total strangers, yo' life's in danger
Prepare nigga be aware, 'cause we ain't scared
M. O. B., till I die, when we ride niggaz disappear
Fill 'em up with pistol smoke
Never forget to blow a hole in his head
For leakin information to the feds
The burnin bed was the tellin' sign
Two hired guns bustin' everyone, yellin' everybody die
Why the fuck they fuck around, we left 'em in the fog
Bleedin like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz
Fuck they feelings, that's what they get for squealin
That's the pressures of a gangsta, dangerous this drug dealin'
See me in physical form, my niggaz swarm
Take the figure of a circle beatin' jealous niggaz till they purple
Simon Says take they heads homies
And send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
Fishin for fake niggaz, observe and shake niggaz
The only way to see six figures, is break niggaz
Me and Musolini set to ride we high
Big Bogart got the alibi if homicide ask us way
Labelled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe
To live and die as a millionaire, on...
Set to explode, my M. O., is kill them hoes
My pistol's like a disease, my enemies and foes
Get murdered and disposed of, we in the fog
Makaveli the Don, and my closest road dogz
Niggas!
Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
Fuck the law, rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine, cross the line, my two nines
Go baya baya when I shoot 'em
Korean mothafuckers was crooked, so niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night
My Niggas! Straight take his life
So don't sleep when my Jeep creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip 'cause we did 'em
Lickin' of shots for Latasha that's proper
Love for my niggas but a glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now
I packed a .9 last year, in '99 I'm packin' 2 now
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
Niggas!
My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is head shots
Your last words'll be, damn what's all these red dots?
Niggas nowawadays, they worry me, my bars is therapy
As long as you usin' them thouroughly, muah till the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably will ever be
And I'm a product of the '70's
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eatin' with you, I'm probably beefin' with you
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin' with you
I know you got a gun but I'm hopin' you keep it with you
'Cause unfortunately, I'm one of them rappers that keep a pistol and
You know what the llama do, Shady/Aftermath, Ruff Ryders, D-Block, and of course Amaru
Lotta people honor you, probably 'cause of the way you used to bring the drama to
Whoever you wanted to, you a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But anyway, life goes on, so I'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do
Niggas!
Now of course I want peace on the streets
But realisticly
Painting perfect pictures ain't never work
My misery was so deep
Couldn't sleep through all my preasures
My quest for cash
I learned fast
Using violent measures
Memorys of adolescent years
Their was unity
But after puperty we brought war
To our community
So many bodies dropping
Its got to stop
I want to help
But still I'm stepping
Keeping my weapon
Must protect myself
Promise of a better tomorrow
Ain't never reach me
Plus my teachers were to petrfied in class to teach me
Sipping thunderbird
And grape kool-aid
Calling Earl since my stomach was empty
It seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil homiez
Lose there childhood to guns
Nobody cries no more
'Cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace
If you can't grant it
Niggas fighting across the whole planet
So we can never be peace
Will never be peace
Or all we all just headed for doom
Still consumed by the beefs
And I'll know there never be peace
That's why I keep my
Pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there never be peace
No time to rest
They stressed out
I can't remember the days my homie was here
Now a days we live in fear
The stuggle is still here
So now who's grabbing there strap
Who's getting bucked wild
Representing the generation of killers
When I was a child had many dreams
Reality kept me and my homiez stressing
Tyring to raise my baby girl to be the strongest
Know when I'm doing wrongest
I never had a bright day
Just drunkless smoking blunts
Getting faded
Wishing my partna made it
If it was peace
Or ????????
I know there will never be
All my tears were shed
When I lost my homie number three
It's getting harder to see
Impossibilty should we just face it
Can't get through the pain
But still I can't erase it
So many trials and tribulations
Things we facing
Wicked days
Can't see no brighter days
It's time to chase it
Cross dreams
Cause the scene is when you never get by
That's why I got to stay high
You'll never know when you'll die
My heart will never leave the ghetto
I know to rise only in peace
That's why I say
There ain't never going to be no peace
Will never be peace
Or all we all just headed for doom
Still consumed by the beefs
And I'll know there never be peace
That's why I keep my
Pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there never be peace
Living life lonely
But I can't even cry
Cause visions of diseption
All around me
Got my eyes full of despise
Who can I trust
Why even try
They say the world is mine
But I know that's a lie
Living to die
Set up from birth
Steady dreaming
Wishing for better days
But all I see is demons
Close my eyes
Reminisence of my childhood
All I felt was pain from my arrival
No memories of nothing nice
Nothing but blinded reminders of my future life
I'm freaking out
I'm getting closer to that other level
Will I be strong with game
Or just the heartless devil
I hope I'm able to find peace in me
Cause there's a storm sixty four inches deep in me
And I try to do the right thing
But it's the wrong thing
That seems to bring me right back
To this dirty game
There never be peace
Fuck peace
Will never be peace
Or all we all just headed for doom
Still consumed by the beefs
And I'll know there never be peace
That's why I keep my
Pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there never be peace
Shit fuck peace, on the strength to my niggas get a peace, we can't
Have
Peace, how the fuck we gonna live happy when we ain't got none, tear
Drops and closed caskets, these mothafuckas are smiling but don't mean
Much, why 'cause I got to be a thug, see drugs gonna turn this
Mothafuckn
Head out, all us niggas acting up, wild ass mothafuckn adolescent,
These
Niggas ain't got a childhood no more, how the fuck can you have a
Childhood when your at the funeral every fuckn weekend, you

Gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself, in his position but remain silent
I get to thinking 'bout the shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin, that got the both of us in trouble
But you you always stay down for a nigga so that's why I love you
Reminiscing needing tissues fighting over childish issues,
Swear I can't live with you but without you everyday I miss you
Word on roll you hold my pistol
My gangster bitch that you always in the mood for love
That's why I'm sleeping with you
Though not the man of your dreams, my planted schemes to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free
I see, yesterday I called you names, and played games on your mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world so girl just be a friend
I swear I'll 'Never Call you Bitch Again'
And that's my word
We came too far
To throw it all away
We came way too far pretty thing yeah
Do it all away, do it all away baby ...
I wake up early in the morning, at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawning, and now I'm gone
Trying to get my money on strong so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts
They envy me, plus we've been beefing with the east coast
Two casualties, got stopped in traffic
Had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed they ain't knowing
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards going
You paid bail got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Crystal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic 'cause we forged to top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend

Waiting to exhale while I'm sitting in the county jail
Keep your head up, cause things are getting better
My cell mate shed tears off your last love letter
Told him you would find a friend so keep your eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss, but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust, and if I bust, will she snitch?
Even though your not the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the board for a third time hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissing in the living room in the nude
Thanks for being there much more than a friend

So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Ain't nothin' hard about it why you lookin' sad? Shoulda though about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggaz up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom Perignon
Knowin' I'm a cash getter still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me; plus you was smilin' till the bill miss me
That's what you get for tryin' to dick me
Missed me with that Buy me this, buy me that syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin' mad 'cause I cursed and I scream I hate'cha
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me?
Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
But that's a thug's nature
I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tongue - kissin', you was truly with it
Little ecstacy, Hennesey, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggaz at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin walls till them bastard drop
Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite
Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!
Haha... started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin for creamin - bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' till I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly

Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God

Last year we was lettin these niggaz kick up dust
This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust
Thug Life nigga Westsiiiiide!
Straight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin' Hennesey, smokin' weed
Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
Had a partner named Snoop, loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shooting craps in the alley till they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies but don't waste it all
Oooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Having house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
Everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
Lookin' dumb, cause you waitin for your chance to hump
Straight grindin, everybody havin' fun
And it's cool till a fool pull a loaded gun
Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool now the party's over
Gun shots rang like it's thunder
And everybody bum rushing and I'm rushing to get a number
Says she got a man but she's lying
Why? I seen her talking to this other guy and...
He's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I ain't trippin' I just hope he get em, I got nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
Cause uh, old man still drinkin', his breath still stinkin
He'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin'
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin' here longer what that tell ya?
And little girls playin' double dutch
Still blush, 'cause she don't get in trouble much
It's uh, ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin' stick ball, quick y'all
Get out the street before they hit y'all
And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
'Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers getting rich slangin crack to folks
And the square's getting big for these sack of dope
Started thinking 'bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
Till the dealer on the block told me, That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tryed to make my way legit, haha
But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinking, since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin' like a waste, tears rollin' down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nothing but family, straight up down for me
Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out 
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out 
Pray to my God everyday but he don't listen 
The poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen 
Listen I can hear her crying in the bedroom 
Praying for money we never think would she be dead soon 
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else 
At 13 can't feed myself 
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me 
Wish he would've helped me 
Too much like him 'til my mama don't love me 
On my own at a early age gettin' paid 
And I'm strapped so I'll never be afraid 
Where did I go astray I'm hanging in the back streets 
Running with G's and dope fiends will they jack me? 
Can't turn back my eyes on the prize 
I got nothing to lose 
Everybody gotta die 
Say good-bye to the bad guy 
That one you fucked when you passed by 
Tempered glass fly 
Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes 
And you'd be crazy too 
With nothing to lose 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 
I thank the Lord for my many blessings 
Though I'm stressin' keep a vest for protection 
From the barrel of the Smith & Wesson 
And all my niggas in the pen' 
Here we go again 
Ain't nothing separating us from a mack 10 
Born in the ghetto as a hustla' older 
Straight soldier bucking at them bustas 
No matter how you try niggas never die 
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply 
See me striking down the block hittin' co'ners 
Mobbin' like a motherfucka' livin' like I want to 
Ain't no stoppin' at the red lights I'm sideways 
Thug Life muthafucka criiime pays 
Let the cops put they lights on 
Chase me nigga 
Zig-zaggin' through the freeway 
Race me nigga 
In a high speed chase with the law 
The realest muthafucka that you ever saw 
I'm livin' raw 'til they bury me don't worry me 
I'm high livin' like I ain't afraid to die 
And you could walk a mile in my shoes 
And you'd be crazy too 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 
Ain't no escape from a deadly fate 
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away 
I'm startin' to lose hope 
It seems everybody's on dope 
Mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke 
Sometimes I choke on the indo 
Peepin' out the window alone on my own 
I'm a criminal 
Got no love from the household I'm out cold 
In the streets give me motherfuckin' peace 
I got nothing to lose 
And something to prove 
What do I do live Thug Life nigga stay true 
I wonder when they kill me 
Is there a Heaven for a real G 
Lord forgive me if you feel me 
'Cause all my life I was dirt broke 
With no hope lil' skinny muthafucka wantin' dough 
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade 
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid 
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city 
No pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time 
If you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too 
With nothing to lose 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga 
We be the craziest, motherfucka'!
You know! 
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga 
We be the craziest!
Here we go; we gonna send this one out to the old school
All these motherfuckers in the Bronx, and Brooklyn, and Staten Island
Queens, and all the motherfuckers that laid it down, the foundation
Ya know what I'msayin? Nuttin but love for the old school
That's who we gon' do this one for, ya feel me?
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nothin' like the old school/ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
I remember Mr. Magic, FLASH, Grandmaster Caz
LL raisin' hell but, that didn't last
Eric B. & Rakim was, the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D
And Red Alert was puttin' in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill gettin' ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal, remember Raw, with Daddy Kane
When De La Soul was puttin' potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin' buzzed, cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggi don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic
Remember Push It was the bomb shit, nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Heheheh, it ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Yeaheheh, it ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Heheh... I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playin' skelly, ring to leavey, or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch, I remember
Way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin uptown, freestylin'
With some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin'
'Cause the hoochies was starin', thinkin', Why them niggas swearin'?
I'm wonderin if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall
Or takin' leaks on the steps, stinkin up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin' to stay away from Riker's Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin' to keep it true
Out on the roof sippin 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Heheheyah, that's right, it ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Hahah... remember poppin' and lockin to Kurtis Blow, the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Hoe back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin' La Di Da Di
Gamin the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties, I remem-ber
Breakdancin to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV, about to hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful don't let the transit cops see me
It ain't nuttin like the old school
It ain't nuttin like the old school
Hahahah, it ain't nuttin like the old school
Hey, heheaha, on the real though, ain't nuttin like the old school
Remember seein Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin party?
Member how fuckers used to go, Is Brooklyn in the house?
And motherfuckers would lose they GOD DAMN MIND
I remember goin' places that motherfuckers was scared to say
They was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfuckin old school nigga
Remember skelly nigga? Knockin' niggaz out the box, poppin' boxes?
Member stickball? Member niggaz to run that shit like that?
Member the block members screamin up at your mom from the window?
The ice cream truck, member all the mother...
Member the Italian icey's yo?
Yo remember the Italian icey's the Spanish niggaz comin' down
With the coconut icey's and shit?
I came through the door, said it before
That was the SHIT
Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming
'Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
'Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open free, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We can...
Only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take
There's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps and that's all it takes
You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't
Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I ain't hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow,
As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me
And that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free to this day
The game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts and your minds
We will never die
We are forever alive
And we continue growing...
One day at a time
Don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and light
Searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest.
Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
And kids think beef is the only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of him die, but makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun
And no pity with guns
And when your money is up
That's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back
Would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains
I spent my whole life, fighting myself
That I can't win so I'm inviting some help
And every now and then I take rights from left
I'm still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
And that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope god
Take a like to myself
I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm trying to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
And we continue growin'...
...One day at a time. Damn!
Pssst... psssssst... aiyyo
Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever
Tell me, which one?
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry
Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me unfortunately 'cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless -- I'm chokin off
Marijuana smoke, with every toke it's like I'm losin focus
Fallin' to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin, and goin' nutty
And reminiscin 'bout them niggaz that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money
Where am I goin' I discovered, can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it
Everybody's dyin' am I next, who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin', two to the head
While I'm in bed, leakin blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller? I'm gettin' suspicious
Of this bitch the line busy every time I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin' all her homies -- that I can fuck her
Like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennesey I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass
By me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh
I put up my middle finger then I dash
Niggaz don't like me 'cause I'm Thuggin', and every day
I'm a hustler lookin' to get paid
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost 'cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay Thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound... well Hell
Can't be worse than this, 'cause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you I don't want to, but I will
See motherfuckers killed over green bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack
I love it cause in heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin' you now, you motherfuckers don't know me
Only fear of death... You ghetto niggaz
Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated
Hahaha, I ain't scared to die
I ain't scared to die
To my homies in heaven
I ain't scared to die
Do you wanna live forever?
Are you scared, to die?
Or will you scream, when you fry?
I don't fear death
My only fear of death is comin' back, reincarnated
This is dedicated to Mental, R.I.P.
And Big Kill, R.I.P.
And all you other O.G.'s, who go down
I don't fear death
Only God can judge me, is that right?
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious, 'cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin' got me knockin' on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
Only God can judge me
And only God can
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Flatline!
Screamin I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies
I wake up strangled in, dangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery talkin' to the, dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin' round strapped
Mista, Po-lice, please try to see that there's
A million motherfuckers stressin just like me
Only God can judge me
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
Let me live baby, let me live
Pac I feel ya, keep servin' it on the rilla
For instance say a playa hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin' wearin a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want em
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggaz, You can fade him, punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
To get your safe, knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise
Guess you figure you know me 'cause I'm a Thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me
My only fear of death is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated
That's for the homey mental
We up out
All right now, here we go
Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
And freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high till I die, my competion's zero
'Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey
I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust?
Got my mama stressin thinkin' it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin', fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up
And recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
Over the fence and open fire
All right now, here we go
These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin' round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin' ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin' up, 'cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin' outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away 'cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin' loogies
At the coppers that pursue me, beotch!
I be a hustler till it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas
All right now, here we go
Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin' bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin'
Droppin' keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety, ah shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin' tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!
Hahahaha, Thug Life!
Oh, I posted bail?
I'm out this motherfucker?
I can go?
Oh, fuck y'all eh, fuck the judge
Fuck all y'all
'Cause I'm out on motherfuckin' bail
Y'all ain't never gonna see me in this motherfucker again
Drop that shit em!
Let these old punk ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
Niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches
I'm stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail if I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk 'cause I'm rappin'
They askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my glock cause its major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone that's my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures and make me some more riches
To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
I'm a thug I was raised in jail
Now I'm out on bail
Stuck in jail and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild through the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart 'cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
And sellin' products to the addicts 'cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I gotta lotta love
Hangin' out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me then it's on G
Got me sittin' in the cell a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me and the shit ull get better
I don't believe her 'cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
'Cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
I'm on bail
Out on Bail
Out on bail
I'll see ya motherfuckers at the next show, 2pac, the media is my bitch
It's that famous shit, you know?
Real thug shit
Real live thug shit, genuine, you know what I'm sayin'
I wouldn't waste your motherfuckin' time with no bullshit baby
Trust me, It's that real shit
I'm talkin' about that shit you never tell your grandkids about, you know?
I ran with a thug nigga, believe that
This my motherfuckin' nigga Em on dem motherfuckin' boards in case your wonderin'
We doin' this shit hell motherfuckin' yeah
An ounze of that shit sittin' in your motherfuckin' lac
Now press rewind nigga!
That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?
Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
Preoccupied with homicide, tryin' to survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require many closed caskets
Who can you blame? It's insane what we dare do
Witnessin evil that these men do, bitches sin too
In fact they be the reasons niggaz get to bleedin
For the fuckin' fire when I leave em, you shoulda seen em
And snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a
Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Excersisin, visualizin, everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggaz in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? and if we fail?
High speeds, and thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drivebys and niggaz die, murder without a motive
By making motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryin' to hover over niggaz till we drop
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, 'cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
Motherfuckers is crooked, is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin' an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a
Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggaz lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggaz bodies put to rest
So I just... swallow my Beck's and holla, Fuck em!
And if I'm next... just let a nigga step with somethin'
I ain't fearin nuttin
Young and thuggin', prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggaz can't get the best of me
'Cause when I bust 'em they gonna shiver, the killer squad soldiers
Got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?
Talkin' bout prayin' -- they need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggaz sprayin up my block, tryin' to take my wealth
Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggaz run the streets
Hahah, it ain't nuttin but muuuuzik
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin' REAL strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin' dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
But all I see is motherfuckers actin' less than G's
Stop bein a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
Cause you know these streets is real deal
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket
Jealous, motherfuckin bastards
I never die, thug niggaz multiply
Cause after me is Thug Life baby
Then the young thugs

It's that new 'Pac y'all
Pac's life
Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life
What do you know about Pac's life
Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life
Started with five shots, niggas plotting to kill him
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits
Dodging cop cars look how we come so far
Picture a high school drop out
Rolling a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out
So when trouble tried to find me can't
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change
It comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night
Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas
Conversating on my life
Mind your motherfucking business
I remember that
Ay
What's happening Pac
Yeah I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through
Meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for for nothing it was shame to see
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see
Now they all in the court room blaming me
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's
With the same sort of dude with he same short fuse
I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass
Nigga you scary
I been knowing you for years
We was high school peers
In Junior High
I was itching' to kill
And you was, 'Ready To Die'
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry
Still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd
And motherfucker's die
It's not the way I wanna live
My nigga it's how it is
Only real niggas stay on top
Why are all you niggas all up in my shit?
Tell them motherfucker's

Pac's theme
I was raised in this society so there's no way
You can expect me to be a perfect person 'cause I'm a do what I'm a do.
That's how I feel I'm a do whatever I like. I am not a role model
As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated scheme
To get us locked up shot up or back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history a mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty's a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man 'cause I'm strong and bold
With this gun full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation in this new nation
All you gave my people was our patience
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now I'm sitting here mad 'cause I'm unemployed
But the government's glad 'cause they enjoy it
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power from the strength that resides within
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
The rich get richer and the poor take less
The American Dream was an American nightmare
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out
With signs drew they know no blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
But now we're impatient
Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out
Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are
It's ya panther power that makes you a star
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
My Mother never let me forget my history
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know the true facts about my history
I couldn't settle for being a statistic
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic
Government cause it was meant to hold us back
Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
In my community they killed the unity
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity
I strike America like a case of hard disease
Panther power is running through my arteries
Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
'Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?
You think you living free don't let me laugh at you
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
Cause some time has passed seem you all forget
There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculate schemes
To get us locked up shot up or back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names

Daddy's home...
Heh, so??
You say that like that means somethin' to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
We been gettin' along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS... fuck you!
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin' sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...
I'm so sorry
For all this time
I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!
Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin' a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother
Moms can't stand me 'cause I'm lookin' like my father
Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin' care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother
Look at mama's lonely smile
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...
I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time
I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And oh -I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin' kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin', Jack
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that wanna be your father shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G
Now that that I finally found you, stay the Fuck away from me
You're so sorry...
I'm so sorry
For all this time, so sorry baby!
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger
If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast
But livin' slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin' time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the type you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...
She's a part time
A part time
Part time

Meet Cindi, she's twenty-two, lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic-Tac
Now what's that say about, this big epidemic
This hypocritical world, and the people in it
Now speaking of in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
Fuck with a smile single file she'll bust nuff styles
That would be cool, if she was your lover
But fuck that, Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
'Cause moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days, had me fiending for a hot meal
Now I'm a crook, got steel, I do not feel
So don't even trip, when I flip, with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a bitch, and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mutha, I'm touched
When moms come by, niggaz hush or get rushed
Maybe one day she'll recover
But what will it take, to shake, or break
My part time mutha
I gotta live with a part time
A part time
A part time
A part time
A part time
I grew up in a home where no one liked me
Moms would hit the pipe, everynight, she would fight me
Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest
He's feeling on my chest, with his hand in my dress
Just another pest, and yes I was nervous
Blood sensor tests, I just don't deserve this
I wanna tell mom, but would she listen
She's bound to be bitchin if she hasn't got a fix in
So... now I lay me down to sleep
Lord don't let him rape me
If he does my soul to keep
Don't let the devil take me
Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom
Thinkin' how my step dad, raped me in the bathroom
Every day I make class, and yet I'm missing periods
The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm fearing it
I gotta tell mom, before she sees me
I told her how he G'd me, and she didn't believe me
Callin me a slut 'cause my butt's kinda big so
Still that ain't no way to be talkin' to your kids though
I can't believe the way you call it
Gotta believe in him, and dissin her own daughter
Time for me to break and find another
That's when I discovered
The ways of the days of a part time mutha
I got a part time
A part time
A part time
Part time
A part time
A part time mutha
I rush to tend her, talked as I touch her
She blushed, the clothes came off, and I bust her
I'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block
Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cot
She's gone, and I'm thinkin' that my game's so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is hell no
'Cause she came back with the kid and yo
I been payin' ever since
The clothes the food the cars and oh the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me list in the first place
So I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I can't dream anymore
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha
And I, change the diapers and clean the shit
The tables are turned I can't take this
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha
A part time
A part time mutha
Now I'm a part time mutha
A part time
A part time
Part time
She's a part time
A part time mutha
He's a part time mutha
A part time
A part time
A part time
Part time mutha
A part time
A part time mutha
Pa-pa-pa-part time
Pa-pa-pa-part time...

Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Cold bustas!
Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federals wanna see me dead - niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands is swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'
Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Pictue me rollin'
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?
I got ki's coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug breded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start bang banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin'!
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some balding-ass niggas and they slipping in my spot
Checking in the park, 'Pac
We caught 'em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin' roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there

All you bitch ass C.O.'s

Picture me rollin' nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day
You can't stop me
You know I got my niggas up in this motherfucker
Manute, Pain, Syke, Mopreme
Can you picture us rolling?
Can you see me ho?
Is y'all ready for me? ... We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again
Rewind this track right here, close your eyes
And picture me rollin'
Clear enough for ya?
Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Cold bustas!
Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federals wanna see me dead - niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands is swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'
Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Pictue me rollin'
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?
I got ki's coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug breded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start bang banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin'!
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some balding-ass niggas and they slipping in my spot
Checking in the park, 'Pac
We caught 'em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin' roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there
I just could not forget about
I wanna make sure they can see me
All you bitch ass C.O.'s
Can you niggas see me from there?
Ballin on y'all punk ass!
Picture me rollin', baby
Yeah, all them niggas up in them cell blocks
I told y'all niggas when I come home it's on
That's right nigga, picture me rollin'
Oh, I forgot! The D.A
Yeah, that bitch had a lot to talk about in court
Can the ho see me from here?
Can you see me, ho?
Picture me rollin'
And all you punk police -- can you see me?
Am I clear to you?
Picture me rollin' nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day
You can't stop me
You know I got my niggas up in this motherfucker
Manute, Pain, Syke, Mopreme
Can you picture us rolling?
Can you see me ho?
Is y'all ready for me? ... We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again
Rewind this track right here, close your eyes
And picture me rollin'
Like watchin picture's in hazy vision
Tonight it's love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we satisfy, yesterday was stolen kisses
Blind insanity perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the death of me, had they plans for me
If I have kids, will I live to see em' grow
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go with broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Vision's in prison's, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven 'cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eye's and see nothin' but pain
The world's crazy, still lookin' for a queen
To plant seed's and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one, or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious,
If you play your cards right
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on, who
Who'll be the one who'll be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water we won't leave until the mornin'
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more
No one else can do, what you do for me
Take me away from the pain, I feel inside
And it's gonna be all right, and it'll be okay
If we try and take our time, yes baby, take our time
And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one whooo
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on, who
Who'll be the one who'll be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water, we won't leave until the mornin'
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more
Gotta play your cards right on one
Can't be rushin like it's a race, you know what I'm sayin'
If you be patient and take your time
And you finesse it
9 times out of 10 homeboy, you gonna wake up wit ya breakfast in bed
Play your cards right nigga, take your time, be patient
Go slow, it's better that way
You ain't heard?
Playa cards right
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on, who
Who'll be the one who'll be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water, we won't leave until the mornin'
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more
You got to be patient man, be patient
Bring some roses or sometihin ya know
Play some soft shit,
Got ta be patient, you gotta playa cards right on one
Can't be rushin like it's a race, you know what I'm sayin'
If you be patient and take your time
And you finesse it
Scott Storch
Why'd you sland crack? I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin' bills
Crazy, I gotta look at what you gave me, claimin I'ma criminal when you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in the holocaust headin for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war, and got a busted jaw for sayin' fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm mad, check the record
What's a nigga gotta do to get respected
Sometimes I think I'm getting tested, and if I don't say yes a nigga quick to get arrested
Restless
Walkin' round ready to light shit up, because my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up, other niggas pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga be a killer, I used to be a dealer but they wanted to see whos realer
Now them same mother fuckas wanna murder me, and I wonder if the lord ever heard of me
I need loot, so I'm doin' what I do, and don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes,
There's no other destiny to choose, I had nothing left to lose, so I'm singin' the po nigga blues
Coppin these brand new shoes, but what the fuck can a nigga do, my little boy gotta eat too
So why must I sock a fella? Just live large like rocafella
And did you ever stop to think? I'm old enough to go to war but I ain't old enough to drink
Cops wanna hit me with the book, and you hooked on my I don't give a fuck look
Makin' rules, I'ma break em, no matter how much you make em, show me bakin, I'ma take em
So don't you ever temp me, I'm a fool for mine nigga, and my pockets stay empty
To my brother in the barrio, you livin' worse then the niggas in ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion, you got love for the niggas in my section
You got problems with the punk police, don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me
We ain't free, I'll be damned if I played a chip for a blonde haired blue eyed Caucasian bitch
Down with my home boy rich, fuck a snitch and groupie ass bitch
And you wonder why we blazin' niggas, 'cause you punks haven babies can't raise the niggas
And they damned to be fuck ups too, drink 40s of brew, singin' the nigga blues
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
And now I'm headin for the mother fuck in PEN
Ah yeah, they love to point the finger
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
I thought I hit rock bottom, they ban my album, point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggaz need guns too
Wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
Them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin' major paid
But when I get my check they takin' tax out
So, we payin' for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin' rich
Whoopin on thugs and robbin drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell 'em your soul or they'll be on ya till a niggaz ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a law suit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin ass marks in the park
For tryin' to earn they stripes in the dark
Only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
As I run up on 'em madman, a nutcase with a screw loose
A zoot troupe full of foolies with toolies
Niggaz run to me don't come to me with beef
Take your jewels and your jeep, boom boom! Let that ass sleep
It's gettin' hectic, niggaz run, quick
Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggaz on the block tryin' to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin' to sleep
I'm steady pumpin bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to bustin', nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no
A quick flurry and he's buried with a swelled jaw
I came up from the amateurs to pro hits
At 5-0, so you know I take no shit
And everybody wants to kill a bringer
Of bad news, so they choose, to point the finga
One two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess till I'm ill, still feel me?
I say one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up
Best to duck or get fucked for your bucks
Scream one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
I can't give up, it's a black thang
And I ain't goin' back to the crack game
Bitches, let 'em point the finga
Snitches, let 'em point the finga
Yo, one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
I guess nobody loves a rap singer
Yeah
Pour out a little liquor for your homies, nigga
This one here go out to my nigga Mike Coolie
How you come up, man?
I started young kickin' dust and livin' rough
You watch you mouth around my mama, you couldn't cuss, man
I had a down ass homie though we ran the streets
And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh
I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five
We drinkin' forties, lil' shorties livin' naughty lives
You couldn't stop us, long as I got my glock, fuck the coppers
Hangin' on the block, slangin' rocks and makin' profits
I couldn't fuck with the school life, I was a fool
I'll play that motherfucker for a tool man
Tonight'll be the night that's what we figurin'
Hustlin' in the rain felt no pain 'cause we drinkin'
Playin' them hoes like manure
First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck, that's how we do it
It's two niggaz comin' up out the hood
Livin' life just as good as we could
But since a bitch can't be trusted
Hoes snitched to the police, now my nigga's busted
The cops whoopin' on my nigga in jail
Tryin' to get a motherfucker to tell
And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga, pour out a little liquor
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
This goes out to all you so called G's
Pour out a little liquor for your real motherfuckin' partners
Don't let the drink get like that y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor, pour out a little liquor
What's that you drinkin' on?
Drinkin' on gin, smokin' on blunts and it's on
Reminisce about my niggaz, that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
'Cause I'm losin' all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin' with them suckers till my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me, Son, there'll be days like this
Don't wanna think so, I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein' big time G's
Rolling in marked cars, movin' them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get to' down for my niggaz in the pen, yo
Your son's gettin' big and strong
And I'd love 'em like one of my own, till you come home
And the years sure fly with the quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin' yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be
Homie, if it was me, you'd do the shit for me
Homie, I can remember scrapin' back to back
Throwin' dogs on them suckers runnin' up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let ya know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
Look at you
Drinkin' got you where you don't even give respect to your partners
Pour out some liquor, nigga
It ain't like that, tip that shit over
Pour out a little liquor
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
This for my nigga Madman, Dagz, Hood, Silk, yeah
A little liquor for my homies y'all
We in this motherfuckin' piece, yeah
Pour out a little liquor, Young Queen, yeah
This one goes out to all my mack partners
Back in the motherfuckin' Bay
Oaktown still in the motherfuckin' house
My nigga Richie Rich, Gov'na
All my real motherfuckin' partners
And all my real partnas in Marin, fuck you busta ass niggaz
Yeah nigga, pour out a little liquor
Now up and at 'em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And Mama told me be a Thug since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a, killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin, never heard my friends callin
Couldn't stop myself from fallin', I'm all in
Shit's gettin' sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin from the gun yellin', 'One-Time'
Take your time to feel my record, and if you did
Chill a second, my blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone, R U Still Down?
Raise 'em up... R U Still Down?
I'm gettin' high, so a nigga think he touch the sky
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin' life as a Thug time to face the truth
What's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God
And got a nigga goin' crazy
I can't read the signs, I'm blind, but a nigga know
He need his nine, cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
And my niggaz on the streets, man listen
Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way I'ma bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay
It seems I can't find my focus, and homey I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, its hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin' lace niggaz with the game
Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but R U Still Down
I wrote this for my critics and my, enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh REMEMBER ME
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail
Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a living Hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped, and mercy Lord
Come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone, and so I'm angry
I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, Baby it's on
And now I'm hustlin and bustlin bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin' cheese
Buyin all the things on TV, and gettin' skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin' wild through the town
Please tell me, R U Still Down?
R U Still Down, to raise 'em up?
R U Still Down, to raise 'em up?
R U Still Down, to raise 'em up?
That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin middle finger
RAISSSSE 'em up
These hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?
Thug Life, niggaz, be, the sickest
You feel me? Now get that shit written down
God damn!
Took four years and a motherfuckin case for these motherfuckers to feel me
Ain't that a bitch?
R U Still motherfucking down?
Old hoe ass fake ass niggaz
We out this motherfucker
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
I'm smokin' these niggas like they endo
Breakin 'em like they windows
And still they rip till they get a whiff
Of this shit that I kick
And if they ever had a notion to stop me
Treat your best shot and get dropped
With your posse, nigga I got the ?mott?
I'm takin' 'em out, a lot I got
More than you could pop
I'm rockin' the spot, so now they jock
Dump 'em and get dropped
2Pac ain't tryin' to hear it, Ox
Screamin at your box
I'm swearin at ya not so uh
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Better have a bat or a gat to defeat me
Nigga, I'm a whole posse rolled into one shot
Takin' on your gat while your girl gets hot and rocks the spot
Fear funky flavor with the gift that only God gave
Hold it to my grave
I'd rather die than be a slave
Slaves come as dope dealers
Some come as addicts
Some come to run while the others cause static
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
I'm comin' up outta the cut
Sendin slugs to the guts
I'm bustin' up outta the page 'cause they got me locked up
I'm tryin' to survive but there's too many playa hatin' haters
Always want static, like boom holla at ya later
Homie this ain't no love in this town that I come from
Niggas be wantin funkin then I stomp em, they don't want none
Girls be on my jock and they playin' me for that
But fool I can't help it 'cause I was raised up like a mack
Jealous because I'm black, Jack wanna jack me
And Jill wants to marry me and watch the Klan bury me
Got to pack the steel for the personal protection
AK, 45's, assault rifles, Smith and Wesson
I'm no longer stressin
Learnin, gotta live long
Get a bag a spliffs for the homies, blaze up all of these
But if you wanna flex, get in my Kool Aid punks, raise up offa
These
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just back the fuck up of me, 'cause you can't get none a these
It's that OG female comin' straight up out the PP's
So step to the side then raise the fuck up off me, brah
'Cause if I take it to that level I'ma light this motherfucker up
Now it's on you, you better try to lose your shit
'Cause if you don't, trust me I got you trick
You better try to choose it and lose it
Stay outta mine 'fore this shit get way stupid
These niggas I fuck with believe in passin gats
Can't leave hoe, without my strap
Not givin' a fuck about nothin'
Slidin through the spot with my face mask muggin
Lookin' motherfuckers up and down
It ain't a future in your frontin
Why these fat niggas floatin around?
What happened to them real motherfuckin G's?
Fake motherfuckers need to raise up offa these
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
It's time for me to uh regulate
You feel me?
You fuckin' wit niggaz that's insecure, watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me till you sure
I ain't beggin just tryin' to relocate between ya legs
Drippin wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight beggin to sex me got you undressin to test me and uh...
Shut me down if ya want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharin skirts
I hopin you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is bangin' got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of tryin' to make my songs pay
Makin' love all day against the wall in the hallway
Ya fantasies come alive, ya heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this Thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a Thug in your life
Cause busters ain't lovin' you right
Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see ya blushin like ya want somethin', come get a taste
Of Amerikaz Most Wanted and let's get into some touchin, erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of bustin' until you learn ya lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass
You can ride out the spoke coke, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga whose spoke coke can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we wind and grind
And when I'm on the field keep him on the sidelines
Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got ya naked
Totally sweatin, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissin' till yo' head swang, I'm so into you
Witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know, now scream my name out
Do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss playa, freaky motherfucker, can I dig
Uh, it's on and poppin', now you see what I was seein
Why yo' eyes rollin', Luke seen ya girl I ain't goin'
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stresed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold da boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm goin' home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You in the presence of a playa, I'd rather be ya nigga
Hear me! Boo-yaow!
What type nigga be a Thug Life nigga?
There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggaz die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin' drunk to keep from goin' under
Gettin' lost in the madness, blunted gettin' tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin, Lord come and get me
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin my clip, I'm watchin every bullet spit when I kick em
Niggaz die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggaz that's caught
Had a motherfuckin ward but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon
It's all about makin' money, gettin' yours
And knockin' coppers off the motherfuckin planet
Word to the motherfuckin nine nigga
We gonna make this motherfucker ours
If they don't feel me, they gon kill me
After all this shit I did with my Mac-11
Did I sell my soul? Mama woulda saved me
That's the way that daddy raised me
Oh God, help me I'm losin it
So fuck it! Take me I'm doin' it!
I need to change and look for a better way
I got a hundred round clip to my AK
Committin sins I might die in vain
So fuck it! We'll live off the street fame!
God didn't send me in the right direction
I'm gettin' hit by a diesel in the intersection
Till then I'ma smoke motherfuckers
Things wouldn't be so bad
If we got the things that we never had, I'm ready for whatever
Big ballin-ass Syke
Yeah nigga, you schooled them young bustas
On how it is to be a real motherfuckin G
In the nine-trey motherfuckers is dyin' daily so you best be packin
Dear mama I know you worry 'cause I'm hardly at home
Every other night in jail, got you patient by the phone
Wanna shake it 'cause I can't take it got me livin' in Hell
Like I'm walkin' with a secret that'll kill me if I tell
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
Not to the brain, going insane, just a part of the game
So much caine in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
And let the devil feel the wrath of a nigga
Goin' to Hell with my finger on the trigger
Now everybody's starin'
Got a nigga losin hair and they wonder if I'm all there
Well don't blame me, blame the flame that flickers
Now tell me if you wanna live forever

In the city wit' no pity, down wit' Thug Life, we doin' it live!
Everytime we side on you trick made bitches.

When we glide wit' my nigga Pac we bustin' 'em niggaz
On th block wit' Gangsta-D back up me your real OG
Comin' up outta the 7 T rees.
Strick 9 to the LHD
We claimin' to bring we make 'em fiend
For the fact we havin' 'em stack on the map
For the city of Sac al the way to the Jo' when stroll
Rebel, rebel, rebel
They just can't stand the reign
Or the occasional pain
Of a man like me who goes against the grain.
Sometimes I do it in vain
So wit the little bass and treble ain't missed a
So it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel.
Cold as the devil.
Straight from the underground, the rebel alone laughs.
They came to see the maniac sychopath.
The critics heard of me and the aftermath.
I don't give a damn and it shows.
A when I do a stage show I wear street clothes.
I give a shout out to your homies.
Maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G.
On the streets or on TV, it just don't pay the be a truth tellin' MC.
They won't be happy till I'm banned.
For point blank in your face, pump up the bass, and join the human race.
I throw peace to the Bay.
'Cause from the jungle to Oaktown, they backin me up all the way.
You know ya gotta love the sound.
Now I'm face to face with the devil.
'Cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto.
And police brutality,
Put you in a nip and call it technicality.
So you reap what you soe.
So read the wrath of the rebel jackin 'em up once more.
Now the fox is in the henhouse.
Creepin' up on your daughter, while you asleep
I got her sneakin out.
Tupac ain't nuttin nice.
I'll be nothin' how I wanna and do it when I'm gonna.
Now I'm up to no good.
The mastermind of mischief movin more than most could.
So sit and slip into the sound.
They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down.
But I never let it get me.
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me.
In fact, they tryin' to keep me out.
Try to censor what I say 'cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout.
So what's wrong with the media today.
Got brothers sellin out 'cause they greedy to get paid.
But me, I'm comin' from the soul.
And if it don't go gold, my story still get told.
And that way they can't stop me.
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy.
It's sloppy, don't even try to.
I'm a slave to the rhythm and I'm about to fly through.
When ya hear the bass roll, go ahead and let go.
Now everybody wanna gangbang.
They talkin' street slang, but the punk still can't hang.
By makin' records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent.
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin out, just to get your record out.
But 2pacalpyse is straight down.
Rebel, rebel, rebel
They just can't stand the reign

And baby you can be my lady
But you gotta give a nigga space
Or you'll drive me crazy

But I ain't tha one to play tha fool
Can't make no money in bed
So ain't no future fuckin' you

Can't do a damn thang for you
If you ain't about money
Nine outta ten
I'll ignore you

Throw up tha block

Then twist you lame tricks
Holla if ya understand my plan ladies
Fuck havin' babies by them shady ass niggas

Checkin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss ya
Soft as tissue
So my next issue is 'how to diss you ?'
They call me Storm
From tha day I was born

Till his hearts warm

Just 'cause we bone
Don't mean you own me
Nigga, I'm grown
I'll be waiting for you
Until you get through
I'd rather run tha streetz to make some mail
And put tha game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm chosen
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples
How I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this
Because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspecious and to wonder
And at tha end I make a come up
Nigga, was raiseed up
Off of M.O.B.
Fighting over something
That's tellen me don't run tha streetz
So tell me am I wrong?
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in tha morning
By sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plotin' on plans that we made
And all tha fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3'
And don't be late nigga
We hagin' out all night
While drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's popin' at a club
But they say I can't get in
'Cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die
I'll be game related
Got me strivin' for a million
Stayin' motivated
Now that we made it
It's a battle
Just for tha big money
I'm livin' wild
No smiles
Cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry
Just a little nigga
Tryin' to make it
I only got one chance
So I gotta take it
Ya never know when it's all gonna happen
Tha rappen or tha drugs
But until then
Give me love
And let me Run tha Streetz
I'll be waiting for you
Until you get through
If you a bad boy
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
I focus my locus thought on my enemies
Sip off the Hennessey it's necessary to finish me
I'm in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them niggas they think I'm crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin' to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin' on to spin the tires
My man define ya 357 anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin at Prodigy
Mobb 6 feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict, who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted
Ever since mama got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin less love in the drug house
Similar to savage it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
Why fear me, fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin' street
Like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath, a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Halfway thugs are buged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big pussy throw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked extorting
Block shots with 22's with my socks with the butt hangin' out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin
Catch my body like haitian 5 minutes from the station
Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick don't mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around 10 niggas bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfucker bleed
All the money was bloody as shit, y'all niggas shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bow down on your knees shit
The glock to your head nigga, don't let inside action
Hit innocent by - standers when he blasted, shot fucken backwards
Little homies puttin' work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g - rides runnin' red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since I'm an outlaw like Napoleon ain't no cell they can hold me in
Caucassian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some niggas fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product nigga I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with I'm some immortal shit
Outlawz we straight hurtin' shit use artillery to murder with
Put then on the box gangsta party like Pac
Lifes hard from the ox me and my niggas on top
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
With the leaded Pac, fuck the law
Carry steal 'cause I live in the nigga side of the law
Ridin' foes 'cause I can't let hoes catch me slippin
Quick to blow and dispose if you block on hittin
Ridin' high, blazing, kryptonite got a nigga dazing
Burpin and smurkin got on his knees before I grave em
Ride em, look behind him, I see him, he slipped
At a stop light in a growin' night, this motherfucken trick
Slide over so I can dip and put it in him
Damn, I guess this motherfucker know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speeding
With the metal trying to make these motherfuckers die freezing
Up the way I seen him slow down
Shit! I think I'm gonna bust these hoes down
Caught them runnin' on e it kind of funny to me
They know they was fuckin' with me but they dumb to see
Open up fire watchin me spy when my shells split em
Plus all them tricks and the bitches go to hell with em
Fuck 'em they phony claimin they homies but the foes
Speakin' on thug niggas daily while we nailing they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
Crooked thoughts cops get bought no longer caught
Did you cry when my girl died
Put out the hit politc niggas worldwide grabbin my dick
I'll never learn take away the pain with sherm
Throwin' gas on my enemies watchin them burn
Call my posse, I'm shootin up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a piaata and party
His last breath a straight lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
Between you and Biggie was like who gon', who gon'
Who rules the entertainment industry, basically
I was like this, is like a fuckin' election, you know what I'm sayin'?
It is, it is that me and Biggie situation was smaller
Than that me and Biggie situation was like
Why am I fighting to live if I 'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no-one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
Check it, I grew up a fucking screw up
Got introduced to the game got an ounce and fucking blew up
Chopping rocks over night
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into black Frank White
We had a code dress to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Showed they codes know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch an asthma attack
That's why I bust back and don't face me
When he drop take his glock and I'm swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold a glock
Bust some weight, lay back I got some money to make
Motherfucker
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no-one gives me a try?
But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crash
As I laugh pushing the gas while my glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple movies now the whole worlds trying to screw me
Even the cops trying to sue me, so what can I do but stay true
Sippin' twenty two's of brew
And now the media is trying to test me
Got the prest asking question, tryin' to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police's shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slip got arrested and flipped
He screamed Thug life! and emptied a clip
Got shot runnin' from the police
Why am I fighting to live if I 'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no-one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
I was shocked at everything, know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked at him
Pac is a strong dude, you know, I know, dude, know what I'm sayin'?
He's real strong
So when they was like he got shot I was more like Again?
Huh, you know what I'm sayin'?
He always gettin' shot or shot at
He gon' pull through this one again
Make a few records about it and it's goin' to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But he when he died I was like Oh!
You know what I'm sayin'?
But even though we was going through our drama
I will never wish death on nobody, you know
'Cause they be coming back from death
Yo, we've been all around the world
I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
Eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song
That I'm singing, dinga-linging
Funky beats ringin', everybody's swingin'
In the place as I kick the J A Z Z Y style
R&B mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it won't be long
Till I'm gone - It's just the same old song
It's just a freestyle, meanwhile we keep the beat kickin
Sweat drippin, girlies in the limo eatin chicken
Oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezin, but still I'm pleasin to all the slimmies
Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a Jenny
If it's good and plenty, don't you know
There I go, there I go, there I go
When I'm rappin', as if she's clappin, then I'm strappin', 'cause I'm smarter than that
Then, girlie, maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song
All around the world, same song
It's the same ol' song, y'all
All all around the world same song
Uh, it's just the same ol' song
All around the world same song
It's the same song
All all around the world same song
Money B, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky
Up and down, well, as a matter of fact I'll be right back I gotta take a leaky
So I'm drainin' entertainin',
But I got fame and the bases I touch to much for me to try to be namin
Aiyyo, you saw me on cable and grinned
I busted in and I was goin' to win
A Clark Gable back in Oakland, it's the same old song
To sporty shorties, same freckles and hat
Drinkin' the same 40
Hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip
Just like butter, my ryhmes are legit
'Cause I'm the humpty. Not humpty dumpty, but humpty hump
Here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump
Ah, shut up and just listen, not dissin', don't get me wrong
But to me it's just the same old song
So just watch, my name is Shock, I like to rock and you can't stop this
2Pac go ahead, rock this
Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground
Girls who used to frown, say I'm down, when I come around
Gas me and when they pass me, they used to diss me
Harrass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high
Same song can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
All around the world, same song
The same ol' song, y'all
All all around the world same song
And ya don't, ya don't, check it
All around the world same song - it's the same song
Ya don't stop - it's just the same song
All all around the world same song
Hibbie dibbie ya don't quit
All around the world same song
Ah yeah, Humpty Hump in the house y'all
All all around the world same song
You know what - it's the same ol' song
All around the world same song
All all around the world the same song
Ah...
All around the world, same song ...
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
War Time
War Time, it's either yourz or mine
Outlawz be on a grind, and a mission to shine
And ride on em', leave em' stuck and fucked from the gate
Hesitate, aww, now you know what
Y'all niggaz were here to go
If you know it was good for ya
Buncha toy souljahs all dressed in fatigue
But I'm Edi Amin on a mission to make 'em bleed
Nigga what?, Nigga who?
It was cool? and at you?, what the fuck is gone do?
Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga splippin', fall at the same time
We all laced in the chain, tryin' to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine
But when you could do yourz, we'll bring these muthafuckas war
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
As I approach the scene, from smokin' green
Got my eyes closed, niggaz so cold on my foes
I make em' die froze
Watch me make em' bleed, make em' G's
Lord help me wit'it
Got me paintin' pictures of a mil-ticket
Help me get'it
See me and pray for options
And this pressures, nonstop
Niggaz get the pistol poppin'
And watch they body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set
Flash on, blast on them bitch-made niggaz wit' my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons hittin' weed
Got me hearin' screamin'
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope-fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggaz pass the cush and watch me bring em' to the floor
I got the Secretz of War
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
We do this thug life shit, like 4, 5, 6, dick em'
Squeeze the lead off, I blow his mutha fuckin' head off
Signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
These streetz is black hockey and raw we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar
Locked in the slammer, while I'm laid cocked back like a hammer
Y'all newly weds that in honey moons, times bout up
Y'all, that means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce, stuck
Your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gonna do?
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
Yo, we go to war
We check the murder rate percentage
Niggaz is finished
Get blood checks from clinics
This thug shit is in us
Flowin' through my system, you a victim
Blunts, I twist em', fuck the whole world
It's us against them
You got some teeth?, pull it out
Cock the hammer if you wit' it, don't make
No difference if, wit' 20 by the life sentence
We already doin' life on the streetz
Like Ali G, niggaz be heated, when they walkin' the beat
This shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggaz hate me
Scared to face me, knowin' that the Outlawz blaze me
Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I suck my money muscle, all the G's got devils
Movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggaz like Rodney
Turn a killa like Kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
We go to war
Bring it on
And all you lil' young ass souljahs
You play this shit back about fifteen times
You'll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin'
Teach these bitches a lil' somethin', you know what I mean?
Secretz of muthafuckin' War...
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
War Time
War Time, it's either yourz or mine
Outlawz be on a grind, and a mission to shine
And ride on em', leave em' stuck and fucked from the gate
Hesitate, aww, now you know what
Y'all niggaz were here to go
If you know it was good for ya
Buncha toy souljahs all dressed in fatigue
But I'm Edi Amin on a mission to make 'em bleed
Nigga what?, Nigga who?
It was cool? and at you?, what the fuck is gone do?
Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga splippin', fall at the same time
We all laced in the chain, tryin' to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine
But when you could do yourz, we'll bring these muthafuckas war
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
As I approach the scene, from smokin' green
Got my eyes closed, niggaz so cold on my foes
I make em' die froze
Watch me make em' bleed, make em' G's
Lord help me wit'it
Got me paintin' pictures of a mil-ticket
Help me get'it
See me and pray for options
And this pressures, nonstop
Niggaz get the pistol poppin'
And watch they body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set
Flash on, blast on them bitch-made niggaz wit' my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons hittin' weed
Got me hearin' screamin'
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope-fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggaz pass the cush and watch me bring em' to the floor
I got the Secretz of War
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz

Secretz of muthafuckin' War...
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
Game rules often slang to the right fools
Heavy hittin' at this motherfucker's straight spittin'
Diggin' deep into your brain while tryin' to explain
Why real niggas need to stick to the game
It's the same got these motherfuckers changin' on me
Jealous-ass player-haters gaming on me
Look out motherfucker homey-G
As in gettin' motherfuckers 'fore they come get me
Get down for the right for the wishes
Fake ass nigga, you in shit, for fightin' over bitches
You call that a player?
Straight-ass sissy
See me at my show nigga miss me
'Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit
Got a pistol motherfucker better pull quick
And just 'cause I'm rappin' don't mean I ain't scrappin
And if you clip when the shit happens, it don't stop
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin' at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
See the shit don't stop
My 9 goes pop
Your body drip-drop
Throw that ass in a zip-loc
Now you've been hauled away in a body bag
Get your Sammy D said how your blood got sneeze me
Yo you fuckin' with a thug yo your ass gets plugged
With this hollow-point slugs
With ya under the rug
That's why my deaf niggas don't play that shit
In thug life niggas be the craziest
So when you think about fuckin' this
You better wear a vest
But it really don't matter
We ain't aimin' at your chest
Nah we blowin' holes in your motherfuckin' skull
Make sure your ass is smoked
That's all the fat lady wrote
You heard that fat bitch sing when my shit went bang-bang
But it don't pay when I flaunt your brain
Nigga, ain't no plain cane brothers come no show
In the casket
Git'n they ass kicked
And blasted
It don't stop
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin' at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
All I wanna do is try to Mac the hoes
Spin bank on thangs sellin me a sponsor on my foes
It's like each and every one they got the look of death
I got my 9 nigga
Don't be silly
You better watch your step
And pussies we crossin when my crew is flossin'
Bitches we tossin'
And niggas we crossin'
It's like a murder rhyme when we hit your hood
It's all good
The punks? I wish you would!
Wouldn't better to just corrolate what we bust
Instead of kickin' dust
Gets a press y'all from nuts
Cause ain't no herbs here
And ain't no morgues
Beware of the water 'cause they full of sharks
But in every state
Niggas perpetrate and test
Where I come from fools die for less
And thugs keep thugin' till their casket drop
It's on till I die
And the shit don't stop
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin' at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
Say he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug
Said he wanna be
One day he's gonna be
Said he's wanna be
Shorties gonna be's a Thug
Said he's gonna be
One day he gonna be
Say he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug
Said he gonna be
One day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug
He was a nice middle class nigga
But nobody knew the evil he'd do When he got a little bigger
Get off the final blaze
While puffing on a Newport
Plottin' on a another way to catch a case
Was only sixteen, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas
But you the only one who ain't telling
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me it's a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, 'n break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commencing to money makin' tactics
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My fingers on the trigga, Tell the lord
To make way for another straight Thug Nigga
I'm sitting getting buzzed, looking for some luv
From the homies, 'cause shorty wanna be a Thug
Straight from the Hall to the Penn
Adolescent nigga scaling weight and standing Six feet Ten
He carried weight like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on some playa haters
If the mutha fuckas act tuff
Then that's when the lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast pull the trigga
Could take the life of a young nigga guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the niggas all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Released with this game till it's a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear and it ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm trying to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark getting buzzed, looking for some love
Out with the homies, 'cause shorty wanna be a Thug
Shorty gonna be a thug
You little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
Gotta stay sharp nigga, play your part
Watch the signs
Damn, you ain't but sixteen nigga?
Sixteen?!?!
That's a bad muthafucker
We's gonna talk about these scandalous hoes
I know you that's why we gonna do it
Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin' around with the piano nigga
Just drop that shit like uh, this here
I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no lovin' from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, Never breathing again
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin ass, triiick
Used to watch you money grabbin, who you baggin beeyitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin' scandalous
Scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
How's it hangin'? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin'
I've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin' to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin'
This bitch'll have ya wakin' up with all your cash missin'
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin' at a bitch who specialize in tellin' lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister ? in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't where we're goin', she's makin' me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin'?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me off guard
Went in the purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous
Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin' riches
I'm spittin' at tricks 'cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded
This is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin' you could be true
When I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggaz doin' time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin' well
Bustin' at niggaz who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me
I'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans
Can't wait till I see L.A., 'cause it's so scandalous
Aiyyo... how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be
A bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin' with a nigga 35
Gettin' him for ends
Hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent
When these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long
Watch them hoes
All you niggaz out there
Beware these lyin' ass scandalous bitches
Quit'staring at me like a infra-red nigga
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close there eyes seeing dreams in they sleep
But don't fall a sleep
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on
Pictures of plenty
Sippin' my glass full of Henny
Hands on my Semi -
- Automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact
'Cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire
Niggas die with open eyes
Scared to take a nap
It's a trap
A long maze
Dreamin' of getting stacks
Makin' scratch the wrong way
What song says
We murder motherfuckas daily
Black out
Blow the the track out
My lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed
Then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the East to West
Like Yayo
Niggas pull out
When I say so
Commence to poppin'
Motherfuckers copy it's fatal
Efficiently I delete and flee
The art of war living sucka free
Get with me
Mutherfuckers just don't sleep
I'm staring through my rear-view doing 'bout 90
The pedal to the metal
So I can't see what's behind me
Buckle up your seat belt
Eyes on the road
They know we riding dirty got playa hiding Gold
They go down to the projects, the clubs been closed
And then they wonder why niggas braking down O's
I'm a runaway slave
You get it nigga, off the chain
I got that Thug Life shit running through my veins
And now they scared
They knowing that I've been heaven sent
And yeah we know the dop coming from the President
But look at us
We ain't got shit to lose
The life we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes
In the Ghetto
Or better yet home-sweet-home
This is the land of the free, but to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the White House
Strapped with my heat
So don't fall asleep
Come on nigga
They say that the more they hate you
The more that it motivates you
My minds set on crime, my mentals set on the paper
62 hours and counting and I'm still awake
And they slipping me sleeping pill's with the will I break
Broke niggas always telling you how to make your cash and just
So I just stop listening and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media they always mad at us
I don't see them trying to mediate when they get they Gat's and bust
They just instigating as soon as they get the tape, it's dropped
And my niggas locked as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't tripping on all that rapping stuff
I'm taking back my money counter's wasn't fast enough
Yup
I got a couple problems
And none of them is money
And pretend they love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to mauve with the Ruger
Kill ya like Freddie Kruger
These nightmare's just ain't as bloody
Money talks to I always have voice to answer this
I can't relax 'cause it's like I'm a fetty activist
See me on TV never a mattress
Don't go to sleep nigga
Don't close your eyes
Don't go to sleep
Sleep baby
Yeah! ha ha yeah... that's right!
The F.A's comin' striaght from the wild wild west
Look at baby girl born in 19-7-deuce
Pop's on his fix, Mom's stuck on that crazy juice
Went to school, It's all cool but in Junior Hiiigh
Little hooker in the bathroom getting hiiigh
What she doing and what she smoking, nobody knows
Is she addicted or just slipping into melbose
A bad ass broad running with the girl gang
Just got some tat's, Talking all that girl slang.
First one to slap, because La vida don't matter
Wip out a cuete watch your brains get splattered
Selling them doves, hanging with thugs and all that
Beating up fools with a baseball bat
Started having sex at only 14
Imagine O.G. wears his clothes all crisp and clean
Got pregnant had a baby in December
She wont see the daddy till next September
Mom's and Pop's gave her the boot
Kicked her out La Casa, Now what Raza
With the money she got, She bought a spot of the block
Started paying the rent by slangin' phat ass coca rocks
Now she's 23 her four kids all alone, and loc'ed out
And plus she's all smoked out, the base face
You could see it in her eyes, it could also tell the tears
Of a life long cries.
They was headed for self destruction
Her own kids gotta healp, 'cause they knew she was slippin'
Took the devil away homegiiirl, You was Slippin'.
Slipping into Darkness
When you slip you trip and fall
Slipping into Darkness
Ain't no sense to give y'all no love at all
They say we're slipping, as a whole one race
So, what we gonna choose, Don't want the blues
I turn to the news and what do I see
We got blacks against blacks, browns against browns
Whites against whites, from governments to undergrounds
So, Peep the sound as it bumps through your stereo
Ear to your brain now check out the scenerio
Cali got quakes, Mudslides, and Floods
Hustlas, Pimps, Shot Callers, and Killas
O.G., Macks, and the big Coca Dealers
We got homeboys who just like kicking it
And Vato's like me who grab the mic and start splitting it
So get closer to the funk and slip into the backseat.
They wanna band me cause a brothas makin' noise a lot
Ill shoot they ass in a sec wit a poison dart
They got me runnin' down the street gettin' hotter
Runnin' from the cops as I try to clock my glock
The war wont stop
That's why they wanna band the music
You ever notcie how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin wit a Mexican
We can all have peace, the sun sets again
They try to shove us in the pen
But we clown and we frown every time we hit the top ten
Once again, it's your friend outta oakland, hopin
To keep the hip hop clubs open
Now we can lay back and let them close'm
Or we can have beef and show that we control'em
Now ain't nobody gettin' paid, it's a damn shame
Why gang bang brothas in the same gang?
They say securitys to blame, 'cause they lettin it off
Brothas come to have fun but they settin it off
One time, make it worse when they sweat us
Send an army of pigs to come get us
Now I'm runnin' outta time and I'm cool down with the aztecs
This is sorta like soul food
I shall not fear no man, but God
Though I walk through tha valley of death
I shed so many tears
Please God walk with me...
Back in Elementry, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside mind couldn't find a place ta rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can ya feel me?
I'm not liven in tha Past, You wanna last
Be tha first ta blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deseased
Call on tha sirens, I seem him murdered in tha streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a 'G' ?
Remember me, so many homies in the cemetery
Shed so many tears
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business
By any means, label me greedy gettin' green
But seldom seen
And fuck tha world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leaven here in a hurse
God can ya feel me?
Take me away from all tha pressure and all tha pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial
And when I Die, babtised in Eternal Fire
Shed so many tears...
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Now I'm lost and I'm weary
So many tears, I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a compilated step
Ta bring me closer
To embrace an early death now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on tha streets
I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screaming peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' ta break free
They planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
Will I survive till tha morning ta see tha sun
Please lord forgive me for my sins
Cause here I come...
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
God
I lost so many peers and
Lord knows I've tried, been a witness ta homicide
Drive-bys taken lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken hearted as I glance at tha chaulk line, gettin' high
This ain't tha life for me
I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me
I'm stuck in tha game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tangaray influenced me ta gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately
I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady
'Cause she's a product of this poison, I'm hearen noises
Think she's fucken on my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to tha floor
Beggin' for tha Lord ta let me in Heavens door
I shed so many tears...
Lord
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
I suffered through tha years and shed so many tears
I shall not fear no man, but God
Though I walk through tha valley of death
I shed so many tears
Please God walk with me...

Remember me, so many homies in the cemetery
Shed so many tears
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business
By any means, label me greedy gettin' green
But seldom seen
And fuck tha world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leaven here in a hurse
God can ya feel me?
Take me away from all tha pressure and all tha pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial
And when I Die, babtised in Eternal Fire
Shed so many tears...
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Now I'm lost and I'm weary
So many tears, I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a compilated step
Ta bring me closer
To embrace an early death now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on tha streets
I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screaming peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' ta break free
They planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
Will I survive till tha morning ta see tha sun
Please lord forgive me for my sins
Cause here I come...
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
God
I lost so many peers and
Lord knows I've tried, been a witness ta homicide
Drive-bys taken lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken hearted as I glance at tha chaulk line, gettin' high
This ain't tha life for me
I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me
I'm stuck in tha game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tangaray influenced me ta gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately
I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady
'Cause she's a product of this poison, I'm hearen noises
Think she's fucken on my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to tha floor
Beggin' for tha Lord ta let me in Heavens door
I shed so many tears...
Lord
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
I suffered through tha years and shed so many tears
So what I'm gonna do, hopefully is... I wanna be, uhm not a wannabe I am 2Pac Shakur!
2Pac!
2005!
Guess who's back? G-G-Guess who's back?
G-G-Guess who's back? G-G-Guess who's back?

Posse deep as I role through the streets
Muthafuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so long you think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beat, I'm robbin' niggas through the teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play tuffy
Last time them niggas rushed me, I ain't bust but now I'm touchy
Trust me, ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buck shots
Them niggas got enough knots, I'm poppin' corrupt cops
You muthafuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem, now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Muthafuckin' Soldier, ready to role and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Role to the door, through a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' 'cause wouldn't stop until they rugged out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's & them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
20 cops, one for every year in jail
Tryin' to keep a nigga down, but you failed
Before I let you take me, I told ya
Fuck bein' trapped, I'm a Soldier.
I betcha that I got something you ain't got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G 'cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do 'cause that ain't you, you just frontin'.
You ain't?
It's 2Pac in the mad bitch
In them .64 rag on them things, that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghosts on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the backseat, nigga when we clown.
Homey is you down?
B got the strap and she anxious
Hurry up 'fo she spank shit
Comin' round the corners, spittin' rounds
They payin' homey down
Caught them sucker ass bitches outta bounce.
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day.
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day.
Stinkin' biatch!

I've changed...
You mothafuckas kill me
I've changed...
It ain't that I've changed
But it's strange how you mothafuckas rearrange
When I found fame
Point ya finger at tha bad guy
You know what my momma usta tell me
If ya can't find something ta live 4
Then you best, find something ta die 4
Repeats through interlude
Deep deep
La'tasha Hardings
Remember that name...
Cause a bottle of juice...
Is not something 2 die 4
Young Quaid
Remember that name...
Cause all you mothafuckas
That go to your grave with that name on your brain
Cause jelousy and recklousness
Is not, something 2 die 4
All you Niggas out there
Got a crack that crumbles
Unite
One nigga, teach 2 niggas
4 niggas teach more niggas
All tha poor niggas
Tha penn niggas
Tha rich niggas
Tha strong niggas
Unite
There's more of us than there is of them
Look around...
Check your strip
Deep deep
That's something 2 die 4
Black
That's something 2 live 4
What do I know?
Something wicked this way come
Something wicked this way come
Something wicked this way come
Something wicked this way come
Something wicked this way come
Something wicked this way come
More than an adversary I' m very quick
I' m ready to hit 'em with this gift
I' m equipped to kick
Grab you coat and you hat, 'cause I' m prepared to clamp
Oh shit 2pacalypse is back and strapped
Attacking the pacs, I' m kicking the facts for stacks to rap
And those that max, relax and let the blacks get jacks
I' m getting taxed, my pacs is packed with angry blacks
I' m ready to go
I' m ripping the shows, hitting the dough
Getting the hoes
Pumping the flow, gangster ho
Cause the nose knows
Check the pose, froze, when you see me close
Punks you gonna roast, host, in a cloud of smoke
Broke, choked on a rope, and then smoked
Wrote, crimes that'll bring me back notes
Nope, I ain't the type of fella that you use though
Kkkkkkicking the funky flava
Run for cover when you hear the bass drop
One verse is all it takes
Something wicked this way come
Wicked wicked this way comes
Wicked wicked this way comes
Wicked wicked this way comes
Something wicked this way come
2PAC
Soon as I get home...
Soon as I get home...
Dear baby it's me
Again stuck inside this mad pen
Tryin' to pay my debt fpor all my sins 
These is penitentiary times
Be so heavy on my mind 
At times... it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell
Stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail 
Waitin' for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks 
And mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder how long will I last
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Bustas is shady 
So I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin'... so crystal clear I see it
Even though you mad at me 
You'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come... so easily
I max out in the morning baby life is good
Me and you against the whole hood 
Soon as I come home...
Garb my strap
Locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a warzone
Soon as I come home...
Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin' 
But now you out in the world... while I'm twisted in prison
Love letters come daily
Words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures... beggin' for some sex 
Stay wide open keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is keep it it real or you could die squealin'
Plus I never have to worry about a visit 
'Cause you're there daily
Gaurds tryin' to get your number
You don't dare tell me
Tongue kissin' steady humpin'
Tryin' to touch you somethin'
'Fore the C.O. in the corner jump in
Frontin'
Late nights reminiscin'
Everybody's queit
I think somethin's in the air 
Prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks
Steel from the bed springs 
I touch 'em with thug love
And then let they heads ring
Started a war but now I'm gone 
Release me to the streets in the morning
It's on 
Soon as I get home...
Grab my gats
Locate my comrades 
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Let's get my money out the safe 
It's time to turn the streets into a warzone
Soon as I get home...
Kadafi
Since you've been gone 
My whole life's been like a game of c-low
Take and pick like they keep a c-note
Fillin' my dreams like Nino... Brown
The whole town be shook up
And me and mama survivin' 
Depends on how many rocks... the young nigga cook up 
Narcotics got drastic
Seen 'em niggas you blated 
Wantin' me in a casket
On the grind coppin' plastic
Yeah nigga I heard
Little Moo gave the word
You get parol on the third
It's all out we just heard 
We out here frontin' 
Still here but all about nothin'
My double o's what I'm wantin' 
And I'm tryin' to see somethin'
That we ain't never had
Luxury life results... livin' bad
Tricks of the trade 
Shit that should've been taught by dad
But learned through the crew 
Lessons between me and you 
And once we lock this shit down 
It ain't a thing they could do
Meawhile I stay waitin' by the phone 
Hopin' I get the call
Tellin' a nigga that you home...
2PAC

You got whites killin' blacks
Cops killin' blacks
And blacks killin' blacks
Shit just gonna get worse
They just gonna become souljas
Straight souljas
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja

Crack done took apart of our family tree
My momma's on tha shit, my dadies splitten, mom's steady blaming me
Is it my fault, just 'cause I'm a young black male
Cop sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sells
Only 15 and got problems
Cops on my tail, so I bail till I dodge 'em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
Remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass
Now I gotta murder case
You speak a' Heaven punk, I never heard of tha place
What is it ta come up fast, got a Uz and a black mask
Drop tha fuckin' task, now who's tha jack ass
Keep my shit cocked, cause tha cops got a glock too
What tha fuck would you do
Drop them or let 'em drop you
I chose droppin' tha cop
I got me a glock, and a glock for tha niggas on my block
4 of'em tried ta stab me, I moved out
Sold a pound a weed, made g's, bought a new house
I'm only 17, I'm tha new kid
I got me a crew, bought'em jewels, and a uzi
But all good things don't last
Task came fast, and busted my black ass
Coolen in tha pen, where tha goods kept
Now my little brother wants ta follow in my footsteps
A soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
Buck, buck, pigs get fucked, don't step ta this
Quiet has kept them blessed, on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em they come and test, and tha rest, nigga gets hectic
Here's tha aneirexic, I'm making it to an exit
Walkin' through tha streets on tha black tip
Packed with several gats, 'cause I'm also payin' back shit
Niggas don't wanna try me, brotha you'll get shot down
Now I'm kick'en tha block, cause my bigger brothers locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other cops see me on tha block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brotha what he needs is some weed up ta season
Tell him just be ready set, pack ya shit up quick
And when I hit, be prepared ta jet
Niggas from tha block on tha boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke pow
These punks about ta get hit by tha best
I'm wear'en double vest, so aim at my fuckin' chest
I'll be makin' straight dome calls
Touch tha button on tha wall, you'll be picken up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout, hit tha pig nigga
Break your bigga brother out
I got a message for tha warden
I'm commin' for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in tha mess hall, yes y'all
A crazy motherfucka makin' death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin'
For every minute you stall, one y'all bleedin'
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walken out, I caught a bullet in tha head
Tha screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gonna pull through, he deserve to
Tha fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following tha tracks of a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
Straight soulja, 1993, all of it.
Mr. Shakur, can you please explain the meaning
Behind your violent lyrics?
Explain the meaning?
The fuck these niggaz talkin' bout?
My message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
Take a closer look
Tryin' to stay jail free
Of young black males?
Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
Than the 4th of July, if I gotta die, I gotta
Game is what she gave me
That's not the way we made it
My message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
Cops pull me over, check my plates, but I'm legal
Message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
On the streets till the niggaz get a piece, fuck em!
Till the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, hear them screamin
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Till the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, hear them screamin
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Till the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, screamin
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Till the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, screamin
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
The niggaz scream fuck em!
Thinkin' they run the motherfuckin streets
It's mo' niggaz than it's police
One nigga, teach two niggaz
Teach mo' niggaz, and we could run this shit!
They finally pulled me over and I laughed
Starin' through my rearview
Just lookin' back at the world
From another level
Starin'...
Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society, first they try
To murder me, then they lie to me, product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed, now the little baby's
Crazed raised off Hennesey, tell me will my enemies
Flee when they see me, believe me
Even Thugs gotta learn to take it easy, listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turnin' Bad Boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin' with a posse
Full of paranoid drug dealers, to the end my friend
I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview,
See I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview see
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers
Now you see em, now you don't, some niggaz
Be here for the moment, and then they gone, what happened to em?
Well let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the, truest
Thug life until I check out of this bitch, I thought you'd know this
Who is, gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview
Half you, is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I feel like southpaws
But still we keep mashin till our dreams come through
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin' days in this livin' black Hell, do you feel me?
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin'
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father I'm a soldier, I'm gettin' hotter
Cause the world's gettin' colder, baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
I say
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly and all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly nigga can die
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets, somethin' I learned
In school, on some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since the seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run
By young guns, Outlawz and truants, shit's deep
Turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burn my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too while starin' through your rearview
Hahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview
So since you ain't knowin' what we mean let me break down understandin
The world, the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin' at the world, from like, behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do, just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggaz do they wanna do, bitch niggaz do what they can't
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, ya know
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time flyand we'll be
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
Heart beatin' fast... time to die
High, watchin time fly, ya know
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you heart beatin' fast... time to die
High, watchin time fly
Starry night, an unknown creation
Written by, and from the archives of Tupac Shakur
Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh
A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
This dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
And you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
But for you there's only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
This world could not accept your masterpieces, from the heart
So on that starry night, you gave to us and you took away from us
The one thing we never acknowledged, your life
Yeah, game laid down by Q, why'knawmsayin?
Vocals by Rasheeda, fly beat by QDIII
And flows by the M-A-see why'all, Mr. M-A-see Mall
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us
Uh, uh, watch me live my art; writing words from my soul in blood
I speak the truth on every thang I love
I'll probably sacrifice my life, to send my message through mics
It's like a war drum calling soldiers at night
It's bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So it's cold n dark and deep like a universe, but nah don't start
It's for ya entertainment but it's my life why all
And I can't rewind, fast forward, or press pause
But when you give your all, it's like the fans demand more
And after the tour I sit alone like before
When ya name is hot it's all love, the world is yours
But when you fall off, you get ignored
You on the cover of da magazine, flossing on the TV screen
Toastin' wit yo' champagne, playin' life like a game
Loaded in the limousine, love to hear the fans scream
Swimmin' wit the sharks now, ain't no love money king
People got they hands out but ain't nobody lendin' hands
Can you really blame dem for tryin' to get what they can?
Late night, bright lights, lust n lies
And anythang goes under the Hollywood sign
Well you might lose ya soul and who knows what you find
But go ahead main we all want to shine
But go ahead main we all want to shine
There you have it
Why'know, when I was younger I prayed, to get in this game
Why'know to hold dis microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs, to let me rock a crowd one day
Why'know let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy Tupac did fo' sho'
And he gave that to me
But he didn't he didn't he didn't let me know
About all the shady shit that's in, in between
You and yo' dream, why'know?
See it's more than the music, I spit it from the heart
So sometime it's cold n it's dark, but it's raw
And that's how I'ma bring it to you every time, why'know?
Yah nigga, Drop the top on your muthafuckin ride
This how we do it on the west coast BAABBBY
Rollin' down the Four O Five
Gettin' high
White boys done wrecked their shit
Tryin' to check my ride
I ain't being bootsy
Crusin' in a Six-o Impala
Drivin' like I'm in a Hooptee
Car full of ballin' caps
Keep yo hand on the strap
And take all the craps
Niggas know my steel-lo
All legit
But I'm drapped
Like a nigga movin' kilo
Shit don't stop
'Cause I can make that ass drop
Make the front pop
And Hit the three wheel motion
All Day
Hit the freeway
Take it easy, uh
Let's slide
And pick-up some hoochies
Ride
Right back to the movies
High
Talking back to the screen drinkin' liquor
Havin' big dreams of gettin' richer
I'm livin' that
Thug Life, y'all know the rules
Big Stretch represent the real nigga
Flex, Live squad and this mutha fucker catch wreck
Thug Life
Sharp as a roughneck
Shakin' the dice, we roll long, ain't nothin' nice
Another one, had to throw another gun
Don't need another case
You can see it on my face son
But I ain't fallin' yet
And I gotta give a shout to where my ball is at
Mophreme Tell 'em why the hoes dream
Gettin' high off a nigga like a dope fiend
'Cause I'm non-stop, and I'm always hustlin'
Twenty four seven, ain't nothin' buck
But when a young G's flippin keys for a livin'
Try to make a mill off the time I'm givin'
Trippin'
Mad
I'm crazy
Can't nobody fade me
And I been goin' insane lately
And everybody tryin' ta hold me back

Thug Life, y'all know the rules
Maaaannnn, I don't worry about the Five-O
If they start,
'Cause it's all about survival
Just stay smart
Keep your mind on your bank roll
Always
Stay ahead of these stank hos
These days
It's an all out rat race
And look at MEEE just caught another cat case
That makes three
My laywers getting cash up the ass
Don't even ask
Why I'm buck wild?
Don't smile
Don't laugh
To the young G's comin' up
Peep game
Don't let the money make you change
Or act strange
Stay broke
It's all in together now
Keep pumping loud
Till the crowd
Bring the top down
Is that Tupac Thug Life?
Hell Yah
Try to dirty up my name
But it's still here
Which way do I turn?
I'm strapped
Lost in the storm
I can't turn back
With that...
Thug Life, y'all know the rules
Straight muthafuckin' ballin'
Part two-
Still ballin'

Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still Ballin'
Ridin' on these niggaz 'cause they lame
In a 6-1 Chevy still heavy in this game

Bust on these bitch made niggaz hit em' up

Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger lord forgive me if I smoke niggaz

And hope the lord understands

Boy I won't be playin'
But clienteles
And rhyme sell's
Question is will you fuckin' niggaz ride for real
Bitch nigga this is g rated
Plus your homeboy won't make your street game fool daisy

Muthafuckers still ballin'
Niggaz wonder why
You can bring your crew

Thug Life!
Still ballin'
Muthafuckers still ballin'
Ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown...
Somebody wake me I'm dreaming, I started as a seed the semen
Swimming upstream, planted in the womb while screaming
On the top, was my pops, my momma screaming stop
From my single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plans for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me asking white Jesus
Will a nigga live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
In the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleeping
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creeping
I can live or die, hope I get some money before I'm gone
I'm only nineteen, I'm trying to hustle on my own
On the spot where everybody and they pops trying to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong 'cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a heroin bong
You can ask my man he's a mind reader
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed nigga
That Hennessy y'all keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggers holla at me, Keep it real G
And my reply till they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise.
Ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown...
I stay sharp as always
Running ya bricks with blitz, do your project always - don't be
Cruz by tools - nigga knows all their
Secrets so war prepared me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems thou, be placing triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot popping out my jeans
...
In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blasting bastards
No faces for open caskets, peeling ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress - Leaving holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew bobby Mo-green in topic
And loot to keep the seams in my motherfucking jeans popping
Leaving ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggers is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker -
And still I rize, and still I rize. and still I rize, still I rize.
Ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown...
Check it
I grew up a fucking screwup
Got introduced to the game
Got a ounce and fucking blew up
Chopping rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying
Ta turn into the black Frank White
It's a red light
How many homies gotta die tonight?
Oh, yeah, stop the gunfight
I can feel it
Somebody's trying to start up a fight
Come on and keep game, uh oh
But you cannot cease the blame
And if you ask me, it's a damn shame
We be taking lives that we can't replace
Over B.S. that don't make sense
We gotta get better than this
We started fighting at our own risk
It was something we couldn't resist
It's a red light
How many homies gotta die tonight?
We had to grow dreads
To change our description
Two cops is on a milkbox missing
Showed they toes
You know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets
A chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and
Catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back
It don't faze me
When he drop, take his glock
And I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape
Sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make
Motherfucker
From the five-oh
Ducking and dodging and my survival
Depends on when I let off with my nine-oh
I'm moving swifter
Than the next nigga
No time for sex
'Cause in my mind
All I wonder is who's next
Nigga, my homey slipped
And now he pays the price
He did a drive-by, sixteen
Now he's doin' triple life
Tell me is it me or my upbringing
I spit that thug shit
Nigga motherfuck singing
I hope you got your
Timberlands on tight
'Cause I ain't givin' up
I'd rather duck these
Motherfuckers all night
I'm running through
The projects, beyotch
They'll never catch me
'Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy
On the sneotch
Don't say you never heard of me
Till they murder me, I'm a legend
Do Thug Niggas go to heaven
I'm rolling with the thorough heads
We getting ghost on them hoes and yo
I got no love for the five-oh
I'm running from the police
Stop the gunfight
I can feel it
Somebody's trying to
Start up a fight
Come on and keep game, uh oh
But you cannot cease the blame
And if you ask me, it's a damn shame
We be taking lives that we can't replace
You got swishes in your system
Juice up in
Now you're red again
Over what he said
Over what she said
Now somebody gotta end up dead
I would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks...
But now...
The game is to be sold and not told
So eh, fuck me
I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block.
Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks.
Learn to throw them thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked.
And niggas laugh, till tha first mothafucka got blasted.
I put the nigga in his casket,
Now they coverin' the basket with plastic.
I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts.
I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce.
And gettin' ghost on the five-o, fuck them hos.
Got a 45 screamin' about survival.
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo.
Hollar one-time when I say so.
Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences.
Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches.
And they say how do you survive weighin' 165
In a city where the skinny niggas die?
Tell Mama don't cry.
Even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
I'm str8 ballin'!
Str8 ballin'!
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it.
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'.
It's kinda boomin' round the way and today I'll make a killin'.
Dressin' down like a villain', but only on the block.
It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops.
Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends.
I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz.
I hate to strip let my music bump,
Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck.
Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo.
A need money in a major way.
Time to fuck my BEEEYATCH! Hey!, and getten' paid
You other mothafuckas callin',
But me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas,
We str8 ballin'!
Str8 ballin'!
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do.
So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to RAISE UP!
But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes
Young nigga time to do or die.
I keep a pistol in my pocket,
Ready on my block.
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit.
And now they see that mothafucka beat pain,
At point blank range 'cause he slept on the game.
Ain't a damned thing changed
Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em,
If you can't stand pain better hold 'em.
Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll.
You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga.
Better live your life to the fullest,
You 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it.
Cause even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
We str8 ballin'!
We str8 ballin'!
To my niggas in the penitentiary,
Loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me.
Cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born,
And once again it's on,
I'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone.
Who the hell can you get to stop me?
I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse.
I keep my glock cocked
I need it 'cause they're all shady.
I finally made it
Now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me!
I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back.
I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack.
And I came up a long way from food stamps.
And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps.
Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire.
What could I do? Pull my trigga or watch my nigga die.
I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs.
I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs.
And mothafucka, we be ballin'!
All mothafuckin' day long, stay strong!
We str8 ballin'.
I would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks...
But now...
The game is to be sold and not told

It was a dope spot front yard, one on one strapping
That's the way it was way before all the scrapping
Earned my fucking props from the G's in the hood
Put in work, did some dirt, never snitched, never would
Rollin' the fat Jaguars with my nigga P blowing up
Time coming back sipping Hennessey
Seventeen years old and I felt like God mad rich
And I had my pick of any fine bitch
And my family was known to be great, seen slightly more
Representing no matter who sets it on
Street power, why you niggaz flip and you thug shit
I be bout my motherfucking grip, nothing else
Gets between me and mine, just remember that
Damn it's a shame, but still I'm in the game
I'm trying to get street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
Don't blame my mama, don't blame my daddy
I know they wish they never had me
In and out of jail by twelve, failing out of school
'Cause I was living by the street rules
Hanging with hogs, dropping dogs as a little loc
I was getting my respect but I was still broke
Into the game and expanded to the cocaine
Went from double-ups, to slanging them whole things
Focused on my mail name ringing like a bell
And even with no proof they gonna put me in jail
Everybody says he's sold and I'm outta control
Bitches want my cash on my dash of my cockpit
They wouldn't know a motherfucker if he didn't have shit
So while I'm balling and kicking up dust, get yo' skull crushed
Bitch-made niggaz know not to fuck with us
'Cause I'm living on the edge, I'm blasting lead
Wanted by the Feds, they got to take me dead
So fuck it drive a bucket in the inner city
In the land of no pity, I made it by the street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a super star, made it by street fame
I had to make some people feel the pain, in this dirty game
I know I'm on my way to hell
Ain't no yellow bricked road for all the niggas that I done smoked
The hood done took me under, a nigga gots no heart
Don't get it twisted 'cause I'm there with my homey's car
I kill for my niggaz, my niggaz kill for me
That's the love you get, from the drunk one, you put in work see
I'm a G with a gang of niggaz after me
Trying to peal me, 'cause I smoked they homey
What comes around goes around is what makes it worse
I smoke blunts all day to keep my mind off a hearse
They don't stop stop till my casket drop drop
Let me ride, but all I want, thou shalt not beef or die
And it don't matter if I rap or plays
'Cause I blow out back of some minds, fuck the fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
... Made it by street fame

Yo 'Law, is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?
Yeah, Mr.Fuck-a-Cop is back and I still don't give a fuck yaknahmsayin'
Puffin on this indo, in the studio with my partners out here
Pacific Heights in the house, know what I mean
I was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga
You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
'Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send 'em upstate 'cause they straight-up hate the niggaz
So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggaz
Straight fools into rules and do niggaz
And one-time had enough of me
I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
They wanna send me to the pen, punk picture that
I stay strapped motherfuckers better get your gat
It ain't easy bein' me I can't take it
Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
And ever since the movies, these hoes try to do me
If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now, can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And aww yeah, I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
You'll get smacked behind the hill with my phone on my pager
It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor
I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous
I got no mercy for these niggaz tryin' to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop, now drop it
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's
Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
You're just another rapper who swears he's makin' records
That's what they said whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though always kept my head up high
Eventually, I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night, always comes a brighter day
And some would say that turned away is all you'll get
I just said, bet, and never let 'em see me sweat
'Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell
Yo get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
I hate the studio 'cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it till you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you and that way you can never fall
But beware these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car, nope
And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed
Remember how it felt, and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
'Cause they can all suck dick, it's strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's
Listen, this is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stickups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not Tupac will cop the glock and come knockin' to getcha
I told you once motherfucker I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked
Niggaz know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down
I'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around
And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore
Nigga, it's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin' all that shit
Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggaz that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches should've pulled the fuckin' trigga
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass, nigga
Mr.Troublesome, niggaz tried to play me with the gat
But like Terminator nigga, I'll be back
Yeah, and I'll be back with a fuckin' army
You tried to harm me, ruh-ring the alarm G!
'Cause most motherfuckers love to act up
Without they backup, when they get jacked up they crack up
It's strictly for my niggaz at the show
So they know, not to play me like a ho-ho, strictly 4 my
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz

Eat a dick up
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man
Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the ruffneck niggaz with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin' streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, 'cause either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore... theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Stickin up spots and jumpin' in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin
And always keep a hand on the gat
'Cause a niggaz straight strugglin
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin
I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun 'cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
'Cause of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dog got it goin' on
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, 'cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
'Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin' changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggaz on they back
Till I call back, niggaz runnin' free better fall back
I'm fifty niggaz deep beat sleep
With a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin' motherfuckers to the moon
Niggaz need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin
See me on the block, strugglin
And rollin' with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
I get in niggaz ass, blast
Straight strugglin
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Live back at 'cha Westside baaaaby
Aight fuck it, we gone flip some new shit now
You heard All Eyez on Me, niggaz know what time it is
Rhymin and stealin, sellin five million
Fresh out on bail, niggaz still can't see me
That's how it is
Now we got a new motherfuckin plan, and a new mission
Competition, so they say, these niggaz is gay
Blast me? It could never happen
At least not while I'm walkin' and rappin'
Heard of some niggaz on the other side of town who wanna ride wit me
They can't hide, listen to the rough shit, my click
I said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead 'n' buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll
Never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggaz get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fuckin' mo', exposin tragically
How can we find some peace and niggaz still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satin infiltratin; my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin'
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
To become a man, we sheddin tattoed tears
I said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug? HUH? WHAT?
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug?
Yo, criminal ways of thinkin' made me crave Abe Lincolns
The days I spent stinkin caught victims on the weekends
Seeking a better path, expose a better half of me
Blast for me, the task after me
For a few years sheddin tattooed tears
Like Gram' Sammy, we feudin for the whole damn family
We scarred up, homies is barred up for mad time
Outlawz locked down for some past crimes
Fast dimes made my stash grow smaller
Your block ain't no harder, fake baller
Nigga it's like this
I been thuggin' just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
That'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggaz flexin
Po-po's guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet 'em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry, but it ain't my time to either die-die
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life
For the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin tattoed tears
I said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
Shit... ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein my opprunities through these bars of hell while gettin' high
As life replays like time; underhanded schemes
To get that cream and thangs while livin' this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals dare be last mental me intitutionalize
Locked down, got many shell shocked, now
Holdin' down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style
Yo I been loosin sleep, stay awake way past late
Visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne
As I lay here gatted down and tatted
Knowin' now it's hard to slow down for a addict
It's been years of stugglin, guzzlin beers
Beefin and never even, ain't no love in the air
And I suffer my shit in hell, talkin' to the heavens
Walkin' through the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot, startin with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
I'm through with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
Step in my shoes, nuttin to lose, but my brain
I'ma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear
Ain't nothing to fear, cryin these tattooed tears
Come on...
I said many times busters still can't see

It's like all we got left - teardrops and closed caskets
Tell me how you feel homey
You recollects and see how crazy it sounds
Since birth, eyes set on gettin' bigger
Just anotha wild-ass nigga
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus
Seein visions of people smokin' and niggaz catchin vapors
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin'
Still no one's knowin', so they kept goin'
But wait a minute back to Precious
She's snortin dope in the back seat of Trigg's Lexus
Teardrops and closed caskets
Hopin God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighbourhood kingpin, who's gettin' bigger
Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
But Precious was lonely while Lil' Trigga was makin' dough
She's slippin in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo
The neighbourhood's buzzin, now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'
How his baby's mama could disapear with another man
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'
Just the smoke from the cap peelin a man with no feelings
Teardrops and closed caskets
Bury you dead and look ahead
A man with no feelings
That's all we got left, that's all
Now with the problems of poverty
And the tricks to these tales
How many people'll die
How many'll live to tell
Although best friends before
Lil' Trigga and Mo
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out
Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out
All the while let's look at Precious
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin ki's
I can't believe the shit they tellin' me
They open fire, three bodies drop, so call the cops
Teardrops and closed caskets
Teardrops and closed caskets
We dedicate this to all the fallen comrades
All the homies that didn't make it to see this day
With teardrops and closed caskets
It's like that's all we got to look forward to these days
Murders, brothers dyin', funerals
I done ran out of tears
Know we gon' have to do somethin' y'all
We gon' have to do somethin'
Teardrops and closed caskets
I send this out to M'thulu Geronimo
And to, all the fallen comrades, all the soldiers
May God bless your families
May you always live in the motherfuckin heart
Rest in peace nigga
May your enemies be deceased, dead on the streets
We can't have peace till the niggaz get a piece
Yo Mo Bee main, drop that shit!
Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy
You know what time, boo-yaow
I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand youknowhatI'msayin
And uh, throw up that finger
Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?
Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, 'cause I get caught up
And the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
The day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin' and you lookin' good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
Witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony
'Cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crack game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...
Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy
Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go...
Give them the finger!
Ya know what baby it's like
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by
Everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven
Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...
Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy
Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go...
Throw your fingers up!
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
A lot of people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin'
See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was
Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy
Give 'em the finger
And all my homies go...
Yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?

Oh shit! Jumped on my man's dick
Heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie?
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me
Ooh-wee! This is the life
New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
Don't try to flip with the lip 'cause I run shit
Hip hip, hooray for the AK
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day
Make pay, next is the wet sex
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check
Bloody as a Kotex, snappin motherfuckers' necks
Revenge so sweet when it comes from
Niggaz get done with the drum, watch my foes run
Nigga keeps comin' when they can't slip
Full of that shit, another hit from Tha' Lunatic
Yeah, fuck that God! Word up
Blowin' niggaz out the motherfuckin frame yaknahmsayin?
Constantly... fuck that trick, we ain't havin' it
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las
'Cause I'm nothin' nice and, I'm icin like Tyson
I'm grippin the mic and, my DJ is slicin
I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin to me with the SAME OLD
Tryin' to do me like Nintendo
How the fuck you think I ever got this far?
By bootin motherfuckers like a shootin star
'Cause I'm out to show, that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin, wait'll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick like a motherfuckin condom
Niggaz wanna flip, let 'em step, and I'll bomb 'em
See somethin' you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin' there, wonder where your money went
While your bitch is callin me, tellin' me to come again
Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin' like a bitch, cause your whole fuckin' posse, broke out
Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
Feel the wrath... and revenge of Tha' Lunatic
Yeah Tu', tell them motherfuckers, word up
We ain't havin' it, NONE of that shit!
Bitch ass niggaz, niggaz can't fuck with us Tu', word up
Ninety-one, we takin' this WHOLE motherfucker over
Niggaz got PROBLEMS in ninety-one
Ninety-two, and ninety-three
And all that other shit, word up!
Recognize game when it smacks you, bitch I'm back to rip
Puttin' this on the map with this mackin shit
Time will tell if it's made well
Well I raise hell and excel cause it pays well
Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
I'm funky, that's word to the father
Act like you know 'fore I thump, the bolo
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin for my solo
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin that he's ruthless
Ducked, and now he's fucked and left toothless
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin', I guess I let the beat keep bumpin
Stop trippin' off these niggaz 'cause they ain't about nuttin
Or should I say NAYthin
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
I'm sick of the bullshit
Come equipped and get ready to rip
Or get the dick of Tha' Lunatic
YouknowhatI'msayin? Yes Tu'!
Tell them niggaz what time it is knahmsayin?
Niggaz can't fuck with us, word up
Bitch ass niggaz, FUCK EM!
Fuck all them niggaz
I'm tellin' these niggaz that they ain't got...
NAYthin on a nigga like me
We squashin these punk motherfuckers in ninety-one
Ninety-two ninety-three... and SO on
So let the beat FLOAT on
While I spray these PUNK BITCHES
With these dope ass lyrics
Thanks to Poppa for supplyin the DANK
Now it's money in the BANK
And all y'all niggaz shit STANK
Compared to this shit...
Fuck y'all punk bitches!
Tha' Lunatic
These is hard times we livin' in
Churches burnin, planes fallin' from the sky
Murder, the good die young
The good definitely die young
This is a lil' somethin'
To help you get through the day
If you could
It was more than a tragedy
Emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky
We tryin' to figure what happened
Burnin' churches, fearin' God
Who can be so cruel
We all ignorant to AIDS
Till it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans
Listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions
We should leave them a choice
Cause who are we to say who lives and die
Breathes and stops
All this judgement on other lives
Needs to stop
What are we livin' for
Givin' more back than takin'
On my knees still waitin' for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned
Cause Pat Buchanan say I'm greedy
You can take my taxes, send me to war
But can't feed me
It's so easy to regret things
After they done
Babies catchin' murder cases
Scared to laugh in the sun
The tragedies that we all need
Love in doses
In times like these we feel closest
The good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Now in my world will it get worse
When I been trapped since birth
But I had to sleep in a hearse
Cause it was my bed first
My grands probably burnin'
Turnin' in they grave
Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin' like a star
And this murder got me
Feelin' like my death ain't far
And the land of stolen cars
Don't get no better
Don't get no weaker or no harder
I was raised in a rush without my moms
And my father
So tell me somethin'
If I grab my gat and get the dumpin'
Would God get to lookin' at me funny
Rest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale
Rest in peace to my father Salek Beale
Rest in peace to my grandparents
And thug in peace to my brother Seike
You know I love you
Which is worst, first Storm and then Al
Pac and then Yak
Redrey Brown
Coulda' sworn I seen ya face in a cloud
Family grievin' on your last breath
Close to the heart whether you know it or not
I swear the love won't stop
Jewel, that's my boo
Mom, Duke and Lou
From jump
You kept it true, helped to feed the crew
The good die young
Livin' fast jumpin' the gun
Mama blamin' the community for killin' her son
My cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'
But never knowin' he was dyin' slower
I guess I see ya when I see ya soulja
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
I know my life ain't promised
That's why the wise move in silence
Analize these scandalous times
It's hard dogg but we manage
Schools turn to war zones
Even homes unsafe
Leavin' children to play caged and raged
They hate, how come
Someone explain why the good die young
Why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
It's time somethin' is done
For our young kids
They growin' hopeless
That ain't the way to live
Tell me why
Days go past and as they pass
Time move quicker
No time for wastin'
Put your hustle down my young dealers
Cause the end is nearer
But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers
Ain't ridin' 4 3 felonys
It's time to plan, plot, and strategize
Capitolize, mobilize
We in the war y'all
It's for all y'all
My family to the ones that stand me
Little bit mo' love is what's recommended
Yeah, and it's plain to see
The seeds from you and me
Gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity
That's if we treat them right
Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does
But if you don't
Man, we sho' to be done
And we'll all see exactly why the good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
I send this out for all my homeboys that passed away
And all yo' homeboys that passed away
I send this out to all the former fallen soldiers
That's in the cemeteries buried
Never got to see they dreams
For everything I touch you touch
For every step I take you take
For every breath I breathe you breathe
Every dollar I make you make
I told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day
You just got there a little quicker
But like my homeboys Thugs say
I'll catch ya at the crossroads
The good die young
This song is dedicated to all them
Young kids that died innoccent
That died young
At Columbine High
Outlawz
Lil' young Xzandafer
Tasha, all them
All the fallen kids
The dead babies
The closed caskets
Yo, Red Spider...
Is that 50 Cent and Pac ready?
Lemme know, holla
It's go'n be some stuff you go'n see
That's go'n make it hard to smile in the future
Yeah nigga... ha ha
Lets go nigga, dis is what it is
Tupac cut his head bald, then you want to cut yo head bald
Tupac put a cross on his back, You wanna put crosses on yo back
Nigga, you ain't Tupac
Is it
Money and women, funny beginning's tragic ending's
I can make a million and still not get enough of spendin'
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound
Rather be buried that be worried, livin' held down
Yo, that shit is crazy Whoo Kid
Bring that muthafuckin beat back man
It's go'n be some stuff you go'n see
That's go'n make it hard to smile in the future
Yeah nigga... ha ha
Lets go nigga, dis is what it is
Tupac cut his head bald, then you want to cut yo head bald
Tupac put a cross on his back, You wanna put crosses on yo back
Nigga, you ain't Tupac
Is it
Money and women, funny beginning's tragic ending's
I can make a million and still not get enough of spendin'
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound
Rather be buried that be worried, livin' held down
My game plan to be trained in
Military mind of a thug lord sittin' in a cemetery cryin
I've been lost since my adolescence calling for Jesus
Ballin' as a youngster wondering if he see's us
Young black males
Crack sales got me three strikes
Livin' in jail this is hell enemies die
Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listnin'
Got my hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitchin'
Please god can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all before we fall into insanity
I'm makin' a point to make my beatin' bumpin' raw life
Drop some shit to make these stupid bitches jaw tight
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's go'n be- go'n be
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we go'n see- go'n see
This is a cry for mercy, I promise
My success would be the death of you
Low and behold, you sold ya soul, there's nothing left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself, who are you
If you don't know who you are, how could ya dreams come true
Muthafucka, I sat backed and watched ya, you pretended to be Pac
I see it so clear, you can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me, and chills, run up ya spine
God made menace in war, but ya heart ain't like mine
And plus, they look at me like I'ma menace
I was playing wit guns, while ya momma had you and yo friends playing tennis
I'ma nightmare, you see me in ya dream
Wake up, and turn on ya TV and see my ass again
You cowardly hearted, you couldn't make it on ya own
Fuck the source, I'm on the cover of rolling stone
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's go'n be- go'n be
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gonna be- gonna be
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gonna see- gonna see
Growing up as an inner city brotha
Where every other had a pops and a motha
I was tha product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
And since my pops never knew me
My family didn't know what ta do with me
Was I somebody they despise
Curious look in they eyes
As if they wonder if I'm dead or alive
Poor momma can't control me
Quit tryin' ta save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies
A ticken timebomb
Can't nobody fade me
Packin' a 380
And fiendin' for my mercedes
Suckers scatter
But it don't matter I'm a cool shot
Punks drop from all tha buckshots tha fools got
I'm tired of being a nice guy
I've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
So they label me a lunatic
Could care less
Death or success
Is what I quest
'Cause I'm fearless
Now tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
I just murdered a man, I'm even more stressed
Wearin' a vest
Hopein' that their aimin' at my chest
Much too young to bite tha bullet
Hand on tha trigga
I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in tha state
Penn
Counting pennys over tha years
I'd done stacked many
Proven wrong those
Who swore I'd wouldn't live till twenty
Now they gotta cope
Since it's tha only thing I know
It's difficult to let it go
I'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause I worry
Hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
But now I gotta move away now
Cause these suckers wanna spray where I lay down
My homie lost his family and snapped
Shot up half tha block to bring them back
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
I'm dangerous
When drunk I only drink beer
Gin makes me sin
Unable to think clear
Heneesee, makes me think my enemy is getting close
Boom boom boom
Got me shooting at a ghost
Some call me crazy
But this is what you gave me
Amongst tha babies, who raised up from tha slavery
I sport a vest and hit tha sess to kill tha stress
Moved out west and I invest in all tha best
Those who test will find a bullet in they chest
Put ta rest
By a brotha who was hopeless
Grow up broke on tha rope of insanity
How many pistols smoking coming from a broken family
I'm sick of being tired
Sick of tha sirens, body bags, and tha gun firing
Tell bush to push tha button 'cause I'm fed
Tired of hearin' these voices in my head
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
This goes out to my partners in tha Live Squad
And all my homies out there involved in that 187
Watch your back...
There got to be a better way...
There's too many of us in tha cemetery
I love it when they fear me
Come on, what we gonna do now
I love it when they fear me
Tha streetz R Deathrow
There you go... acting like a hoe...
Was it the liqour
That makes me act blind?
The times I'm with her
Anonomous pictures
Of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her, or shall I dis her
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin' to paint a perfect picture!
My memoriez of jealousy no longer care free...
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriendz keep tellin' me
I'm on tour but now my bedroomz an open door
So it got me thinking what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb
Eager to please, a lil'Trick on a mission tryin' 2 get'em a piece
Me and my niggaz is Thug niggaz!, former known Drug Dealerz!
We don't love bitchez!, and believe they don't love niggaz!
I got'em playing my attraction
But you became a distraction a threat to my paper stacking
I thought you'd change, but now I know
Can't turn a hoe into a house wife baby
And there you go...
There you there you go, acting like a hoe
There you there you go, acting like a hoe!
There you there you go, acting like a hoe
Acting like a hoe, acting like a hoe!
See tha word on tha streetz you're a... hoe
Just a groupie on a world tour... hoe
Now I find out for myself you're a... hoe
Girl you need to check yourself...
These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim'em, just bang'em...
Papa raised a playa, so playa I'll play'em
I got hoez, that got more hoez than me
So how I look getting hooked like I ain't got G
Truly, cutie, booty big!
But that ain't enough
And tha head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, bitch be lying too much
She be dying to fuck me, you be buying tha stuff...
See old friend I know...
Your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown town coast to coast see
I been trying to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that shiesty shit that you do
Knew from jump you aim
Straight through them spandex don't front just name
Spots on your body for me 2 touch while ya clutch this game
I keep flowin' like h2o
It ain't nothin' for me to say why you keep actin' like a hoe but there you go
When I first met her I told her I was busy all the time
Now she call me flippin' like she miss me all the time
How she gonna even trip she got a man at home
You need to stop chasing dick, bitch and raise your son
I'm like damn we can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time
Girl ya thirsty and stop callin' while I'm workin'
Ya hurting me all this bullshit is hurtin' me girl
There you go
I blame it on ya momma she need to holla at you
Or should I blame it on your daddy for all the thinds that you do
'Cause there you go just like a hoe caught in the streets
Like giving your number out to every nigga you meet
I'm tired of games you playin', so stop playin'
You hear what I'm sayin' you only good for parlayin'
I'm laying down the rules, it's a game that you lose
So the streets can have you baby 'cause I stay on the move
Y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured
And just looked at the whole situation
Cause once you look at it
You know
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody give a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
Some say niggaz is hard headed 'cause we love to trick
Equipped with game so we bang wit this thuggish shit
I see you trying to hide, Hoping that nobody don't notice
You must always remember you're still a member of the hopeless
See ya black like me, So you snap like me
When these devils try to plot, Trap our young black seeds
Look it, Cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin'
Lookin' for role models, Our father figures is bases
Some say they expect Illuminate take my body to sleep
Niggas at the party with they shotties, Just as rowdy as me
Before I flee computer chips, I gotta deal wit brothas flippin'
I don't see no devils bleedin', Only black blood drippin'
We can change, whatcha now say?
Whatever it takes to switch places wit the bustas on top
I'm bustin' shots make the world stop
They don't give a fuck about us
And if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
And if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did 'cause they saying you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons dawg, I don't doubt you
See the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
No including yourself, All you want is wealth they perceiving itas greed
So as you loaded up that mack and continue to buck 'em
I was on paper, Thinking they don't give a fuck about us
I'm seeing it clearer
Hating the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior
So why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watching my nation die, genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath, The aftermath is y'alls
I told ya last album, we need help 'cause we dying
Give us a chance, help us advance 'cause we trying
Ignore my whole plea, watching us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They don't give a fuck about us
And if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
And if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
Now all my homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply
Now that's love, Shit
Nobody else could give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down
Six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong
How long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song
Ain't gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame 'em?
Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck
I don't, feel what I'm saying?
Now thug niggaz die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic, Or closed casket for our troubles
Present times, We busted like bubbles
With the police, This nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Man I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain
So I spent your time in poor and working
I see no reason, So I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinking that they give a fuck?
You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga your lying
Cause half of my niggas, long gone,
Buried in the dirt just for trying
Sometimes I think my block is dying, And that it's awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't change that awful
I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
While I'm layin' in the coffin
The shit comes around so often, So tell me something
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
Nigga I been so through pain go through the struggle
Doin' the same thing you did at my age and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin'
Well since you don't give a fuck, you frontin'
And I'ma drink my Hennessey like it ain't nothin'
Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
While I'm kickin' rhymes, getting to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die, they kick us every time we try
They don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm getting high, I'm watching as the world goes by
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
While I'm kickin' rhymes, getting to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die, they kick us every time we try
They don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm getting high, I'm watching as the world goes by
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
Get your money nigga get your money!
Rise my nation rise
They don't give a fuck about us... rise
Get your asses on the right path nigga
They don't give a fuck about us
Get your money nigga get your money!
2Pac
This Ain't Livin'
This ain't livin'...
Nigga - I hear even the smaller G's be dippin Chevy Impalas
While flossin they gold D's, O.G.'s, is who they follow
We swallow tomorrow see, what we leave is hollow
We feed violence and greed, let 'em bleed tomorrow
In time, they grip a nine, sippin wine - hit grass
Till I be starin' watch the parents sacrifice they child
The love's gone, a thug's home, with no love
Feelin' so strong, make young boys into drug lords
Now one for adolescents, now dos for dose
Keep yo' friends by your side, even close your foes
Now three for Johnny Law tryin' to make my chips
I never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch
Throw yo' hands in the air, it's a robbery
... Thinkin' 'Pac, would you ride with me
Let's go see what our enemies talkin' bout
When G's enter the house nobody's walkin' out
This ain't livin', it's similar to prison, we trapped
My homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
I watch my back twenty-fo' seven
And never let a busta send a G to ghetto heaven, you know!
This is how it goes when we floss with foes
Before I toss yo' hoe, it'll cost you mo'
I do shows make a lot of dough, murder my foes
But I'd give it all up, if it would help you grow
This ain't livin'
Can't find a better way to break you
This ain't livin' I gotta do what I gotta do
Peep it - gunfire is produced at alarmin rates
Today's youth, grip the shit, get in the car and break
It Takes a Nation of Millions if we intend to stop the killin'
They our seeds and when they bleed, we bleed
That's what becomes of lonely children, they turn to G's
Heavenly father can you rescue, my young nation
Rest the Lord will protect you, respect due
Not a threat as I step in blue, and check those
That oppose when I froze them fools, and who are you
To watch me fall farther
I disappeared, reappeared as the ... follow me now
Skippin class, and livin' fast, will get yo' ass
Stuck in the pen, doin' life plus ten
Young brother pump yo' brakes for me, before you choke
Won't ya soak up some game from yo' big homies
This ain't livin', we givin' you jewelsl, use 'em as tools
Explode on they industry and fade them fools
You know the rules, gotta be a rider
You can run the red lights but read the street signs, hey
This for all of y'all that keep on raisin hell
Put a pistol in your hand and let you fade yourself
It ain't right, what you put your momma through, young G
Gotta change your life, take the game from me
This ain't livin'
This motherfucking life I lead, shit
A hell of motherfucking road blocks and crooked cops
We still ride though
What side?
Westside
I want money in large amounts my garage full of cars that bounce
Moving my tapes in major ways cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these nigas is punks
They running off at the mouth till I fill up with my pump
They jump my automatic keep them weary
While you fronting like you Billy bad ass nigga you scary
I been knowing you for years we was high school peers iIn Junior High
I was itchin' to kill and you was ready to die
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leaving no trace they see my face and then they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry still I ride I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live my nigga it's how it is
Homie got into a fight last night they killed his kids
In this life I lead fiend for currency

Been blessed for sure to eat from out the ghetto

When you see me nigga

Steady seducing us and I'm all for it
It's the life for me and the law can't spoil it
My mamma ain't raise no punk and even dead Pac
So when I jump off I breathe for Yak
Been puttin' in work so I walk with a bop
Thug living Ugh what the fuck would be better
I do my dirt with the family so we dying together
We on a mission for mo' gangster shit on you hoes
We ain't fucking with you lawyers crossing niggas up out there dough
Trying to live Godzilla Edi went from a bad boy
To a anybody killer Look out
Wanted man guns in hand stand firm
Nuts are my pride now lets burn
Bound and profound going down swinging
Holding my ground we the last ones breathing
No stopping till we eating deep in the trenches

You gotta watch your back stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt

And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun

Love within a storm
First it was nothin', not even, a fake?
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes
Thought I'd never feel this way again
And you were supposed to reach my heart
And find love within, love, love
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me
Wonderful
I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near
Any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly disappeared
It was re-birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend
'Cause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again
Fall in love again, in a storm
Just when I thought I'd seen it all
Our paths crossed, amen
And I knew, from the first glance
That you, would be hard to forget
Your eyes, attracted me first
But you reeked of sultry confidence
I couldn't wait, to touch lips
And kiss, with my heart's intention
When we didn't, was what I expected
And for that moment, we erased the tension
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters
And the initial blind date, first impressions
We kissed again; and I felt the passion
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessin'
We made love, within a storm
In the midst of passion and chaos
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder
Those who prevail this drama
Will learn to bring their love farther
But now, the storm has past
And the seas of our friendship are gone
But as long as I live, I will remember
The love within a storm
Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love
Ya know that I miss you, and love you
Ya know that Tupac broke my heart
We need to hear ya, hear ya voice
They say, this ghetto fabulous
On 125th street forkin' around
This village, and the village uptown
South Central, Compton, Philly
Sha-Town, Southside
It's hot in 'Lanta, hot in 'Lanta
Jersey peeps, I hear ya
Miami, South Beach, uh
Yeah, got love for you, love for you
My Brooklyn knights lovin' you, lovin' me
This open, rich city
Ya know, I got love for you
Put me in the car JoJo

Heh heh, yeah, maybe it's the thug in me
Yeah, that type of shit
You know what time it is
Maybe it's the thug in me
By Age thirteen I was buck wild
Good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood
Never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man

Now I can't wait to get you home
Get you all alone

Into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly
Switch and How it supposed to be?
And Dirty money
Can't be evil 'cause it's filling up my tummy see
Born in a position
Death collision
Was futuristic
Twisting riches
But there is only one way to make mo'
So I'm standing on the corner
Trying to hustle in the snow
And My bigga bro
Couldn't know
But buy a four four
Blasting at playa hating
Wantin' mo'
With a Thug Passion
Putting down mashin'
Control by this Thug's Passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin'
I'm asking, What Happened?
To the niggas who kept it real
Like they claim to
That's when I bang do
See thang true
Traveling this road my poor soul
Has been consolidated
With all this bullshit I done tolerated
How I made it
Can easily stated
It's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
To be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit
Make this to some high dollar gangster shit
Jack a stack till we got enought bank to split
Creep with me
Through that Imortal flow
Thug Passion got you tremblin'
Like Death on the Row
Make your move
So I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowin' up tha scene
Like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke
As your heart goes full arrest
I got tha bomb
So nigga, fuck tha rest
Ya need a 3rd to get ya flowin'
And let that loc see smoke
Feelin' tha strokes of tha nine squeeze tight and slow
They say money don't make tha man
But damn I'm makin' money
Observin' you muthafuckers
Cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it
But you bullshitin'
Lickin' them lips
You got me about to act a fool quick
Sippin' on some Alize and Cristal, meanwhile
Buy me a drink
And get to winking at me
She smiles
A niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlastin'
How does it feel?
What I'm askin'
While I'm rubbin' on that ass
Why you laughin' ?
See, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious
Baby get a grip
When I be doin' this
It's so physical
My attraction
Driven by alcohol
Beware of my reaction
Baby I'm born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize
And picture what I said so
Now you can feel it
It's a potion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin'
Bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G
We ain't dead yet, hit me!
I got my Hennessy find ya foes
In a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm getting high off buddha
'Cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough
You never find me broke
And who meee a nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep living in these wicked times
Peep, niggas after me 'cause they see I'm stacking G's and heat
You can holler if you want to pleeease
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew bleeeed
Enemies and my range is on
You're in the danger zone
My fuckin' game is strong, Hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
From hustling and busting them rhymes
To my niggas up in Quentin
Down on Riker's Isle stay rile
But a nigga gotta use his styles
These,
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
It's like they stuck
From making niggas duck from Glocks all the time
My mind's full of thoughts of ends
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Cause in the dark see they hearts' full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell
Straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucka screaming like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the morning
Only the strong survive
I cry but in my own way
Swallow my pride pick a reason to hide
Cemetery full of brothers I buried
It's going down even now I wonder
Will I still be around my hometown is the gutter
I was born a wild came up out this dust
With my heartless style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
I remember Uptown huh got to get to listenin'
To Mr. Magic cuttin' up the hits
And even though I had habit makin' words rhyme
I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
And Pete and Lee young G's
With a gift of gab and tryin' to hook up with the hookers
Who was quick to stab remember mama's cooking
No school straight hookin'
And tryin' to get with light skinned
'Cause she good looking
And jumpin' over turnstiles 'cause we ain't paying
I'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot
'Cause my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
Had to move to the West to regain my style
These,
Chorus till end with ad libs
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasin' me around
And it's always drama
Whevever I wanna get around
Mama told me
Long before I ever came up
Gotta be true, to watchya' do
And keep ya' game up
'Cause things change
And jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wifes house tryin' to mack her!
I'm on tour
But still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry
I'm steady wantin' more
Every day is a test, yes
I try hard
But I'm strugg-a-lin' with every breath
I pray to God that the woman that I left at home
All alone
Ain't nothin' like tryin' to bone
Over the phone
In my mind
I can see her naked
I can't take it
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew.
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad 'cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
I call you up long distance
On the telephone
I wanna tuck you in
Even though I know I can't make it home
I whisper things in your' ear
Like your near me
Wonder if you feel me
From far away
Or can you hear me
It seems to me
That your' jealous
'Cause I'm hustlin' and makin' money
With the fellas'
In the back streets
Tryin' to trap me
Baby hold up
Thugs get lonely too!
But I'm a soulja
And there's no way I'm a' stop makin' money
'Cause your' attitudes changed
And your' actin' a little funny
Always complainin'
Sayin' we don't spend time
Can't you see
I got enough stress on my mind
And hangin' up like you all that
And get mad when I'm tell you that
I'm busy baby call back
Please, ain't nothin' left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too
You know.
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad 'cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
I sit alone in my room, drinkin'
Without a care
Talkin' out loud to you'
Like your' there
Take your' picture out my back pocket
Man it's on
You the first face I wanna see
When I get home
I wanna love you till the sun rise
Buckwild
Touchin' every wall in the house
Thug style
Put your' hands on the headboard
Think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you
Sick of scenes in yo' head
That I'm makin' love
So turn the lights down
Reminice 'n' relax
'Cause baby right now
I feel in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear
Baby tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly
Watch the ceiling
Scratch my back
How you react
Lets me know you feel me
'Cause everything I'm givin' to you
Is so true
Thugs get lonely too
You know.
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad 'cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
Yeah! 
Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You na'mean?
Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga, that's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At Thug Mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and would have tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the sky...
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the sky...
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion
Dear Mama don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, till the day came
Little LaTasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in 'Thugz Mansion'
Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggaz need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Ya know what I mean? Where do niggaz go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
... At thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind

We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessey, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rolling by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm trying to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ozzie Davis, grey hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much suffering
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
Where angels soar, with golden wings in 'Thugz Mansion'
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday

Little LaTasha sure grown

Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion
No doubt... to live and die in LA
California -- what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
And everybody got love
To live and die in LA, where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knok it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin
Worldwide through the hard times, worryin faces
Shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark, cold hearted 'bout it
Nigga got smoked by a fiend, tryin' to floss on him
Blind to a broken man's dream, a hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessin, plea bargain
Ain't an option now, so I'm stressin, cost me more
To be free than a life in the pen
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset likin this sin
What's the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
To live and die in LA on bail, my angel sing
To live and die in LA, it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
What everybody wanna see
It's the, City of Angels and constant danger
South Central LA, can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggaz gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen the right across from hell, I can't cry
'Cause it's on now, I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life Thug style, so I can't smile
Writin to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches, hahaha
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggaz copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love woman
'Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of Thug in him
We might fight with each other, but I promise you this
We'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in LA
'Cause would it be LA without Mexicans?
Black love brown pride in the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke, I'm on some bullshit
Out for everything they owe, remember K-DAY
Weekends, Crenshaw -- MLK
Automatics rang free, niggaz lost they way
Gang signs being showed, nigga love your hood
But reconize and it's all good, where the weed at?
Niggaz gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this muhfucka burned out, M.O.B.
Big Suge in the Low-Low, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex, wit a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggaz with me, OFTB
They got some hash took the stash left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Head Ron, Punchy too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin it pay
Gettin' high watchin time fly, to live and die in LA
This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin my shit
Makin' my shit sells katruple quatraple platinum, hehe
This go out to all the magazines that supported me
All the real motherfuckers
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A&R people, all y'all motherfuckers
LA, California Love part motherfuckin Two
Without gay ass Dre
No doubt... to live and die in LA
California -- what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
And everybody got love
To live and die in LA, where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knok it
