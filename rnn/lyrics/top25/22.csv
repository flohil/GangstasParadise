Stuntin on them niggas, gettin' money stayin fly every day a nigga spendin
Ridin' 25s and we blazin' gettin' high, nigga showin off his ride
Crusin through the beach nigga rollin' in them bimmers
Them people pull me over hatin' 'cause they can't see us

I ain't have to touch a piece of work since '94
I lost my daddy in '96 and started makin' moves
In '98 (I got a brand new lexus coupe)
(Now them laws won't leave me alone)
They pull me over, lock me up, I bail out on my own
I call my poppa on the phone, tell him cook up a zone
I leave a house with a pocket full of stones
Got them hoes slangin, hidin packs in they titties
Them small chest bitches gotta put it in they butt
(20s in them they can't fuck wit us)
I got so many hoes

And however you own it
You can get it tonight hoe
And all night hoe

Fuckin' right hoe
I might go crazy on these niggas
I Don't give a fuck
Run up in a nigga house.
And shot his grandmother up
What? What I don't give a fuck
Get ya baby kidnapped and ya baby mother fucked
It's the Carter 3 bitch
Better put your supper up
Holly Grove I throw it up
Like I'm tryin' to lose my gut
Fuck is up, Beat 'em up
Like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffeled up
For the fuck of it
Shit, get on my level
You can't get on my level
You will need a space shuttle
Or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better
If not now then never
Don't ever fix your lips
Unless you 'about to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words
Taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty
Spit it back at me
2 more inches I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor
I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches like magic
Abra Kadabra, I'm up like Viagra
I could do this shit for my clique like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop & I'm a keep it on my channel.
Watch me
Bitch, watch me
Bitch, watch me
But they cannot see me
Like Hitler, it's the New Orleans nightmare
Money so old it's growing white hair
Young Money baby
Yeah be right here
I'm a make sure we ball
Till we fall like tears
And mama don't cry
Your son can handle his
I got her out tha hood
And put 'er in tha hills
Yeah, when I was 14 I tolds my mom
""We will see better days""
And sure enough
I got Ms.Cetha in a betta place
Yeah, when I was 14 I told my mom
""We will see better days""
And sure enough
We did exactly what I said
I tell my girl ""When you fuck me,
Better fuck me good""
'Cause if another girl could
She gonna fuck me good
No sittin' at tha table
If you bringin' nothin' to it
And I get straight to it
Like there's nothin' to it
Yeah, I got game like Stuart
Scott, fresh out tha ESPN Shop
And when Sports Center poppin'
Everything stoppin'
But you can't fool me
I know what you watchin'.
Me! You watch me
You watch me

But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said ""You's an ill nigga""
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The haters music to my ears, I got my dancing shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on ""I don't give a fuck"" Avenue
(Hook] + [Bridge)
Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on a hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
How can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there"

She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail
In this ""give or take"" world I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'mma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh
No lights but them infrared lights
Long life, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby

Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Ready, set, go
Go, go, go, go
Go till you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
""Westside bitch!"" Quote/unquote
Whoa there boy, don't go there ho
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named ""Big"" got bodied?
But every rapper named ""Sean"" got money?
Well I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20 so I be counting a hundred 100's

I spend all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
They want these bullets to book it for me
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin' broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gonna book report me

Made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I don't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your own girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with ME when she tells you she needs some ""me time""
It's our time, so fuck y'all
I'm really about to go Spring Break now start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl

Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the locks in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long till they can see the lights
And I'm on one, I got one

32,Asthma Team,2009,"Young Money All Stars, Part 2 (2009)",Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"Swear to you, Lord
Same dudes that used to laugh at me
See me in the CL6 with half a B
They know that money begets money, so naturally
Me, I have to blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
'Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two partners in that caprice
With no copies made, I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mold you rappers like plaster, see
I have the dreams but dog, me and success are two things
You don't wanna find your ass between
Back against the wall like a plasma screens
The inside of my wallet is pasture green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while is smash the scene
I should leave Earth, it's nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and every night is new years
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these skeptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all
Family, money and music is all I ever knew
My neck will suffer from depression
It is forever blue
Cheer up baby, You don't see all this revenue
I started the game at level two, I'm saying
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel flying spur Tony Park it
And it's cool if you spill something it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colors only dark shit
If Toronto's where you living today
Then you ain't making records the people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move
Sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints
I'm giving away
You feel me?"

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle

Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

I give props and every other extra credit that I can

No homo but please blow me to Japan
Ok I'm getting hotter ima need another fan

Always trying to be better than I am
Label me the best and in the throne I will stand
Why? Because I'm just a stand up guy

Take no nights off do my days the same
And people change but fuck it, nothin' stays the same
And naw I ain't speaking so don't wave the blame
Lock me up but you can never cave the brain
Gasoline, king vision if my gaze is flames
No you cannot stop my vibe
Couple page a game, dang a-gain?
Yup well give me some crazy frames
And if this camera shoots me, then Lord save my chains
Lord save the rings I am way too vain
Listening to that Kanye again
I play the game like, I made the game
You playin' like you tryna get traded man
And you ain't gotta call me the greatest man
But I am more of a dog than the greatest Dane
You boys actin' like ladies man
Crying like you bout to have babies man
And you can find me grindin on the days it rain

Yeah life is a bitch but I appreciate her man
Yeah life is a bitch but I appreciate her man
(Lil Wayne - Verse 2)
It go dark ass shades, I can't see them haters

Pistol in your mouth I cannot make out what you tryna say
And if they want a war, tell them mother fuckers bombs away
All these bitches and niggas still hatin'

Ya dig, Santana
Weezy F.
Ay Wayne
What up man
What you been workin' on nigga?
Oh you know, I got Currency's new album
And prolly workin' on my album, ya dig
Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga
That's what it is
But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together
That's that ""I Can't Feel My Face Shit"" they know that
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
Guess what, we already did
I'm feelin' like a black Republican
Naw, I can't call it
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office
Young Barack Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Tikara
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, flier than an ostrich
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish
Money buried behind my house like a garden
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high
Higher than turbulence is
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims
Its get rich, go to jail and be a murder victim
Ai!
Now all y'all listen
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen
I feel like a black Republican
Tote a MAC'n Republican
Act so southern 'n' die for my brethren
Money, money, money
Like money Mac and publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets call but the heat make me feel covenant
Been done had cake day late like Anne Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom 'n' them
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politick
But I get all in her mouth like parlithins
New always represent it to the inner
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep
Pick a nigga's ass up like he got somewhere to be
And we wanna let the world know
This is not a diss song either people
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig
Recognize or step aside, ya dig
We let the music talk, Draught 3
And by the way, it's Santana, I'm back
It's Weezy!
You dudes gotta stand in the mirror backwards 'cause you can't face yourself

Hustlas make the world go round

See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta cake in the oven now watch it bubble
And you can knock on my door
But you can't knock the hustle
But I- it's like a game of twenty-one and I got nineteen
And my Jake but I put more'd' on me
Lil Weezy Wee gon eat that's how it is
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens
Me and my squad in the paddy waggy tally Benz
And you know I put the mags on that
.45 mack with the flash on that
Who want it
Everybody sing along
Now I'ma ride 'cause I got riding in my bloodline
And I'ma shine 'cause I got shining in my bloodline
I get that dough 'cause I got hustle in my bloodline
I bleed concrete
And when I move, I move out with the raw
I move out with the squad
Then to his album we ride we so mob
I throw lives and loaves to live
For my loaf of bread the people's player
I did what the culture said
And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead
This kid in white with buttonholes inside that bled
I'm pumping o's of lots of haze
I'm so high and really I don't even know why
But oh I just go buy a whole house
And lay my mat down lay her back down
But I never put my mack down
You see the thug in me
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-B
All my basketball shorts where the thunder B
If you want it then come for me
I'm right here
I'm G'd up
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the day with no food
But just so I can eat
And ain't it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can come see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
My fate and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints
'Cause I did and I do shit that's better than new shit
Fit for two clips

Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music
And the Blueprint

Nice tires on the 'Ghini
You should wanna king me
Brain dead flow, vegetable zuchini
I live on the beach
She walk around in her bikini
Girls are like a school
And I cut 'em like seniors
I'm here to distinguish
The bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap,
Get some money in between it
Glocks like police
Pumps like FEMAs
This beat gettin' totaled
Pam, Keisha, Kema
Sittin' on the world
Thinkin' 'bout a girl
Pistol on my side
Paint you like mural
Dig in my pocket
Pulled out a party
Be cool before you get stumped and pulled out the party
H-H-Hollygrove shit, I'm on my Hollygrove shit
Lookin' for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church like a choir and a couple of old priest-es
Elevator in my crib 'cause it's five floors
I'm not expectin' you to have one inside yours
Vince Young, suicide doors
Life's a bitch, now die for her
(Verse Two - Short Dawg)
I have the type of flow niggas don't have to like
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don't have to write
The way I'm eating niggas wish they had my appetite
Straight up out of Texas and I'm major like Apple white
I pull four then I hit the exit door
Take a trip to Macy's cop the whole second floor
Hood smell the scent of money coming out my pores
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, boy
I made it from a flier to the Forbes, (see me)
Young Elvis Freshly, yes he flier than the store
Dropping babies out and your chicks cheek, kicks neat
Got your son looking up to me like I'm 6 feet
Your daughter need someone to save her, not me
I knocking hoes down like Layla Ali
Try he and I'm a put the toaster to ya kidney
Then I pull off in a Bentley top open like a chimney
Damn, it's no ceilings like a Colosseum
Candy slab, paint dripping like gonorrhea
The way I'm leaning I'm annoyed if I stand still
Flow harder than an anvil
Short
(Verse Three - Gudda Gudda)
Okay, it's Gudda hoe
All about my Bills like Buffalo
Your bitch under my sheets
I heard she was an undercover hoe
Purple got me moving slow
Like I'm in a snail race
Pop pop pop 3 shots to the head
Then I pick up my shell case
Leave 'em with a pale face
Yes I am a young money goon
Your girl like a motion picture she be cummin' soon
I do a certain rule, I pop her like balloons
I dance her of to Mills and drop her off the tune
Couple screws lose, wanna play with him
This is No Ceilings bitch, ruthless like a stadium
We shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in
You want us club, well nigga pay us then
All grey B.M., I'm getting from my baby M
She told us get the money and count it for me when I rake it in
Don't play no games hoe

Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote, it's got that nice slow groove that everybody dancin' to, and when I play it, it kinda remind me of me and you. I mean, there's one more thing I want to talk about. It's time for you to come home, everybody got their problems I'm dealing with mine. I done gave up them narcotics, I'm a changed man.
She loves me, she loves me not.
(Verse 1: Little Brother)
How many ways can I say I'm done fishin'.
You wanted the role, smash the audition.
Havin' a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen.
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women.
And some say it's the life I was given.
I say it don't matter if I work at MC-E-D's.
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees.
On a new broad, you still one to one.
Every once in again I like havin' some fun.
No disrespect intended but what's done is done.
Women steppin' out for love, men do what to come.
Not a playa like Pun, but when shorties get the grabbin' on me.
The last thought I get is Koobie run.
To them girls wishin' on a star that's will stun.
But I gotta tell it like it is hun, one.
(Chorus x2: Lil Brother First, Lil Wayne Second)
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.
(Verse 2: Lil Brother)
We was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens.
Every morning, and every evening.
Ten years later she eatin' that mean cuisine.
I'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine.
In the NFL which mean Not For Long.
City to city, all the groupies they hop along.
Word get back to wifey, she like ""Stop the song,""
I'm takin' the kids to my mommas, I'm out, I'm gone.
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears.
But I've been with your daddy for 'bout 35 years.
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating.
But I ain't never had to wear no black eye from beatings.
As long as he doing right, by you and your kids.
How you gon' expect that man not to be who he is.
I ain't sayin' that it's right but we often pay the price.
Cause a womens life is love, a man's love is life.
And he gon' live it to the fullest, and I ain't tryna pull you down or sound like a broken record.
But you should know by now that all niggas is dogs.
Better to have a rich pit then a broke German shepard.
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.
(Verse 3: Lil Wayne)
I say I don't have nothin' if I don't have you.
Like Shadai, we got the sweetest taboo.
And my game is skin deep, like your first tattoo.
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo.
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices.
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces.
Hey, girl don't play with my gangsta.
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger.
And I know cheaters never get crowned.
So I play ""fair"" like roller coasters and clowns.
You gotta hold ya soldier down.
Even when the war is lookin' it is right around the corner.
And you don't want to leave me, believe me.
'Cause I could turn you on like a personal TV
It's young weezy, I know what ya thought.
But I'm just here to play my part, so don't go breakin' my heart.
(Chorus x2: Lil Wayne First, Lil Brother Second)
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.

Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next man
But dog
You don't know me
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I mean
And dog
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb
Ticket on the dash
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard
So I am what they gotta be
'Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows
And tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me ""Is that a rose?""
You mean rosé?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style

I'm looking for the right woman to give my last name
I wanna a big wedding with all the expensive rings
Huge ice sculptures spelling out yo name, white doves flying
Tears without the pain
I'm standing at the alter you walking down the lane
The whole church crying while the choir sing
75 thousand dresses expensive champagne
I'm just playing baby
This is the year of the lover
(Lil Wayne)
Now I can put your ass out, oh
Keep running your mouth
And if yo brothers come trippin' ima show 'em wat dese teardrops bout
Shawty I was just playing
Oh but I can take you to the Caymen... islands
Have you screamin' and hollerin'
We gone be making... Love on the beach
The people see what we doin'
Awww they pointin' and ooh'in
Oh but we gone keep on doing... it
Like it's just me and you and no one else around
It went down on the balcony
And her legs are open how Sweet
Shawty like a model out da Penthouse Sheets
That's why I got her on my Penthouse Sheets
(Andre 3000)
So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a Pip, I'm glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin' ""Too soon! Don't do it! Reconsider
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that bitch do you dirty
We'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
(Common)
Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'm going to do the best I can do
'Cause I'm the best when I'm with you
You help me to discovery me
I just want you to put trust in me
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touching me
It's destiny to we connected girl
You and I we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane
I want you to have my last name"

Wit no seeds
So she can't eat
My heroes had da broads and da cars wit big ol rims
And I could remember slangin, thinkin'
I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
I lived life numb
It made so much since for me to run
When da 5-0 come
'Cause I ain't dumb

99,Damage Is Done,2005,The Suffix (2005),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"Runnin' from the scene, Hammer in my jeans
Dead bodies behind me, the cops'll never find me
Arm and Hammer Clean on my way to the honeycombe
Hustle all night tell my bitch I'm never coming home
Be there in the morning, stop cryin' bitch
The sun is home, drop it on the living room table
Bitch the money home, I know you ain't gon' stay once the money gone
So while I'm rich I pull my dick and get my fuckin' on
Youngin' on some real ""Gangsta Gangsta"" shit
Blame it on the neighborhood I was sanctioned in
But I'ma make sure we get them acres
Tell 'em fuck computers, we good with paper
Tell 'em fuck the world 'cause I'm hood by nature
Feelin' that way is how the hood'll make ya
The hood is vacant, the streets are empty, yeah
Mr. Bush, rebuild the city, but
Yeah, over like yesterday floatin' to the floodgates
This is New Orleans, welcome to the blood state
A blood bath, and you ain't nothin' but tub bait
No political justice not even the judge safe
If his ass can't swim he get a closed case
We need our own space, I ain't talkin' about Jupiter
No luck, no help and we the fuckin' future
I'm a hoosier, usually the cool one
But when I need it, I turn into a looter
God forgive, but do he forgive the brutal
Even when it's for the better of your junior
Soon you see that life's just another movie
And the main character dies at the end, usually
There's nothin' that haven't been done that you can do to me
I been hit, I been shot nigga shoot at me
Yeah, Money on the mind, murder in the plans
Disturbin' if you may, but it's dinner for the fam
Hustler by law, support when I can
Hustle when I can, tell me nothing I'm a man
Smell my shit as I walk off the stand
Nuts to my feet with my heart in my hand
Pardon my G, but I'm one of a kind
Been shot two times, here to put it in a rhyme
Slow lane, move the Coupe like a 5
If I get pulled over, bitch I'm gon' do time
And I know my niggaz love me, but they can't do mine
So I gotta be smart, get bread or get behind
Get lost or get in line
But the carpet's still fine
So keep tryin', the whole world turnin' back
But we keep tryin' until we get our piece, no piece
Keep Firin'"

See when I got Mercedes money, I went and got a Mercedes
When I got that Bentley money, I went and got that Bentley
Now if you ain't help me make it, don't tell me how to spend it
And yes, I know the rules, never marry Robin Givens
Mozzarella over bitches, so we call them bitches cheeseheads
I ""Lambeau Leap"" in that pussy like in Green Bay
Lambo' sweet, look like sugar on the freeway
And I'm riding dirty 'cause I'm so UGK
One, two, three-way, four four makes eight
Nine times out of ten it's 11- or a 12-gauge
Friday the 13th: that's the day that hell raise
But y'all boys too weak, like fourteen days
I'm so clean, why wouldn't I be?
I be with Ben Frank so much, he starting to look like me
I'ma smoke my weed, 'cause I don't want to smoke yours
And I pour four every time I pour
Like, was you saying something bitch?
You ain't talking 'bout us, you ain't talking 'bout shit
(Hook: Lil Wayne)
I woke up this morning, eyes half-closed
I looked into the mirror and say, ""Damn, I'm cold""
Damn, I'm cold, and my ho
Pimp shit nigga, keep paying my hoes
Damn, I'm cold, man, I'm throwed
I say damn, I'm cold, hot damn, I'm cold
[Verse 2: Bun B] + (Lil Wayne)
See when I got that slab money, I put the Rivie' on blades
When I got that 'lac money, I candied the Escalade
Got that Screw in my deck, a house or two on my neck
A couple cars on my wrist, and bitch, I'm ready to wreck
We 'bout to do this for Pimp C, so pass me a bottle
I'm 'bout to pop the top on it, like a slab or a model
Turn it upside-down, and pour it out for my little bro
And pass me another one so I can pour out a little mo'
Fresher than Ozium, cleaner than wax floors
I'm slick as linoleum, swinging my 'lac doors
Them Franklins, you folding them, we trying to stack those
So 'fore you play the role, you need to learn how to act, hoes
Swingers that clang fours and tipping trunks who bang
Haters get back, and hoes'll flip with nuts who hang
It ain't a thang, ain't never was, and never will
I put that on my life, Bun Beeda forever trill, for real
(Yeah, fucking right, all right
Going at your neck like a fucking dog bites)
[Verse 3: Bun B] + (Lil Wayne)
Is it the ice in the piece or the ice in the chain?
Is it the ice in the watch or the ice in the rings?
Or the bracelet? Face it, you feel a chill in your veins
Could it be from Bun Beeda or that boy Lil Wayne?
(Could it be the two-seater, on them thangs?
Got on a couple gold chains so Dana Dane
I swang and bang from lane to lane
Yeah, it's getting hot, and you starting to feel the flame, Bun)
It's getting brick, and you starting to feel a breeze
And the temperature's going down
Best to get you some sleeves, and you best to get you some G's
'Fore you lose your control
And we turn your whole neighborhood into the North Pole
(Like, burrrr
Machine gun, br-r-r-r
I am a beast, grrrr
Money machine, br-r-r-r

101,Days and Days,2013,I Am Not a Human Being II (2013),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeno
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tape worm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big headed my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
These nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes
Lil Tunechi
I might book me for a show
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures
I like math, all I did was add bitches
Swagger galore, got your girl on all fours
It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it
Everything authentic, plus I named my pistols
Last name Fuck, first name I Don't Give A
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver
So when I start pimpin', you know the procedure
All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss... I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples
I pop a nigga like a sicle, drop a nigga like a missile
Mo' money mo' issues, I'll size you up and fit you

102,Destroyed,2015,No Ceilings 2 (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"I think I'm seeing things
When I don't see a thing
I woke up and realized all the nightmares that dreaming brings
Let my people go
I know y'all hear 'em screaming things
Now load up choppers, point it at the coppers
Let let freedom ring
I like the sweeter things
So what bitch, no needle strings
I wake up stretch my feet and wings
My life has no deleted scenes
I pop pop pop and leave the scene
Leave the scene Noczema clean
Sipping on that lean cuisine
Incredible Hulk on creatine
My nigga
Fuck the world and may I mention fuck the world again
But I wanna go around the world Tune
You down to go around the world again?
I am and you can trust in a nigga like fam
I'm hitting these licks on these niggas like stamps
Giving these hoes headaches like rams
Yes ma'am and I
Just might call your girl a friend
But fuck her like she my girlfriend
Talk to her like she my girl like
Oops you look like my girl's twin
I said, ""I'm bad,"" I meant, ""My bad.""
I'm lost in future, present, past
All those drinks I had
I'll speed 'em fast I'll blink I crashed
They say it's my time
I'm racing time I think I'm last
And if Tune mentions lean again
Then I might drink his stash
The underdogs understand what I lay over tracks
New school but all I listen to is older raps, bitch I still
I still been drinking on the low
I never think because I know
And pimping haven't died and money getting old
And now the wrinkles starting to show
My rims twinkle like a toe
I'm tippy toeing with ya hoe
One thing led to another and then the pencil broke
I got that handgun on the table, shotgun in the closet
Police in disguises I don't like surprises
I don't like tomatoes, I don't like tamales
Shout-out to my plug, I pray the rats don't chew the wires
Straight balling you niggas just bald spots
When they tried to read my palms the pages were torn out
And pussy niggas get hawled off
No cough drops
I'm tryna make the same cash off rap they made off pop
I'm off topic
I killed more than I did with a gun with a skill
I'm no role model
I'm rolling with models rolling off pills
I'm rolling over
Whoevers not rolling with us, then road kill
Tryna get Uncle Phil cake
In case I die trying I wrote wills
I'm chilling for the moment
Till I can't figure out the code to get the motherfucking safe open
Who the fuck left the cage open
Stage of rage
I'm liable to blow your fucking face open
Every bone you can break broken
If I go broke every home I can break in broken
Pussy look like a steak smoking
Niggas looking like the lake frozen
And I hate rodents
And I stay choking off the straight potent
Till it make no sense
Niggas talking shit
Nigga I can get you wacked nigga
You can picture that till you break your lense
Niggas take no ends
Nigga fuck your hoe
While you cutting your grass
Nigga cut your throat
Taking out your trash
Pull up on you slow
Going at you fast you ain't got nowhere to go
Nigga hung 'em by a rope
Dump 'em by the boats
Fuck 'em adios
Fuck 'em I don't care
Got a bad bitch naked
And she just asked,
""What you gonna do to me that I ain't done to myself?""
I said, ""Oh talk dirty, but don't talk long
You leave Wayne's world it's a long walk home.""
My pockets on that growth hormone
I call them shots, can I get a dial tone, yeah
Mula, can I get a million
Till the heads on tails
Till I get a full coin
Full fledge, full house, when your friend gone join?
Got a friend in the cut with a gun by the groin
And what are friends for
I'm still the boss don't get sent for
Roger that 10-4
Nigga send me point 'em out where he at I got em
We don't wanna see you back in court
The weed so loud bitches get ignored
'Cause I don't got time to go back and forth
I told that bitch don't question me bitch
If you do you asking for it
I'm spaced out like asteroids
Feeling like arod after 'roids
I'm from Prop city
I'm from New Orleans the part that's destroyed"

119,DontGetIt,2008,Tha Carter III (2008),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"Baby you understand me now.
If sometimes you see that I'm mad.
Don't' you know no one alive can always be an angel.
When everything goes wrong you see some bad.
I'm just a soul, who's intentions are good.
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood...
What's understood ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me, so let me explain.
Stood in the heat, the flame, the snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blows, my dreads swang
He had hair like wool, like Wayne
Droppin' ashes in the Bible,
I shake 'em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary no tale fairy
All real, very, extra-ordinary
Perry Mason, facin, the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge, no guy or no gavel
A hound, a rebel, down to battle, now or never
Or whenever, in the effort, fuckin' fantastic fuck if you agree
Yeah I'm bright but I don't give a fuck if you see me.
I'm just a soul, who's intentions are good.
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood...
What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand, meet Dwayne
For 8 1/2 months I gave Ms. Cita pain
Now it's Young Money baby, keep the change
And mama say fuck 'em and we the same
So hello muthafucker you got some sheets to change.
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday
You know church fit, then outfit
Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this.
So what you 'about bitch?!
Excuse my French, emotion and my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion.
What are you askin'?
If I don't have to answer
It's probably on the web
Like I'm a damn tarantula!
But I know you don't understand
'Cause you thought Lil' Wayne was Weezy
But Weezy is Wayne!
I'm just a soul, who's intentions are good.
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood...
I'm watchin' TV the other day right?
They had this white guy on there.
Talkin' about black guys. Talkin' about how young black guys, are targeted.
Targeted by who?
America.
You see, 1 in every 100 americans are locked up.
1 in every 9 black americans, are locked up.
And see, what the white guy was tryin' to stress was that, the money we spend on sendin' a muthafucker to jail, a young muh'fucker to jail, would be less to send his or her youngass to college.
See and another thing the white guy was tryin' to stress was that our jaisl are populated with, drug dealers.
You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that.
Meanin' due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine the police are only, well I don't wanna say only right but shit only logical by ridin' around in the hood all day and not in the suburbs.
Because, crack cocaine is mostly found, in the hood.
And you know the other thing is [laugh] you know where I'm goin'.
But why bring a muh'fucker to jail if it's not gonna stand up, in court?
Because this drug ain't that drug, you know level 3, level 4 drugs, shit like that.
I guess it's all a misunderstanding.
And um, I sit back, ""well shit those muthafuckers, that 1 in every 9, were probably only sellin' the crack cocaine is 'cause we in the hood"".
And it's not like your suburbs, we don't have the things that you have.
Why? I really don't wanna know the answer...
But uh, I guess we just misunderstood.
You know we don't have room in the jail for the real muh'fuckers, the real criminals.
Sex offenders, rapists, serial killers shit like that.
Oh don't get scared! Don't get scared!
I know you saw one of them sex offender papers, don't trip he live 
 on the end of your block.
Mmhmm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender on the level 3 drug, convicted, ex-con, yeah. Check 'em out.
What you got? You got a daughter, son? What you got?! [laugh]
I have a daughter, you understand me and why the fuck would you bring my man into jail, just because, the reason he live next door to me, ain't the reason I live next door to him?
Meanin' he didn't rap his way to my, fuckin' neighborhood.
He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood.
You move him out, bring him to jail for life and then you move in the sex offender [laugh] then give me a paper.
Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.
Another thing!
Let me take my glasses off 'cause I wanna see the reaction on the faces when I say this... Mr. Al Sharpton... Here's why I don't respect you and nobody like you.
See, your the type that gets off on gettin' on other people.
That's not good, no homo.
And rather unhuman I should say, I mean given the fact that humanity, well good humanity rather, to me is helpin' one another no matter your color or race.
But this guy and people like him they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's the word.
You know, spec before check.
Meaning, I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you make one just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton.
Hold on, I ain't finished wit you man, just gotta pluck the ashes.
Mr. Sharpton and anyone like you, you don't know me so if your not gonna try to then what you do or think or whatever I do is totally casper the friendly ghost, to me.
And it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you informize, doesn't necessarily make you a bad person either but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way.
But since I am human, I am good and bad as well.
But I try my hardest to stay good.
And some of the things I say and do may be bad, or just not too good [laugh]
But I do try. So with hat said I don't fault you. Your only human."

Where's my coffee?
Good Morning Doctor Carter (Hey Sweetie)
Looks like it's going to be a long day. (Ah another one what we got?)
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concept (Uh-Huh)
Originality (Ugh)
His flow is weak (Another one)
And he has no style (Ugh)
Whatcha got for um?
Verse 1 (Lil Wayne)
Ok, let me put my gloves on,
And my scrubs on,
Dr.Carter to the rescue!
Excuse me if I'm late,
But like a thief, it takes time to be this great,
Honestly just wait.
Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place, and I'm just grace.
One, Uno, Ace, and I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass,
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix whatever you shall break.
Where is your originality? You are so fake,
So picture me like a gallery- Capture what I say.
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take.
Like, hey, brighter than the sun ray, got a pistols on the playground.
Watch the gunplay, like, No kidding, No kids in the way,
But the kids do watch. Gotta Watch what we say. Gotta work everyday.
Gotta not be Cliche.
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K.
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensai.
You gotta have faith, you gotta, gotta wait, wait...
I think I, I think I lost him... (Dial one eighteen please)
(Nurse)
Good afternoon Dr. Carter,
I don't know about this one...
His confidence is down,
Vocab and metaphors need work,
And he lost respect for the game. (ah, lemme see)
You think you can save him?
Verse 2 (Lil Wayne)
Okay, respect is in the heart.
So that's where I'ma start.
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.
Now hey kids-- plural-- I graduated
Cause you could get through anything if Magic made it.
And that was called recycling
Or rereciting
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it.
Some say its biting
But I say its enlightening
Besides Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.
Arthritis in my hand from writing.
But I'ma doctor they don't understand my writing.
So I stop writing.
Now I'm like lightning.
And you ain't Fish Young so don't clash with the Titans.
Fast and exciting.
My Passion is Frightening.
Now let me put some more Vocab in your I.V.
Here take this Vicodin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget so pay me no mine I don't walk like I talk it 'cause I'm running I don't do it 'cause I done it and I'm in the emergency punnet.
Goddamn it I've lost another one...
(Nurse)
Good evening Dr. Carter, it's been a long day,
But this one looks much better than the others.
His respect is back up, his concepts sound good,
His style is showing strong signs of improvement,
All he needs now is his swagger (OK lemme take my gloves off then)
Verse 3 (Lil Wayne)
Swagger Tighter Than A Yeast Infection.
Fly Go Hard Like Geast Erection.
Fashion Patrol Police Detection.
I Stay Tight Like Chinese Connection.
I Stay Tight Like Pussy At Night.

But I'm To Wrong To Write.
To Fresh To Fight.
To Paid To Freestyle.
To Paid To Freestyle.
I Had To Say It Twice
Swagger So Nice.
And Don't Ask Me Shit Unless It Concern A Price.
And I Don't Rap Fast I Rap Slow.
'Cause I Mean Every Letter In The Words In The Setence Of My Quotes.
Swagger Just Flow Sweeter Than Honey Oats.
That Swagger I Got It I Wear It Like A Coat.
Wait, As I Put The Light Down His Throat.
I Can Only See Flow.

I bring Wine to Amy House we smoke it out and we drank it out, and talk about these pussy niggas that ain't about what Wayne about
I'm hanging out a Mulsanne without a brain it's outta his mind

My gang top of the line hollering out ""Squad Take it outside!""

Getting in through the back wayer
Red devil to the blue collared, unenveloped black mail
Fed up with the Fed shit and Fed-ex lost my package
My white girls say ""Yeah nigga"" my white homies act blackish
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL

126,Drop The World,2010,Rebirth (2010),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love on my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times, seems further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga, it be on mo'fucker
'Cause all this bullshit, done made me strong mo'fucker
So I pick the world up, and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
Bitch I'ma pick the world up, and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
And I can die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave earth motherfucker, I'm gone (Motherfucker I'm gone)
I know what, they don't wanna tell you
Just hope your heaven sent, and you're hell proof
I woke up in the world, and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain, they can't wipe off (Uh)
My word is my pride, but wisdom is bleak
And that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murder and bribe
And when it got too heavy, I put my burdens aside
So I could pick the world up, and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Ha-ha, Yeah)
Bitch I'ma pick the world up, and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
And I can die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave earth motherfucker, I'm gone (Motherfucker I'm gone, I'm gone)
It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never know
If only you can see, just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream fuck 'em all
Man it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Uhp, it's time to raise it then, your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes got 'em cookin' boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes, I stole that fuckin' clock I took the time and I
Came up from behind, and pretty much snuck up and butt fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another, I'ma make these fucking haters believe it
I swear to God won't spare the rod, I'm a man of my word so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch, and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head'll lie, permanently bitch it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk you're trapped in my medicine ball
I can run circles around you so fast, your fuckin' head'll spin dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
Bitch I'm pick the world up, and I'm drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
And I can die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship, and leave earth motherfucker, I'm gone (Motherfucker I'm gone, I'm gone)"

Nigga Millz with that New York shit man
One time for my nigga T in this bitch
Yeah, tired of these niggas me
I can make her do tricks
Make the bitch do splits
Write your name on a bullet like a gift
I'm Saint Nick
Overdosing off the dough
Comatosing on the low
Keep my hands on some coke
Like Guns 'n' Roses, rock 'n' roll
The guns we tote is not for show
Welcome to the murder show
Welcome to the murder capital
That's capital NO
That's New Orleans
It's you or me
If that's so, you gotta go
You drop the gun
I drop the world
I drop some cash
You drop the soap
Rep that soowoo dada-do
I just got Bluetooth on my stove
You don't wan try me like Dej Loaf
Yeah I know, I know, I know
My Spanish ho she love me so
She say ""amor amor amor""
These lil boys don't want no war
Them toy soldiers, G.I. Joe
Mystical
Here I go, here I go
Vehicle, Diablo
All black, white seats, piano
Yeah you're from Santiago
You don't want no fiasco
We don't do Donnie Brasco
And tell your crew I said let's go
Tell your crew I said leggo
Oh it's way past midnight
Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain't got a whole team right
Yeah ah
He think that he gone take it from me
He said I should give it up 'cause he got money
Told him I don't think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya
All of my niggas is real, all of my niggas is solid
All of my money is in rubber bands, I do not carry a wallet
All of my bitches stay ready, soon as I walk in she gon pop it
Everyday I be floating, forever on autopilot
If that nigga ain't got my money though
Wrap him up like a mummy though
Regular wolves howl at the moon
My wolves come out when it's sunny though
My niggas ain't got no words with police
You tell the cops what they wanna know
This shit right here is my dummy flow
No Ibaka but I bring that thunder though
Your girl a jumpoff, I holler ""Geronimo""
Slam in that pussy like dominos
That boy Millz he got beats and all kinds of flows
What you think Weezy signed me for?
Stayed down and I'm still down
True definition of loyal
My style timeless, my style vintage, Crown Royal
From birth to now, heart Big like L, Notorious, and Pun
I want what I deserve, and some
Yeah I'm ballin' - And 1
All my niggas outside with me
All my niggas down the ride with me
And every freak that that I ever meet
Gotta fuck my girl if she slide with me
That's word

He said I should give it up 'cause he got money
Told him I don't think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya
We kick down the door, said it before
We did not come round to play games with you niggas
They say you nobody till somebody kills ya
Well I'm bout to make you a famous lil nigga
No game in this killer, murder he wrote
Can get life behind bars with these murderous quotes
The flow is like meth, it's like crack, it's like heroin
Yes I am spitting this dope
I am the future, I'm seeing right through you
I'm so New Orleans but I do not know voodoo
My piece will come face-to-face with you like Oovoo
Have niggas searching for you like it's Google, I'm brutal
I've been slept on for a long time
Been patient for a minute, now I want mine
I hear a lot of niggas talking down
I'ma put my mothafuckin foot where the sun don't shine
Can't rhyme in a cypher like this
I've been rockin' with the best
They don't put me on the list
I'm an underground king
Underrated in the streets favorite
Every street corner gonna speak bout this
Rest in peace Pimp C
Still got the muddy cup full of Morgan Freeman
Yep, lean on me
Like Wu Tang, cash rules everything around me
You know I got the cream on me
Gun barrel smoking like hydro
Middle fingers up, fuck five-o
Still repping B's like a H-town nigga
When I'm finished in this bitch call Geico
You looking at a god man, I put that on the Bible
Killin' everything fuck rivals
Hundred round drum on the stick
When I let the bitch off man it sound like pyro
Oh it's way past midnight
Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain't got a whole team right

Here come the beat boy
Shoot out the street lights
Time to bring on the heat boy

But I know you watchin, peepin down on how I'm livin'
Ay, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk
Say, I'll never forget the time that you caught me smokin' herb in the house
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin'
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise
I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know

Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile

Bitches
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin'
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection
And you see I left school behind and chose CMB
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me
I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog
I promise I won't ever put nothin' above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why I'm here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart
I can't forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said ""thay's my peoples""
Watch over me nigga till I see you

I know I can't be close to you (dog)
I know you watching over me dog

The outside world don't count here this is an inner circle of our family,
What we say goes.
Anybody anyplace else that disrespects you deal with us,
If you're with us you're with us, and that's it,
That's the way it goes, there's no such thing
As an outsider coming in, we don't let no one in,
We use all of them to do our dirty work,
And they come in they do our dirty work and that's just the way it is.

Throw my dope like a rope, let them tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches
Runnin' cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune
Come and get it, automatics in motion

'Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin' liquor like it's water, gettin' pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil' broads that tryin' to give me some
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my wasteline
Duckin the law, 'cause I ain't tryna' do no FED time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of everything and keep macita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin'
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lyin' that the law tryna' bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The FEDs said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha Brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she trippin' talkin' 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support
And my own family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep fallin' to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin' they self everyday
We keep fightin but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck

But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveilance when and wherever
Wreckin they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin' that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the world

This what the streets showed us
This how the block made us, the same block where they laid 'em

Lord will I be next for the taking? Take me
I know I'm livin' like I know when I'm comin'
But I'm just livin' 'cause I know that it's comin'
And the end is comin', but I ain't runnin'
I and hidin and duckin, I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it
I'm just speakin' from the heart of the dyin' public
We still beatin', we gon rise above it
Though it seem like they cheatin' and we loosin
We survive if nothin', they could never take the stride from strugglin
I gotta ride
And sometimes that ride get bloody
But I just think about my buddy and go after that money, but uh...
(Bridge - Nikki (Lil Wayne simultaneously in the background))
Oh, we gotta get over, we gotta get over, gotta get over
It's almost over, and we gon be all right
(I gotta get over, I gotta get over, cause bitch I'm a soldier)
Straight Patrone out the bottle to the head now
We gettin' read now, bitch my nigga dead now
And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now
I shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds
Now I gotta walk around, brim down
Just tryin' to find my way to the next day, escape
Ya birthday could be ya death date
So I'm livin' like it was just yesterday, let's pray
Ten fingers together, can't bring 'em together
It's murda murda, I don't think it get better
So be a competitor or get out the weather
Me? I got a umbrella and a berretta
I'm just tryin' to make sure my daughter future progressin
And behind that, I'm shootin excessive, trust me
The beautiful dead, we livin' wit the ugly
I just tell my pops wait for me, I'm comin'
(Chorus (Lil Wayne simultaneously in the background) x2)
Thooouugh, though I'm missin' you
I'll find a way to get through
I know livin' without ya is impossible

'Cause you were my brotha and I love ya, and I miss ya
(I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over
But I'm a soldier, so I gotta over, can't stay sober, I'm just tryin' to get over)
(I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over
But I'm a soldier, so I gotta over
Can't stay sober, I'm just tryin' to get over) (in background over and over while talking)
They ask me why I wear shades at nighttime... 'cause I don't wanna see nothin'! Yeah...
Like I said, life ain't nuttin but a long extended road, keep drivin'
I done passed up plenty people up on the side of road, no help, keep goin'
Yeah... Lost a lot of passengers on the ride, kept goin'... yep...
Who knows when I'll run outta gas. Yeah..."

Now go down girl, give head, go down
Go down girl, give head, go down
Now go down, girl, give head, go down
Go down girl give head
Now, momma's a hoe met her at a video with her face ready to go waiting for cameo
She say, I can tell you hustle, I can smell the coke
The money, you got a lot, I can smell the dough
I told her, keep her nose outta business of grown folks
She been to New Orleans twice never been through the?
Now her pocketbook nice, and her dress coal
But her teeth pearly white and her lips was swole
She bad, have you seen her?
My n*gga said I might as well marry a diva, like Trina, I pleased her, she please me the same, hey
What's the beauty without the brain?
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head
Right on the club, right in the club, shorty popped an x and gave me head right in the club
To be honest, I don't think we gonna go to my truck cause her cousin's with her and she looking better than her
Yeah, she's fat in the ass, slim in the waist, kinda pretty and she down to take the shit in the face
Licking all on her lips, 'cause she love how I taste
It's dripping on her chin, hope it don't fall on my?
Yeah, I'm glad I found ya, can't wait to bring Wayne and Mack Maine around ya
Gave me head in the pool and I damn near drowned her
Before I'd kiss that hoe, I'd rather kiss a perahna
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head
Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from us
Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from us
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head
All my little divas, pay attention, just listen
If we ain't in Paris, then we ain't French kissin'
I'm tryna feel your tongue, I'm just tryna be the one
Give it to ya from the back and make you cough up a lung
Or give a little brain and cough up a sun
I bust two times and then I toss up a one
Now shake it baby, it took your momma 9 months to make you baby
Enter the bedroom, we won't make a baby
Get your kneee pads on, no skating baby
So get your aprons baby
She said, I think it's a boy, she ate the baby
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head"
183,Glory,2015,Free Weezy Album (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"Woo, this that shit they didn't want me on
I'm 'bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne around my room
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lam, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in the wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little girls
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, Holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'Cock-a-doodle'
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you, glory
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-boo, I got them spooked too
I drive a neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not accuser, your mom a cougar, I sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than Tyga's Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' art destroyed, this the art of war
These niggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely, I'm soarin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view till I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord
Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tie is Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em"

Bang my thing till no more lane remain

Dudes a lil game and get her to do brain

Me and Young Jazze at the back of one tweezy
I'm so breezy off the Velvie and the perk
Now I'm getting head on the balcony on Bourbon
Apple and Eagle is the street that I shop
The Birdman my daddy and we fly south
And we don't go to work man we get work out
And the bricks may go as low as ten up in the drought
Niggaz is selling and you should be buying
Niggaz is telling and you should be dying

Believe that my haters are my motivators

Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)

Ain't in a rush from these streets
I am the streets
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard!
Carter called, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man down!)
Hit 'em on a walkie-talkie
Hit em, hit 'em knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians
Or a real real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the Mac, hit 'em with the Tec 9
Hit 'em with the Ruger by the intersex line
Hit 'em with a tommy so my niggas call me Kimmy and I always the jammy in the Trunka of the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up

Doin' the scissor-leg on the mat with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter
Fuck I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle
I'm a bad bitch no muzzle (no muzzle)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kenta

This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas whellying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back-east, South Ishakis (?)
This is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinsky

How?
You don't know how to prove it,
Well what you just you do is...
Stop, stop, stop,
Stop, stop, stop,
Stop, stop, stop,
Stop,
Stop hatin' on a nigga that
Is a weak emotion
The lady of a nigga
And You can get tipped like
You waitin on a nigga
Put a body bag and an apron on a n*gga
I give my all behind the mic
But you could never see if you
Sit behind the light
You don't have to pick me
To win the title fight
But I'ma wear that
Championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong there is no right
And if I'm wrong there is no white
I'm triin to be polite
But you bitches in my hair
Like the fuckin' po-lice
My flow is rare
These other rappers nice
These other rappers bark
Some of them even bite
But I'm much more bright
I give the game sight
So before you dim the light
You just might might wanna
Think it over, think it over,
Ooh think it over baby
Stop!
Stop analyzing
Criticizing
You should realize
What I am 'n' start epitomizing
Legitamite
I got the heart of the biggest lion
I'm confident like fuck 'em all
Pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick so sick its
Like my shit is dyin'
It rains a lot in my city
Because my city's cryin
Because my cities dyin'
Still I emerge from all of that
I am a livin' pion... eer near
Zion
Fear god not them
Steer my robin coupe through
The streets of the booth and soowoop
And
Then I leak blood in the booth
I leave a blood bath
Sorry there's a tub in the booth
Now where the drugs at I'm twisted
Like the strings on a shoe
No nigga fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot now
Where new Orleans at?
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession
I I, I must ask
Hey haven't I been good to
You tell me haven't I been
Sweet to you
Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem
I won't even think
Just leave you dead like
The mink under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I've graduated from hungry
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm a need cheese
If I'm bakin' a ziti
You niggas want beef
I want a steak and a wee be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where weed be
Hard body n*gga just takin' it easy
All about my paper bout my paper like ez
Why do rappers why do
Rappers lie to fans lie to
Rappers lot of rappers lie
Like actors
Cut the mutha fuckin' camera
Cut the check nigga
Fuck your props
And make it out to Hip Hop

Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip
She end up catchin bites to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I light me a spliff drink henney without ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin' I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm here to handle my situtions correctly
And I know I might be young but niggas gone definitely respect me
But in the mean time I'm fightin gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
It's like I'm never happy now
Except for the fact my daughter sayin' I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke about 3 blunts
And puff a Kool it boost me up

And put up wit the stuff trust me it's tough
But I mantain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall

So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mother's the dearest
And I ain't neva said they don't appreciate what I do
But jus know if I wasn't a man I wouldn't make it through
Who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so hectic
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with them at all so I don't say it's a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change
I'm always street so I'll forever be facin a change
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of them family first 'cause the liquir and weed is a habit
And I'm so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last

Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out
Tunechi, Tunechi, tote the toolie, fuck around and pop ya
My homies got that white girl, call it Lady Gaga
Glock 4-tini, nina colada, suck, swallow, semen saliva
I'm going at your collar, fuck you ho niggas

Diamonds in my teeth like I'm a fucking dope dealer
You're a dead man walking: Michael Jackson Thriller

And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats
Till the wheels fall off: I can fix a flat
If you're scared go to church and get a scripture tat
Guns the size of children now, don't be childish
Be with wild-ass niggas and I am the wildest
I'm a motherfucker, call me Weezy baby
And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?

They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

Fuck you and the horse that you rode in on

Red ants army, Caveman Spartan
Die, come back to life, shaved and corporate
I paved and carved it, made man forfeit
Laid and chalked him, I slaved then bossed it
I don't need flowers around my grave, I need maids and doormen
We not one and the same;
Casper the Friendly, Tunechi Cobain
Ask how I'm livin', I can't complain
Like, it's hot in hell, but it never rain
Shit never sweet, him never changed
I will always be the MF'er Wayne
I been lost conscious, I never regain
Bitches wanna sleep with my remains, lord
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie

Stank like corpses, got a young nigga coughin'
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin
Bad bitches in my coffin, suck dick till they cough
How long will they mourn me?, I had a Rolls Royce Ghost
Now I'm feelin' like that motherfucka comin' back to haunt me
We are not one and the same;
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked
So fuck every key on your key chain, boy
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I don't know if I'm comin' or going, Lord, I'm undecided
Throw flowers on my body, you allergic to pollen
Rest in peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten, no

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
I roll with a bunch of untamed guerrillas, head bustas, and sharks
Niggas that's 'bout beefin' - lettin' them K's spark
Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas
Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it
Niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin
They dressin' in black, prepared for combat
Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out
That's what happen to ya tryin' to be hard, runnin' your mouth
Get erased, my nigga (my nigga)
Look here: I leave no trace, my nigga (my nigga)
No witnesses so can you see my face, my nigga (my nigga)
Fled the scene - so you have no case, my nigga- -case, my nigga
Look here: you can play if you wanna get down
Get your stupid ass left where you can't be found

I was wrong for a lot of shit that I'ma take to my grave
Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, ""Juvenile, stay off them streets.""
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', ""Fuck the police!""
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed
All they understand is my project English
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis

You a killer, nigga? (Eah?) Ain't no fear in my heart
I'll go toe to toe with ya or take ya to war
I'll even go K for K with ya - now make your choice
Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'ma sneak ya, nigga
Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas
Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga
Nothin' change - I'm on TV, I don't play with you niggas
Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas
And empty a hundred out that K
Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me
I've been in the game - niggas know what I'm 'bout
So many murders under my belt, I done lost count
If you wanna be another number, my nigga

Hello, world
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy
Glock cookin', boy
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'
Spark or lace somethin'
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible
If I live to be old, it's a miracle
'Cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar
Cut off lights, we masked riders
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

When other n-ggas don't stay long enough they
Get the digits and split
If ain't nobody telling you that you are pretty
That's just because you are and they do not want to admit it
Look at all that ass, you ain't got to have titties

Kiss her on the thigh make her p-ssy hole cry
They say numbers don't lie, lets try 69
Kiss her on her lips let her p-ssy hole drip
She can't even walk to the bathroom she gotta skip
Kiss her on her cheek, make her p-ssy lips speak
No she pulling on my locks, kiss thou Sheek, ha
Kiss her on her breasts, east and west
And then I go south
And clean up my mess
No stop signs, no red lights
She put on a show, no stage fright
And then I f-ck her right

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Find out where your parents stay
Tell my goons to go straight to your momma room
What's in your pockets? What's in your pocketbook?
We think the Bible's a comic book
Bitch this Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that's so good, need a name
Call it milk, because milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist
So somebody better monitor the thermometer
I just eat pussy and pussy ass niggas all day
And I ain't even kinda full
Hollygrove, Hollywoood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Woo!
I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits, I'll show you my weapon and grill
And heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom
She lay down and say ""let's make a film""
I be like ""action""
I hold her hair down by her neck
This how breathtaking feel
Family first, you get your family killed
That's if you squeal, pop-pop close range
Hold that gun like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch ridin' my dick
She swerve 'cause another bitch grabbin' the wheel
I ask 'em to chill
They both look at me, say ""shut up""
I say ""my lips are sealed""
I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in heaven when hell was a pile of wood
I run through hell with gasoline drawers on
Stop, tell the devil that god is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure
Vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, everyday Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery, I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese been on my beast
Since I was wearing wallabees, where paparazzi?
I need my privacy, fuck yo photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get my good side of me, Lawwwd
I come from Hollygrove
Hollywood should make a movie bout Hollygrove
Whoo, whoever play me should get a Oscar and a golden globe
This ain't no movie, this is real shit
I don't need a script 'cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed
All she could snort, more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets but got superstar written all over my face
That's why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove
I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bapapapaapapappa
I ain't finna shoot and tell them don't check the gate
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Fall asleep to the gunshots
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her she say ""Hallelujah""
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Oh, but I done went Hollywood
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Oh, but I done went Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Hollygrove ain't far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
""Lord please don't let this car break down""
Hahahah
H-Town! Lawd, I done went from Hollygrove to H-Town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th ward bitch that be boostin'
Sometimes she doze off, that's the lean, I excuse it
She said ""If it ain't chopped and screwed, It ain't music""
She say I never take her out, we went to eat at Houston's
Sometimes I doze off, that's the lean, I'm just snoozin'
I still got Actavis, nigga that's exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that's a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I'm gon' nail all them hoes, I'm Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life, had to do this for Houston
Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with the work
Praying the car don't break down
Oh, Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with codeine
Cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you don't give police no names
Or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught
They gon put me under the jailhouse
Damn, I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with this chopper
Leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper protecting my livelihood
I'm so good, I'm so straight, I'm secure
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

Excuse my French, but it's menage a trois, au revoir

A lil' louder
Yeah
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love
When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love
Ooh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
Ooh, see I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual
You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

What the fuck you think I do it for?
Bitch don't act like you don't know

Custom made casket for your motherfucking funeral
Keep the women with me
Shit I gotta keep like two or more
Party everyday, like we won the fucking Superbowl
Chilling with my nigga Mack, he keep bitches handy
White girl on the table love them sniff the nose candy
When I'm walking by the women saying ""Who is that nigga?""
I replied ""Hi, I am Gudda Gudda that nigga.""
I was raised in the home of the cap splitters
Whip on 24's watch it crawl like a caterpillar
I come with a toy, boy like a Happy Meal
And you's a motherfucking duck, Daffy Dill
I'm from the school of hard knocks, where we scrap and kill
Pick the knife or gunner, you can get the package deal
I'm hot nigga, burning everything around me
I was lost for a minute took a while but I found me
The streets say I'm king but the game will never crown me
Realest nigga doing it just ask the niggas around me
So you can't size me up or try to clown, a
Shark in the water jump in and I'ma drown you
New Orleans nigga, gun out, I'ma down you
Put niggas to sleep like a motherfucking downer
I'm a great white, you's a flounder
Fish and a bitch, I tuna eveything around you
U-Haul Gudda, moving everything around you

At the top is where they found us, nigga

The chopper spin him around, like a ballerina

I'm from uptown, my bitch from Argentina
My pockets on fat like Joey Cardigena
Stunt so hard, it's all y'all fault
And when it come to beef give me A1 sauce
I ain't worried about shit, everything paid out
You can catch me courtside at Dwayne Wade house
With a high yellow thick bitch, with her legs out
Cash Money president, but we in the red house
Who the fuck want it? Make my fucking day
I blow your candles out, now nigga cut the cake
I got to eat bitch, like a runaway
And y'all niggas ain't eating, stomach ache
Okay, all these bitches, and niggas still hating
I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gaten
Fucking with my iPhone, bumping Illmatic
I'm on the road to riches, there's just a little traffic

It's been so long since I said ""It cost too much""
I'm so addicted to the fast money lifestyle and withdrawal sucks
And dead presidents act immortal, but I know you see money's not a problem
Bald like a butch bitch

256,I Hate Love,2011,Tear Drop Tune 4 (2011),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"She was the sweetest ever
Whatever happened to forever
She never say never, she rather say whatever
I'd rather stay together and she'd rather chase the devil
Now I'm left to race the rebel
Bartender make it several
Turn up the bass and treble
How 'bout I make it metal
I'm such a fatal fellow
And she's the reason why
Because without the muthafucker I'd die
I'd die, I'd die
So bury me today or tomorrow
'Cause I've buried myself away
In the sorrow in May
I die before I wake
I pray I'm resurrected for her nightmares sake
But you love me
At least that's what she said
That whole weekend in my bed
But there was a speaker in my head
Saying ""seek and you'll be led""
But instead, instead I loved you
I was weak and mislead
I was deeper than dead
I was sinking in dread now I'm thinking in shreds
So I inked this in red
But she loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love
I used to tell myself I wouldn't do this to myself
Until I proved it to myself
And now I'm losing myself
I used to have my shit together but now
You see now, I with whatever
And now, you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever
And everybody know I ain't acting like I'm supposed
I'm attacking my own soul
I'm back in a lone mode
I'm back on that long road
And that road goes forever and ever
I don't wanna love no more, spare me
You can have my heart its only dead beat
I'm sick of the love songs and the bullshit
When reality bites like a wolf bitch
She's on top, she wanna kiss
She wont stop, she don't wanna quit
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever
She loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love
And I don't want love, I don't want love
I don't wanna love no more
So if you see her you can have her
She'll be outside my door
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor
I curse the very day you were born
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I'm guilty"

I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like ""Hey, I like the view from here!""
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
And these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy getting problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho
God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We wen't from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her that night
I'm a Southerner delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
And today, I took a walk outside and...
Uh, and we all kiss our mamas
'Cause promises are broken but tomorrow isn't promised
Think I'm gettin' sick, I'm feelin' illegal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget, so try to live it up
It's doctor Carter, bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up
I need some wallpaper before they start to fuss
Yeah, pick up the phone and call your bluff
Human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough
Motherfucker I don't shoot ya, bitch I shoot ya up
I ain't like these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint like Spike Lee nigga

I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will

Cost a few hundred Bens and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah, you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' winnin'
She said, ""I seen it all"", I said, ""No, you fuckin' didn't""
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said, ""I can't feel my legs"", I'm like, ""Bitch, me neither""
I'm going in, where should I begin?

Saints cap, new car, paint that if it ain't black
Red light, press a button, make the top think back
That was tough, so are us, no such thing as sober up
You close minded, I shoot you in the head I bet you open up
High yellow women with her hair to her ass
Bring her home, fuck her like a belt then I crash,
And when it comes to head, I get that head of the class
I got them green backs like I laid on the grass

Uh, I'm in the ocean getting shark pussy
Shoot you in ya fuckin' mouth and make you talk to me
Sometimes I need someone to talk to
'Cause I Am Not A Human Being... Part Two
Getting paid, show money for walkthroughs
Lettin' all these hoes ride my dick, car pools
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Uh, whatcha man doing?
I pop his muthafuckin' top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed
And last night I took a transformer
And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl, was sleeping with Decepticons
Money talks man and mine talk lecture long
P-U-S-S-Y... my second home
I be grindin' on them hoes like a half pipe
She say ""Tunechi you the shit, you need your ass wiped""
I say ""Before you gas me up, check the gas price""
Then I make her take this dick like advice

That's swag, I'm a True Blood, bitch no fangs
Been went pro, now I'm going propane
Tell the bitch get off me, bitch get off me
I got her over here blowing me like coffee
Decaffeinated, hand me that paper like I graduated
And I get head while it's decapitated
Think it's a game nigga come play
I'm with my killer bees, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta, I personally know strangers
It's so strange but this girl named Dana, like to go anal
Shoot 'em in his head, what's that? A no brainer
Plain ol' nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve so don't be breakin' my arm
I rather ring ya fuckin' neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me alone
Wit 'em, I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, ya ass is grass... get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growin' hair
Bitches sweatin' me like John Mayer, or warm air
Man, nuts and bananas
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?

No rubber... I just fucked this piano

Never tired nor fatigue
Never defiant to my team
Never lien on the thing until

And when I do accomplish it ima try it again

Got everything to gain and I'm proud of the pain

Denied by the sane beside were the same
Whose guidin the train
Whose flyin the plane
Whose drivin' the lane
Who dies when it bang
Who fires when it bang
Who lies in the aim
Two lives in the drain
Who cries when they sang

Find what you can't
Revive what you tank survive what you paint
Supersize what you shrink

Tinted windows bitch, that mean mind yours
And the weed loud, like a lion's roar
Stare into the eyes, the eyes of forever
Hear no evil, see no evil, Helen Keller
No music on, rock it a-capella
And I don't need a watch, the time is now or never
Tell my niggas love, I die behind this shit
A nigga countin' money, you niggas counterfeit
Real nigga, nigga, proud of what I am
Young money is an army, bitch I'm Uncle Sam
Them hoes call me Tunechi, mama call me Tune
I left the bullshit, in the waiting room
Straight to the money, no short cuts
Now watch me go retarded, yellow short bus
We do drive-bys, we do walk-ups and bitch I be so high, I get starstruck
Millz in this bitch he said fuck them hoes
And the jewelry bright, like summer clothes
And I keep some bud like Rudy Huxtable
I'm bout to slam the beat, nigga, Dusty Rhodes
I'm from Eagle street, I go Hercules
I get on the beat, murder 1st degree
YMCMB, we don't give a fuck
You faker than some titties, you get tittie fucked
This the best-worst feeling and nigga if I die I die a death worth living
This that textbook G shit
I've been in that water but I've never been seasick

Knock me I knock ya face off, life's a crazy bitch, Grace Jones

295,It's Good,2011,Tha Carter IV (2011),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the Crown of a King on his throne
When you're chained in the dark all alone?
(Verse 1: Jadakiss)
I'm real as they come, I follow the rules
I'm still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don't fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I'm pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don't sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do your thang
(Verse 2: Drake)
Mind in one place heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he's just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit and got too fuckin' comfy
'Cause we still fuckin' hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin' faded, aww yeah I'm fuckin' faded
They tellin' lies about me, aww yeah I musta made it
Rikers Island on this flow, 8 months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin' in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out
(Verse 3: Lil Wayne)
Stop playin', I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, shanaynay, oh my goodness
This is Wayne's world, and y'all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock 40â²s, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin' in the money, I'mma need some fuckin' goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real ho
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin with a full deck but I deal ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfucking field goal
Talkin' 'bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that 'how much you love your lady' money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I'll take you out, that's a date nigga
I'm a grown ass blood, stop playin' with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin'
I think you pussy cat, ha, hello kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, tempur-pedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think it's cleavage
Its young money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop pop potato salad"

My name like honey, it got all the bitches buzzing.
The neck of the barrel is so long and narrow,
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunchin and munching like Farrel.
Bloodshot eye's on the sparrow,
I stay high, but on-point like an arrow.
Street nigga baby I'm in love with the gravel,
Money gives me life like the man with the gavel
I'm straped at home, I'm strapped when I travel
I pop my trunk and make the bitches spread like cattle
(I got King Kong in the trunk)...and I feed him banana clips,
And he sing like Gladys Knight and the Pips
I'm just sticking to the muthafucking manuscript,
Understand I'm tryin' to get the chips and the dip.
Better know I hold that gun with a Panther grip,
My hollow bullets got tips like a dancer bitch.
Where my money? Where my money? You need to answer quick,
Or I'll get back on my ransom shit. (Put him in the trunk)
So you'll be laying ontop of speakers.
Holes all in you like an old pair of sneakers.
Before I do a day, on the edge, I will leap first.
Bet you any money that I will land feet first.

He saw me dippin in but he didn't know ???
Soon as he pulled off

Sayin' to myself look at this dog ass hoe

For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts

She was a fool with it

306,Kobe Bryant,2009,Tear Drop Tune 2 (2009),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"(Kobe talking)
I want to be the best
I want to be the best, simple and plain
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
And that's what drives me
(Stephen A. Smith talking)
He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassin's mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant? There is no one
This guy is highly motivated
What separates Kobe from the pack?
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one
(Lil' Wayne)
OK
Kobe doin' work
Two-four on my shirt
He the greatest on the court
And I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the 4th ring like it was his first
Gotta get the bling
Do it for Kareem
Two-four so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldestein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings
Kobe in the game dunking on your team
Black Mamba, attack conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, a turnaround jumper
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's going, it's going down yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show
(Talking)
I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing
(Lil' Wayne)
Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry 'bout my shot
'Cause I'ma get that off
Yeah, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work 'em like a auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
'Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with 3 seconds
And I bet we gon' win it all in 3 seconds
Ya dig? That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let 'em get to me
Literally
Step back and give 'em a three
Ain't no defending me
(Reporter talking)
One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately
LeBron James
(LeBron James talking)
I've been recorded saying that
He's definitely the best player in our league
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our league
And there's not another guy in our league
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing
(Lil' Wayne)
Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline facetime
Tongue out like two-three
Even two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha brackets ain't for me
I will be jumping over you
Like I got a mattress at my feet
And all the Phil Jackson teams
Better be passing it to me
I put the master in the beast
Attack you like a beast
I am starving for victory
And that means I'ma eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me
(Elie Seckbach talking with Mikael Pietrus)
Reporter: Who's the best player in the NBA?
Mikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant
Reporter: Really? Why?
Mikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get
(Lil' Wayne)
Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. Automatic
I can post 'em up, or Lamar go get the alley
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want? They want Kobe
And what he want? He want the trophy
The victory
And the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break 'em off, Kobe break 'em off
You better be where that Laker don't
Yeah, just give him the ball and he take it off
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
'Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah
(I thought you want to be the greatest)
Do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothing wrong with doing it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin?
Killer instinct
Murder the basket
Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a all-star, been a champion
Free throw line, you hear 'em chanting
Mvp, mvp
Kobe Bryant aka Envy Me
In knee deep, smash any D
Whoever he is he can't guard me
He can't guard me
(Elie Seckbach)
So, there you have it. The overwhelming answer was - Kobe Bryant"

My paint bubbleish, the motor so vicious
The rims the same color as the wrapper of a kisses; Hershey's

And when I'm in Detroit I be ballin' like a Piston
Boy did I mention I fly like a pigeon
Hidin' gas prices, you Vegas trinket
I'm ridin' on the park in the Bentley golf cart
The Polo be cream but the bottle's caviar (yeah!)
Weezy I'm sick from all this tourin'
You told me (sip this,) then call me in the morning (yeah)
And I vow I never trust another woman ('nother woman)
In my life, and then I got horny (ah hah)

Like a mattress from Sing-Sing or way down to Comstock
These bitches call me bling king I shit when the bomb drop
And sprinkle down into all the niggas flawless in D-Class
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean Glass
They movin' on a nigga as I'm walkin' the valley, ready?
And Zulu with the cameras like I'm diggin' down Halle Berry
My money help me do things that you nigga's can't believe
Like purchase personal plates on sort of things that you can't conceive
Like interactin' with women, on caliber of Janet
I sit and mater my vision and massacre the planet
I hope you nigga's know just what it is
While I'm countin' my paper nigga's know I'm handlin' my biz

Got my gifts before christmas
Didn't have to wait for em

Luda
I done killed so many niggas in the booth
I sell rappers on e-bay
Cause every one of my verses been instant like replay
Speakers get blown like candles on ya b-day
Cause Luda's catalog got more records than a DJ
Tha bank yells mayday like everyday's a payday
I put it on tape then I sell it like Ray J
But not out tha store (nope) straight to tha buyer
'Cause I slung 'em out my trunk like tha D.C Sniper
And 6 albums later you'll deposit every word
Till ya memory bank give me tha credit I deserve
Top 5 damn right but really it just hit me
That 3 of yo Top 5's too scared to fuck with me
So how can I advance if you don't give me no opponents?
How can you see tha future if you living for tha moment?
Hip-Hop couldn't die I never offered my condolences
But I offer y'all a day of atonement
(Chorus - Ludacris)
I'm a lyricist till the death
So I got whatchya need
Ludacris, I'm the last of a dying breed
And we almost extinct
So I'm saying it loud
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'
... (DJ... ing)
(Lil Wayne)
I got it baby
And I'm a MC
I move the crowd like Moses
Like the Red Sea
I wear red like roses
Go against me and you be dead like roses
Spittin' at ya head for the bread like toastas
Never had a holster
I keep it on my lap
And hip-hop ain't dead it just had a heart attack
But you see I keep it pumpin
Yeah I got that heart back
So just call me little carter
Or little cardiac
Precious like an artifact
Valuble like a quarterback
Hannibal like they call me Jack
Throwback like a starter hat
And now did he thought a that
I mean how did he think a that
I mean how did I think a that
Now like a rental bring it back
I mean how did I think of that
I surprise myself sometimes
Some one could throw me a surprise party for every line
Everytime I do it
I do it dity like swine
For the dirty and fine
Hip Hop I'm alive
I'm a lyricist till the death
SAndI got whatchya need
Weezy F, I'm the last of a dying breed
And we almost extinct
So I'm saying it loud
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'
(Ludacris)
They say O'Reily don't like him
Oprah wont invite him
Tha president denounced him
No one will announce him
Controversial lyrics like I'm crying for
I'm very talented but I should be ashamed of myself
But this is my art, this is my music
I'm speaking from tha heart hit record and I'll lose it
Bite my tongue for no one I'll put you on blast
So all the news channels y'all can kiss my ass
And if I dish it I can take it, fix it if you break it
Could hit rock bottom and I'm still gon make it
'Cause I'm a born hustla, natural survivor
Seed of a gangsta I put that on my father
Youtube or Google me, turn it up and play it
Cause many people think it, I jus had tha balls to say it
And risk everything, I stand for the weak
And I live for my fredom of speech cause
I'm a lyricist till the death
So I got whatchya need
Ludacris, I'm the last of a dying breed
And we almost extinct
So I'm saying it loud
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'"

Nigga I'ma tell ya straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag with 20 grams of crack
And I'ma sit in the back seat of yo' 'Lac
Just in case I gotta snap, a firette to the chest
If I don't know shit, I know cars and broads
I done ordered plenty hits and watched heads come off
And I done saw my nigga get life behind them bars
To them dog hoes, nigga, we scream ""fuck 'em all!""
I hustle hard in these city streets
I got my block on fire with my HB's
Spinnin' Benz in these drop tops double r
Cook a brick, flip 'em up, now I got 'em hard
And you can find me
Right up in them hallways, holdin' and totin'
Got the whole motherfuckin block loaded and smokin'
Nigga know one thang: its some uptown shit
If a nigga get it fucked, then we killin' a bitch
Nigga I'ma tell ya this, straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack
Well let's go nigga, see we can slide nigga
'Cause if you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga

Let's go nigga, let's slide nigga
If you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga

Better pay attention now so you don't forget later
I run the damn block, I oversee all of the paper
Don't make me take ya, play ya
I cock the glock and spray ya
Call it a caper, won't be no as-salama-laka
And J, he got the gauges, they cocked and ready
Make me run up in ya places and pop ya daddy
Got them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known
I cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone
Then I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls
Supply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off
Lock the spot down
Respect it young nigga, I'm creepin' over
Now cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders
I take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever
Nigga it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend
You see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed
Rats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me
(Lil Wayne)
See I'm a hustler, cut-throat, put rhymes in mom's muffler
You can't even count how many times the 9's bust at ya
Some of the, niggas that you run with are, suckas bruh
None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya
Niggas can't hold me down, wodie wild
'Cause all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure
Niggas got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song
But y'all gon' twist it and end up all gone
Dog-gone cocksuckers, you not thuggers
I pop dozens of glocks, cousins, in my struggle
So stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere
I'ma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere

Kick back and get high wit me
And if she still get me
I hope my wife know she got a playa 4 life and that's no bullshitin

Do a hundred-ninety in the lane called memory
And I know you in that lane wit me
But when the light change
You didn't change wit it

And she was a beast
Woman so bad it's illegal to speak
She say she like me and she was eager to meet
And I was just as eager as eager as she
Body so sick you can eat off her feet
Go to the hospital die in a week
She say she was a model well obviously
'Cause I can sure picture her between my sheets
Baby was a flower w/ rose pedal cheeks
And every time she talk it's like a gold medal speech
Intelligent she should teach
And if so
I will be a nerd like screech
I told her I would write a rhyme about her
And it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track she said that's deep
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat
This is the beat this is this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She she she said her name was Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was discreet
Her picture's in the dictionary next to elite
I told her we can get away we can retreat
Cut off my arms put um on her seat
Cut off my legs put um on her head
So I could run through her mind like she does mine
And every time she smile it make me feel like a child
In the supermarket on the candy isle
I saw a picture of her w/ her panties down
I fall asleep and dream I'm a camera now
I would love to be the water in her shower
Or one of her bath towels
I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track she said that's deep
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat
This is the beat this is this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She she she said her name was lisa marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was a piece
A piece of fine art like a piece of the leak
She was unique ex-quisite
Like x y z she was complete
And I think she like butterflies
Because she got one on her upper thigh
And her face is like summer time
Birthday the same month as mine w/ a different sign
Virgo I go wherever her go
If she say so I'm on her like a fur coat
In November she colder than December
She got me fallin' like TIMBER!
I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track she said that's deep
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat
This is the beat this is this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She she she said her name was Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie

328,Live From 504,2007,Da Drought 3 (2007),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"Live from the 504
It's Mr. Crazy Flow, jumpin' like a bungee, no rope
Even in a dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny, I glow
If it ain't bout money, I go
Nowhere, I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Like there's a whale in the boat
See you can smell that I smoke
And yep I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination
And make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water
Yeah, I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willie the squid
Li-li-lilly pad niggas lo-lo-look at the monster
You-you-you don't wanna crash like La-La-La-Bamba
See it's me, Roni and Terry
And my new drop is very
Watermelon plum, just call it fruit punch
I'm an old rapper, gettin' new bucks
And all you new rappers, you're just new lunch
Feel sick, so sick, need a doc, yes
A creature, monster like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the tock, before I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock, ""Gimme a sec""
In the middle of the war where my enemy at
I'm runnin' this bitch like (?) enemy back
'Cause every time I hit a track I'm like an energy pack,
The instruments are crying out ""Where the sympathy at?""
Yeah, if you betting money baby, him will be back
Whatever legends look like, bitch I'm fittin' to be that,
I walked right in hip hop, like where my dinner be at?
I ate that and I was like, ""Where my dinner be at?""
I hate that women lie so I lie to them back
Got two bitches in my pants quiet, neither of them that
A lot of bitches want dick, I give a lot of them that
Let's do a pill, I can fuck you for an hour with that
And to the kids, drugs kill, I'm acknowledging that
But when I'm on the drugs, I don't have a problem with that
And my niggas got guns the size of toddlers, biotch
And we aiming right at your fucking collar, biotch
Pow!"
329,Live from the Gutter,2015,No Ceilings 2 (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"You at home broke as fuck doing the milly rock
I'm in Hollywood with millions, check my Diddy bop
Sipping Actavis, I put that on my double cup
Pushing work, man, we got the whole city hot
Raised up on Jeezy, Jay'd up on Yeezys
Young Money millionaires, me, T and Weezy
Sixteen in the peezy
Another sixteen, that's a PT
36 that's a keyzee
Push button start, bitches thought I lost my keys, please
Trappin' out my haunted house of ghosts, there's some scares there
And I got that work, homie yeah, yeah
Finessing all these niggas, I need air fare
All these diamonds dancing on me, baby very
I might call them Michael Jordans, I need every pair
Tell your homie hit my line, I got fishscale
Certified hustler, yeah, real street nigga
It took me 31 years to make my first million
But I ain't trippin', this the beginnin'
Lost deposits at Chase, no time for chasing women
All black Porsche slammed on them red mags
I peel her top back and watch the haters get mad
They need to stop it, niggas don't like when you
Balling on them bitches, they just mad 'cause they ain't got shit
And niggas with the gossip, ol' Dr. Phil ass nigga
You might as well go 'head on and start a talk show
Me and Hoody making big moves off in this Tahoe
Your bitch travel hundred feet, work off in that rental
Backstabber smile in my face, showing the dentals
But you know me, I chunk the deuces at them bitches
Never stop the chat, I keep it moving on them bitches
In and out of town and yeah I do it for my city
East side New Orleans is where a nigga get it
So have your money right or else I ain't fucking with ya
And I ain't posing twice so I hope you got the picture
Ya dig?
Reporting live from the mother ship
And I ain't talking nothin' but Young Money shit
Yeah, I ain't talking no more Cash Money shit
Yeah, I ain't talking no more, now I'm coming, bitch
Distorting guys with the cutter
I'll rob a motherfucker talking all that big money shit
Got me hustling like I never had shit
I'm restarting from the bottom, now ain't that a bitch
But watch me turn this pen into a Brad Pitt
Yeah, watch me turn this world into a hand print
The money made me hungry like I'm fastin'
I see the stars lining up, I feel like NASA
I seen my homies give up on me like a marriage
I went back and counted up and no more stunting like my daddy, ah
Then my bitches hit me up and said she love me like a daddy, ah
Cuban bitch walking 'round my house like she live there
Wake up in her mouth, she dribble like Sebastian Telfair
I see y'all ain't playin' fair, I see you, you layin' there
You see bitches everywhere, you might see them in Vanity Fair
My homie got that Danity Kane
Them shots like planes they landing here
Oh yeah, and we got them bitches on that wifi
It's a bird, it's a plane, them bitches sky high
Back up off me motherfucker, whoa yeah yeah
Me, T and Hoody feel like Dame, Hov and Ty-Ty
Me, Mack and Po feel like Lyor, Hov and Tata
My bitch don't own panty hoes nor a bra top
Roll up the windows in the Rolls, nigga hotbox
Cut on some Drizzy in this bitch, we don't cha cha
Whole time I was ready, ain't no cat and mouse in my fetti
Ain't no Thomas, ain't no Jerry
Ain't it really ain't no thang, you niggas really don't gang bang
I'm with that mob smoking gas, ain't no limit on my tank
Up, up, up and away, cup, cup, cuppin' all day
We sipping that oil, we sipping that oil, more oil than Oil of Olay
You killas don't play, kill 'em on sight in the middle of the day
Shoot a nigga right in the middle of his face
Bullet be biting like a venomous snake
Pussy be tighter than traffic, LA
We got that white, we traffic all day
I went from Kool Aid and PBJ
Now it's champagne and caviar steak
But still reporting live from the gutter, bitch
Before I fade away I hit 'em with the stutter step
Yeah, now before I fade away I gotta stutter step
Before I fade away I hit 'em with the stutter step
I hustle like it's nothin', left my woman in her underwear
My youngin don't wear underwear, I love my -
Yeah I love my baby mothers, yeah, little hoody ain't no huggy bear
I represent that grizzly bear, my neck look like a city fair
Page out the Jungle Book, amazed is how your woman looks
When she see me and all my niggas coming
Afraid is how your gunners look, we take a finger, tongue or foot
And mail it to your people, we mean business, get that understood
Big ol' bag of fuckin' good, a little bad, a ton of good
I'm pretty like Blair Underwood, she insecure, my gun secured okay
I'm pretty like Blair Underwood, she insecure, my gun secured okay
No ceilings"
330,Living Right,2015,Free Weezy Album (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"Niggas that's me in that nice ass house
Butt-naked bitch with a nice ass
Walking around saying ""you got a nice ass house""
My phone keep ringing though, my bad
I think my girl got me on Spycam, now
My homies call cocaine white trash
Charge you double just to take my trash out
I can not fuck with you bitch, 'cause you gon' get a nigga busted
Worrying 'bout the wrong things while I'm hustling
Put the dick up in your mouth while it's running bitch don't ask no questions
Soon as I heard they said ""young nigga killed it""
'Cause I go too hard I eat beats, mmm scrumptious delicious
You chewing your kidneys I hope you see blood in when you pissing
And we run up in your house on Christmas, and don't ask no questions
Just shoot whoever's present, why they open their presents up
Please Lord forgive me, I just talked to my reverend
Asked him if I'm the devil he said ""that's these bitches""
See I'm from New Orleans, that bitch is infested
Shoot out like the Westerns, kill you and your bestie
Pay niggas to do it correctly, two ninas they lesbians
I gotta shoot you with both or else one would get jealous
I make money not exceptions, take pills like breath mints
She just get dick and refreshments, free all my dogs in corrections
We all we got don't need extras, we don't expect shit
We don't get mad over pussy, I'm probably lying in some pussy
While fools out here dying over pussy, and that's what I don't understand
'Cause a young nigga living right
Young nigga living right
(Nigga) Yeah a young nigga living right
A young nigga living right
Don't get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga living right
Bitches see me and start getting right
Because they know a nigga living right
(You see)
Standing on the top I got a
Lot of observations
Young nigga lot of options
You, you
Running through a check
Buying all the champagne, been blowing up the net
And setting all the trends, showing niggas what's next
I was drinking coffee, smoking weed on the jet
Probably with your wifey, getting her back for pillow talk, but we ain't talking
Getting top, I'm laying on top, swear to God I had a chopper
Now the gun biz are the friends hopping out of helicopters
I be rolling out the doctor's wishes
Counting up the money, kicking out the bitches
'Cause they all up on you but be gone when it get real
Bitches ain't shit but a brick to your windshield
Shows in the evening, business meetings in the morning
(Hoo)
Goons on deck, don't make a nigga sic 'em on ya
(Go, go, go)
Niggas talking shit gon' make a nigga get pneumonia
Wrist so cold, think it's sick and got Ebola
Crib so big got a bitch in every corner
Joint smoke good 'cause I showed her how to roll it
In the mornings I got meetings with my lawyer
Arguments I'll never be a part of
Love pussy and some good conversation
And that money, we don't ever see a shortage
Nigga run up on me, he gonna be a goner
Bruce Wayne whip, I got a new favorite bitch
I got a joint I just rolled, I got a Liu Kang kick
I gotta do it big, it's just how I do things
(Uh)
Cause a young nigga living right
Young nigga living right
(Nigga) Yeah a young nigga living right
A young nigga living right
Don't get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga living right
Bitches see me and start getting right
Because they know a nigga living right
(You see)
My homie got the pistol and he might spazz out
Light span, mothafuckin' light span
That shit all depend on how tonight pan out
Oh, I said these hoes ain't right man
I left my shady bitch, I got a nice tan now
Red bandana in my right pocket
So if I pull the trigger I can wipe that down
I just put my gun up in her Coach bag
I won't hesitate to pull it right back out
Life Coach, I don't need no life coach
To coach me through my motherfuckin' ups and downs
Tell a bitch don't ask no questions, my money so old
I tell my new money, respect your elders
I'm starting to get jealous of my own reflection
The young nigga sexy, a young nigga healthy
A young nigga flexing, I'm counting my blessings
Achoo, God bless me, thank you, you're welcome
I talk to my reverend, asked him if there's a heaven
A heaven for a G, because me and my gangstas
Done done it all but never tell, he say ""we already in hell""
I said ""ain't that a bitch"" 'cause I work too hard
But still thankful as if this shit came as a gift
I just pray for my niggas that's out there still slangin' that shit
Keep my distance, I can't take that risk, I hope they understand
'Cause a young nigga living right
Young nigga living right
(Nigga) Yeah a young nigga living right
A young nigga living right
Don't get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga living right
Bitches see me and start getting right
Because they know a nigga living right

""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take till she get to shop?""
Don't worry why my wrist got so freeze
Tell her, ""Girl, like Doritos, that's (na-cho cheese)""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to (Lay)
I cain't (only have one) and I ain't tryin' to wait""

Butchu ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, till the roof get melt

Shawty say she wanna lick the rapper...
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor
I (Anita Bake) her, now she caught up in that (Rapture)
I got so much chips, I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips, you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mutha-fudge cakes, now tell me how dat fudge taste
I do it for Bloods' sake, suu-woo think it's voodoo
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate
She so-so-sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir, because they sang from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because, all (she) do is (bang)!

If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-can't-make-an-appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it - remix!
(Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs)

Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feeling of, me bein the shit
'Cause I was leavin' skid marks on, ev'rywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it like, Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere, innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in yo', neighborhood area, CD thang, tape deck
IPod, ya gurlfriend and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that ""I think I'm late"" text
Heh-heh, so wrap it up
Bu-bu-but, he's so sweet sh-she wanna lick the rapper
(Re-re-re-remix, ba-bay!)

All I know is paper, I don't know these hoes
I like mouth in my lap, and pussy on my nose
And I'm bringin' home the bacon, it's fryin' on the stove
You hoes can't drive me crazy, keep your eyes on the road
Got the money on my mind, and bodies on my nine
And I swear everyday I'm on my Ariana grind
Erase I got that yay, I got that ladidadida
And a kamikaze squad, and you chicken parmesan
Lord I'm a free man like I come from Amistad
Know I come from Hollygrove, turnin' o's to octagons
I get money while I'm sleep, I dream that I'm in heaven
I dreamed I saw Lil Beezy, and smoked a gar with Wessy
All my niggas rest in peace, and my enemies rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep they catch 'em when they least expect 'em
Momma told me if you run these streets, run these streets correctly
Well feet don't fail me now I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows, I wear new clothes to the mall
Two hoes on my arm, fur boots when it's warm
Church shoes to play ball
We spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me
All I love is paper, I don't love these hoes
Boy that vest won't save you, neither will heroes
Lord he better hope you save him, better catch the holy ghost
Holy moly hockey mask like Halloween like OVO
Lord all I know is strippers, all they know is poles
All they sell is pussy, 'cause they been sold their soul
Boy you go 0 to 60, I go 1 and 2 zero's
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord all I know is paper, big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is, that bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience, till I heard ""All aboard""
They mad 'cause I be skatin' at home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
God damn, a pint of lean almost 5k
I be spendin' 25k every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day 'cause Hood just came with them chickens
I don't want you in the house bae
Plus we need the kitchen, Lord, trap house in abundance
We got trap houses in London, y'all don't hear me
Hol' up, had to switch the flow up, had to pour up, roll some more up
Watch me go up, my doors go up, when I show up, why you show up?
Pick my bro up, pick a O up, hit the store up, get a soda
Get us 4 cups, split a 4 up, then we slow up, yeah you know us
Then we toast cups and we post up, don't approach us, we got toasters
That's my slime like we ghost bust and we both bust, give no fucks
Take no stuff and take your stuff, then ho hunt for some choca
I know a ho who'll rock the boat, but I row her, I'm Noah Lord
I remember when I was no one Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimetres oh Lord
I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms
He died recent, so I hope heaven made more room for him
And I hope he see me, 'cause if he didn't save that lil boy there would be no Weezy oh Lord"

The fodd of the squad
And Baby bout to buy me a house in the sky
Why? 'Cause I'm so fly
When my feet touch the ground sometimes I gotta ask myself why
Coupe kinda wide but I move sorta quick
Looking for my roof where it went
Mink on the floor big shoes on the bent
Windows are the tint more wood than a bench
Working in the hood more green than the Grinch
Please don't play 'cause I'm connected like Sprint
Leaves on the tray popping up the back-end
Peppermint leather with a feather in my brim
It's Lil Weezy
Sucking on my wrist real breezy
And this is what I say when you see me
Look, and leave your broad at home she get took
'Cause I'm a player hold the game by the book
Some call me Weezy

Sweet, do speak when I should've put trays
Forget it I'ma slam it on bubba-bubba-blaze

And beating went to the A
Eat with JAZZY FAY

But she was so fly
She invited me over
So I hopped in the Rover
Then my lady called the phone
And I should of went home
But I let the phone roam
And it was like
Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's was like
Oh
I can't keep my hands to myself
I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or will it end in tragedy
I swear that I was done
I'm never going back
Then she called me up
She said I left my hat
You know I can't live without my hat
I got an excuse double back y'all
So you know I'm gonna have a ball
I said I'm going back y'all
Believe me that's not all
And now I'm like
Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's like
Oh (Young Money)
I can't keep my hands to myself
I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or let it end in tragedy
Uh, I got a main bitch and a mistress
I'm trying to work it out, I'm on my fitness
Probably won't last, but I'm optimistic
One makes me happy, the other one makes a difference
I ain't a player, but I love a lot
She loves me, she loves me not
But it feel good, and it's not supposed to
I eat her insides, mm soul food
She put her head back, then her eyes close
We stuck in the moment like the time froze
Then my girl call, back to reality
But I keep her in a picture in my heart gallery, oh
Oh (Yeah)
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's like
Oh
I can't keep my hands to myself
I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or let it end in tragedy"

349,Loyalty (Skit),2006,"Like Father, Like Son (2006)",Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"You know while your mother is cooking the macaronni today I figured id sit down and talk to you since your old enough. you know its time that you really realize what this family is all about cause about this time is when your gonna be able to join in and earn some real money and real cash but before you do that I wanna teach you a little bit about loyalty, the main name of this game is respect and loyalty. family is a big thing when we do this kind of business everything is with respect and when a family member gets outta line and another family don't like it one thing leads to another and the next thing you know, you're gone and then your just a memory of me, my hearts broke then, but you gotta remember there's always family and loyalty, loyalty is the main thing. obviously you know I don't make my money, I don't make all my cash from uh construction jobs we do and uh sanitation and private stuff is all earned money through the family and since your of age now I think its time i
Taught you what coming into the family and respect is all about. so the first thing you gotta learn is the name respect, tha means you don't cross nobody you don't go over the line, once you go over that line there's no coming back whether you're a member of the family or not. that's when people get whacked and we don't want nobody whacked in our family so I gotta teach you the proper way of respect. when you're earning money, everybody earns, everybody eats bread. it's all about cash money that's what it's all about making the money. so the first thing of business is this, you remember your name, you don't forgets your roots. you never ever disrespect anyone that's above you especially your capo especially the big time guys, those are the guys you listen to. you never ever disrespect anyone unless your told to unless you get the okay. and if there is no sit down there's nothing"

And my coupe is a 2 seater so you bitches gotta follow
Now buss it open backwards like the doors on a Rolls
I got money in my pocket, I got hoes on the pole
See, see I'm steppin' out froze

All this money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole

It's young Elvis Freshly in the four door European
And the tint dark as coffee, a n-gga feeling bossy
Pulling hoes like a tooth and it's hard to get 'em off me
I'm a stunna like the CEO of Cash Money records
The Louie V rag got me chequered with the matching kicks
Grinnin' at your chick, the surp got me leaning like 10 after 6
Therefore I tell her, go on buss it open
Goin' buss it open, they call me short dawg but no I ain't from Oakland
My money so tall that you gon have to climb it
If she know how to rewind it, trust me I'm gon change the climate
And then I get behind it like I'm tryna do the heimlich
She heard that I be rhyming and I'm balling like Kurt Heinrich
She's looking for some love, but over here she will not find it
So get down on your knees, you're in the presence of Your Highness

The street talking, bullshit walks on crutches but it's strut to strut
Niggas panic button pressing the end is coming
Count your blessings
We living in the day and time where the ten commandments are now suggestions
How depressing, how invested click clack, pow intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses with tight pussies
I found the crevice
AK bullets move mountains
Break them bitches down to pebbles
That tough talk is like music to my ears so keep it a capella
Based on a true story we not worry you too worried
I faced my fears and told them motherfuckers y'all too gorgeous

Shoot or get shot or a nigga choose for you

Take off looking for something to take up
Want the paper? Or you want in the paper?
Not horoscopes but in the horror scope
Pray to God you see tomorrow, nope
They gave my nigga 30 for a jar of dope
But do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap
Blowing so much you sneezing dick

Uh, I'm priceless, remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me and continue to bite me
Got no degree but where I'm from, that's the original climate
Where you can't tell a fiend a crack rock isn't a diamond
Hold on, Lord if my Bugatti come to a dead end
I've already been everywhere except heaven
And tomorrow's not promised, when I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my momma, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side

Searching for better days, before a better person
I'm perfect, just ask my bitch and she'll say that's so urgent
I purchased, my children gifts and I just keep the curses

Stay out them streets 'cause they don't fuck with us, they hunting us

Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin', problems on the triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you nigga's skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
Yeah
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't
(Don't hurt me)
That's right (Don't hurt me)
I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)
Huh

I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never givin' in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love
It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now
(Yeah)
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't

That's right (Don't hurt me)

Whaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
Or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings
And z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Wheez - anything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicadins valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people,
When I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'ma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind

I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine

You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes

Nigga, y'all gon' respect Wheezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', ""Stop!""
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed
On the corner till the mornin', see the cops and flee
And if we beef, we don't beef long 'cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
'Cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than ""The Three Lil Pigs'"" last damn house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, nigga - Wheezy Whee tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind

Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'ma tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks till I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich 'cause I wan' shine

Boy Mack supa fly in a Coupe Deville
And got birds in the field

Neighborhood superstar, third world gangsta

412,Outro,2011,Tha Carter IV (2011),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"(Verse 1: Bun B)
Yeah... When I step in the spot, motherfuckers say ""who that? ""
Big Bun B, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man (damn!)
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with DA so you know what it is
I'm sittin' on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps that are holding back... let's go!
(Verse 2: Nas)
Look who crept in with automatic weapons, reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record goes back to ""The Essence"",
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man, intestine,
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
But I'm like a gastric bypass,
Bunch of Nas African actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow, cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit, I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon,
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden, I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected, chowed down now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs, bust louder than the noise I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin'... testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry the 8th, guillotine to ya neck, bitch!
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude, studied cowards that made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food, you can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne, let them niggas hate
I love my nigga Drake say ""we ain't got time to respond to niggas""
(Verse 3: Shyne)
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa
Blood gang, five! It's that Blood gang, five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fight
They actin' like they ain't gon' die until I let them llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it's no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!
(Verse 4: Busta Rhymes)
They say I'm underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin'
""There he goes again! ""
See now they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
Now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake 'em when I come and shake 'em
And bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain't no fakin', ain't no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin' up
Everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (Damn!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
OK, now enough of that, see now I'm out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with Tha Carter IV"

416,Paradice,2010,Rebirth (2010),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"She was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame

Oh no, this ain't paradise, yeah
Oh no, this ain't paradise
Oh no, this ain't paradise

I say love don't love forever (oh oh oh oh oh)
And everything that's new gets old
Sometimes we try to find the road to the riches,
Need roadside assistance
Blisters on my knees
From begging for forgiveness
Ain't no dollars on my trees
But mileage on my feet
'Cause I been climbing to the peak
And running from the bullshit
I'm tired of hearing the same song
Who told the DJ to bring it back?
Dead presidents bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat
Staring at BIG poster, I swear that he be winking back
Cut school, sell crack
Sorry, I'm just thinking back
Call me crazy, I been called worse
It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth? (haha)

And I'm in her pussy thinking about money
I done forgot what all my old hoes look like
But they see me with my new bitch make them miss the good life
I move to Cali had to leave the beach alone
And you could call me what you want, just don't call me on speaker phone
And the good die young and the great live forever
Go see your memory bank teller 'cause you done forgot who put this shit together
Wait bitch
I hop in my Phantom and drive to my phone start roaming
Lord I don't want to talk to nobody I want my moment
Please pardon my rest room but Tunechi got the longest shit list
My pockets are pregnant they up early with morning sickness
I swear I been through so much but that's life I get high it don't phase me
They ask how do you sleep at night I reply like a baby, bitch
I been outchea doing me by myself nigga no special features
It's all about the Benjamin no disrespect to Aretha
But I got to get that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby
'Cause this game fuck everybody, this game fuck everybody
Got to get that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby

But I got to get my paper baby
Perfect attendance on the block I'm booming
When it's cold, when it's rain, when it's muggy, when it's hot, when it's humid
I walk into the corner store feeling like a king
World on my back shit feel like a mink
Mad at some motherfucker dropped my pill down the sink, hold up wait
I got xanax, I got percocet
She give me pussy and her income tax
I send my goons to rob the dope man
They bring it back now I'm the dope man
Suitcase, dead body in the suitcase
Molly in the Kool-aid, we put molly in the Kool-aid
I'm still watching boot legs 'cause I can't go to the movies
'Cause I'm bigger than the actors in the movies
Me and your bitch made a movie
I'm on a new wave
I been wilding in these streets mamma but still remember everything you said to me
Don't believe these hoes they be lying through they teeth mamma toothache
Oh lawd, I got to get that paper

I hop in my Bentley and drive until my phone start roaming
Lord I don't want to talk to nobody I want my moment
I use to be fun loving now I'm a gun loving killer
But these niggas made me like this
Now they all afraid of they own invention
I walk with a limp 'cause this AR will not allow me to walk straight
I come to a stage in my life and I just can't let my life move me upstage
Tuxedo on and a cummerbund, finger crossed behind my back
On the corner watching my money come
'Cause I got to get that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby
'Cause this game fuck anybody, this game fuck everybody
Got to get my paper baby, my paper baby, my paper baby

Hold up wait, I don't want to do it no more no
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more
I wear black 'cause I can't find nothing else to wear
I wear dreadlocks 'cause I can't do nothing else to my hair
I kiss you 'cause it just happen
I do what I do 'cause it got to be done
But I guess I oughta take credit for something
Yesterday I met a woman on the stairs that wasn't there
She wasn't there today, I really hope she go away
(These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
I don't want to do it no more no)
'Cause you know sometimes that last doesn't happen at first
I'm the pimp and the problem
She said you don't think of me when I know you think too much
(I don't want to do it no more
These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody
And I don't want to do it no more)
She said I think you think I think you think of us
(I'mma get this paper baby, I'mma get this paper baby)
She said she wanted sprinkles I said sprinkles are for winners

Weezy, baby, diaper off, different cloth
Different thoughts, sippin' syrup like it's broth, life is short
Tart, fuck his bitch, whip his kids, drive his cars, fuck
I'm grindin', tryna stack a hundred commas
Just popped a combo, I ain't talkin' 'bout McDonald's
I'm standin' at a table full of choppas
I'm standin' in a Maybach 'cause it's topless
I'm standin' at a table full of options
Different bitches, different flavors, different toppings
And we ain't got no traitors in our posse
And really I'm just wavy and I'm saucy
And really I'm amazing and I'm awesome
My whole squad lit, nigga, arson
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't all in, nigga
If you ain't been to Vegas, you ain't party, nigga
Shout out to Lil Capito and Marley, nigga
I've been fuckin' with them since Atari, nigga
And me, I'm a lil 504, New Orleans, nigga
I be in 305, though like a Marlin, nigga
And Hoodie, he from Texas, bitches boppin', man
And since I met him, I ain't ran out of drank
When we leave H-Town it's in a fish tank
Glass house Chevrolet, you can see everything
Bad bitches with cocaine nose rings
Get it with the real niggas and expose lames
Cold game got me in the Mo sane
Killin' these streets, audio drug slang
If you don't collect Ferraris you ain't poppin', nigga
You could learn Italian in my driveway, bitches
If it ain't OG I ain't coppin'
Don't smoke, we just throw it in the garbage
Them niggas ain't tough, we just talkin'
Outchea after dark, them niggas targets
Horror movie writer, I be with the monsters
Trill surround us, you might not make it out of
Phone calls in the morning say they found him
Whole hood wanna see what y'all gon' do about it
Rolled up on the front porch
At my grandma's house watchin' Blood Sport through the screen door
What you know about gunshots? Ever seen war?
I've really seen more than I talk 'bout, nigga
Stuntin' on streets you're scared to drive down
Our town, children be firin' live rounds
Hug the ground 'cause this shit gettin' serious
Fuck around, get killed unintentional
When I'm outchea eatin', nigga, Whole Foods
Rollin' up straight gas, fresh produce
I'm the guy that you go to, criminal smooth
Digital moves, triple the loot
Hopped on the phone, called the lot, ""Gimme the coupe""
I thought it through, called back, told him, ""Give me two""
That's what I do
If you ain't got no Daytons you ain't poppin' nigga
One time for my lowriders hoppin', nigga"

Half a million for a watch with no diamonds
Brought cash to the jewelers, still had change
Ooh, sharks in the crib and in the back yard
Elevator in the house, never got stuck
I just looked in the mirror, got star struck
I just looked at your bitch and got eye fucked
Who the fuck wanna race? Put your money up
All you see is license plates, far in front of you
I gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life
She licked her lips twice and told me I'm yummier
Glass house on the block, 5 floors in it

You observing it, I'm absorbing it
Judge mad 'cause a nigga make more than him
Ignoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims
I'm going in until I'm pourin' in more than M's
I'm courting in swimsuit models that don't know who I am
In foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films
My warrant clear as day like Doris is
When I ain't trippin', my lawyers is
So what the charges is? Put it on my tap, baller shit
I'm from the cell to the mall with this

One time for the hustlers and the young moms
My presidential is crunch time, looking in my son's eyes
Only time I see a upside
I tell him he gon' be a tough guy and never be a punchline
Tell him never wait in one line, tell him not even a lunch line
Pray more than some times
When the cops come you tongue-tied
Take dirt, make a mud pie
Lookin' out the window, in the coupe with a bimbo
Talking 'bout who she resemble
Bitch you in a Enzo, stop being so simple
Now fuck me like we in a limbo
I ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill
I got ocean views, I got water bills
I got cards to deal, I got hearts to steal
I got larger wheels on my automobile
I lost appeal, the bullshit cost me a mil
It brought me to tears, I came home and brought me a crib
I walked through that bitch, strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk through that bridge
I got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge
I started to swig, but ended up drinking all of that shit
'Cause I deserve it, I be working hard for all of this shit
I step into a Rolls Royce when I walk out then pen
My nigga I'm, I'm post bail ballin, post bail ballin'

Watch these snitches, man these rats think they Mighty Mouse
In the kitchen, Arm and Hammer, just the right amount
Got the dope spot popping, dope spot jumping
Car parked by itself, robot stunting
And it's voice activated, I just tell it something
I ain't even gotta press a button
Viper with the rally stripes, I don't eat no Rally's
I don't eat my words, nigga I don't eat no salad
I got too much on my plate, I got too much on my palate
Never seen my car before - it's like a unicorn in traffic
Too much fucking talent; rap Shakespeare, go Hamlet
You other boys could kiss the game goodbye, be romantic
Please don't worry Nancy, all my weed is organic
If my children end up smoking
I'll whip they ass if they don't pass it
Hol' up, I just got a package
I let my bitch test it, with flying colors passed it
Burning money fast, like fire on the plastic
You a dead man walking, throw some tires on your casket
They say niggas in wheelchairs is half dead as it is
I still keep the heat on me, attitude cavalier
Boy I think your whole clique's Summer's Eve, Massengill
Monastat 7 Vagisil

Boom, It's my shot like Biloxi
Even my shadow don't trust me
Big dog in this shit like a husky
285, 20 pounds of musty
Stopped by the spot, had to serve Pooh bear
He buy one, I front him one, so I left two there
In a two seater, pull up popping 2Pac
Didn't have a safe, so I stashed it in my tube sock
Eat so much Benihana I need nunchucks
You just a old nigga always saying big bruh
You a bad bitch always saying big daddy
You a real nigga talking 'bout you want a selfie
Uh, a baby bottle with my shit in
And my role model was a kingpin
I say let's work, he say let's work
Let your next work be your best work
And it's that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
And I'm so sorry for the wait too
From New Orleans to the A, TRU
You test my homies, we ace you

Scheduling million dollar meetings with the president

Rappers are liars and they women are deceitful

Then he got it for me and I'm happy as can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off ofa rebound

When I look into the mirror in the morning I don't see anything
What happens when the sun don't rise and the birdies don't wana sing
And even the flowers of the day die and then they stink
And then they shrink
And even the friend of mine says the shrink might work
And I was thinking bout clearing my mind but I'm afraid it might hurt
And just when it seem that I got the hole world at my door
The bell ring and I open up with a bang

Okay, let's cut the crap
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap
I only stick with that 'cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat
I be dipped in black
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out
'Cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow
Unlike no other, I'm real gutta like bag 'Bauds
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow
Is that so?

Look,
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?
I'ma strap up and slam his parent's street
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease
There has to be some explanation for this insanity
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy (fill in the blank)
Now give me the dank
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank
What's your kid gonna think?
Come home and find your wig in the sink
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti
For fifty G's I get ten keys and straight out weight it
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys
They know Wheezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys
Never catch me UNPACK without them plastic toys

Niggas that's askin' for it

I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes
Two pistols, desperado gun busta
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick
'Cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'

You know you couldn't find a better thug

So young that you even called me your little brother
But I'm all grown up now I got my own money
I'm married and divorced and my daughter is a woman
And guess what? my daughter want another
Sister or a brother and you lookin' like a mother
I took you from a clubber to a lover
And you took another bitch husband
The other bitch wasn't doin' shit for him
She say she did too much, I say she did nothin'
She need to quit frontin
I havent hid nothin' and you love everything
Can't hide ya feelings, can't let my pride conceal it

And baby you can keep the change, but...

Then we wake up and we pick up where we started
Then she make a nigga breakfast sprite, orange juice, and water
And she on stage waitin for me after my show
So no time for groupies, straight to the top flo'
Fresh out the shower, a smile and a towel
Then after an hour, she gon need another shower
I'm at home or in the coupe or in the office
Or the streets or in the booth, thinkin' 'bout you
And, most of the girls that come by are cute
And they try to holla but they all on mute
And, my old girls turn they face up at me
And, they thrown they purses and they make up at me
'Cause you got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby you can keep the change but...
Come home smellin food on the stove
She done cleaned the whole house
Washed the dishes and the clothes
And we out we do it just how we supposed
Look good for the public leave the drama in the Rolls
Royce, choice of car dat we move
And she gets high sometimes 'cause I'm always doin' it
You hear them hallways we always doin' it
Work cut, always feel like the first one
Perfect, when a nigga stressed off dat work shit
Take away all the pain, make it lesser than dirt
That's why you got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby you can keep the change but...

It be the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles, way I displayed
When I used to cool out where all the other kids played
'Cause I was way too ill, I would home my skill
Go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark
Two dudes, brothers would dip from us, me, and NARCS
And then my, legend would grow on the A-train line
Where rappers would gather to see my blowin' nicks and dimes
It was me, Big Pete, Tanya, and Sir?
When in the heat of the cipher, I was not liable
For all the casualties of the dutty MCs'
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in ya head, we gon' rock the dead
Night of the living MCs', the weak ones fled

So ahead of my time with my next week ass
Money on the dinner table like let's eat cash
And I do it for the killers and the hundred dolla billas
And from now on, I don't think you should stunt without a million
Dollars in the bank, I got money in the bank
Now throw yo' hands in the air if yo' pussy don't stank
You got a bullet and a shank, I got a bullet and a tank
I got fur, in my boots, and the hoody on the minks
Stop sweatin me, you should follow me, I'm directing it
Other fools break it down, I be dissecting it

(Q-Tip - Verse 1ne)
I don't think they heard me, hold up
...So here we go, now
It be the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles, way I displayed
When I used to cool out where all the other kids played
'Cause I was way too ill, I would home my skill
Go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark
Two dudes, brothers would dip from us, me, and NARCS
And then my, legend would grow on the A-train line
Where rappers would gather to see my blowin' nicks and dimes
It was me, Big Pete, Tanya, and Sir?
When in the heat of the cipher, I was not liable
For all the casualties of the dutty MCs'
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in ya head, we gon' rock the dead
Night of the living MCs', the weak ones fled
C'mon Bust

And strangle niggaz like poisonous octopuses - shut the fuck up

476,Say Whats Real,2009,"Young Money All Stars, Part 2 (2009)",Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertaining as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back
But it's hard to think of them polite flows
Mr. fano poloto suits on your night clothes
And jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full
Now this shits just been light pole
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets
Showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camara
Someone gotta tape dis
I make hits and like a bitch
Just married I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness
I'm that close to
Don't ever forget the moment
You began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los angeles, cabanas or atlanta south
Watchin home shows
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarased
To put my phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She said I shouldn't have until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is and counts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters trying to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just see my ex-girl
Standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear
We from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something dat these lables can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And still b only tellin' tales ""damn drake fly""
And he just be like ""silly mother fucker I know""
That was your bad
How could you pass up on em?
He just take the records
And he gas up on em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em
Oh they did pole
At least they try to
And that's what happens
When you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you
However they decide to naww
Before they told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause who of known me would
Mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed in the slightest
Could of fooled me
Baa into my city I'm da 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and is not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type
And campus life is crazy understand
I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest versus down at cabo
So if you find a blackberry with the sides scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit
I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in their verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said 'cause it's ye shit you better kill
And I think it's got them making of a legend feel
Problem with these other niggas they
Ain't never real
Yeah... that's all I can say"

My bitch is independent, she don't ask me for a dime

From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant, she doing lines like a movie script But these are true events, lord
I'll kill a nigga right now, I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box, with holes in his body, like socks
These niggas softer than, these niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth, I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fucking self, you only live twice slime
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline, I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me, these niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline, but they never try mine
Spittin' like I'm sipping cyanide while my bitch sip a mai tai
But she wine fine, and I'm so sorry, she say ""don't be sorry""
Woo! Then she said ""don't apologize for shit

Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back
Told me ""Baby it's real.""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby you know the deal
'Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

And I tell her ""Go on! Pop that pussy for me.""
Haters can't see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her till she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and imma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!

Sorry for the trouble that I put you in your heart too
God knows that I'll do anything for a part 2
Hard to be friends for the day you come back to me
Sayin' that you forgive me
Give me another chance I'm needing it like a kidney
I don't want a advance
Give me back her hands give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up, but everybody fucks up
Now this southern nigga lucked up
Telling me and my click don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm from new Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was a soldier
I was a gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster. Bang

Always Trying, To Keep It Under Control (I see you hiding it mama)
You Got It Down, And You're Well On Your Way To The Top (You doin' your thing)
But There Is Something You Forgot
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fight
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, you would cry twice
To me you were the brightest star under sunlight
Take away my title, take away my strength
And give me back my girl and you give me back my life
-Give me back my girl and you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hoping she'd be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I can bring it back
What she means to me is what I mean to rap

You Got It Down (I know you do)
And You're Well On Your Way To The Top (But I wish you nothin' but happiness)
But There Is Something You Forgot
But I hope you haven't forgot about me
Up in the living room watchin sports center
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the lord is a forgiver
You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Why you even go and get a like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me butter, I called you babe
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say, please, don't worry about the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream. Damn

I shed tears 'cause I'm told that they'll heal
To tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Never felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin'
Way back it was hoops, now it's Maybach coupes
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin' at each other, sittin' in a court room I'm laughin', 'cause it's lookin' like a cartoon

But they keep takin' pictures of my jewels in the light
Hundred g's in the night, entertain big timers
Cause my 1 liners rule these dynamers
Smellin rosé on my breath, on ex brisco fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin' lavish stackin mail up
Clothes come from big 'n' tall?
Got live life, I'm tryna live life
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the Benz twice
Convertible to the cars, 'cause I murdered all of ours
Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars

But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin 'em mighty daily
I know I'm under surveillance (I look at it as a talent)
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin' I'm such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin' which way I'm goin'
Now I'm chatering boeings 'n' readin a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
And I never felt this way bout anything in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin' back at regrets

They go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight
Man somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the night
Yeah I'm single, nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sipping on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sipping on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight
Now she got on her fuck 'em dress
And I got on my double breast
And he been fussing all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F Babysitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up, she say she just playin'
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's 'bout to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lyin'
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up, if you single for the night

Young Money, Cash Money,
This is Da Drought 3
Ladies and gentlemens, Y'all know me,
You know I ride for my muthafuckin'niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
They tell me don't get high, and I should try to make a living,
I tell em' I'm gon hustle, and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes is so wide as he watchin the skillet,
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it, imma kill her,
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas,
And fuck ya, I spit on young money, we the illest,
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest,
My flow is nasty, like C Y Phyllis,
Self made G, and them bitches know the business.
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist,
And when I was 5, my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention,
You looking for devine and little intervention,
And the birds don't fly, without my permission,
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes,
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons,
See my world is different,
Like Dwayne Wayne,
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thang,
(Course)
And you know that imma ride with my muthafuckin niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
'Cause the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And if you look high, you see that I'm gonna be in it
The sky is the limit,
Buck Ten in the coupe, And ya bitch love it,
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects,
Tell the bitch don't talk to me,
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free,
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap,
'Cause I'm the type to let money talk for me,
My flow is art, unique, yeah
My flow can part a sea,
The only thing on a mind of a shark, is eat,
By any means, and you're just sardines,
I got the 40 cal. Tucked in my p.r.p's.,
What do you expect, I'm from New Orleans,
And majority of my city is riders,
They tried to make a brand new map without us,
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars,
And no matter how you change it, it will still be ours
(Course)
And imma ride with my muthafuckin niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And imma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
Because the sky is the limit,
Yeah, the sky is the limit,
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,
'Cause the sky is the limit,
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,
Use your head, or I'll take it off ya shoulder,
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting on the livingroom sofa,(that's fucked up)
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,
Use your head, or ill take it off ya shoulder,
Mail it to ya moms, with a dozen of roses, (Now that's fucked up)
And I'm a G,
And you ain't gotta know the alphabets to see,
I know that my whole city is depending on me,
And I forget a lot of shit, but I could never forget the streets
(Course)
So you know that I'm gonna ride with my muthafuckin niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
Because the sky is the limit,
Yeah, the sky is the limit,
And If you look high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me don't get high, not to try to make a living,
I tell em' I'm gon hustle, and I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit,
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit

She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster ... BANG
(Chorus) (Lil Wayne)
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control (I see you hidin' it mama)
You got it down, and your well on your way to the top (keep doin' your thing)
But there is something you forgot
(Lil Wayne)
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star under sunlight
See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl and you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me, is what I mean to rap (what I mean to rap)
(Chorus) (Lil Wayne)
You've been hiding, (y'know) never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin' it mama)
To keep it under control (but I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
And your well on your way to the top
(But I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness shawty)
But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin' room watchin' Sports Center
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner, but the Lord is a forgiver
You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me ""Butta"", I called you ""Babe""
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me, and I just wish you never forget me
And let me say, please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen, and all I can do is dream ... DAMN
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart"

Pain, since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me, sayin' that you forgive me
Give me another chance, I'm needin' it like a kidney
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much
But I fucked up, I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up

And I reach for the stars, got stuck in the clouds
Got high as a bitch and left my love on the ground
Now ain't that about a bitch? It ain't never about a bitch
I'll take your bitch and make her everybody bitch
Backed up by a bunch of G ass niggas
And I just bought your girlfriend some knee pads nigga

Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows
Soon as I'm done peel off like velcro, Gone
Baby I'm stoned, smoking on the strong
Got a huge ass bong
Swag off the hook, you can't use that phone
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on
One time for the G's
The niggas got it locked, the niggas with the keys
The niggas on the block, the niggas on they P's and Q's

I turn into Freddy, my fingers machetes
Trap house jumpin' like Monta Ellis
We trap out the teli when we outta town
Uzi on deck, phone ringin' off the hook
Bitch that's the plug
Ocean view bedroom baby
See through showers and I just put some fish in my tub
Hold up I ain't playin', niggas say they rich I say eeh
Same old song I don't dance
Heater on my waist hotter than a frying pan
If you don't see what I'm saying I give your ass a fuckin' eye exam
I ain't playin', guns in my hands I ain't prayin'
Fireman spittin' venom, Spiderman, I'm enhanced
I'm at peace, joggin' pants cost at least about a grand
I'm advanced like Japan, got more sand than Sudan, lord
And life ain't nothin' but a long day
And tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way, away
You know the haters come in all sizes, all shapes (okay)
That's why I had to get a little more trunk space
Gotta insurance on the trap house, Allstate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a heart rate
Got the trap house pumpin' like an 808
Boom like an 808
I could fly around that bitch need a tarmac
I just landed in Cuba need a straw hat
I gotta get the raw back I need a format
I put the shit on horseback and start my own ranch
From where they don't talk smack, they just snort smack
I turn your head to an open hot sauce pack
I tell the bitch some true lies and some false facts
Boy I'm drownin' in the syrup like a short stack
Ooh, 187, 211, hockey mask on, Wayne Gretzky
Stunt my ass off, chain heavy
Your bitch get passed on, chain letter
Train smoker, smoke plain never
Had a date with the devil, then I changed schedule
I'm a trained killer, like a paid killer
Better yet Saddam Hussein nephew
Nigga no love
That's from the bottom of my heart
I pull up and paint yo' whole fucking block red
And get out of my car and admire my art
Then smile at my thoughts
My bitch from Atlanta got eyes like a Hawk, she see why I'm a boss
I just got another speeding ticket on the Bugatti
While it was parked
Now I don't wanna talk, bitch I don't wanna talk
Lean in my punch, I decided to spar, anybody want war?
I'm excited to start, get indicted tomorrow, I be out by the morning, before I even yawn
Stay in ya' lane, I remind these little boys, this is victory lane, now do I need a horn?
The struggle is real, and the Bible too long
I'm writing my will, and I'm typing my won't's
Lord please, Kilo's OZ's
'Cause my bitch act like she like Pinot and cheese
I dropped out of class so I'm zero degrees
I can out-think a shrink, she can deep throat a tree
I can hijack a brincle, my sweet soda pink
I'm a freak-show to freaks
I'm spitting these bars, hope my bartap is cheap
I'm a hard man to reach, I'm newborn and deceased
I'm too hard for this beat, I'm the heart and the beat
The Chong and the Cheech, my blunt long as a speech
Roach look like a leech, I'm too long for the brief
I'm too wrong for the priest, with this chrome on your teeth that get blown out yo' cheek
Like my bitch mixed, like Long Island Tea
She don't hide her figure, she don't hide her feet

And bitch I'mma shine, like Connery

Couldn't fit a half a meal in the Gucci tote
Hit the lights
Watch the roaches say ""Good Night""
Spark twice, say ""Good Bye"" to the Mice
Cook nice for the little bit of slice
And watch them jokers put that fire to that ice
Sure as that dog's tail wag, it will bite

Won't you come on Eagle

Crackheads got bikes and pistols
Now run up on that crackhead and fight the pistol

A lot of y'all are still soundin like last year
The game needs change and I'm the mofucking cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush, shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious ya hate me

But I left somethin' in the car, so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin wet she only 5'2
And 48 hours was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn. My reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin I neva have to fit in
So tryin' to keep up with my progress is like a dead end

I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin waters steady tryin' to swim to shore
I'm on a shoppin' spree to get whatever is in store
Just call me ""Shopping Bag Drizzy""
And call me ""Mr. damn he ain't copin that is he?""
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy
While this young'n that you doubtin is about to get busy

I'm on the other side, but it is a sharp gate

And Imma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cowshit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit

Then the cooked haze came through
Some soft some stepped on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights, thought I heard niggas comin' thought I saw the cop lights but, I was dreamin', then I woke the junkies was fiendin, and I had coke so, I had hope ya may say that its wrong, but I ain't talkin' to ya child I'm talkin' to this song
I'm just, doin' a bump down memory lane, if I crash just pick up my brain, and yes, my niggas the same
But they quicker to bang, and if they do then I'm the nigga to blame
So I shoot first anyway, and I would do the honors anyday, and tell ya honor he a bitch to his face, and whip through the state like I whip through the yay
Show ya ass on how to take 4 and make 8. and it don't take four niggas to get straight, the only hot boy leavin' off this plane
Young, weezy baby, that's what ya bitch say, give ya ass a location and a template, show her how to work tha interstate, stop workin with that thinner weight, gecha rims fixed
Stop playin', cause all we know is gunplay
Trip while ya fall and my clip guna be empty
When the stomachs get empty anything's tempting, ain't nobody safe when its for the kids sake
The hurricane wiped us out like a earthquake, we trying to say grace, but we ain't gotta place to stay, so they made us evacuate
We on our way pussies, relocate

It's that simple yes homie pick the news up, it wasn't good nigga think about the hood nigga
The people who ain't, never had shit ain't gon never have shit
Bullshit, 'cause they still gon try to manage, niggas do anything like I don't understand em, but please understand us
Niggas with money lost mansions
Niggas with nothin' lost families
Lives lost from traffic, water up to the attic, there goes the stashes
But a nigga got passion, even though the bounce back seemin like magic

Hustle with what? how we gettin' on?
Where he's sittin' at, what he's sittin' on
Stand up if you know its true, the end of the world comin' and my city the proof, yeah, chyea, and this if after disaster, this ain't rap this is recap
Steppin off the G-4 still strapped
Bust ya head in the air that's a skycap, have my car pick me up where I arrive at, drop the work off cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars, dead presidents gotta dump the bodies
Birdman as long as we gon eat, then everybody gon eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reachin', and ima get there through these bars, believe me

Straight off the black gold, nuts in my hand, trustin' no man
Got my glock cocked, runnin' this thing, ya understand
We be steamin'.. blazin'.. nines, pumps, and K's, and
Holly Grove 17th, (what) the hood where I (what) was raised in (what)
Niggas bustin' heads and, runnin' duckin' Feds and
Rocks under they tongues and, ki's under they beds and
Hood fulla real niggas, twenty-four seven hustlers
Eh, until we shove a barrel down your pipe suckers
Ain't no love for no busta, no fear for no coward
No respect from no stunt, and no money without power
We keepin' niggas hotter, ewww nasty and sour
Pile up in the Eddie Bauer and BLAKA at every hour
Some niggas like that powder, foldin' up what they drain
Some like that weed or that dope and some shoot it up in they veins (oh)
From the home of that 'caine, jackin' and crackin' brains
Broadcastin' live from tha Block it's Lil Wayne (who it is?)
Juve: Nigga you got that yayo?
B.G.: Well cook something nigga
Juve: Nigga you let them K's go?
B.G.: Well bust somethin' nigga

See where I'm from we keep our guns out
Dodgin' cops and burnin' blocks, so we be thugged out
It's time to floss, bring the big bodies on dubs out
And they got quarters, halfs, and birds in that one house (I got it)
(I got it) It's all good in the hood but a lot illegal
Soon as you get it, hot skirt, there go them people
Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'
End up in Miss Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch
This everyday, at the spot where niggas murder off top, boy
It's the spot where they got Fire Girls and Hot, Boys
We don't know what be goin' 'cause we so blunted from trees
And we'll be 'round you all day till we ""400 Degreez""
And you see where niggas go, nobody be on the pulpit
They got a nigga got on a scarf, he flippin' out off that raw
Betta stay in yo' car, and make sure (beep beep) your door is locked
Cause this ain't nothing proper, cause Tha Block, is just Hot

We done shot out all the street lights
So you can't see who we be like
And we like, to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits, 'cause we ain't tryin' to be presidents
And ever since the coke drought, niggas been on a trip y'all
So you better watch what y'all playin' wit
Cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
Hah, catch your breath, now shhhhh, catch a slug
It's street smarts, plenty niggas that keep spots
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts
Callin' weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Go all out for that cake, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie 'em up put 'em in the vans, then put a gat in his jaws
... Tch, one move blow his cactuses off

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ain't nothin' nice or sweet (Huh?)
They don't even much understand this (Uh-uh)
Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes - I'm drunk and blow
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
For the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin' from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine - it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice
(Hook (Lil Wayne))
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues
(Lil Wayne)
Look-
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
(????) Off the meters
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy - just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton - mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty - I carry one
Come to kill up everyone
What!
(Hook (Lil Wayne))
(Lil Wayne)
Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Wheezy cock
And niggas be like Q-Tip 'cause they breath and stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop
I grease the glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me - everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly - ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house

Better know the time of day in any f-cking time zone

Pull in the ladder from heaven about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
In this World of numbers I keep my nine on
And I don't go to church because the line long
And the preacher he be getting his shine on
But I know my Lord I am God's own
Back to my hands, tick tick a time bomb

547,Tie My Hands,2008,Tha Carter III (2008),Hip Hop|R&B,Lil Wayne,"We are at war
With the universe
The sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
Da da, da-da-da da da
Da da, da-da-da da da
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down
Yeah, some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometime that tragedy means it's over
Soldier from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on
Let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn
I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly that low
No one's gonna save us now
How you feel, you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome, no
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be
What have I done so bad, what is my destiny
You tie my hands, what I am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad, what am I gonna be
I knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around, the luck's all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right
And I'ma tell you what's life
And did you know I lost everything
But I ain't the only the one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one
I walk a tight one
They try tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floatin'
And they wonder why black people still votin'
Cause your president still chokin'
Take away the football team, the basketball team
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
Let's pray
These friends, they come and go
But I got family, family
These kids, so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go
That there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low
And we can't overcome, yo
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be (what am I gonna be)
What have I done so bad, what is my destiny (what have I done)
You tie my hands, what am I supposed to see (what have I done)
What have I done so bad, what am I gonna be
And if you come from under that water, then there's fresh air
Just breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process is so much stress
But it's the progress that feels the best
'Cause I came from the projects straight to success
And you're next, so try
They can't steal your pride, it's inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining
I know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
See, right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark
We ain't trying do nothing but be at the heart
We need love
That's all y'all, that's all
Yeah, born right here in the U.S.A.
But due to tragedy
Looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So accept my emotion
Do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul
And I must be me
We got spirit, y'all
We got spirit
We got soul, y'all
We got soul
They don't want us to see

Everybody die, gon' bury me alive.
Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside.
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky.
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire.
Life ain't shit but bitches and money.
I pass that weed, like I studied.
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix.
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic.
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts.
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks.
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei.
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape.

If she don't suck dick, I don't give her that dick.
Got the world in my hands, I'ma dribble that bitch.
Money is the issue, full court pressure.
I like my blunt, Nutty Professor.
I'm a straight rider with a getaway driver.
Hit you dead on the money now you dead on arrival.
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends.
But never too rich for new money.

Rest in peace to the game 'cause I killed it.

I bought me a double R, 'cause I went from rags to riches.
And these niggas nag like bitches.
Actin' like little fags like Richard.
And all of my bitches be bad as vision
You got a problem I can fix it like a mathematician.

All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke
Tryna get some becky in the backseat of the ghost
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up every morning and I take a drag
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean then I laugh

You sweet as pie, a muffin or cake, dick in her mouth, I'm fuckin' her face
Live for the night, sleep in the day, get high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog, you sheep in the gate, pussy, umh, how sweet is the taste
Gun to your head, what you keep in the safe? Weezy bitch, I'm deep into space
Floatin' away like a leaf on the lake, I'm gone like, delete and erase
Talk that shit, I walk that shit, pills, weed, all that shit
If the bitch is bad, I'mma call that bitch, get pussy, ass, all that shit
Umh, what they talkin' about? I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm runnin' 'em in and walkin' 'em out, cars so cold I parked in the house
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant, flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it, money tall, Lisa Leslie
YMCMB connection, rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Woman up in my sheets is sexy, if she ain't fuckin' she can exit
Gun tucked in the waist, I bust in ya face

You're wylin' out then we're ridin' out, now your hidin' out, honeycomb
I'm laughin' to the bank like I just broke my fuckin' funny bone
What's really good five? I'm over here smokin' that really good five
Eyes so low I look blind, but the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas took lives and niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted they gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit, these rappers are just my hostages
Let's cut to the chase, my bitch no habla ingles

But please brah, won't ya come back for Lil Wayne
And see ???, Mrs. Roe, Sheryl, Kemp and plus Sinetra
Dawg, we really miss ya
And it ain't all that cool livin' off pictures
Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me
Can't believe you left me to be a small man
But I know it wasn't meant to be
That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me
It's up to you, Wayne, nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, 'cause everythang gon' be all right
I know it's hard tryna make but it's gon' be all right
All right I know it, see I got a child

But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy
But the same thang make ya laugh, make ya cry
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why
And ask him to bless your soul every time I pass by
I know he doin' it, and leavin' all the love to me
And I'ma prove it, and show ya daddy it's up to me
I mean it's up to me man

Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show
She do my dishes wash my clothes and fix my corn rolls
She do my diches wash my clothes and fix my corn rolls
I can't forget about my bitch name ""E.T"" Boo
She's a young project bitch I use to brang the hoe to school

On a scale of 1 - 10 and my girl be a 20,

My goons so pretty my goons are so with me,
Haters got to go on iTunes to go get me
Gaters by the doors, baboons and those grizzly's
All come at me when I'm on the microphone in the,
Mic check 2 - 3, I'm different like blue pee
And my girls be half naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man the boy been riding
And I ain't gas'd up because I'm more like a hybrid,
You think I'm stunting no I'm just surviving,
And I've been here but my soul is just arriving,
Look up in the air, it's a crow it's a robin,
No ceilings full dose
I'm prescribing, medication free
And for meditation we
Smoke some better tasting weed
That you'll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P as tack hotter than
Riding through a dessert on a camel back,
I done bin riding through wherever with the hammer strapped,
I ain't lying, I can do whatever if I'm planning that,
So I got my guns lets dance like fanny pack,
And we cooked the hard, cut the soft and bring the whammys back,
Mock yo b-tch where you muthf-cking family at,
Call my n-gga gudda if you trying to get your mami back,
All up in another n-gga woman I be ramming that,
Seeing through these see through n-ggas like their laminate,
Hip hop so contaminate, I swear just examine that,
If I'm such a philanthropist the god to these evangelists,
I dress all Los Angeles but I love miami though,
I am so New Orleans yes I grew pistachios,
Dat mean I go nuts on any beat they throw at me,
And the bitches is so at me,
And you know what they throw at me,

So we get high till it feel like the sky low

This is times up
Put your signs up

Money over all
The World is on my shoulders,

P-ssy has a pattern and I know where I'm going
And if you got beef I turn into a tenderloin
Sanity kills so I live the crazy life
I wonder if you'll pay attention if I change the price
Life is my wife, till death do us part
Man I'm fly as f-ck you ain't even next to depart
Quick draw McGraw, I hope you like art

Stepping on the bullsh-t

Disrespectful on the beat, Borat
F-ck the system and the p-ssy wasn't all that

Hope you put the kid to sleep, they be cock-blockin'
You could really get this meat, get this hot sausage
And I'm way too rich to beef, I just buy a body
And I really kick my feet up and that's not karate
Yeah I really kick my feet up, let a thot massage 'em
Where ya ass was at when I was with the Hot Boys?
Prolly watchin' Baller Blockin', eatin' popcorn
Where ya ass was at? You was in the drought, boy
I was prolly at the fight bringin' out Floyd
Say she love me 'cause I'm laid back, she outgoin'
I possess a drank, pockets fat like Samoan
I just told my goons I got it, I just waved 'em off
I just told Tunechi I got it and he said, ""Of course""
Lose my mind the only time I ever take a loss
I work too hard for takin' off... I'm takin' off
Really 'bout to see a billion, all in arm's reach
Sleep on a hammock in the middle of two palm trees
My neighbors can't sleep, all they hearin' is them cars screech
My bitch can't sleep, all she hearin' is them car keys

I'm just sipped out and I'm way too tired, I'm yawning

Where ya ass be at when we be poppin' all these corks?
Where ya ass be at? Know you're prolly with them dorks
I'm prolly with some bitches that be poppin' pills and snort
Diamonds in my mouth, no Swarovski
I'm hittin' notes with the pistol, oh I'm off-key
And the money... come at godspeed
I'm movin' slow, Lisa Turtle, Lark Voorhies
From the treasure chest, inside was a heartbeat
And Katrina had us hustlin' out a RV
We had to stash and steal, balled, Steve Harvey
We had to stash and steal, balled, Steve Harvey
And we set a nigga up like eHarmony
And your bitch plain, nigga, and your car cheap
And we leave your brain right there on your broad's cheek
And we leave some stains right there on your offspring
And the purple rain right here in the soft drink
Yeah the purple rain right here in the soft drink
And to fight the pain, nigga, like a horse train
And we don't complain, nigga, and we don't blink
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think
I think you run with 12 and I think these hoes quiet link
I be so underwhelmed 'cause I swear his hoe's style's weak
I'm movin' slow as hell but the money comin' godspeed
I'm movin' slow as hell but the money comin' godspeed
I just told a pussy nigga, ""Call your henchman, nigga""
I just stole on a nigga mid-sentence, nigga
Fiend searchin' in a haystack for syringes, nigga
Dopeman got 'em flippin' like some ninjas, nigga
Got 'em tweakin', got 'em lurkin', got 'em cringin', nigga
That's them symptoms, nigga, I can prevent 'em, nigga
Split a nigga's head in two, that's split decisions, nigga
Been to Hell and back, came back in mint condition, nigga
Feel like Heaven winnin' racks, return to spend a nigga
Feel like Heaven's only lackin' your attendance, nigga
Feel like stuntin', drop them tops but not them windows, nigga
Toss out your demo, I ain't even like your intro, nigga
I just went Kimbo with this tempo, un memento, nigga

I'm an x man bitch I ain't talkin' marvel comics
Put the dirty dishes in the sank
No pork but I get paid like a piggy bank
I spit like backwash, sasquach
No back talk, I act lost
But I bet that money find me
Your jewelry telling jokes
Man You got them funny diamonds
I got them sunny diamonds
I got them money problems
That Christopher Wallace
Fuck bitches get money
Young money
Do it do it

Listen... I'ma hundred percent hussla from my face to my feet
My lifetime cases the street, my dime places the street
Until I wake and see another fuckin' day is relief
I pray that he keep, I'm scrappin my knees from chasing this cheese
I had point guard dreams of playin' for some team
Hit the block and made NBA money in one week
See I hussle in the hood and plus I fly birdies
And play the tracks out every month so I can ride dirty
Needed someone to manage my money I hired Shelly
But Shelly started talkin' to much so she died early
They got me loadin up my Benz with my eyes blurry
I sent the message to the fucker at bout five thirty
Now if the bitch ain't got my dice for me then I'm sorry
But I'ma leave everyone who outside bloody
And then I go in the stash get the coke and the cash
I'm lettin niggas score it for half, I'm hopein it last
But still nigga don't, I might have to just go in the lap
And if its slow in the ass back to the rope and the mask
(Chorus) (Lil Wayne)
Man we got that white girl,
And wigga talk bout uh price to make it right for you
And if you like that alllright then we got what you neeed
And if you like that nasty broad then we got low ki's...
Dog who got um? We got that white girl
And wigga talk about uh price to make it right for you
And if you like that alllright then we got what you neeed
And if you like that nasty broad we got them low ki's...

Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust things
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get it - it's Wheezy Whee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'ma hit the block and barrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

On four tires, or feet, dog

Nobody is not sleepin'
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff
'Cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump
And passin' a blunt - me circle once to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead

Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday

Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed added up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks

Two tattoos but she say she gettin' plenty more
She got Indian in her family, Semino

And she get mad when I call other woman hoes
You send a rose

Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear
Then lick around her lobe
And when she check her watch it's never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like the common cold

She fell in love with the martian

Man, these hoes, love Wayne
Got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change

Down here waiting for her to cum like payday
I'm hoping this juice
Is sweeter than baked cake
She say it's for Tunechi
She lie with a straight face
But I'm trying to eat healthier
So I ate a veggie
Sucked on that pussy
I feel better already
She said ""Tunechi go slower""
And Tunechi went faster
My tongue is a motor
My dick is a NASCAR
Whipped cream on that pussy
Dick head like a bullet
If her hair real I'ma pull it
I hope her ass feel like cushion
I give her wood when we wouldn't
I hope that pussy tastes like pudding
Then I give that hoe the boot
Hold up, let me put my foot in (Tunechi)
Got a sweet tooth
Candy and pussy
I'ma leave that ass smoking like a Amsterdam tourist, man
These hoes, love Wayne

He scoping me out
If that dick like a tree
Watch me build a treehouse
OK, the baddest bitch in this bitch
Got the fattest clique in this bitch
You might drown
You better start doggy paddling in this bitch
I'm Trin Beam, nigga, queen, nigga
Sleep in this pussy, dream, nigga
I stay on that dick
Like a fucking balance beam nigga
Hair pulled, neck grabbed
Don't fuck with hoes that backstab
Don't fuck with niggas that ain't got shit
If I fucked a nigga, that's my dick
My mouth a jacuzzi
My pussy a safe place
Fuck me till daybreak
Then you can go skate

I'm Sorry 4 The Fucking Wait, was busy
Racing Ferraris with Lil Reginae, that's gangsta
You know I always come in second place, you hatin'
It's written all over your fuckin'
Bitch you jealous, woo, and I was right, yeah
Bitch you jealous, stunt, stunt, shit niggas don't like
Tell a fuck nigga ""bitch you jealous""
I'm Sorry 4 The Wait, apologetic
Bitch you jealous
Now give us our cash and our credit
Riding around like Pablo, still talking that blanco
My Nina sing soprano
So we gon' leave on a high note
Come out my shell like Rafael, and crack yours like a taco
Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne
Make him change his name to John Doe
It's me and my lil brother Capo, Lil Marly G, and my bottom bitch
If I'm falling it's bottomless
If I'm tripping it's a power trip
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates
And with that said I climb the fence
My other bitches gotta ride the bench
And with that said - bitch you jealous
I'm fly like my dreadlocks propellers
I think I should headline Coachella
My woman a queen like Coretta
And nigga you sleep with the devil
I couldn't be Junior forever, I don't mean to ruffle your feathers
But I had to spread my wings, ain't trying to get lemon peppered
Got too many pistols, too many issues
Too many mistakes, too many miscues
Only made me better, it turned me into
The man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just coming in
Like I broke a window to an igloo
Slow a bitch down like un memento
I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie
If she ain't fucking it's Uber time
I rather be advised than supervised
You do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine
In water guns and shoot each other, uh
I get high, meditate like a monk
Preposterous when I get drunk
And my goons is wilder than Gronk
My do's is as bad as my don'ts
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk
As long as the bitch got a donk
And I smell like; pussy, money, and weed
She said ""ooh, I like your cologne!""
The last niggas tested us flunk
So please study hard, study long
Kill your wife, then take the bitch phone
And text you to please hurry home
And the rain drops turn into blood
Look like you just come in from a storm
And if all pussies come with walls I hope you run into your own
Nigga I come with that heroin flow
I come with that never before
My CMB days are dead
I ain't worried bout ghost
I married the MOB, we divorced
And all that shit dead without me of course
It's nothing; a zombie, a corpse
You burnt yourself and was suppose to pass me the torch
Fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes nigga
I'm Sorry for the fucking wait
Was busy, searching my calendar for better days
I found 'em - you either turn the page, or tear the page
Y. M., Young Money, never age
Bitch you jealous, woo, and I was right, yeah
Bitch you jealous, stunt, stunt, shit niggas don't like
Tell a fuck nigga ""bitch you jealous""

What we gotta do
That's right, that's right
I gather y'all here today
To become a witness to something you may have never see or heard before
There's something I wish to share with y'all today
You know it's hotter than fire and it hurt worst than pain
This here is something you old folk, may not know too much about
This here, this is the, the young'n blues y'all
I got the, the young'n blues y'all
I got the, the young'n blues y'all
I got the, the young'n blues y'all
Check me out
Listen
I met her when I was young and she was younger
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing
I had to get her number
After how she made them daisy doots fit her all summer
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer
And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didn't come easy
'Cause she ended up being my baby's mother
And then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers don't know shit
'Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
She screamed to me
My love, my patience, my pain
Nigga please
I got the young'n blues y'all
I got the young'n blues y'all
I got the young'n blues y'all
I got the young'n blues y'all
I met her after the fame
And she ain't even like me but I got her after the game
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good, I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange and it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin what more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard, I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life the picture flipped
And none of it includes Weezy and all his bullshit
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep it, she ain't want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody
I got the young'n blues y'all
I got the young'n blues y'all
I got the young'n blues y'all
I got the young'n blues y'all
You see I never really ran, but no gentleman
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am
I'm just tryna be Weezy
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy
Baby girl, you gotta work with ya boy
'Cause all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy, ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin' we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do
And please consider that
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes
Love pussy but you don't love them ho's
Love ya niggaz love ya children
Now if they got a bitch you could love that
Holla back
I got the young'n blues y'all

If you ain't talkin' money hommie then dats cheap cheddar
I'm pissin on the game feelin' like I gotta weak bladder
N y'all fallin' off you climbin up a weak ladder
N I'm 2 high 2 try 2 reach ya son
I rock shows everyday wit ms. cita's son
Then I'm uptown baby like I'm peeta gunz
I lost tyreek 2 the lord I speak
I got game I'll have a vegie tryna eat my meat
(Chorus x2: mack maine)
Me 'n' tune is just 2 niggas from the same hood
Fell from the same tree
Cut from the same wool he the young lion
And I'm the young bull
Welcome 2 the zoo nigga
Welcome 2 the zoo
(Lil wayne and mack maine)
Now bring it back to hollygrove yeah hollygrove
A well part had work by the sliding boards
A well part get you murked by the sliding boards
17th ward animals and dinosaurs
Tyrannosaurus rex test me its m.o.b till a mortition dress me
And that's deep get run up on eagle street
Bail fast in monroe be right at ya front door
Knock, knock, hello there goes several fellows
With clips to the elbows hellrose
And tell them niggas we was hustlin till hell froze
Hollygrove ain't no muthafuckin melrose
Hollywood ain't no muthafuckin hollygrove
They could find yo ass Monday in yo Friday clothes
Or they could find yo ass part dead on father's day
Hollygrove usa were maine and carter stay
