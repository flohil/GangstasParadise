One-two, one-two
Kinda tired...
Big L, 'bout ta... get into some shit
Aight check it out
Yo, fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expandin my chips
You mad 'cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style, plus the way that I be flowin is sharp
A while back I used to hustle, sellin blow in the park
Countin' G stacks and rockin' ice that glow in the dark
Forever - hottie huntin, trigger temper I'm quick to body somethin'
You lookin' at me like I'm probably frontin
I fuck around and throw, three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm, older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hangin' around y'all, cause niggaz like you
Be prayin' on my downfall, hopin I flop
Hopin I stop, you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe, smokin' the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more, stitches than you
Fuckin' punk, you ain't a +Leader+ what? Nobody +Follow-ed+ you
You was never shit, your mother shoulda swallowed you
(Mmmm... WHOO!) You on some tagalong flunkie yes man shit
Do me a favor, please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead, and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nuttin Butt-head
{*Laughter*} My game is, vicious and cool
Fuckin' chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come, you can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggaz got they whole style from?
(Yeah!) So what you actin' for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga sum'un, 'fore I crack his jaw
You runnin' with boys, I'm runnin' with men
I'ma be rippin the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggaz like, ""Damnit this nigga done done it again""
I throw slugs at idi-ots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm makin' wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggaz
I might pull out this gun on your niggaz
And rob every last one of you niggaz
(Bobbito) Yeah! (What?)
(Big L) I'm TIRED
(Bobbito) For somebody tired, that wasn't, that wasn't too bad!"

My crew is in the house
Terra, herb mcgruff, buddah bless
Big twan, killa kam, trooper j, and mike boogie
And ima set it like this
Big l
Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin' this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my smith-wes blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap new york rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smoke, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than cali, wicked like harry
And fuck sally, I rather marry halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous
Terra
Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now its time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In 87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
N.o. rated, rappers you no-made it
Tell the terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that lord prayer
Power struck, terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts
Herb mcgruff
For those that don't know, yo, I'm herb mcgruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
Mcs are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than an African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to big l, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here
Buddha bless
Aiyo, its time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like its plastic
I rag crews 'cause I'm bad news
In a mad move I'm servin' brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
'Cause I'm a known medigan for poems I slide the hotties home
Heres some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fags life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin' niggas lives like a felon
Big twan
Yo, I bust chumps like a glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when its locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missin' like a cup scout
Killa kam
Rappers be funny like flesh, 'cause they sections 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But killa kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin' at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On lennox ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took
Trooper j
I'm havin' nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin' trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin' but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call 'em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallys than riots back in cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
>From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And mike boogies next up, and keep my head straight
Mike boogie
I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
'Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin niggas hoppin home
Word to god, its kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're comin' to see me, nigga, bring a cask and crutches
And niggas, I don't need a gun for you, none of you
'Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my no. 2
And its death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn they muthafuckin ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, 'cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like santa clause with a mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to big l, aiyo, 8 is enough
True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to d-whiz and short man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to rockin' wheel from the hard pack crew
Peace to mase murder and the b.b.o. crew
The best out crew, the m&m crew
And all the other crews that's representin in harlem
You know what I'm sayin'?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th street nfl crew
My crew
Word up"

Yo once again it's the Big L, that kid who got much props
From killin' corrupt cops, with motherfuckin buck shots
So don't step to this, 'cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big but they make coffins yo' size too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Cali, it's Harlem nigga we do walkbys
No one can match me, tax me or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps G just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me being a virgin, that's idiotic
'Cause if Big L got the AIDS every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
And I put more holes in his ass than swiss cheese
Chorus: Big L (repeat 2X)
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Big L)
I steal lives like a stone thief, so leave me alone chief
Or catch a buck shot to your domepiece
I must warn, I got it goin' on, word is bond
Ducks be gettin' thrown off platforms like P.M. Dawn
I'm catchin bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers, not just on niggaz but hoes too
So don't try to test me, 'cause I can't stand test-es
Fuck around, I'll introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears, pal
But man you've been rappin' for years now
And ain't made a hit yet, you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews, I come out of wars barely bruised
I'm puttin' motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the git-go
Leavin' fags in bodybags with tags on they big toe
(Big L)
Yo ever since I was young, I ripped mics and I killed beats
And I'm known to milk freaks and hit 'em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name, I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin' snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS, then I'ma start rapin bitches
I'm all about makin' papes kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past, stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty G's is what the creep stole; so the next day
Knocked on his door and shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Got it goin' on, from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style I'm wild, comin' straight out of Harlem pal
It's Big L, the motherfuckin Problem Child
(Big L)
This goes out to all y'all bitch-ass niggaz
So if your mother ain't ready for a funeral, don't FUCK with me
'Cause I know a good way to get your family together
And I ain't talkin' 'bout a reunion motherfucker
Yo, I'm bout to sign out, but before I go
I gotta say peace to the NFL crew, you know who you are
And all y'all niggaz talkin' that gun shit
And won't bust a rhyme, stop fakin the funk!
Word, I'm bout to get up out of here
Yo I'm out B, yo peace man
I gotta get this money
So all y'all niggaz on my hitlist get your suits ready
Hahahaha!"

(Check it, Yo!)
Crooked corrupted criminal crime boss with cream
Cocaine hustler, blowing out the brains of busters
Being my mansion, chilling inhalin the ganja smoke
Counting mad cream, weighin tons of coke
Guarded by thugs and rottweilers
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Niggas get plugged when my glock collers
Skunk smokers, philly and aisle ripper
Cristal sipper, I've been a willy for awhile nigga
'Gruff got hoes, the man with all the nachos
Expensive hot clothes, drop top Rolls
East coast west coast fiends overdose
'Gruff get the cream with my team and I'm ghost
(Murda Mase)
This money be temptin me, to jump out the MPV, empty 3
Clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since 14 I sold morphine for more green
Kept open a nautica coat under the draw sting
And watched out for cops, squad cars, and beamerz
And laundry ninas
Flea the country to Argentina
Laid back in the beach (yeah)
Coastin with commuters
Smokin' the buddahs, on the cruiseline boat to Aruba
For awhile yo, pump the vowel so, I can pile dough
Then become a Harlem Kingpin just like Al Po'
Get paid so, I can lay low, in San Diego
With yay-o so I can ship it out whenever I say so
Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean
Whether its Uptown, Downtown you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We ain't splitin this cream
(Killa Kam)
Yo! Imma run hestrically, till they bury me, count numerically
Hills of Beverly, more grands than cherokee
President like Eric B., and Rakim
Drug game I'm top ten, locked in, right now it's not an option
And those who creep, got the Mac in the heat
They got the 5 inch screens in the back of the seat
And now they got to steady braggin
Last year, had me saggin', wasn't ready when heavy
Was back tossed me in the paddywagon
But ain't nobody out here stoppin' love
'Cause we was 12 years old in the Cotton Club, poppin' Bub
So Hall of Fame without the fortune, Goddamn you wrong
Killa kid Kama'Ron surviving in the Amazon
(BloodShed)
Yo! I leave you dazed and froze
With all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded I counted with bathing with Asian Hoes
Back home niggas is after me
I'm back to sea sippin daquiri's
Coke factory, fiends baggin up crack for me
From cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
Nautica yachts, and knots busting outa my socks
Now that's bloods play the chub
All the ladies love me, they hate who made me hubby
Behind my back they say my babys ugly
Each night I sleep, with freaks with Lamborghini, jeeps
Neighbors be sneaking peeks, how my semen leaks, between the sheets
Mess up my loot, I cut your collars, Juan
Cause these is modern times, and the only thing I see is dollar signs
Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean
Whether its Uptown, Downtown you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We ain't splitin this cream

Harlem Kids is known for felonies, and sellin keys, pushin 300z's
Gee-Es- 3's, and puffin trees, these Gees breeze while Dee-Tees
Be yellin' freeze, we stash cheese while keepin' pockets full of centuries
Aye-Yo I'm set for the rest of my life
Some clown that laid the threat 'cause I had sex with his wife
I stuck my tool to his brain, so that fool can get slain

It's flamboyant y'all
Yeah, yeah yeah, corleone y'all
Me and my man was cruisin through the streets and everything was flowin nice
The corner's crowded, niggaz must be rollin' dice
I parked the ride so my nigga iroc can crash the lye spot
And I'ma gamble until he come back - why not?
Click-clack, cock the gat back, gotta be strapped
The game was mad packed, mad cats pockets was fat
They playin' cee-lo, my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothin' less than a g yo, you know my steelo
First I was losin then I started throwin' headcrack
After headcrack, got my bread back, jumped in my red ac'
I'm waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggaz startin to plot, and I'm far from my block
Finally he walked out, told him, 'hop the fuck in'
On my face he saw the grin and said, 'how much did you win? '
I estimated about, 45 maybe 50 g's
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at mickey d's
Now I'm alone, headin home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggaz trailin so I picked up the phone
Called bones, I said, 'yo son, I'm on the run
Need your help before I get done
Meet me downstairs, bring your big gun'
I don't believe this, this nigga said he can't make it
Cause some bitch is in his house butt-naked
And then he hung up
And this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut, what?
I'm cruisin fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from, and his grimy crimey
It's about to get, real hasty
Grabbed the steel, took it off safety
'Cause I refuse to let these niggaz waste me
I started to cruise fast, then stopped short and made 'em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed, when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too, leakin with a deep gash
I ain't panicked, I was quite calm
Couldn't use the right arm, so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him, shook my head then started buckin my heat
It's over now, cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think I'm dyin', I'm feelin' weak out on my feet
But before I got some medical help, I had to catch a cab first
To one-forty-first and bradhurst
That's where bones live, walked in the buildin, staggerin
Lookin' tore down, shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye, he knew he would die
Started to cry, stuck the gat to his head and said, 'why? '
Then he offered me, all of his cheese
Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out
Into the streets covered with blood, about to pass out
The hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but
Damn, here comes a couple of cops; I pulled out
And started blowin' they started blowin' back I'm goin' all out
I ain't holdin' back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin' back
I kept shootin, one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleedin real bad, and couldn't stop it
But still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets
The coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playin' everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them, run for they share
And all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear
Now I can hear the sirens, that means here comes the jakes
But it's too late, I'm knockin' on the pearly gates
Yeah, casualties of a dice game
Never gamble with snakes
Let that be a lesson to ya
Yeah, it's corleone y'all
Yeah, it's flamboyant y'all
Big l y'all, flamboyant baby, yeah
Big l... uh

Always spraying Tecs, because I be staying vexed
Some nigga named Dex, was in the projects laying threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinking
Put his brains in the street, now you can see what he was just thinking
I'm choking enemies till they start turning pale

""Can I get your autograph L?"" No bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breaking hottie hearts, niggaz drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge; just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tenant rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Aiyo crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggaz got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in Special Ed so I suggest
You spread pretzelhead, 'fore I turn your white sweatsuit red"

Still run with the same clan
Used to be a Kane fan
Everytihng I rock is name brand
Element, ya dame swallow
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin' midget's sips
I run with the richest cliques
Fuck the thickest chicks
Plus drop the sickest hits
You know nothin' about L
So don't doubt L
What this motherfucking rap game without L
Yeah, that's like Jews without ice
That's like China without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or crackheads without pipes
The Village without dykes
Or hockey game without fines

'Cause I'm the only son of the motherfucking devil
It's a fact I'm living foul, black
Niggas should have known I was sick from the shit I did a while back
Cause being bad I couldn't stop
When I was in pre-school, I beat a kid to death with a wooden block
Faggot niggas I was back slapping
I realized that every time I got mad something bad happened
A nigga hit me with a can of beer, then he ran in fear
Later they found him hanging from a chandelier
Enemies I be bucking quick
My moms know who I am because she know who she was fucking with
On my skull the 666, no tricks
When I catch fits, my mom picks up the crucifix
And I kill chumps for the cheapest price
I'm rolling with Satan, not Jesus Christ
Enemies I got several done
Big L straight from hell, the motherfucking Devil's Son
""When I was 12, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus"" (Repeat 3x)
""I'm waving automatic guns at nuns""
It's Big L and I'm all about taking funds
I'm a stone villain known for killing and raping nuns
Ayo I even kill handicapped and crippled bitches
Look at my scalp real close and you'll see triple sixes
There's no doubt I'm all about a dollar
I just signed a lifetime contract with the funeral parlor
This kid that owed me dough, I didn't take his life
Instead I tied him up and made him watch me rape his wife
One nigga cold tried to diss me and that shit is risky
The nigga took a swung but he missed me
So I popped off mad chunks not junk
I spit in his motherfucking face and then walked off
Once a hottie shot me with a shottie
I died but then I came back to life in another body
The way I'm living is dead wrong
I'm a devil from Hell without the tail or the red horns
Killing is fun, I'm #1 with a gun
Front and get done, cause you can't run from the Devil's Son
""When I was 12, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus"" (Repeat 3x)
""I'm waving automatic guns at nuns""
The Big L is strictly gunplay
I run through church and pistol-whip the priest every Sunday
Once I put out the crazy order
I sent niggas to kill Tone, his mom, and his baby daughter
I'm living up to my extortion image
I be stalking Lennox, catching more bodies than abortion clinics
A kid tried to take L out
Shot me in the chest with a tech, I just laughed and spit the shell out
Next I took his gun then he dropped to his knees
With ease I made him freeze, he begged me please not to squeeze
But I ain't the type to bust, I just sniped a bus
Gunclap *bang* Another nigga bites the dust
Shorts I'm taking none
Misbehave and get sent to the grave by the Devil's Son
Word, Big L the motherfucking Devil's Son is definitely in effect
Giving a shout out to all the murderers, thieves, armed robbers
Serial killers, phychos, lunatics, crackheads, mental patients
Mental retards, and a special shoutout to all the niggas with AIDS, peace

Since y'all wanna chit or chat with the powers
Y'all might as well join The Force

Takin' pitchers in silk, gayed it up
Passport: dated up, hair braided up
I fucked ya bitch but I ain't rape the slut she gave it up
I runnin' with Wop, you runnin' wit me, we runnin' together
We get drunk and blunted together
But don't front, the guns is under the leather
Ready to ill, ready to kill, ready to peel
Steppin to Corle' you better be real
'Cause none of my niggaz be lettin me chill
My crew be deliverin hot lead
When gats are clenched rappers I clap and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I be killin' up shit in rap events

With new clothes on, I'm fly

Money is chips, movies is flicks
Also, cribs is homes, jacks is pay phones

Nautica sweats with the fresh Gortex
Jewels with baguettes, swingin' like the Mets
Throwin' the dice and takin' all size bets

Yo - all of y'all weak people fall back

Leavin' big holes with small gats
Have 'em all fallin' where the wall at
All of y'all weak people fall back

Hot as hell blocks where shells pop
Where they sell rock to cop the SL drop
Hood bitches in nail shops; no good snitches that tell cops
People find bodies in lobbies, you can smell shots
Niggaz turn stale on the Rock until they bail drop
New York livin', got a nigga four-fifth limpin
Send you as a gift to the mortician
If you forfeit livin' - my fortune is forbidden
I say it one time before spittin'
Then I leave your forehead drippin
I laid low then came back for more bread grippin
More thread flippin
More head from chickens, it's time to turn the ape loose
Bust out the cage and let the gauge loose
Blow the feathers out of your Nordface goose
It's G. Rap comin' back with a click of brave troops
Have y'all niggaz runnin' for homebase like Babe Ruth
Have you holdin' holes in your body like you play flute
Lay you down till you get found up in the sprayed Coupe
Prepare for the takeover - give you the face makeover
The seedier row and sheet draped over
Be found on the block with the street taped over
Or comin' out of deep coma, your speech made slower
Corona Queens shakedown; I'm comin' with the nickel-plate pound
To trade rounds with all you fake clowns get down in the unsafe town
Lacin it down, black guerilla fams kid we takin' the crown

I'm a nig who don't dig a muthafuckin pig
Cause to me they ain't nothin' but harassers
That misuse they badges to whip niggas' asses
Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
With the .38s cocked, 2 deep, up to no good
They say that my skin was black so they attacked
Threw me on the back and stuck a gat to my fuckin' cap
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay
But if a man woulda took the cop life, he woulda got life
And never again see the street lights, and that's trife
Around my way they shot many teens
And them cops better stop, or I'ma stop em, by any means
The Big L won't hesitate to cold diss em
And if you ask me, muthafuck the whole system
There are too many young black brothers doin' life bids
Cause justice means 'just us white kids'
So take heed to the rhymes I kick
I'm about to flip, 'cause I'm fed up with that bullshit
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up (Aw, shit)
Whether it's the hot, warm, cool or cold season
Pigs be fuckin' with a nigga for no reason
You're just gettin' home from work
And gotta get searched and treated like dirt by a fuckin' jerk
Niggas in the streets got tough luck
First they get cuffed up
Then get roughed up, and that's fucked up
This every day, not every other week
Listen when this brother speak
Muthafuck turnin' the other cheek
Or you'll be layin in a pine box
Bad enough they got .38s, now them clowns gettin' nine glocks
I'm not only fed up with the cops
I'm only fed up with them punk-ass cab drivers who don't stop
They don't care if it's snowin
First they slow down, then they see your skin is brown, then they keep goin'
'Cause I wasn't white, the cab took flight
But I caught him at the light
And put a bullet right through his windpipe
I keep a tool with a full clip, the trigger I pull quick
'Cause I'm fed up with that bullshit"

Uh-huh, check it out
Y'all niggas be walkin' the streets, iced out
Not knowin' the walk, so put the price out
To get you stuck and punch ya lights out
Or catch ya car in the night and snatch ya wife out
And beat the hoe up if you don't give the dough up
You got me pissed off, frontin and ya whole clique soft
If ya had ya Roly on, I might cut ya wrist off
Then lick off, and slide ya bitch off, punk
I hope ya ready for the kick-off
Ya flankin niggas and I'm gettin' rich off
I done sold coke, sold crack, sold smoke, sold smack
Now I wanna go plat', can I get it sold plat'
It ain't no part a time out, once I climb out
The garbage can, with 2 nines out, and blow ya spine out
Or I got you cats by a long-shot, every song hot
1-3-9 and Lennox is a strong block
I left enough a y'all stinkin
What the fuck was y'all thinkin'?
My shit's tight, nigga, I spit writin
Yo, what?
(Shyheim:)
Young outlaw, the state wanna get rid a me
I'll probably die from the death penalty
Y'all analog, Shyheim I keep it digity
I'm not pussy so I don't need security
Like Big L, I'm MVP on the street
I did wet more people than the pool and the beach
So be easy, or I'll expose you like shock TV
O.G., that's why they put me in a movie
Don't screw me, 'cause if I punch you in ya face
You'll probably try and sue me, and take me to Judge Judy
Look me in my eyes cause ya handshake don't fool thee

Ain't no screwin off a silencer, uh-uh

And furious anger on those who attempt to poison and destroy

Cause niggas be wantin beef, but when you pull out
The heat they ready to talk it out
What is there to talk about?
You was just frontin, now it ain't nuttin
Ain't that somethin'? I should start bustin' anyway
And put one a you punks in the ground
Y'all niggas be killin' me with y'all faces round, jumpin' around

Tight broads watchin
The Guru, the great 'Dat X, and Big L
Flamboyant for life
(Big L)
Check it, a year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, ""Monique""
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get somethin' to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin' to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right - it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin' our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that? I wore a Lifestyle
Chorus: Big L - (repeat 2X)
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
(Sadat X)
I'm in the breed of the bad guy
Get caught in a mad lie, come in your crib mad high
Think about me with the smile on your face
Think about me with my hand on your waist
And think about me with your hair in your face
Even caught a case fuckin' witchu
Had said some ol' slick shit, that had forced me to hit you
Had you set up livin' swell, how you gon' fuck my man L
Like we don't cross paths in these New York streets?
But that's good, 'cause he's my man and we both shine
And to say we don't love these hoes is a old line
Honey just save some space in it so you can hold mine
Her whole spine be twisted;
Things she did and how she kissed it
I kinda missed it, think back on how we dissed it
Now we two-fisted, she ain't never resisted
Left it red and blistered, shakin
I could slam it if it wasn't NO money makin'
Chorus: Sadat X (same as Big L) - (repeat 2X)
(Guru)
Word up - games, these girls nowadays they play many
Techniques for gettin' your loot, they got plenty
Suck the skin off your dick, just for some ice and shit
In the beginning they're polite, actin' all nice and shit
But honey got plans to be pushin your Land
When she got you - she goes and fucks your man
Understand? You gotta lay down the law
A lot of broads is fraud, they'll set you up Baby Pah
Some'll try to get you stuck up, some'll fake pregnancy
Most are after the dough, and the fame basically
Yo you can't make a hoe a housewife kid
Pick the wrong chick - could be a lifetime bid
A lot of cats be beefin over these honies
Not me I keep it movin they ain't getitn jack from me
Mack these freaks for your own enjoyment
And one love to L we gon' stay Flamboyant
Chorus: Guru (same as Sadat X) - (repeat 2X)
(Guru)
Heh, word up
Yo son you better watch these little fast-ass
Little fancy-pants bitches with the thongs
Heh, that's my word
Yo, rest in peace to my man Big L, uh

Ey yo, what's up this is Big L, know what I'm sayin'
Calling to see how that joint, know what I'm sayin', came out
Hey yo fellas... Keep our eye open... watch out
Cause females be playing a whole lot of games like these
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
I know this lady by the name of Katie
If you broke, she's shady
You got cash? She's ready to have your baby
The type of female the fellas stress
Stay fresh to death, well dressed
In Chanel, Guess, nothing less
Body got more curves than an S
I smoke her boots like Sess
And I confess the sex was the best (yes)
Within a week she had keys to my res
And then later my man Squeezer gave her gees to invest
Then one day I overheard her talking to friends
Saying how she didn't like me, all she want is the ends
Yo honey was sheisty
Had me thinking she was wifey, tricking ridiculous
Given her dues that was icey
I said it's over
And what I gave you, you can have that
It wasn't even her - it was myself I was mad at
Letting that dame use me for my name and my fame
That's lame, but it's a shame how I fell for the game
A year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, ""Monique""

Yo I got a death wish

I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip and stick the gun between they lips like a
Cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
? No need to lie or cry it's time motherfucker to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone let's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
>From 25 consecutive 25 the life is
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm decked to hawk shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunts shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun
Jay-Z:
The way I rock
No way you could stop

When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
'Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around

I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a niggas ass half silly on da one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel

Bitches will treat me like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it

Ya man get outta line and it's kill kill kill

Never past up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels were truck he got his ass stuck
So what the fuck is you sayin' hop?
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Who's ever around when I be sprayin' drops
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas but I ain't tryin' to hear shit
I'll burn you faggot niggas like toast
If you die and come back I shoot your spirit
Now your ass is just a holy ghost
You tried to play me to the left
You better put a target on your head
'Cause you're marked for death (echo)"

Can I hit it? (Yes you can!)
Can I hit it? (Yes you can!)
Can I hit it? (Yes you can!)
What's up boo, how you do?
I've been watching you and you don't have a clue and this ain't nothin' new
Come to the crib, I got a beautiful view
And a heart-shaped water bed made for two
Uhuh, I do my thing when it's humping time
So all you cuties that wanna bump and grind, jump in line
Let me zoom in the boom like Rex
When I'm through your nets
'Cause I'm a feen when it comes to sex
Am I the man? (True that)
Of course you knew that
I'd give you the world, but shook my ends, I don't do that
I'm ready to get my flirt on
One honey with the skirt on
She got knees that I would love to put some dirt on
Come here shorty, let's drink a forty and get naughty
Go get your crew, I'll go get mine and let's make it an orgy
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
I'm not with it (why?)
It's just room to hit it
So all my ladies are you with me, where you at?
Let me hit it from the back and tell you if it's good or wack
When I'm all alone I call honey's on the phone
And Tell 'em come see me, but if we ain't gonna bone then keep your ass home
I used to mate with this honey Kate
The sex was great
Her shape would make a sweet playa turn straight
When you mention my name it rings a bell
Ask any female, nobody does it like L
That's why the ladies wanna meet me, discreetly
'Cause I'm freaky and love to go deep sea
Fishing, I be caressing em', strickly sexing em'
You know my style, I'm Down with O.P.P. like Treach and em'
I get the woman loose quicker than gin and juice
Sometimes I wanna jiggy to sporting gators and linen suits
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
I'm not with it? (Why?)
It's just room to hit it
Around your girl you shouldn't trust me
Cause soon as you turn your back I'm a slide her off then bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of brothers I know are taking care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low, I'm freaky like that
I even hit my man's girl 'cause I'm sneaky like that (huh!)
It ain't my fault your girl me ho-hoppin'
And matter fact the last time you gave her loot to go shopping
She picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walking crooked and her throat hurts
I hait to wait 'cause I'm not on a patient tip
Just hit me off, we don't need a relationship
I practice safe-sex so I keep the latex
Looking through the rollerdex to see who I'm a slay next
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
I'm not with it? (Why?)
It's just room to hit it"

Yeah yeah, Flamboyant Entertainment (no doubt)
Yo, y'all fellas like to stress them chicks
Impress them chicks, spend money to dress them chicks
I sex them chicks and send them home
Corleone is known to be stoned
When I bone, I'm rubbered up in case that shit full blown
The other night around 8 P.M.
Pockets crazy slim, jumped out the gray BM
Went to the ATM, took a thou' out
Then later on I had to wild out
In the club, knock some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom, pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin' - which chick number I could dial out
'Cause it's L, the Harlem pimp baby, for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady
And that's ill, playa haters be givin' me harsh looks
But I'm tryin' to sell records like Garth Brooks
So eff 'em all, when it's cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
Mega-ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't Cristal boo, I guess it's Perignon
If the na-na's too tight, I throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the nine mill burst
I've been off the scene over three years
And cats is still thirst - to hear Big L drop an ill verse
So all you unsigned cats that want to battle;
Get a deal first - I sport the bulletproof, fitted hat
That attitude - you better get rid of that
Wherever you floss is where you gon' get it at
What? I stay strapped, I go to sleep with my steel
Makin' figures while you broke cats keepin' it real
L is rap's most livest cat
I'm gettin' stacks while you askin people,
""Do you want fries with that?""
I rob bags in the staircase, no mask, bare-faced
The one police wouldn't dare chase
Keep my gear laced - do I walk around without papes? No way pal
Wword up - my money longer than the OJ trial
Chorus: Miss Jones
Harlem world keep holdin' it down, for Big L
Nigga long overdue - niggaz wanna know,
Do you still got it got it? (""It's so amazin'!"")
Yeah yeah yeah... Harlem world keep holdin' it down, for Big L
Nigga long overdue - niggaz wanna know,
Do you still got it got it? (""It's so amazin'!"")
(Stan Spit)
Stan Spit, yo, uh
Yo what the hell y'all can tell Spit? Not shit
I did a flick and bounced on L's shit
Well shit, expect me to go platinum
That's the only reason why I'm rappin'
And since L passed, niggaz expect me to make it happen
With no release date, I sell in each state
I'm the type to drive to Philly, for a cheesesteak
So what I'm a Harlem king, doin' my thing
My name ring - chains and dames what the fame bring
After platinum it's the same thing
And niggaz'll never learn
Till I pull the steel and make they lover burn
You don't get another turn, game's over
Here's my flamethrower
Rearrange your Rover, Harlem soldier
Wait till I get older - and we won't stop
I thought Mase told ya
Nigga Stan he do what he gotta
And these haters can't do me nada
Be in Nevada, with a lot of enchilada
(A.G.)
Yo, yo move the fuck, A bring the heat, when I touch tracks
These niggaz beef then wanna chill? Fuck that
These rap niggaz with the mills, we deduct that
I asked all my ghetto cats, where my love at
Now where the brews, and the drugs at?
Corrupt cats kept slug hats
Asked the feds where the bugs at
Puff with the dread, 'cause I puff black
High, till I die, and you can trust that
All I wanna know - is the club packed?
I see the haters sweatin shorty, but I dug that
She put my nutsac, back where her lungs at - little hoe
And them niggaz who owe, give up that
Huh, it's me and Corle', like Eddie and OT
Go 'head and provoke me
Heard you rap, wanna rhyme? Better be dope B
Still ""Diggin"", still livin', still givin'
Y'all the ill written, still fuckin' like Bill Clinton

29,How Will I Make It,2004,In Memory Of... Volume 2 (2004),Hip Hop,Big L,"Aiiyyo, some people was born in heaven
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing
Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
Of those that was born in heaven, which is called hell
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them... and never will
I'm only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like it's heading for a dead end
Cause my moms be smoking mad crack
My dad went out for a fast snack, and never brought his ass back
Nobody knows how I feel, it's quite ill
'Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
'Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
I just can't take it (uh-huh, uh-huh)
And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?'
It seems like my life's been cursed
Ever since I was a child, and how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
I walk around with a frown; I got no reason to smile
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
Aiiyyo times was rough, I had to grow up foul
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
I always knew that I'd end up doing time on the Isle
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
Five years passed by, now I'm at the age of 15
No more fun and games, it's time to get cream (word up)
'Cause I'm about to burst, it's like my life was cursed
I went to church, prayed everyday
And it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets, slate robbing suckers for funds (give it up, give it up)
Now everyday I creep with the heat
Ain't nothing sweet, I rob for meat
If I don't steal I don't eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Robbed this brother named Umar
Then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living hell
Then I started to realize - I'm better off in a prison cell
Now I can sleep, now I can eat
Can't hit skins, but I wasn't hitting skins when I was in the street
Aiiyyo I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?'
Doing time was full of stress G, all the
Fighting's and stabbings and men finding men sexy
One tried to test me didn't find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
My time came to a cease; I'm back on the streets again
I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again
But it's getting crazy hectic
'Cause I'm broke, get up naked
And can't get a job cause of my jail record
Before you know it, I was robbing them same ducks
I even started robbing homeless folks for they change cups
My whole life was deserted
Either I'ma go back to jail or get murdered, but do I deserve it?
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
But it seems like I can't get a fair shot (word up)
I just can't take it (uh-huh)

31,I Don't Understand It,1995,Lifestylez Ov Da Poor And Dangerous (1995),Hip Hop,Big L,"There are too many MC's who are overrated
You ask me, they wasn't even supposed to make it
In the rap biz, they don't know what rap is
So give it up, become a actor or a actress
Or a producer, cause you fail to use the
Mic right, so take flight before I bruise ya
For sayin' those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked, sit back and rip that contract
Hey yo, I'm serious, Big L ain't playin' games
I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin' names
But deep down inside you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par, you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Goin' platinum and don't have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice and don't even go gold
I don't like the way it's goin' down
Because it should be the other way around
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
How MC's take this rap game for granted
MC's - what's goin' on?
I don't understand, man, how rappers cold transform
One minute you're hardcore and raw
That's what you was known for, but not no more
You changed, you rearranged
You're not the same, your raps are blame
That explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top, then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop, now you no longer gain props
Who's fault is that? Nobody's but your own, black
Used to make fat tracks, jack, but now you're stone wack
So MC's, don't ever step out your range
Remain the same
And only change with the time
Unless you get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like I'm goin' for mine
But if you're rough, stay rough, if you're dap, stay dapper
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains, and now they're wearin beeds?
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
How MC's take this rap game for granted
This is how it should be done
I'm not the one, and my raps is strong like gum
But some MC's grab the mic and sound dumb
Plus slum (How come?) Rap skills they have none
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail
They're forced like fairy tales
Your technique and everything you speak's weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name, but your lyrics are lame, black
Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
Your raps border wack, and you went on tour with that
Crap, don't understand it, cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul that Nike Airs, givin' MC's nightmares
Rappers be frontin hard, and rhymes they don't write theirs
But still call themselves MC's
Please, how could that be?
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
How MC's take this rap game for granted
I don't understand it"

(Let 'em have it)
A-yo I'm serious I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black never seen in polka dots
No other writes rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze
I'm playin' rappers out like striped Lees
Smoother than velvet
My lyrics are well writ
You sayin' L's this and L's that
Get off L dick
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325 I's
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican
I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up
Give me two thumbs up
I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
Yo it's all about me it's a B. I. G. L thing
The crown is still mine 'cause I drop ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate Big L practice Gun Fu
'Cause I'm a MC assassinator
I grab a mag and leave a nag leakin' like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
I'm naughty and stop callin' me shorty my name's L
My raps are hotter than the Bahamas
MCs be talkin' about breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise
With Big L you can't swing long
So get behind me and sing cause every hero got a theme song
The Big L's back to attack with a phat rap
Matter of fact black I'm puttin' Harlem on the map
What's up 'cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then talkin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride
I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died 'cause he tried
To take my cash but he didn't last
I pulled out fast
I tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass (boom)
I make a lot of doe
I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate she gotta go
When I was young I played with guns not a kiddy toy
'Cause I'm a ruff rugged gangsta not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody be like Mike but Mike wanna be like L
Big L Outro:
A-yo big shots to all them niggas on the corner
Doin' something they ain't got no business doin'
I gotta say what's up to S&S, Doo Wop, and the Bounce Squad
Can't forget my peeps from Brooklyn youknowhatI'msayin'?
Like Box and Herb and Big Sid
A-yo L you must be buggin' B
You didn't even let me say what's up to my hoes B

Did you think anybody here in this town is any different?
They don't give a damn who gets killed,
Just as long as the dice keep rollin', the hos keep hoin',
And the money keeps flowin'!)
My name is L, and I'm from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
On 139 and Lenox Ave, there's a big park,
And if you're soft, don't go through it when it gets dark
'Cause at nighttime, niggas try to tax
They're sneakier than alley cats, that's why I carry gats
Yo, I'm a motherfuckin' fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me it's all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city, shootin' shit up like Frank Nitty
We robbed kids and split the dough 50/50
One day we stuck a dice game on the ave and split the cash,
Then I murdered his ass, and took his half
Because I'm all about ends and skins
When you got those, you don't need no motherfuckin' friends
If I catch you on a late night, black, you're gettin' stuck, Jack
My moms told me to get a job--fuck that!
Ai-yo, picture me gettin' a job,
Takin' orders from Bob, sellin' corn on the cob
Yo, how the hell I'ma make ends meet
Makin' about 120 dollars a week?
Man, I rather do another hit
I want clean clothes, mean hos, and all that other shit
Yo, I admit, I'm a sucker
A low down, dirty, sneaky, double-crossin connivin' motherfucker
Breakin in cribs with a chrome bar
I wasn't poor: I was po'--I couldn't afford the O-R!
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip--I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja, dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds, then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene
Took his brand new ring 'cause stickin' up's a everyday routine
Once I was crusin' in a beat-up ride, saw this nigga named Clyde,
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him, ""Give up the dough before you get smoked!
""Oh, you're broke? (*shots*) now you dead broke!""
The Big L was cold crazy
A top-notch crook snatchin' pocketbooks from old ladies
I don't care, I'll do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck, 'cause I don't give a fuck
Some say I'm ruthless, some say I'm grim
Once a brother done broke into my house and I robbed 
Plenty and many brains I bust
'Cause I was livin' the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous
Word! All of us from Harlem, 139, that's livin' the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous, you know what I'm sayin'? This goes out to my brothers Big Lee and Don Ice, Reggie Reg, T.C., Todd, Lou, Black Tone, Whitey, Ty Speeder, Ru Dog, Herb McGruff, E-Jet, G Love, Doc Ring, Slice, and Rich Dice.

Crack domes, well to all my niggaz that's gone
Kerry, Nate the Skate, Reggy White, L Corleone
We still the dangerzone
Where no man can withstand to hold his own
Nigga Please, know when you home alone
Shoot through your peephole blow out your chromosones
Nigga Please, 'Gruff kill niggaz for real
And I kill you right know, but these niggaz gon' squeal
Nigga Please, squirts slugs that hurt thugs
Rap's secondary, murder's my first love
Nigga Please, always get the last laugh
Stash math anything in my path smash
'Bout fast cash niggaz be splittin shit half-half
Staff laugh puttin' up them gats and masks (nigga please)
(Big L)
Y'all fellas like to stress them chicks
Impress them chicks
Spend money to dress them chicks
I sex them chicks and send 'em home
Corleone is know to be stoned
When I bone I'm doubled up in case that chick full blown
The other night around 8pm, pockets crazy slim
Jumped out the gray BM, went to the ATM
Took a thou out, then later on I had to wil' out
In the club, knocked this coward and his pal out
Then afterwords went to the restroom pissed cristal out
Then I'm thinkin' what chick number I can dial out
Cause its L, the harlem pimp baby
For real, I got more dimes than that sprint lady
And that's ill, player haters be givin' me harsh looks
But I'm tryin' to sell records like garth brooks
So F' 'em all, when its cold I keep the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
Mega ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't cristal boo, I guess its perignon
If the na-nas too tight, I put some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the nine mil burst
I've been off the scene for over three years
And cats is still thirst
They hear Big L droped a ill verse
So all you unsigned cats who wanna battle get a deal first
I sport the bulletproof fitted hat
That attitude you better get rid of that
Wherever you floss is where you gon' get it at
I stay strapped I go to sleep with my steel
I'm makin' figgas while you broke cats is keepin' it real...
Flamboyant Records baby..."
36,"No Endz, No Skinz",1995,Lifestylez Ov Da Poor And Dangerous (1995),Hip Hop,Big L,"Verse One:
Let me get to the point real quick, when ya pockets are thick
Mad chicks be on a brothers tip
When ya sporting jewels and driving in a groovy car
All the ho's go sweat you like a movie star
To get in ya pockets, that's what the girls wanna do
But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only nock boots when you got loot and your on the map
'Cause if you broke you'll get a wack slut
If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
And if ya live alone she's gonna pack her suit case
And move in then ya start losing all ya bucks
Soon your brothers a joke a not a rut?
Then she takes off and brakes off ya ho's gone, so long dear
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn
'Cause when you on top everything's OK
But when you broke you get no play
If you don't got endz you won't be gettin' no skinz
And if you don't got money you won't skoop a honey
If you don't got cash you won't be gettin' no ass
And if your not clocking loot you won't be knockin' no boots
Verse Two:
Girls of the 90's ain't nothing but crooks
It's all about what's in ya pockets not how ya look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leaving brothers for the next man 'cause he's got a penny more
They want a drug dealer not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always asking for a dollar
And if you pushing a fresh Benz they'll be ya best friends
Yeah, as long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours, but as soon as your dough go
Your ho go, now you solo
But when you was makin' papers sucker jumped ho's
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's
And you was taking 'em to the movies every weekend
Now that you dead broke the girls not speaking
Cause nowadays girls want you to crook
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big...
'Cause when you on top everything's OK
But when you broke you gets no play
Verse Three:
I tell it how it is 'cause I'm a goldfigga
And I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a. golddigger
It ain't even funny
Some girls don't even know me asking me can they get some money
I'm looking nothing like ya poppa
I wouldn't give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz I'ma break it down like this
It's like that y'all, and that's a fact y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all
It's Big L y'all, I'm livin' swell y'all
I do my famous, spell my name, ring bells y'all
(If you don't got endz)
Girls be frontin
(If you don't got endz)
They ain't givin' up nothin'
(If you don't got endz)
All the girls they ignore you
(If you don't got endz)
They act like they never saw you
(If you don't got endz)..."
37,Now or Never,1996,The Archives 1996-2000 (2006),Hip Hop,Big L,"Its time to make power moves and get the chedda.
And buy the real nice things that makes life betta.
No foolish acts, moves must be clever.
I'm down for whatever, I gotta blow son, is now or never.
I walk through the ruggedest blocks with jewels flooded wit rocks.
Hustlin on hot corners that be smuggled wit cops.
I was sworn for harlem, true roach don.
Word bond, we leave mics torn.
Y'all brothers slept too long, now its on.
L Corleone will neva fly.
Records are forever hot.
Front on me you better not.
I keep the barreta cocked.
This goes out to my people's up town.
Downtown, mid town, across town, and outta town.
You see me flossin often, at all the club sites.
At the bars buyin crystalls like they bud lights.
My style is hard like strong lumber.
Dime pieces get the digits chicken heads get the wrong number.
(Chrous)
Yo I announce spacks.
When I get busy over bounce tracks.
Droppin' lethal raps so wack so I can count stacks.
I keep a heavy knot, got a spot on every block.
Hunnies that's very hot.
And sent to the mary yacht.
95 was a beautiful year for L.
Now I'm back and all the ladies still cheer for L.
Whatever I write is gonna be tight.
'Cause if makin' hits is wrong I don't wanna be right.
Never the less, the east is were my crew rest.
We bust caps that go through vests.
We only do what we do best.
And that's triple than you riddle men.
Since you wanna play rough, then say hello to my little friend.
I like drop tops when its hot.
I like lambs when its snowy.
Bank account is fat like Joey.
I'm not very religious you wouldn't call me holy.
Sometimes my hairs grow long, sometimes its froly.
Spark up the you know what.
Pop the moey.
L stay flossin, presidential doughly.
Y'all brothers know me, I step in parties with mints and fly links.
Shorties hittin me with eyewinks as I buy drinks.
And every girl I got looks like a model.
If you ever see me with a chicken then she must of a hit the lotto.
Uptown is my home, and where I roam.
I stand alone, Big L Cornleone got a song.
Sellin weight in and outta state to generate cake.
The one jakes hate.
Got homicide runnin' out of yellow tape.
I pack toast with infra red scopes, I turn crews to dead folks.
If y'all fellas is playas, I'm the head coach."

It's either that or I'ma squeeze the gat and pop ten out
You see Corleone, ice spinnin, jigged out, white linen
And if a bitch don't like me, then she must like women
Everytime I come around you see your wife grinnin
Don't be mad 'cause your career's in the ninth inning
It's over now, nigga leave the game
I'm from the Danger Zone where MC's get slain
We're thugs that never hesitate to squeeze the flame
We're niggas be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
Hustlers flip cokey, 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
When I was OT your bitch wrote me
First day home, I dived in it, left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin me every five minutes
MC's I squash and disgrace
It's all about the Benji's, so why your
Bills got Washington's face?
A lot of cats be frontin, made singles wit a fifty on top

Stuffed the coke in they ass
Crazy beefs got provoked in the past, lot of wigs got split
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Harlem World be the place of my birth
Believe me son, we breed the smoothest
Niggas on the face of the earth
Mics I steadily smoke, rhymes cleverly wrote
As long as I can rock a crowd, I'ma never be broke
Some hoes treated me like a bumb nerd when I was unheard
Now I'm icey, I ain't gotta say one word you dumb bird
I push whips while you walk all day
And I hate when strange niggas wanna talk all day
Clown ass shit, hate to be around that shit
You don't know me, just say ""What's up"" give me a pound that's it
When I was at the steakhouse pullin cake out
You was at some cheap Chinese shit gettin' take out
How you make out, you take the fake route
You oughta break out

Rock this for Rock N. Wills. Hardpack tape
A'ight. Goes like this
Ay yo. I've got the gift of gab
To lift and grab
The mic and recite hype rhymes
That'll rip and rag
And drag a fag MC
Who likes to nag a lot
And brag a lot
Talking about the lyrics that he has are hot
Step to this and get lit like a candle, troop
Rhymes I hook up
MCs I cook up
Like Campbell's soup
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you'll get bust
And dust
And crushed
Bum rushed
And all of that
Rhymes never sound wack
'Cause I've got them down packed
For you the time is over
So give me your crown Jack
I get hype fast
And MCs might last
A minute with me
Because their rhymes are light as
A feather and mine are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick
When I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
MCs that tried to get with me, hops
That's why they all got taken out like a pizza box
The crown is still mine
'Cause I kick ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I'm smoother than Vaseline
And I'm a stone cold rapping fiend
A lot of new jacks are coming out, but that's cool
'Cause I'm the principal of the new school

A'ight. Check it out
I control the microphone like a robot
My lyrics are so hot
Props: I've got a whole lot
'Cause with a pen and some paper this man made
Rhymes: they're so damn great
With flavour like pancakes
I'm kicking rhymes like a game of kickball
I'm rough like a brick wall
MCs take a big fall
For trying to get with this
I'm too swift for this
A microphone murderer form of magnificence
A def rapper and also a swell one
In a battle I cook MCs well done
My hits are consecutive
I'm a lyrical executive
Bite my rhymes and I won't let you live
So to be safe on the microphone homes
Recite your own po'ms
Or get your dome blown
Or put in a boot camp
L's the new champ
I'm not the kind to go out like a?
I'm throwing rhymes like a pitcher throws a curveball
And I'm a serve all
Punks that try to brawl
So stop sleeping on me
Don't even dose hops
Or I'm a heat you up
And eat you up
Like Stove Top
Stuffing
I'm bum rushing
Shorts: I'm taking none
My rhymes weigh a ton
I'm not faking son
You're the one whose faking, trying to be a duplicate
Can't kick stupid shit
Tell you the truth: you should quit
Rapping
Start snappin
'Cause all you is a joke
Battle L and get smoked
Yo. I over throw ya
And have you screaming like a rollercoaster
Guzzle you down like a small cup of Coca-Cola

Stand back

They're softer than paper plates

A few sheets of loose leaf
And an eraser mate

Mics I wreck and fry
Rappers I petrify
Pack a four fifth with eight shots
With one you get popped
And now your locked in a box
Dead with no props
I'm not joking. There's no time for snapping
Niggas that be yapping
I'm putting caps in
So ??? up
From the waist up
You'll be found face up
Cops can't trace up
Fingerprints. Why? Because I leave no evidence

And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin' in a clinic
(Big L)
Ayyo, one hot summer night after ballin hard
I went to the phone booth with my callin card
And called up Joel, yeah you know L
I told her come to the crib, yo motherfuck a hotel
She said she was gonna come at ten
The bitch came, but one problem, she brought a friend
You know I'm not a rude brother yo
But I let Joel in and slammed the door on that other ho
So we was sittin' in the livin' room kickin it
And all I thought about was stickin it
She was mean, cause you know I wouldn't fuck wit a sleazy ho
Yo we was coolin, watching some TV show
I was crackin' sex jokes, tryin' to get the pussy
And this bitch was kickin scripts beatin' round the bush
Talkin' bout rhyme for me L man fuck rhyming
Cause my dick, is hard enough to cut diamonds
I said, ""I hope you ain't tryin' to dick tease
Ayyo, cause Big L's quick to tell a bitch leave""
Ayyo my game started fuckin' wit her head soon
Next thing ya know we went straight to the bedroom
I knocked the boots from New York to Santa Fe
And that bitch burnt me like a gamma ray
I caught a cab, on 139 and Lenox
Ayyo, I took it to the neighborhood clinic
Because she gave me gonorrhea
Yo, I'ma kill that bitch, the next time that I see her
Chorus (Repeat 2x)
One afternoon I was cruising on the Westside
Bumpin my system, lounging back in a fresh ride
Hoes be hotter than a sauna
So I put the system on max, and bumped my shit on the corner
I saw this girl walkin' by who was hype as hell
She was mad point-blank, she was right for L
But she tried to play me like a statue black
I said, ""Sweeheart what's your name?""
""I gotta man,"" ""I ain't ask you that""
She said in order to be with me you gotta be rich
You won't be able to switch, I said, ""Fuck you bitch""
Another girl walked by, I called her
""Excuse me what's your name"" ""Lorraine, what's yours""
Ayyo, game I kicked well
I said honey my names Lamont, but I'm known as Big L
I was looking smooth with the jewelry
She said, ""L's for Lamont, but what's the Big for?"" ""You'll see""
Ayyo, my pockets were extra thick
""So what you doin' later, oh nothing, then lets catch a flick""
Yeah, I bagged that ho well
Took her to the triple M, movies, meal, and motel
And when it comes to this I'ma a professor
I didn't molest her I caressed her, undressed her then sexed her
But I must be getting older
'Cause I didn't put a helmet on my motherfucking soldier
I started stickin up quick
And the next time I took a piss
A motherfuckin flame shot out my dick

You see Corleone, ice spinnin', jigged out, white linen
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women
Every time I come around you see your wife grinnin'
Don't be mad 'cause yo' career's in the ninth innin'
It's over now, nigga, leave the game
I'm from the danger zone where emcees get slain
We're thugs that never hesitate to squeeze the flame
We're niggaz be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
Hustlers flip cokey, 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
When I was OT your bitch rode me
First day home I dived in it
Left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin' me every five minutes
Emcees I squash and disgrace, it's all about the Benjis
So why your bills got Washington's face?
A lot of cats be frontin'
Made singles wit' a fifty on top
L tryin' to have the city on lock
Peace to Biggie and Pac 'cause they really were hot
Rap game, heavy hitters, it's a shame they no longer wit' us
Niggaz wanna be L, ladies wanna see L
If I go to jail you'll wear a shirt sayin' ""Free L!""
What
Word up man, them niggaz is hungry
They ready to bite a nigga arm off
Chorus: repeat (2X)
All my wolves in the house, are you live or what?
See, Harlem 'bout to get it, all eyes on us
Only ghetto niggaz shine, who gon' rise wit' us?
And the first cat who act, we gon' size 'em up
Ayo, I hear a lot of bitch in your talk
See a lot of switch in your walk
Only thugs get rich in New York
Time is runnin' out
Niggaz like,""L, when you comin' out?""
Because they sick of all this drag queen shit
Your wife's missin', I'm the nigga she was last seen wit'
Me and Ron hit it up on some tag team shit
A buncha niggaz got smoked for the cash
Used to ride Greyhounds wit' dime holes and stuff the coke in they ass
Crazy beef's got provoked in the past, lot of wigs got split
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Harlem World be the place of my birth, believe me son
We breed the smoothest niggaz on the face of the earth
Mics I steadily smoke, rhymes cleverly wrote
As long as I can rock a crowd I'ma never be broke
Some hoes treated me like a bum nerve when I was unheard
Now I'm icey, I ain't gotta say one word, you dumb bird
I push whips while you walk all day
And I hate when strange niggaz wanna talk all day
Clown ass shit, hate to be around that shit
You don't know me, just say whatsup, gimme a pound, that's it
When I was at the steak house, pullin' cake out
You was at some cheap Chinese shit gettin' take out
How you make out, you took the fake route, you oughta break out
You couldn't get a bitch before you put your tape out
What
Fuckin' punks
Niggaz like you will get robbed everyday
Yeah

(C-Town:)
I be a Harlem World party pleaser
You might find me on 1-3-9 sippin a Bacardi Breezer
That's where I rest at, killin' tracks is what I'm best at
Jealousy, I expect that, I don't stress that
I want a cutie with some tight jeans on, that I can scheme on
Treat her nice, take her out and trick some cream on
TV screens all over the U.S. I'm seen on
It ain't all about me, I'm tryin' to put my team on
Because it's good to have a crew to lean on, mics I fiend on
You think you can do it like this? Dream on
I'm a, chrome my rims and ice my chain
Fly clothes and pretty hoes is the price of fame
(Big L:)
Yo; you know the game plan
C-Town, that's my main man
We never bring luggage, we go shoppin' when the plane lands
Still run with the same clan, used to be a Kane fan
Everything I rock is name brand
L'll make ya dame swallow
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin' midget sips, I run with the richest clicks
Tap the thickest chicks, plus drop the slickest hits
You know nuttin about L, so don't doubt L
What's this motherfuckin rap game without L?
Yo, that's like jewels without ice
That's like china without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or crackheads without pipes
The Village without dykes
Or hockey games without fights
Don't touch the mic if you unable to spit
Flamboyant is the label I'm with

I'm straight loco, to hell with you and your broke hoe
You ain't a big dog, you more like Toto, you got no dough
I smoke 'dro mixed with cocoa, strong as bolo
I pack a fo'-fo', platinum ro-ro
Anti-homo, that's a no-no so fuck po'-po'
I push the seven-fo'-oh and not the Volvo
C-Town push the six-oh-oh, I'm with a bitch on dolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While y'all buck for legs I, buck for heads
I even buck celebs, nigga fuck the feds
(C-Town:)
I stay sweatin out a bitch perm
I love it when a girl ass is fat and they tits firm
I take all the dough my chicks earn
I watched Corleone do it, now it's Chris turn
{A ""Hoodlum"" like Fishburne}
Act illy, get smacked silly with the mac-milli
You see me on MTV and Rap City
Keep frontin, I'm a step out, mask on with the tec out

Got my own label now, so y'all can sign with me
Y'all can take me from the bottom and climb with me
That's fine with me, that's how it was designed to be
(C-Town:)
I be that young teen with DUMB cream
I refuse to be unheard or unseen, I shine like the sunbeam
All you niggaz better come clean, before my gun scream
Rap's a fun thing, only roll with one team
Flamboyant Entertainment, that's who I came with
I pack a nine and once I aim it, I got to flame it
Push a blue eight, got props from here to Kuwait
And while your crew hate, you hear me on Big L new tape
They call me C-Town, I snatch mics like a rebound
Pack a three-pound, that's my prerog' like B. Brown
I rip shows in large arenas, like the Garden or Meadowlands
Got nuttin but love for all my ghetto fans
On 1-3-9 and Lenox eyes get shut
The ""Danger Zone"" is where pies get cut, where all the guys get stuck
Try to front we gon' size you up
Like Corleone'll grab the chrome and throw five in your gut
(Big L:)
Aiyyo, gats we bust (backs we crush)
Only hot tracks we lust (crazy stacks we clutch)
And we need plaques to touch (that say platinum plus)
Cause half of you niggaz that's rappin' now (is wack to us)

Yeah, it's the Big L
Comin' at you once again, in nine-five
And I dedicate this one
To all my peoples from Uptown... and everywhere
Check it!
Yo where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin' up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
Cause mad clowns be catchin wreck with a tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends, they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin' to school, they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up witchu in the long run
Brothers be all up on us, actin' stupid, gettin' lifted
They life is twisted, and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got TALENT; but they'd rather sell cracks
And bust gats and run the streets actin' violent
To them it's all about hittin skinz and makin' some easy green
Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin' a sweet nut
They don't give a (WHAT?) 'cause they street struck
Chorus: Big L
You betta listen when L rhyme; cause bein street struck'll
Get you nuttin but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme; cause bein street struck'll
Get you nuttin but a bullet or jail time
(Big L)
Before the rap contract, I was sellin crack
Stay strapped with a Mac, I was into alla that
I started rappin' and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this I might be doin' life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game sellin 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go 'head and do your thang
But with the cash profit make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that, if you're dead, or behind bars?
And yo it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up they careers for some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Aiyyo they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams but gave 'em up 'cause they street struck
Chorus: repeat 2X
(Big L)
I still chill with my peeps in the streets; but most of the time
I'm in the crib, writin rhymes to some dope beats
Or either callin up some freaks to bone
But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin me, like the crack be callin Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
'Cause where I'm from -- you can choke from the gunsmoke
Stay off the corners; that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin on a hospital bed, from bein street struck
Chorus: repeat 2X
(Big L)
Worrrd up!
Aiyyo take it from me, the Big L
'Cause I been through it all, youknowhatI'msayin?

It's a fact I stay geared it shouldn't be weird
That I'm feared, 'cause my raps are roughed than a nappy beard
I cook rappers like a chef

My raps are badder than mornin breath
For niggaz deaths I'm the number one suspect
'Cause I catch much wreck, 'specially when I'm upset
Suckers I'm a stick of they start
Breakin 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin the microphones
Apart
I hold a 40 right because I'm the naughty type
When I strike the mic, niggaz be like, ""Shorty hype!""
I'm smoother than velvet, my lyrics is well writ'
You sayin' L's dis and L's dat, get off L dick
Rhymes I create and knock out ya gold tooth
Battlin me's like fightin a gorilla in a phone booth
I wreck mics and drop the cool speeches
Nowadays rappers think they motherfuckin school teachers
1-2, 1-2, Rappers I run through
Fuck Karate, I practice Gun-Fu
The Big L is an assassinator
I grab the mag and leave a fag leakin like Activator

Walk through with jewels on, that ass'll get stuck clown
I got styles you can't copy bitch

Straight from H-E double hockey sticks
I'm the Devil's Son, like my song said:
I smash niggaz like cornbread
You can't kill me - I was born dead
I wet shit up like a floodage
Me and me crew peel cats and carry gats like it's luggage
I'm nowhere near trash, step to the rear fast
'Fore I have ya queer ass cryin like tear gas

You better guard your grill, before you gets scarred for real
Big L is a large boss
Known for puttin' more holes in a nigga body than in a golf course
I'm crazy quick to knock a duck off
I'll pull out then buck off
And tear a nigga grill right the fuck off
You'll get smoked - like a Phillie fast
'Cause ya shit is really trash
Fuck around, I swing on ya silly ass

Known to keep a hottie open
I keep a shotty smokin'
Front and get half the bones in ya body broken
I never false teach, so listen as the boss preach
I only rock leathers by Martin Cannon and North Face
I'm makin' rap hits, I stab flicks and mack chicks
Just the slim ones, you won't see L with no fat bitch
Yo I'm the nigga that they call AWOL
Punks - I slay all, on my spare time I play ball
In the playgrounds I spray clowns with trey pounds

The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one

You see what happened in my last fight friend?

I beat kids with lead pipes
I leave a trail of dead mic's

Old folks get mugged and raided
Crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts

Until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most

Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smoking dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed
And got a hot lead face lift
All through high school I had braids
I kept mad blades
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak
Cause my techniques great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
'Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper
Punk brother vamper
Fuck around you'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my glock makes a pow sound

To stop me, you gotta kill me

The shit is eternal, I rock the Heavens well
Even if they won't let me in Heaven
I raise hell, till its Heaven

Get up off me, nigga, its bad luck to cross me
I'm poppin' Crystal, shooting game like missiles
As projected, all ho's affected by this style
I mack like Goldie, go back like the oldies
But the goody, pullin R&B bitches wearin hoodies
They don't be knowin' the way I be flowin
When I be goin', I be running the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme
The way that you do things wit a swing and have 'em rockin' like
You say never you run, if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm
I be producing like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom
For greater understanding
I'm landing blows and
Knocking sense into those that oppose me, ha
Enticin when slicing through tracks
Your screaming, ""Jesus Christ,"" he's back
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map
So give him his dap
And me, I just take mine
Gimme those, gimme this, gimme that, fuck that
You never see me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible
Even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping, extortion and corruption
So you know, beatin' me will never come
Like a nun or tomorrow, I'm too thorough, nigga
I make moves, cause bowels to move
When I'm creeping through your hood with a thousand little dudes
Um. We're the peace like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise, I feel no fear when facing y'all
Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's trying to be the best
And even in dying, couldn't be this def (death)

Kinda tired...
Big L, 'bout ta... get into some shit
Aight check it out
Yo, fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expandin my chips
You mad 'cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style, plus the way that I be flowin is sharp
A while back I used to hustle, sellin blow in the park
Countin' G stacks and rockin' ice that glow in the dark
Forever - hottie huntin, trigger temper I'm quick to body somethin'
You lookin' at me like I'm probably frontin
I fuck around and throw, three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm, older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hangin' around y'all, cause niggaz like you
Be prayin' on my downfall, hopin I flop
Hopin I stop, you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe, smokin' the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more, stitches than you
Fuckin' punk, you ain't a +Leader+ what? Nobody +Follow-ed+ you
You was never shit, your mother shoulda swallowed you
(Mmmm... WHOO!) You on some tagalong flunkie yes man shit
Do me a favor, please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead, and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nuttin Butt-head
(*Laughter*) My game is, vicious and cool
Fuckin' chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come, you can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggaz got they whole style from?
(Yeah!) So what you actin' for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga sum'un, 'fore I crack his jaw
You runnin' with boys, I'm runnin' with men
I'ma be rippin the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggaz like, ""Damnit this nigga done done it again""
I throw slugs at idi-ots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm makin' wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggaz
I might pull out this gun on your niggaz
And rob every last one of you niggaz
(Bobbito) Yeah! (What?)
(Big L) I'm TIRED
(Bobbito) For somebody tired, that wasn't, that wasn't too bad
(Bobbito)
You wrote... yeah... you where... you where thinkin' bout somebody when you
Wrote that right?

Uh, check it out, aight, check it out (Bobbito: Woo-- Woo!)
Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo check it, yo my shit is hot like jerk chicken, I should rob you
But with that cheap shit, you ain't worth stickin'
I've got a left hook, that be leavin' guys knocked out
Keep frontin', and I'm a choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid that like that?
Yo, I'm not in the mood, son, so don't push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight, grippin' my dick like a pair of pliers
You fuckin' snitch, right now you prolly wearin' wires
It's not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
I'm a strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass (Bobbito: Ouch)
(Stretch: Oh, word)
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smokin'
My album is done, so no it ain't no parts open
I'm not a sweet stud, I'm a street thug
That's quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug, till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week bring a different car out, go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain't a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with fuck them too, I'll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take?
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fuckin' chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half (*laughing*)
Yo, I'm a take you out your misery (Stretch: Yeah right!)
And after this, nigga, put you in the social study book 'cause you're
History

I drive up and down harlem blocks, iced out watch
Knots in my socks, cops think I'm selling rocks
Pulling me over too see if I'm drunk
But I'm sober they wouldn't fuck with me if I drove a nova
Listen columbo you're mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kinda names try to hurt my pride
You're just mad 'cause I'm a young cat, pockets dumb fat
Talkin' bout where the gun at, I been there and done that
I'm through with that illegal life, I'm stayin legit
I love to see cars come cruisin bye and playin' my shit
I walk around with six thou' without a pist-al, my whole click's wild
I'm rich pal, no more sticks I'm makin' hits now
I drink cristal, I'm through breakin laws
I don't sell coke anymore, I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down them jakes'll do whatever it takes
Word up them federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mouse trap, I doubt that
Chorus: big l
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be callin it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
(Fat joe)
Aiyyo enough's enough, federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus, they want a nigga sewed, but they know
Big joey crack ain't never rat a cat that he know
Fo' sho', death before dishonor; I left the streets alone
Since tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So I'ma keep doin' what I'm doin'
Pursuin my dream till there enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So where's your witness that you claim to have, sayin' that I'm takin' half
Extortin new york and not payin' tax
I'm layin back, playin' the role, playin' the low
But it's the same ol joe so don't get k.o.d
Hey yo I'm gonna fry for what I never did
Or catch a heavy bid, why don't they just let a nigga live?

Hey yo, I just left the studio, and it's about 2 in the morn'
I just finished doin' a song
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
In this good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jumped in the jeep, stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep
My voice is harsh, barely can speak
I called back on the cell
It's Coley, mad as hell
He told me to listen well as he started to yell
""I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room in the Holiday Inn""
""It's my wife, you sure?""
""Yeah I'm sure
I saw the whore as soon she walked through the door""
""Yo, say no more, which one?""
""The one in Jersey, son, right over the bridge""
""We goin' hurt those hoes""
""And hurt both of them kids""
Now I'm in the Range
Switchin lanes, doin' a buck 'n' change
I can't wait to touch the lames and them fuckin' dames
Reach the destination, grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin' up my reputation
I saw Coleone holdin' the chrome
Ice-grill, lookin' like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin' the cup
Lookin' like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up
""Yo, who that in the background?""
""It's Tommy Giss""
""Oh, I didn't recognise you with your hat down
Son you ready, we got this whole shit mapped out""
""Yeah, wo goin' to take the backroute
And pull our gats out and throw our mask on
We ain't leavin' till everyone's dead and all the cash gone""
""We goin' to get our laugh on when we're through
But right now we got a job to do""
""So let's do it""
Hey yo, I stepped to the deskclerk
Put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her to listen up before she get hurt
""They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males
What room they got?""
She paused and said ""212""
Took the steps now I'm out of breath
I gotta stop smokin'
Them cigarettes goin' be the cause of my death
My heart beatin' fast now, 'cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door, let the glock off, tore the lock off
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pase
I felt disgraced, I should've shot the bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in
Each had a cannon
Ready to take care, how we done planned it
""These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate""
We know they got stacks
'Cause they don't move with nothin' but weight
We got the cuffs and the ducktape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we be lettin 'em loose
""Hey man, I kicked Mike in his face
So I just had your back
You wanna live and tell my nigga where the stash at""
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there, I found 50 keys in a stash
A 100 pound of grass, and 2 million in cash
I was dumb glad
The sit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the teeth
And put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck
When I got back, Coley done popped them punks
""Hey yo', fuck it L, we might as well pop these studs""
Man that's four bodies
Two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days

I'm at the table, like the Godfather smoking a dutch
Controlling the bucks; I roll with enough
Niggas that'll blow in the clutch
Not only holding we bust
The fat raps, so pass that and let me hit it
Got me gassed, black; skins was mad fat
She flipped it, Bronx is equipped with niggas that'll rip shit
Studios get blown from D and D to Mystic
With this shit I'll bomb the nation from a distance
The jewels gotta have patience plus persistence
We rock glass like Rockford
Waiting for bottles to pop in the condo; bottles get rocked
To sum up my career from bottom to top
Now we in the thick of it, and you don't stop

I spark light with the pen, drink O.J. with gin
Rock Tims with my laces untied
Cruise in the city on seventeen inches; ride past wenches
Past the projects, thugs chilling on the benches
Profile low as if I had an ill vengeance
Life on Earth is just a death sentence
Fuck it, alpha omega, arm, lega, lega, arm
With cold steel if you pose a threat to my neighbor

Its about time that I feel cash, gotta get it right now, gotta get it real fast
Cause all I got left is 2 mack tens, a army jacket, a ski mask, a hoodie, and some black Tims
I'm about to get extra ill, so I went to crib, got booted up and got dressed to kill
The first place that I hit was the corner store
I pulled out and told everybody to get on the floor
I took the cash and I jetted
One kid tried to set it, I bet he regret it cause because he got wetted

Yo I was robbing people on a regular basis in many different places and all types of races
I robbed gangstas, I robbed ducks, I didn't care who I stuck as long as I got a buck what the fuck
When niggas see me they take flight
I'll even rob Jehovah if I catch him right on a late night
Keep a vest G don't try to test me
A red neck police chief tried to arrest me
Ayo that wasn't a smart cop
Because I put 2 in his chest and his motherfucking heart stopped
It's a must I commit crimes
'Cause I gotta get mine, its hard times, and all I see are dollar signs
Why should I work for another sucker
When I can do robberies and make G's like a motherfucker
Fuck a job, punks is getting robbed is scarred
Cause times is hard on the boulevard"

Where I'm from
Yeah, Tony Touch in the house, yeah
Big L Harlem on the rise, 1 3 9
You ain't know?
One love to my nigga McGruff, Mase Murda, Killa Kam
Rest in peace to my man Bloodshed
Live on baby, the spirit live on
Yeah BBO in the house
Yeah my men stand I'ma rock this shit

Yo, I be that smooth cat you never seen rollin' with clowns
One of the few from Uptown that's holdin' it down
Bitches be on me like I'm welfare, even rich ones
That live in Bel Air, is this Big L yeah, hell yeah
Word up, I use a chrome gat to push domes back
Watch how you talk when you call me, Feds got my phone tapped
This rap game, I put my life in it, chain got
Mega ice in it, push an Infinite, chrome rims, light tinted
You can see pal, it's all about me now
Twenty G's a show bitch three thou just to freestyle
I made this cheese it didn't grow on trees
Can you hold somethin'? Sure, you can hold on these
Yo I'm fat like the old Cray-on, smooth as Rayon
L is who the ladies stay on, baby play on
I stay jeweled up, pockets swelled up from banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggaz Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep, with the Triple Black dogs in their old jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put the glock to his dome
Tell him ""Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split""
Prick, it ain't nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
And mad niggaz be fronting the life
Popping mad shit, trying to be something they not
Your faggot ass better stay to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing
I'm sick like Manson
In '97 Harlem kids is blowing
And we don't trip, we'll let a bitch starve till her ribs are showing

Word, check it out check it out check it out
Bust it
MC's get taught a lesson
When the mic is in my possession
Rap's my profession L is nice, no question
It's a fact I stay geared you shouldn't beweared
That I'm feared cause my raps are rougher
Than a nappy (?)
I cook rappers like a chef
I'm def like Jeff right to left
My raps are better than Morgan (?)
With niggaz deaths I'm the number one suspect
'Cause I catch much wreck specially when I'm upset
Suckers I'm a stiggedystar breakin' them mother and takin' they heart
You better believe Big L is a matter be rippin' the microphones apart
I hold the forty right because I'm the naughty type
When I strike the mic niggaz be like shorty hype
I'm smoother than Velvet my lyrics is well writ'
You sayin' L's this and L's that kid or L did
Rhymes I create and I couch ya whole crew
Battlin' me is like fightin' on the river in a phonebooth
I wreck mics and rock the cool speech
Cause nowadays rappers think they motherfuckin' schoolteachers
One two, one two, rappers I run through
Fuck Corati I crack his gun fool
The Big L is an assasinator
I grab the mack and leave a fag leakin' like activator
I'm the nigga that you never even thougth of beatin'
Black white or puerto rican
I'm gonna slaughter each an'
Every crap MC that warms up
When a battle comes up
Give me two thumbs up
Peace"

I be twistin' bitches alot, have 'em sit on this cock
I wasn't prepared for this I wrote my shit on the spot
I be droppin' like early August late July
With tracks that will make you cry, hate you die
Stop frontin' you got no dough
Mighta had but not no mo', you mad 'cause I knocked yo' hoe
While cops watch me, I got cats that watch po po
My block loco, don't need a crew I rock solo
On wit my nigga Gruff, these faggot niggaz ain't as rich as us
I need chicks to lust, smoke my weed mixed with dust
Go ahead and let your crew soup you up
And the ambulance gon' have to come and scoop you up
Fuck what my last sold, my new shit is goin' past gold
And if you don't agree you's a asshole
Mark my word, you gon' make pump the berg
And spark this herb, till homicide chalk the curb, you heard
I never hesitate to buck my gun
Harlem World, y'all know where the fuck I'm from"

I asked honey her name and she told me Celeste
She had big breasts, honey had me harder than a Spanish test
We on the dancefloor, gettin' our boogie on
I see the haters watchin me with they hoodies on
Tryin' to peep the ice under the sleeve
I'm like, ""It's time to breeze,"" told honey, ""Let's leave""
Took her to Ema G's (?), got some eggs and cheese
Grits fishcakes and orange juice, freshly squeezed
When she finished her meal, I said, ""What's the deal
For real - you goin' home or you tryin' to chill?""
She got close, whispered somethin' slow in my ear
And it ain't hard to tell where we goin' from here
Yeah

I ain't on that hatin' stuff
I was feelin' shorty then the bitch told me she was datin Puff
I'm a average nigga, then she said she was in the 6
My relationship, with that nigga called Jigga
I'mma compete with that? I'm a corner nigga sellin crack
Guess I gotta be a ballplayin nigga to bone Da Brat
One bitch, I ain't even wanna fuck
She runnin' around, all open off Kurupt
The ho I thought, was gon' be real easy
Told me she got a man and he's some beatmakin nigga named Stevie
What's wrong with these hoes? I'mma fly nigga
I don't wanna go flip Mo' to Rah Digga
Or Miss Lopez, bitch no feds
She used to be in the Bronx, rockin' Pro Keds
With some Dominican 'dro heads, ridin' on top this
On the back of mopeds, titties all out - what what?
Whattup miss, who you hidin wit?
Who you slidin wit? Who you ridin' wit?
We can jump in the SL
Rent a room at the best 'tel
I make it last 'cause I sex well
Is yo' game rusty? Around yo' dame, never trust me
Cause soon as you blink I'mma slide her off then bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of niggas I know are takin' care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low, I'm freaky like that
I never get caught creepin' 'cause I'm sneaky like that, uh
It ain't my fault your girl be ho-hoppin
And matter of fact, the last time you gave her loot to go shoppin'
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walkin' crooked and her throat hurts
I hate to wait, 'cause I'm not on the patient tip
Just hit me off, we don't need a relationship
And when you mention my name, it ring a bell
Ask any female, nobody do it like L
I met this chick Rhonda, who pushed the black Honda
Took her to the crib and bombed her with this big brown anaconda
Whattup miss, who you hidin wit?
