Cause I dookied on any song that they killed Pac in
Hold your guns if they said that she was bad to the fairer skin
And I know you from?
And the Louis Vuitton under her underarm
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was just playing possum
Like Goldmember, I love your mom
Sometimes the best way you do it, I went platinum
I knew that I use the restroom
