Death Row
That's where motherfuckers is endin up
Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I rob my adversaries, but Slick done left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch, or make the nigga rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin', and talkin' behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin' trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
Whip out the nine, now I'ma dive and pump your ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch, and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin, but swear I'm nothin' nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
I listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers
And fuck five-oh, blaow blaow... turn 'em into forty-niners
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where they find me? 16 on Death Row
Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, 'cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my set, is 16 is wet
It's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin' Hell
I shouldn'ta let him catch me
Instead of livin' sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin' torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin' sheep, niggaz countin' cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
'Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me? 16 on Death Row
Dear mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin' every breath
I'm bitter 'cause I'm dyin', so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that motherfucker never cared for me
He's only here to be sure
I don't drop a dime to God 'bout the crimes he's committin
On the poor, and how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
To keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin motherfuckers
Steer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin for the chair
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where we live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me? 16 on Death Row
16 on Death Row
It's to all my partners in the penitentiaries
16 on Death Row

I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I, think I got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker
Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side

Niggaz with a death wish step in with a Tec and I'll wet this

Two to one I'm writing representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm must run

That old deadly shit. Aiyyo Treach where you at?

And if another doubts I blow your fuckin' mother out
And that's the street scarred style
I shout I'm-de-MC-wit-de-nasty-mouf, and kick the bitch out
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin' pounds more

Pickin' pockets with a razor stoppin' Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin shop
Once you sound hot, 'cause if you ain't a perfect ten
My sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin' styles in em
Like women I did 'em I'm in for deadly ready venom
Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Maj
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin 'em down, I make 'em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Rob and steal and runnin' from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin' bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leavin' trails of brains and bladders
Blowin' 'em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, somethin' that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit em, I lit him
He's out! A poison, a deadly venom
Yeah Maj, fuck that! You know how we do.
KnowhatI'msayin? Squad in effect, YG'z in effect.
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent
Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggaz can't touch me when I wreckin G you better flee
'Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggaz back to the stomping grounds
Line 'em up single file, dome runnin' in em
A nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom
Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin? Fuck that!
I told you, we takin' over, yo 'Pac.
Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggaz don't even worry me, see

Fuck the cops cause my gauge gets me... PAID
As I sit and reminesce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey

Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight

We takin' this motherfucker over. TRUST. We out.
When your hero falls from grace, all fairy tales are uncovered
Myth exposed and pain magnified, the grace pays uncovered
He told me to be strong, but I confused to see it so weak
You say never to give up, and it hurts to see what comes to be
When your hero falls solely the stars, and so does the reception of tomorrow
Without my hero, there's only me alone, to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work, and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do, when your only hero falls
As long as some suffer, the river flows forever
As long as there is pain, the river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be, the river will flow forever
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together
We'll ride, the river together, as long as, you are with me
The river, will flow forever, as long as, you are with me
The river, will flow forever, as long as, you are with me

Jewellery, fast cars and known for flashing

A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was working for the feds, same crime different trials
Niggas picture what he said, and did I mention?
Promised a payback, Jimmy Henchmen, in due time

21 Gun Salute to my niggas that died in the lines of duty
Represent to the fullest and be a souljah
The military minds that play the rules of the game
21 Gun Salute
I salute you my niggas
Stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you
It's on for you
'Cause all you bitch made niggas
Are coming for me
Against all odds
I don't care who you fuck with
You touch me I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers don't think I forgot
Hell na I ain't forgot nigga
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war till I got my money right
Now I got my money right
Now I want war
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Picutes of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time on California crime
Watching for thievin I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin
Puttin' a bullet in mutherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, 'cause we ain't hard to find
I got my locs on hard hat goin' to war
Breakin them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch 'em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, Tupac and the Click, smokin' blunts, loadin clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a hoe, a hoe
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'
Down the steps
Abandonded broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the drama play
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake although mine was first to ask niggaz
Motherfuckers didn't think I wasn't going do somethin', ask niggaz
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga, threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride, double-edgin for the other side
But now, my glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental keep my name out your dental
Nigga, if your gum bleedin, and you needin
Mo' than twenty sticthes, you behaved like dem bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game, check the resident it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find
Why them niggaz actin' like they can't find us
Like like they can't see us and
Like we don't be at the same spots they be at
It's the same congregation, Young Pac is back
YouknowhatImean?
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to fine
Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some hurricane
Sideways to the next light...
It's all about you
YouknowhatI'msayin?
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh
You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
But how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' Boo, is this is all about you
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
With the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
'Cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you... hahaha, yeah nigga
It's all about you
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you? Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean... god damn, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm sittin' back, watchin Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in, my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy Tupac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin?
And then yaknahmsayin what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in, the homeboy Warren G video
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same hoe
Don't get mad, I'm only bein real
Yeah
It's all about you
YouknowhatI'msayin?
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh
You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
But how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life

I'm caught between my women, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as we dip
I'm lost in the land, with no plan, living life flawless
Crime Boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm taking off on the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tek
Devoted to serving this, Moet and pay checks
Like a kite sailin' nigga I'm forever Ballin'

Sucka duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handling my business nigga keep on coastin'

Steady flaunting against the grain nigga still don't know me

Will I survive, will I die, come on lets picture the possibilities
Giving me charges, lawyers making a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, alone, as a teenager, on the mobile
Calling big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, balllin' in the fast lane
Hustle till the morning, never stopped until the cash came
I live my life as a Thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa
'Cause we be getting high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down now its time to floss my shit

Fuck these fed Niggas Pac
Do it, Do it, Do it.
Come hell or high water
Down to slaughter opposes
Just another lost soul stuck callin Jehova
Outlaw till it's over
Brandish my strap, back like a cobra
I stay drunk 'cause I'ma mad man
We're never sober
On a one man mission
My ambitions to hold up the rap game
While I plug holes in niggas like doughnuts
And still
Down to die for all my souljahs, like hillbillies
They don't feel me
So we fued
Bringin' war to the city
With each breath
Death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me
No apologies, your honor
A general in war I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers quick to move shit, heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam
Sometimes I question Hussein
Like fiends fighting for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sand storms
Then transform
Watch me, I take a figga of thirty niggaz, who all got me
While bitches wondering, who shot me, no love
Keep a grudge, shooting slugs like Muammar Qadaafi
Murdered my friend built a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi
Gon fly now
Nigga like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper
Bustin' caps at Jay-Z
And still avoid capture
While you all caught up in the rapture
Still after me I'm in Jamaica sippin' daiquiris
No doubt
We used to havin' nothing
Then grabbin something and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga
That my old man wasn't
I came to a fear catchin' cases, litigation
Niggaz playa hatin'
Got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screaming Death Row
Throwing Westside
Ain't no thang
We was raised off drive-by's
Brought up to bang
We claim mob
M-O-B., if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this
I'm hard to kill
When I bill with this live spot
Father
How the hell did I survive, these 5 shots?
Live it up or give it up and like demons
Late night, hear 'em screaming
We going All Out
We going All Out
Bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route
Without a doubt
War, which means, we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle ya own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay
Nigga go all out
Busta's playing with your papes
Better go all out
Trying to see the next day
Nigga go all out
Obstacles in your way
Better go all out
I'm on my land sled
Walking through the belly of the beast
Feeling like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, who are mob niggas hiding in bushes
Claiming that they ride but they softer than cushion
They softer than bitches in worst way drowning in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers I'd die for these thugs
Say hi to these slugs
It's a shame how some niggas on the west coast
Who was riding with Pac
But when he died they went pop
I mob the Jers' to the fullest lots of west coast love
But after Pac stopped rapping ain't no west coast thugs
Just west coast what?
To my real niggaz stuck in these street game
These rappers like Jay-Z
Who be pumping Kool-Aid through their veins
It's true what I'm saying
Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my 4-4 put three holes in your dome
I Ride or Die
While these other fag niggas be biting this
It's all from my heart when I was writing this
Now it's All Out
We all ride
And down to die
Who with us?
Speak up
Or get treated like you coming to kill us
They nothing but squealers
In this rap game swearing they rough
Tattoo'd up
And now them nigga swearing they Pac
Stop that and watch your back
We ain't forgot about cha
These glocks hot
And when shot would bring the bitch up out cha
It's me, Kastro
With the goatee
Walking like an OG
Cause all these fag mother fuckas owe me
I pray to thug lords, like the mother fuckers holy
Frontline soldier, till the heavens, hold me
I go all out
And if you real you real
Feel what I'm talking 'bout cause this game is real
I live it
Forbidden fruit and shoot till they feel it
Living proof Pac breed niggaz they can't deal with
Holler back, right back, and watch your mouth
Or get blood in it
What, we going all out nigga
Fool, you better go all out
Keep going all out
All my niggaz going all out

Ey, you niggaz just gone think you gon be a, talking slick on all these mother fucking records

You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah...
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, Fuck it, cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, Go to the tele hoe
You put what money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggaz is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin' attention
To my amibitions as a ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
But they can't do nuttin to a G
Peep it... it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
Spittin' at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they catchin me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
Gettin' much mail in jail, niggaz tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me,
And all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Got the police bustin' at me

Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
Gettin' much mail in jail, niggaz tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me,
And all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah
This one is all about love
Love, love, oh no
This one is for my baby boo
Now what's about baby
Red Rat will always love you, always
Yo bean or not molest me of you
Prepare to die or say you want me too
I would do anything for make you my baby boo
Remember that I still love you
Yo bean or not molest me of you
Prepare to die or say you want me too
I want to hear my baby boo
And this one is just for you, just for you
I would jump all my girls for you
Walk around the world for you
Fly around like the birds for you
That's why I wrote these words for you
I don't have everything
I sometimes wonder why
I don't have anything
From my heart
Yo, accept the G of a better day
And you tell me find my way
But be the man I'm sure to make me stay
But to keep you, I'll do all it takes
Of course, yeah
Men you think you're nor'
Hold you but you're cloa'
Give me a chance for sure and I'll show
I'm really the one you know
This is not a flo'
Can we stick to the Red Cross? Yo
And if it meant that my love was really true
I'd gladly die and watch over you
I wish you know how much I cared
You'd see my love is true, that love we'd share
Believe that yo
Even if you change your mind
And said our love was through
I'll die, I would cry but I'll still love you
Yo, yo bean or not molest me of you
Prepare to die or say you want me too
I would do anything to make you my baby boo
If it don't work I still love you
It's for our love, no matter what
I'll still love you
As the world turns...
As the world turns my niggaz grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Niggaz die and mommas cry
Niggaz got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggaz fame, as the world turns...
Though I walk through the valley of hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build, and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
If we search deeper, god bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deeper inside
We we ride plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin them fakes smile plastic tears
Like last year, niggaz stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the Mob, M-O-B
Killin' bustaz is my motherfuckin job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, niggaz reported missin'
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns...
My niggaz grow and grow and grow
And gettin' dough and dough and dough
From this state to that state
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns... and steady turnin'
As the world turn burnin paths, starin' through my rearview
It's a war goin' on, and the President is in too
I hear Tu-Pac sayin', Watch 'em they'll kill you
Sippin Thug Passion, scrub actin' like he feel you
Steady plottin, ready or not; Outlawz lost
But not forgotten, from Gittere to Compton
A spitter of the hotness, long timeness
So like six I ain't never been rich
I need cream, to buy Ellene a dream house
She no longer fiend out y'all, Outlawww
Another lonely nigga with a 12-gage pump
With a 12-hour rush to run and get this money, fuck these punks
Road rules I swim in the dirt, I stay in some skirt
I hit where it hurts, I ride or die for my turf
I ride or die for Makaveli the legendary war thug nigga
Kadafi betta unslug this nigga, Seike betta undrug this nigga
Out of the buildin we street children with no souls
Our hearts gon' stay cold, the war gon' stay on
We serve em, like Pac told us to, catch 'em wet with the tec
Hit 'em in the neck and watch him die like he supposed to
Napoleon the front line soldier, front times over
Rider for the mightly dollar rather drunk or sober
Nigga talkin' thug walkin' all through yo' squad
Y'all niggaz scared by a dog, I got my fo'-fo' for y'all
It's like a hot, heated day homie, warfare don't play homie
Better be prepared than try to dunk away from these strays homie
Worlds turn, thangs burn, all in one shot
Rest in peace to the fallen soldiers, all that we got
As the world turns...
Niggaz gettin' swoll out
And it don't stop and it don't quit
That real shit! As the world turns...
Niggaz die for
How many you niggaz try for this? As the world turns
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns... and steady turnin'
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns...
Only haters caught feelings, when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin'
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin' our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas - mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin armies ridin' soldiers, gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nuttin left to earn
October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my Mack-11 hit the block playin'
Only five years up in this bitch, poppa runnin' from the Feds
Puttin' peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin straight shots of Cristal Brothers
Hundred dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns
Hahaha... as the world turns...
And turns and turns and turns... haha
This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin to bubble, keep on hustlin, as the world turns
Money come and go, hoes come and go, foes come and go
Friends come and go... my soldiers, stay eternal
Outlaw Immortalz, dedicated
I send this to black Jesus, only he can feed us
When you need us, as the world turns
Throw this shit in the deck, hahah
Niggaz gettin' chin checked
From the East to the West best to wear a vest
Nigga we ain't the ones to test, fuck you
As the world turns
Outlaw ridahs, Mutah right beside us
Camillion, wanna make a million
Haha legit, as the world turns... haha...
Burn baby burn
A lot of niggaz get burned as the world turns
A lot of niggaz gettin' burned as the world turns...
Gettin' burned as the world turns
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat, so when she asked me
What would you do if it was you?
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggaz grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain, Lord come and take me
Four niggaz violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No, you got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies
Baby, please don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry
I ain't no hater but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
And never your feelings, he's chasin millions fo' sho'
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much, mo', livin' to do I'm spittin' this to you,
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she
Got 'em all stuck standin' still when she come through
Baby, take a little mo' time, love'll find you
And show us the sky's blue somebody other than me
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Baby, don't cry
I'm tryin' to do all that I can, from jump
Now you losin', you was choosin' the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homey roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her, Pampers and food, just to stop through
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Shoulda chose me, she 'bout to O.D. from the pressure
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Baby, don't cry, I gotta keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
Yeah, Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Its just the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
This is the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Ballad of a Dead Soulja
The plan to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded to be the man it was planned
All my road dogs official mob figures love to act up
The first to bomb when we rob niggas
I could be lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thoughts gripping chrome nines
Niggaz get tossed up war scars battle field memories
Swore saw the Devil in my empty glass of Hennessy
Talking to a nigga on a tight leash
Screaming fuck the police as I ride through the night streets
Little child running wild towards his danger
What's the cause don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a mad man a pistol grabbing nigga
Unleash the sand man
Promise a merciless retaliation nothing is colder
Close your eyes hear the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Its just the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Close your eyes, hear the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
This just the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Close your eyes
Completely lost revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch switch now the tricks crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screaming bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what ya see now
A blind man and a dead body I'm meant to leave town
And get my cash though hook up wit Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers try to play us out 'member that
They took my money and my stash time to get it them back
Haha I pull my secret arrival
Death to my rivals tell me what you want lord?
Nobody laugh after the death of a drug lord
Haha the situation's critical nothing is colder
Than hearing the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Be a coward put your hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out them niggas came out BOOM
Who wanna see me in a challenge
So merciless I'm terrifying niggas in my ballad do you feel me?
Capo or capitan one day I'll be the Don
Until then I remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Busting at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facing sixty years
Shedding tattoo tears another suicidal on the tier
Take a private plane trying to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All they promised us is death nigga
Take a breath could be the last one left nigga
Its real now, uh feel it and fantasize ain't nothing colder
Listen you can hear it, the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
This go out to Kato 'n' Mental
All the niggaz that have passed away
Mutulu, Geronimo, Seyku
All the down ass ridahz
All the niggaz that put it down
All the souljaz
All the niggaz that go through that day to day struggle
All the niggaz that passed on
All the niggaz with ambition and money in their heart
All the niggaz want some and that don't take none, hahaha
The police is so scared of us
All the feds, they aware of us
They wanna see us dead,
They got pictures of a nigga hit
Try and see me in chains
Shit, them niggaz will never breath again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole mutha fucken block
Fuck the cops
The police? We run these streets nigga
Heh, these niggaz can't see me
Half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionare
Shit, it ain't fair
But nigga-you know
It's the ballad of a dead soulja
Looking for these better dayz
'Better Dayz'
Heey
'Better Dayz'
Got me thinking bout better dayz
'Better Dayz', 'Better Dayz', 'Better Dayz'
Heey
'Better Dayz'
Got me thinking bout 'Better Dayz'
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smoking weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids wanna try now
Then lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches them clocking, the evil men do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearing victims screaming
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semen's
Cause even our birthdays, are cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beasts
And only we can change, it's up to us to clean up the streets
It ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Pass by his family but what could I say?
Keep your head up and try to keep the faith and pray for 'Better Dayz'
Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Thinking bout better dayz
Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Got me thinking bout better dayz
Thinking back as an adolescent
Who would have guessed, that in my future years I'd be stressing
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Trying to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slanging yayo all day long
Saving up for some Jordan's, 'cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too
And so am I, I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So we argue and playfight, all day and night
Making passionate love till the day light
Plus we bout to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
You tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressing looking for them 'Better Dayz'
Better dayz
Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Thinking bout better dayz
Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Got me thinking bout better dayz
Now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school we was true, me and you
Only part of us separated we stay faded
Affiliated with gang bangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressing like grown men, when rolling
Out in the dark, smoking Newports, gaming marks
Gotta place in my heart, homie stay smart
Locked you up in the pen and gave you 3 to 10
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hoping you well, I know it's Hell
Doing time in the cell you need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doing cool
I've settled down had a family, working and night school
Every once in awhile, I reminisce
And wonder how we ever came to this
I miss the 'Better Dayz'
Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Thinking bout better dayz
Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz
Heey
Better dayz
Got me thinking bout better dayz

Black Cotton
Black Cotton
Black Cotton - A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Robbin' Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak
Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Answer that then answer this too-
Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Dum dum diddy is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Nobody don't care
Nobody don't care
Nobody don't care
Nobody don't care
Nobody don't care
In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know
I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did
To what's Bebe's kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet
Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit
They shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind
And we ain't stop, its cutains, you try to rise and
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Runnin' up, Gun cocked like nasty gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove
No love
Waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
Biblicle times good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton - I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton - I ain't stoppin' till they givin' me mine
Black Cotton
Searching for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin jewels and shit, yaknahmean?
Straight tatted up, no doubt, no doubt
Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off nigga...
What?
I do my shootin's on a knob, prayin' to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
Like I'm jailin, shots hittin up my spot like midnight rains hailin
Got me bailin to stacks more green; Gods ain't tryin' to be trapped
On no block slangin no rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
Gods words all cursed like crack
Shai-tan's way of gettin' us back
Or just another one of my Black Jesus traps
Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin' up in silence
Dark prayer, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
'Cause I swear, they tryin' to break my will
I'm on the edge lookin' down at this bottomless pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin' souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus, hahahahaha
He's like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
Outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
Rebellin against the system, commence to lynchin
The President ain't even listenin to the pain of the youth
We make music for eternity, forever the truth
Political prisoner, the two choices that they givin' us
Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin new
In school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true
Black Jesus
To this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggaz pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggaz play together
We die clutchin glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wishes nigga smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin, hopin for possibilities
I'll mob on, why they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hatin' the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast till they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin Black Jesus
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin' souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
Some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
Trapped, black, scarred and barred
Searching for truth, where it's hard to find God
I play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer
Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties
Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums
This ain't livin'... Jesus
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!
Searchin for Black Jesus
It's hard, it's hard
We need help out here
So we searchins for Black Jesus
It's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect, you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt
Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we coming from
That's who we pray to
We need help y'all
Against all odds, I'm still here nigga
Aiy, I got to get my props for 2Pacalypse
O.P.D. -- what??!
When this album come out, niggaz can kiss my ass
Did you think I'd fall?
You think you could stop a motherfucker like me?
Introducing you to my criminal crew
Treach, A.D., Apache, Essential
You got to deal with me on a whole new level motherfucker
Above the Law, Lench Mob, the Underground
'Cause I'm gettin' paid
Gets around and we down in this bitch
And the more you try to keep niggaz away from me
The more I unite with mo' niggaz and mo' niggaz and mo' niggaz
Extra special thanks to my nigga Big John Major
And it's a ghetto in every city and a nigga in every ghetto
I owe him, thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of out fathers
Motherfucker we are unstoppable
And uh, I'm not goin' alive!
My family tree, consists of drug dealers thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle screamin' fuck they feelin's
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this
Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know, niggaz gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now rule one, get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, 'cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one, watch for phonies
Keep yo', enemies close nigga, watch yo' homies
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels bein' handed, to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Promise if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nothin' free, give back what you earn, no doubt
Gettin' higher than a motherfucker, bless me please
This thug life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my pops told me, blasphemy
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
We probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowin'
Everybody kissin' ass to go to heaven ain't goin'
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin' devil niggaz daily
Plus the media be crucifyin' brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mama a virgin
We got addicted had to leave the burbs, back in the ghetto
Doin' wild shit, lookin' at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, waitin' for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one, I'm deadly
Babylon beware, comin' for the Pharoahe's kids, retaliation
Makin' legends off the shit we did, still bullshittin'
Niggaz in Jerusalem, waitin' for signs
God's comin', she's just takin' her time, haha
Livin' by the Nile while the water flows
I'm contemplatin' plots wonderin' where the door to go
Brothas getting shot, comin' back resurrected
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
The preacher want me buried why, 'cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead, pass eternal fire
Why you got these kids minds, thinkin' that they evil
While the preacher bein' freaky you say honor God's people
Should we cry, when the Pope died, my request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop
Waitin' to beat my ass if I don't go pop
Memories of a past time, givin' up cash to the leaders
Knowin' damn well, it ain't gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain, times in B.C.
It's hard enough to live now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man, well he should understand
Times in this crime land, my Thug Nation
Do what you gotta do but know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? And my people say
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Usin' de name of de Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain

Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us, from evil.
For God, is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever, and ever, and ever.
In today's music news, the ever controversial Tupac Shakur has
Just released another album under the alias Makaveli
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
Street dates, in fear of a wipe out in retail inter chart movement
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row records as well
Nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at Tupac
Excuse me Makaveli's verbal assault
On Mobb Sleep, Notorious B.I.G. and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z of Hawaiian Soapy fame, Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release
The question everybody wants to know is
Why'd they get this nigga started?
Tupac, rather Makaveli was not available for comment
But released this statement
It's not about East or West
It's about niggaz and bitches
Power and money, riders and punks
Which side are you on?
Gun cocked, six shots, bullets hit ground
These niggaz is still fuckin' talkin'?
You nigga still breathin'?
Fuckin' roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid on you
All day
You punk muthafuckas
The shit nigga
Killuminati Style
Makaveli the Don
Solo shit
Bring It
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0 my .45 gun's
Next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes 'cause they breath freely - see me ride?
Located world wide, like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude's shitty
Bolder than a dope-fiend's titty
And every city you'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, nahmean?
I hit the scene, niggas ducking from my guillotine stare
I'm right there - my every word, a fucking nightmare
Get me high; let me see the sun rise and fall
This is for my dogs - down to die for y'all
Extreme venom - no mercy when we all up in 'em
Cut 'em down - to hell is where we send 'em
Murder motherfuckers lyrically, and I'm not gonna cry
Me - a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big Pits, I call 'em Mobb Bitch-Nigga Eaters
And I don't whimper till I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins, so I'm strong
Bye, bye, bye, let's get high and ride
O how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep, nigga when I find you...
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me, yay yay
West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya
Should have never fucked wit' me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest till my road-dog's free
Bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life
And I'm 'a bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life
And I'm 'a bomb first
For so many days and some many ways, we've been ducking strays
They deliver, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nothing to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Deathrow
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli, be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission, set to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes I'll die for the cause
Ya best believe if I leave this bitch I'm dying with choice
Kamikaze sicker than a motherfucking Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made Paparazzi
Tell me if you ain't in this rap game, for the motherfucking cash man
Then what is ya motherfucking purpose, none for service
E.D.I. Mean born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, biatch
Yer style wack as ever, like you was rocking patent leather
Cause a massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't terrel
Half rapper, half drug kingpin, yer telling fairy-tales, son
King of New York like you the motherfucking one
But I'm from Jers we don't play that shit
From the Claire down to North Bricks, all my niggas flippin' chips
Getting rich, even though it's hard
With no warnin' signs 'cause yo my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the nine ready to put in my time
Shoot first, look at their head burst, bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize
And bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize
And bomb first
Who be the last mother fucker breathin
Tell me nigga
Tell Me
Who be the last mother fucker breathin
Stressed
I'm busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last mother fucker breathin
Bustin'
My automatic rounds catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last mother fucker breathin
Woke up with 50 enemies plottin my death
All 50 seeing visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest na nigga I was stressed
Had me creeping round corners
Homies, sleeping in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block
Call the cops, a thug nigga screaming west side busting double glocks
Hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got my driving up on the curb
Hand on the steering wheel swerving
Bless me father I'm a sinner
I'm living in hell, just let me live on these streets
Cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Getting world wide exposure
With a bunch of niggaz that don't give a fuck, riding as my souljahs
I'm just released, I'm on a war path,
Not your average dealer
West side, outlaw, bad boy killer
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin'
I murdered all them bustas
Now I'm the last mother fucker breathin'
Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
For all my souljahs gone, we burnin' the earth
Outlawz world-wide, we pack the block
Shoot rocks at the kidups, bust back for Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here, stale down here
To many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me
Young Noble
Outlaw till these mother fuckers kill me
I'm still breathin'
We was raised, fuck this life
I rose my right
Holding on a tight grip with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm sinner too
Sleepwalking is it true?
Walkin' round town with a pound full of bitter food,
Came a long way from my born day
Dead away, with this war play
Fuck friends, I'll say
Rather die for my AK
With these fag ass niggaz
See through glass ass niggaz
Only ride my dick and scared of my mash ass niggaz
Breathin'
I walk around, with a knife in my back
Talk about a bad day I live a life like that
It's severe
And I'm losing my hair
Bless a hooligan
Catch me, I'm falling out flat
Yo I'm ruining
Breathin in sewer stench
No one give a fuck about me
I learned to like it like that
When I was still in mommy
Beside a seed that the Devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still we breathin'
Totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest, man if one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one mother fucker, bout to do it again
Shit, Pac still doin' it
You hoes can't ruin it
Two million every time we drop
I know you fuckers losing it
We moving in, for the kill
For a mil', holding steel
Hold the wheel
I'm bout to give these niggaz something they can feel
Fakin' real
But we the raw and uncut
Style biting
Thug Line niggaz
Give it Up
We Hit Em Up
And we still real
And we still real
Baby
Brenda's
Baby
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now, Brenda really never knew her moms, and her dad
Was a junky, went in debt into his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought-my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out, and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old, guess she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy
And yet in all, she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of 'em are together,
Whatever, he left her, and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor, and didn't know so
She didn't know what to throw away, and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up, and threw him in a trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heep, ballin'
Mama can't help him, but it hurts to hear him callin'
Brenda wants to run away, Mama say
You making me lose pay, a social worker's here everyday
Now, Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitters, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack, but ended up gettin' robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as her way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby
Baby
Don't you know she's got a baby
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a babe
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a

Bury me a G
Thug Life for life
Thinkin' back
Reminiscing on my teens
A young G
Gettin' paid over dope fiends
Fuckin' off cash that I make
Nigga, what's tha sense of workin hard
If you never get to play
I'm hustlin'
Stayin' out till it's dawn
And commin' home
At 6 o'clock in tha mornin'
Hand's on my glock
Eye's on tha prize
Finger on tha trigga when a nigga ride
Shootin' craps
Bustin' niggas out tha door
Pick my money off tha floor
God bless tha trife folks
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sippin' on Gin
With a couple of friends
Sayin' them thug life niggas be like major pimps
And if I die
Let it be
But when they come for me
Bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G
More Trouble than tha average
Just made 25 and I'm livin' like a savage
Bein a G ain't no easy thing
Cause you could fuck around get crossed
And get stuck in tha game
And for tha rest of your life you will sit and reminicse
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to tha G's you can feel my pain
Till tha mothafucka gets born again
You thought I was a game kid
I'm not tha nigga for playin' games
I let my buckshots rang
When I pull tha trigga on my gauge
I'm on a rampage
Makin' runs for tha devil
Ain't nothin' on my mind
But gettin' in some trouble
I'm tryin' to ride
No more loves
For me hard to figure
Get a nigga for some blunts
I gives a fuck nigga
Stuck outta luck
When I bust
Put me to my death
But I'm a G till the end of me
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G
I got nothin' ta loose so I choose to be a killer
Went from bangin' and slangin'
Now I'm a dope dealer
All my life paid tha price to be tha boss
Back in school
Broke tha rules I'm getten' tossed
Poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time
Pack a 9 all the time
You wanna test mine?
Don't cry
I die before they play me
From tha cradle to tha grave
Bury me
Straight up
Kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
Gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts
A bitch said I'm no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in a dope spot
Never had no time for no bitch
Just slangin' rocks
And bustin' caps on your punk ass marks
Fake ass G's
Bitch niggaz with no heart
I'm stayin' real till I'm 6 feet deep
So when a nigga gone
Bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafuckin riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury Me a G
Stuck on Full
Tangaray got a nigga high
Lord knows I don't need another DUI
I led a Thug Life
Heartless hustler
Just 'cause I fucked
Don't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibratin'
Can't sleep
So I'm mobbin' to tha ho's house
Pumpin' Isely
Is it cool ta fuck is what I'm askin
Bitch recognize game and start laughin'
Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
'Cause I'll fuck and get up and let ya know
I'll be a 10 minute brotha for a $2 ho
Lots a ho's get mad and shit
I let a trick be a trick
You can have that bitch
'Cause I doubt if I change
Tha games a mothafucker
Real niggas turn ta bustas
Bury Me a G

California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean, mean, money-making machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-I-A

Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing hoochies screamin'
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player, where cowards die
And it's all war
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks, not Ballies 
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution; we collide with other crews
Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know The Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-Town
The Bay Area and back down

California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean, mean, money-making machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-I-A

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing hoochies screamin'
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player, where cowards die
And it's all war
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks, not Ballies 
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution; we collide with other crews
Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know The Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-Town
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love
California

Throw it up, y'all, throw it up, throw it up, I can't see you
This song is dedicated
To the mothers and the children of the revolution
From Tupac, to Afeni Shakur
And many many more
This is for you
One love, one life
Can you see... the pride of the panther
As she nurtures... her young all alone
It's the seed... that must grow regardless
Of the fact that, it's been planted in stone
Can you see... the pride of the panther
In the concrete jungle, alone with her cub
It's the seed... that must come to harvest
It's the tree... that must grow out of love
Can you see the pride in the panther
As he glows in splendor and grace?
Topling obstacles placed
In the way of the progression of his race?
Can you see the pride in the panther
As she nurtures her young, all alone?
The seed must grow regardless
Of the fact that it's planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers
As they unify, as one?
The flower blooms with brilliance and
Outshines all the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Carries out like the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Shines bright like a new day begun
Can you see the pride in the panther
As he glows in splendor and grace?
Topling the obstacles placed
In the way of the progression of his race
Can you see the pride in the panther
As she nurtures her young all alone?
The seed must grow, regardless
Of the fact that it's been planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers
As they unify as one?
The flower blooms, with brilliance
And outshines all the rays of the sun
It outshines all the rays of the sun
And keeps high like a new day begun
Shines bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keeps high like a new day begun
Carry out like the rays of the sun
Keep on like a new day begun, say
Shine bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keep high like a new day begun, say
Keep high like a new day begun, say
Shine bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keep high like a new day begun, yes
Keep it high like the new day begin say
Carry out like a new day begun
A new day begun, a new day begun
A new day begun begun begun begun
Begun begun begun... hoo!
Love is the people's power
Let me come swoop you up.
But he ain't gon' if I take you out.
I'll have you back before he even get home;
Before anybody see.
Why you got on glasses?
Ever since I met ya I could beat depression
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't 'bout no suckin and touchin, just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations -- would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
But anticipation of love makin'
Got you shakin when I'm standin near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate -- but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon... let's go... can you get away?
Can you get away?
... Can you get away?
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin' for these hoochies that be on me 'cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
'Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
When he ain't lookin', now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?
I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
'Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
Stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- 'cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?
All I really know, can you get away?
You could get away
You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
I ain't tryin' to put you in a position
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
You need but now... he ain't even takin' care of you
He beatin' on you and shit; look how you look
She motherfuckin wanna be with that nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
YaknowhatI'msayin? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin' to Hawaii, seein the world
Seein what this world got to offer you
Not goin' to, yaknowhatI'msayin?
The emergency room, gettin' stitches
Cause this nigga done got jealous
Don't cry, it's all good
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeah
The blind stares
Of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see
The P
Give me my money in stacks
And lace my bitches with 9 figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel plated 9 triggas
Must see my enemies defeated
I'm cashin'
While they coughed up and weeded
Open fire
Now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh
And test
And get your chest blown
Straight out tha west, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like ho's
Open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe?
Nigga you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money
But baby I got to gets mo'
You scream and go
'2Pac'
And I ain't stopin'
Till I'm well paid
Bails paid
Now nigga, look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens
Niggas open fire
Buncha Thug Life niggas on tha rise
Until I die
Ask me why I'm a Boss Playa gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by
Niggas Can't C Me
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't C Me...
Been getten worried that
These square muthafuckers with nerves
Sayin' they can get with us
But picture me gettin' served
My own mama say I'm thuged out
My shit be bumpin out tha record store
As if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what?
It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was
A young nigga with heart
Ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools
You know the rules
D-R-E you got me heated
My words like a penatentary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed
Alazay and Hennesse
To my Thug niggas in lock down
Witness me
Bail on these ho's in floss mode
Tha life of a Boss Playa
Fuck what ya thought tho'
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch
When my album hit tha streetz
Niggas Can't C Me
Niggas Can't C Me
Which way did he go George

You niggas made a mistake
You shoulda never put my rhymes with Dre
Them Thug niggas have arrived and it's Judgement Day
Hey Homie if ya feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me

Look to the star

Cross this nigga here, now Biggie, tell me who do you fear?
Ain't a livin' soul breathin' shall pump no fear here
My last four flashed then I mashed his ass
Bastard, fuck with me, bet I blast your ass
So many follow but can't reach me, caught in a maze
Catch 'em mimickin' my style, tryin' to walk this way
Impossible, my posse droppin' you, we Death Row riders
No need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us
Feeling blessed, the richer I get the more I stress
Smokin' lye watchin' time fly, waitin' for death
Dear God, I been feelin' like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me
Watchin' niggas catch strays, shake, choke an' bleed me
A mercenary for the streets, check my pedigree
Bustin' motherfuckers, it's the thug in me
Now niggas talk a lotta bad boy shit
Then get to squealin'
Bitch made catchin' feelin'
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screamin', Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound

But that ain't me, dog, my mind's now clear
An' that ain't fair, dog, your heart pump fear
In the state I guess
You better hide nigga truth is near
An' you know just as well I do
You ain't no killer, so kill that you wouldn't kill if you had to
We might wobble but we don't fall down
We take the gospel from Makaveli, pass it around
Ah, shit, we gonna taste the power
We started the thug trend, the game is ours
Now we coast together, put our thoughts together
Won't question will we die together
'Cause the hour is soon to come
Kadafi trained soldier, I show you how to use your gun, bring it
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down

Screamin', Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Ride or die niggas, an' we huntin' you down
Representin' all the real niggas stuck in the trap
Bangin' out with the po' po', tryin' to get to some mo'
Street life, young strugglers racin' the clock
Ain't no tellin' when it all can end, roll or rock
Ain't no world with feelings, this a man's world, youngin'
But the bitches' in business, so learn a lil' somethin'
And stop runnin' your mouth, you're on the verge of squealin'
Bitch made catchin' feelings, nigga

Screamin', Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catchin' feelins uh
Everybody's a gangsta but don't put in work
Instead of puttin' on the armor, niggas put on skirts
These drugs ain't helpin', it only makin' it worse
An' the streets ain't got nothin' for me but herbs
I can't trust the church or the mobs
I can only trust God an' to tell you the truth
I gotta ride, I only roll with the real
'Cause rollin' with the fake got my loved ones killed
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?

Catchin' feelins
Shit, I'm a changed man
Hey turn the lights up
Still ballin', 2Pac up in this bitch
You know how we swing this shit
By age 16 I sold to dope fiends
Not a drug dealer but I watched them closely
Until they noticed me
I got the feds wondering who broke the law
Fuck too inhibited for gun smoke I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fucking diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggas trippin' homie, when we riding?
Fuck 'em slowly like Jodeci
I'd stick a needle in my eye
If I don't live and die for M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one
Last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys
Ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches
Who do you fear?
The game plan of a changed man
So what I'm saying is ...
I changed gears but I'm still the same old ridah
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it up
All my real thug niggas go and get your hands up now, your gonna flip your hands up
Changed man, you dealing with a changed man
In drop top
Glock cocked
Got rocks in ma socks
Cops spot Watt niggas
But hard to stop niggas
Not if the gat niggas
Doughboys and hot niggas
Who might have shot niggas
But only by strolling
Out for respect
Now days they expect me to be in a Ferrari or the old Lexus
But anything you see flashin past and can't tell
That's me
Gauge on the Escalade back seat
Don't creep
But what you think
T.I. be in them suites?
But don't sleep
Get you hit from your head to feet
Hey you don't know me
I'm fittin' to introduce you to the old me
You walk in, explode it and leave reload
You don't like a record nigga - buck you, blow
But you will respect me
Or get it in your neck piece chief
No grief nigga still gonna let me be
Or get your insides exposed to the streets, nigga
I changed plans but I'm still the same old ridah
Slanging new dope to the world but the people still buy it up
All my real thug niggas go and get your hands up now, your gonna flip your hands up
Changed man, you dealing with a changed man
A niggas so cold when I flow
Bow down to death row
Three wheel motion
Coming through coasting
Who's that nigga in the g-ride
Screaming out m.o.b
Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick up kid
Number one in the nation
I fucked the world
The judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weights
Slanging to the whole nation
Give me mine or I'm blastin';
On every song
Murder my enemies
I'm mashing until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggas
And fuck a bitch cause a truce is to love niggas
Throw your hands in the air close your eyes and hope
You ever come against a mass of smoke
On Death Row
My adversaries bleed
But fuck 'em all till the talk cease
Fucking with a changed man
I changed plans but I'm still the same old ridah
Slanging new dope to the world but the people still buy it up
All my real thug niggas go and get your hands up now, your gonna flip your hands up
Changed man, you dealing with a changed man
Haha, everybody think they understand a nigga
Shit you niggas don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap songs
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3d
Westside
I ain't the same, you fucking with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fucking with a changed man
We ain't the same, fucking with a changed man
Changed man ...
Come on, come on
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship them dope and let them deal the brothers
Give them guns, step back, watch them kill each other
It's time to fight back, that's what 
 said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start making changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Oh, yeah
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
'Cause both black and white is smoking crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you staying in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
Being real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
I made a G today, But you made it in a sleazy way
Selling crack to the kids, I gotta get paid,
Well hey, that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Oh, yeah
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you
Don't let them jack you up, back you up,
Crack you up and pimp smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry about the paybacks
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Coming back after all these years
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
That's the way it is, uh
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Oh, yeah
You're my brother, you're my sister
Things will never be the same
You're my brother, you're my sister
That's the way it is
Oh, yeah
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Call Suge, call all the niggaz tell 'em to meet me downstairs
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggaz drivin' or y'all flyin back, whassup?
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
Aw nigga, damn
Now I'm up early in the mornin breath stinkin as I'm yawnin
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alize and Hennessee
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, till you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy trying to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time
Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shoe, 'cause we out this motherfucker
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true, with Janet on, I'm in a Escapade
But did it all end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room, so I assume
Since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's Trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak into your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
Cause there's someone else who deserves my atttention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause busting bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time
Aiyyo man 'Pac ay where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin'
The only one not to leave
Yo man it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
You seem them bitches?
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece! Yo nigga whassup?
Hey I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin but I'm checkin' out later
My behaviour is crazy, from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin your thoughts, 'cause I'm livin' Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashin the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream, and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight, for 'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time
Ay, it's check out time
Ay 'Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin, where my shoes go nigga?
Where my motherfuckin drawers and shit at man?
Man y'all niggaz was in here partyin too fuckin' much
What the fuck y'all doin' nigga?
Kurupt, go tell Daz man and Bogart and the rest of them niggaz
C'mon man, niggaz is trippin' man
Front desk all callin me tellin' me to get the hell outta here man
I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred
From tha Cradle to the Grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto. Ooh
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
June 16,1971
Mama gave birth
To a hell raisin' heavanly son.
See the doctor tried to smack me
But I smacked him back,
My first words were thug for life
And Papa pass the Mak.
I'm bustin' on these motha fuckas ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini 14 callin'.
From out the window of my drop top
I got my glock cocked
Bustin' at niggas
When will it stop?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
But even with this thug livin'
Will I escape prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance
And if you slang
Then you'd better have your nikes on
'Cause when we fight
It's in the middle of the night with no lights on.
Hey!
There must be a God 'cause I feel lucky,
Paranoid out my mind...
This muthafucka's tryin' to rush me.
Am I goin' to jail?
Look at me bailin'
Commin' out the court house
All about the male man
Never, never die
Be a hustlah mothafuckas
And makin' thugs out you suckas.
From the cradle to the grave.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't nevah been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cardle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave
Since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild.
Pop pop!
Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark with less spark.
Surveillance on a nigga every day,
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away.
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet.
So now a young nigga bein' raised by the streets.
And then the on other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
A straight thug.
Just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gatts
One black and one of chrome.
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got
So stop and walk a thin line.
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave,
From the cradle to the grave.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say
I made it this far.
Many G's died hard
And all they got was their name here up on a wall.
It's sad thinkin' about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land...
As the warzone I got no home
Don't have no friends neither.
It's just me by my lonely so I married my nina.
I keeps her wherever I go,
I love my hoe.
Never leave home without my sugar.
I'm hafta plug a nigga.
Mama told me not to trust no punks,
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me.
Since then I been known.
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
'Cause I stay shootin' at marks,
Get twisted up in police reports.
Since the cradle, I've been ungreatful.
My first toy was a gun
I got sprung and learn to love weapons.
But now I'm through with money
And through with street fame.
Somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
March 18th
A rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth.
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb.
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum.
I tried to cope loc
But my family's broke
And my pocket's short
So now I gotta sling dope.
In a game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame,
The white man got a motha fucka slingin' cane.
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I get my serve on.
Always in the spot with my glock slingin' rocks at the rocks.
This shit don't stop I'm steady dodgin' cops.
I never flip flop
Hear my glock cock
Thug till I drop.
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk reminiscing about the good times.
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doing dirt,
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
Time's movin' fast
Will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A.K.
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did
Wishin' someone help me
But they never did.
I can't take it
Will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage.
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way my Daddy raised me
Crazy.
Do or die. Nigga pull the triggah don't give a fuck.
You'd rather be in jail than get your ass bucked.
Nobody cares, it's me against the world.
Keepin' murdah on my mind and my tech-9.
I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high
Then my mission is a walk-by.
You better jet when I hit your set 'cause I'm commin'.
Start runnin' yellin' evil mind as I'm gunnin'.
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside,
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died.
The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave.
Chorus till fade
A smokin' ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a TEC-9 now his smokin' ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin' now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin' quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said, Freeze!
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk... please...
Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin like a bitch, cause you don't know how to... hush...
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me... body...
One to the chest, another to his fuckin' dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggaz
Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick steppin to the niggaz with the props
And any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin weight the shit is real smooth
A nigga's tryin' to play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin' on ten keys, I'ma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac, got the fuckin' Glock cocked, and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
Welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get-a-WAY!
Niggaz got PAID!
And yet another sleepin' ass nigga got slayed, word up
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch...
Crooked ass niggaz
Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rollin' with my crew, watch what crooked niggaz, do!
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin' mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke till I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit 'em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggaz knew, I'm a crooked nigga too
Crooked ass niggaz come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbin's what they specialize in
They'll try to getcha, they'll sweatcha to get in the picture
And then they hitcha, son of a bitch! Now he's richer
Crooked ass nigga...
Criminal, criminal, crim
Crim-criminal behaviour
Criminal behaviour, criminal behaviour...
Criminal, criminal, crim
Crim-criminal behaviour
Criminal beha... crima-crima-crima
Crim-crim, criminal behaviour
Criminal behaviour...
Yeah nigga
Yo, I heard you got beat up by the police
Niggaz just wanna know if your still gonna be on some crooked ass nigga shit
Please tell me what's a nigga to do and it's true
Ain't nuttin' new so I do what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK47 layin on my hips so don't trip
One motherfucker from the underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggaz if they fuck around
Yo, why y'all got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch them motherfuckers gotta beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin the finger at police instead of motherfuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when them punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
You can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too
You know you really can't say that you blame niggaz
Fuck bein' tame, set a flame, tryin' to aim triggaz
2pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
So save two, run for cover
And other bitches from the clan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
Genuine draft ganja ganja and my fuckin' Tec-9
Cobra - And niggaz will take the world over
I'll be a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

Pardon me, ?? has been God and try me
I'll be damned if I die come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
Now it's the rebel and the devil and one of us is goin' to hell
I got the whole place covered with loc'ed out brothers
And nothing but love for eachother
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop
See it's cool to shoot a nigga but they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on deathrow
But I learned to look ahead of me
Stay strapped, watch your back, keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and ooh you can't fuck with the crew
A crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

Y'all gon' stop fuckin' with me
You are appreciated
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary
Hey, I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it? 
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to ya
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin home after work, late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
You're just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough, you're alone
Tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are fulla all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be all right if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

He's just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' AK all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't,
You don't do a goddamn thing
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the corner, any day
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self,
But I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner,
The pressure's getting to me
I no longer trust my homies,
Them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
Got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest,
Under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived,
Straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
That was buggin'
My homie told me once,
Don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
But they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
Who done passed away screamin', please
Young nigga, make Gs
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless,
I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner
I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor till you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin' on them niggas till they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
'Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
Them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you till you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin' high was a way of gettin' free
I see death around the corner
This is for all the real mothafuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
We all gotta go, ya know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there,
All right
I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead
I want him dead, I don't care
He's just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' AK all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't,
You don't do a goddamn thing
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the corner, any day
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self,
But I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner,
The pressure's getting to me
I no longer trust my homies,
Them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
Got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest,
Under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived,
Straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
That was buggin'
My homie told me once,
Don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
But they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
Who done passed away screamin', please
Young nigga, make Gs
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless,
I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner
I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor till you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin' on them niggas till they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
'Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
Them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you till you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin' high was a way of gettin' free
I see death around the corner
This is for all the real mothafuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
We all gotta go, ya know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there,
All right
I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead
I want him dead, I don't care
Nobody's, closing me out of my business
I played the cards I was given, thank God I'm still livin'
Pack my nine till it's time to go to prison
As I'm bailin down the block that I come from, still gotta pack a gun
Case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
I guess I live life forever jugglin
But I'll be hustlin till the early mornin 'cause I'm strugglin
Like drinkin' liquor make the money come quicker
Gettin' pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
I ain't in love with her, I just wanna be the one to hit her
Drop off and let the next nigga get her
That's the way it goes, it's time to shake a hoe, make the dough
Break a hoe when it's time to make some mo'
I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock
And spittin' game through my mobile phone
The type of shit to get them hoes to bone
My Definition of a Thug Nigga
Tis the season, to be servin' What you doin'?
Mob-mobbin like a motherfucker
Tis the season, to be servin'
Well I roll with a crew of zoo niggaz
They're quick to pulle a nine when it's time do niggaz
Comin' through like I'm two niggaz, a true nigga fuck a Zig Zag
Roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga
I'm drivin' drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy
Lookin' for a new face to skeeze me
Everybody's lookin' for a nut but I'm searchin for the big bucks
Give a fuck, rather die than be stuck
In a one-room shack, and, kickin back
So how's that from the mind of a Thug Nigga
Bought a fo'-five 'cause I heard that the slug's bigger
Figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself
Gettin' swept off his feet by the pump
I put that on my moms, word to the motherfuckin trigger
Before I go broke I'll be a drug dealer, a Thug Nigga
Short than a motherfucker snatched up by one-time
Make a phone call and be back to ball by lunchtime
So here we go, we in the inner city
I keep my hand on my gat and stay cool, my attitude is shitty
Niggaz don't like me 'cause I'm makin' ends
Roll in a Benz and I blaze a blunt, 'cause I'm all in
And any nigga trying to take what I got'll
So here we go, I can't be faded
Happy in the motherfucker, finally made it
Got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
And I ain't takin' shit from no niggaz
I'm just tryin' to make some money right
Put some motherfuckin food in my tummy right
I'm feelin' good like I'm supposed to, ready to ball
Find a spot and we can serve 'em all
My Definition of a Thug Nigga
Tis the season, to be servin'
Mobbin like a motherfucker, every single day
Tis the season, to be servin'
Nobody's, closing me out of my business
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the staaaaaart
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, don't wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
... That's right, sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do?
So now I'm back
To makin' promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin' low, losin control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucka for love
... Damn, sucka for love... sucka for love
... Sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Now he left you with scars
Tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost
Trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry 'bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision 'cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
... Sucka for love
Know you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
... I'ma sucka for love, sucka for love
... Sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Just 'cause a nigga come in he got style
Don't think I won't flip it
Don't pull your file
But I got enough bullshit to deal with
I'm rollin' with the thugs so
You must be on drugs to the head
Get your ass break down
Broken half baby
I'm a feelin' like a motherfuckin psychopathic
And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer
I'm no joke
Mopreme straight loc
And you could get smoked
You hook the shit you get stroked
And all of that
And later be back for your motherfuckin dope sack
Kid it ain't the type of day to play doughnut
Don't get your ass sewn up
Why you leakin on my blown out
Hey, you're mixed up like a bowl of nuts
You fuck around and got it twisted up
Boy, don't get it twisted
It's the Macadoshis coming from the dark side
The park side where the O.G.s do ride
Ain't nothing but killers in the park
As many niggas lost they's heart
When my gat sparks
I'll bust a cap in that ass
Don't get it twisted
When I'm on a mission, niggas come with Mishy
You busters gettin' disciplined
And you're comin' up short on your life
When I smoke you with this mac-10
When it's on it's on
Fuck it
I'm makin' niggas kick the bucket when I check em' by inducis
Ain't no think to let my shit spin
You on my shit list hope you got a death wish
I tried to warn you but you missed me
Don't get it twisted!
Niggas got problems about gettin' shit twisted
They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin their big clips
But don't front no shit that brought no shit that peace started
'Cause I'm a cold hearted rider straight dunkin'
Never through with my streets
Never hurt nobody but my heat
East side brothers don't hear me though
They'd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas when I caught 'em
Couldn't bust a drape if they wanted
They're soft like Charmin
But I don't sweat varmits
I suffer with my black group
Just a one-day murderer
On the motherfuckin Rudy Poop
I snapped his soul, son
Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy can't save you now
Cause you got the job twisted up
For fuckin' with a killer
Shit
When I enter the first zone worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy manifestin' military styles
Casually try da G when niggas battle me
My prophesied prediction, switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch and watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin' still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin', hell or prison
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world, me and the mob gettin' married
It seems all the fine screams pierce the dark
This is expected, a trick bitch where's your heart?
You mark, watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til it's none left, don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time
Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random
Rapidly wit' accuracy, they shouldn't've talk bad to me
It had to be a motherfuckin' murder
I'm glad to be a nigga that did the murder
So sad to see another motherfucker floatin'
In plastic reef, sleep wit' his head wide open
Rapid release, keep the police coastin'
Casualties warrant in deep east Oakland
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt, drove off to the hills
Positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the lex ruger, death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullet fly, kill and execute 'em
I blast first 'til they body me like my guns in varieties
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hand on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples nigga nothin' simple 'bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin', dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out ain't no easy way outs or easy exits, don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time
When I hit the street all I can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tear when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose then no crew standin' but mine
I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
Whateva you do shawty you betta think wisely
You might see me wit' a stack in the trap
I use my thoughts and pen similar to a saran wrap
A lil' lame nigga I'll neva be, yeah, I'ma keep it G
I'm from the Three and Scrap will neva sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep
Don't sleep
Don't sleep
Yeah...
All up in this bitch
Don't stop...
Don't stop...
Keep it goin', got my nigga Slip Capone
Hahahaha, hell yeah, lot of fakers is out there
Niggaz get around these backwoods
Get around they mommas, pull up they pants
Hide they rags and start to act good, hahahahaha!
Killin' willingly, who got the right to make a sound?
My sound break block, corners, avenues and drives
It's about time the mashin is arrived
I take you on a mission, be on a mission, I'm packin steel
I spend major loot on khaki suits
Nikes and kroker-saks to sweat suits, and leather boots
I box niggaz twice my size, I bust wit a fo'-five
Lick you up in yo' eye, blast, make the party live
I live the unusual, crucial life
So pay attention when I come through for you and your crew
As just a man and his music, I ain't afraid to use it
Bruise you badly, you want confusion, I mean it's useless
To step to this, we in effect, we dangerous
Contendin mental murderers and ain't afraid to diss
I give a fuck, what you thought, or who you brought witchu?
Better laugh now, then cry when I come to get you
I hit you with two glocks, and leave you with scar tissue
Let's go for dolo BIATCH, and watch me flow yo' shit
Mr., Makaveli movin pieces like telekenesis
Shots rang and niggaz brains were spilt
I hit the funeral and busted his folks
And leave the scene like a shadow in a blaze of smoke
Don't stop, keep goin'
Hardcore hooligan, verbal assault chopper
Lethal with mics like guns, bats and knives
Those who oppose are my foes, all stand in rows
Deadliest MC across the globe, Kurupt Capone
Too much pressure makes ya fold, so lo' and behold
Why you waitin for the poetical Satan?
Creatin' slaughters, runnin' through camps like Walter Payton
Who goes against the program, I'm the Man like Meth
The second I get a chance I'ma bust ya
No matter where, you could be in Russia I'ma touch ya
Shoot for the loot, brownies and black mags
Don't stop, don't stop
...
For everybody out there that got the humps in they Jeep
Big Suburbans, they Lexuses, they Beemers
We gon' break it down a lil' somethin' like this
For you to get yo' sub on throughout yo' neighborhood
Turn it up, check it out
Number one...
I ain't got time for this man I'm out
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?
Callin' up my house to hang it up You think that makes sense
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
Let's make it an even break don't make it scandalous
Try to be mature I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're saying I'm too busy I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but your lyin'
Fighting back the urge to start cryin'
I wipe away your tears come and hug me
I love you like you love me
Girl... don't you trust me?
I can't bare to hear you yellin' at me
Maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional you milk me
Comin' over crying just to get me feelin' guilty
You and me were met to be it yet
Just let me pack my things and I'll be outie
This time I'm breaking out you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
I get no room to sleep I hope it ceases 'cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
When I can give you more when you unsure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya
And I hope that you understand why I bust it
But girl don't you trust me?
Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
Not that I don't trust you
Who you are,

Young nation, no revolution and no cause,
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
Young nation just trying to get this
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get,
Out the window on some uptown anthem shit,
I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure, I been here before,
Fugitive taskforce at my girlfriends' door,
Now they checkin' in her bedroom, I ain't there,
Forty Cals, extended clips, still I ain't scared,
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive,
I'm different and I'mma prove it if it take me to die,
You think God had a plan for me?
But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me,
Maybe I'm brazen or paranoid than a bitch,
Me dyin', you think I'd let him see the joy from that shit?
Walking dead, angels spend their last days by me,
New Jersey Giant like Dave Tyree,
Young George or Jonathan Chat,
Your guns clap,
Mine will go 'br-r-r-r-att',
Soldier like Geronimo Pratt,
And come through cockin' tha black pound,
When they put the twin towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' 'em back down,
Poster child,
Air Force Ones, with the checks,

Money and murder is all I breathe in my life,

One Nation under a thug and bullet scar,
Young nation, no revolution and no cause,
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
Young nation just trying to get this
I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac,
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box,
You end up in the box 'cause them grave robbin' bastards,
Dig your grave up and snatched you out the casket,
Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage,
The flesh to the bones,
The bones to the ashes,
But I'm not dead,
I'm actually in a session with the Pac Keeper, Sha Money, progressing,
They don't really want no drama, I know they goons,
That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound,
This God given, he keep givin' me better music,
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement,
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin',
Songs of evolution,
If I load your gun for you and we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it,
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever, stupid,
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless,
You got the same bullets you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it,
The Nasareema dream, get ready for execution,
Papoose, Fatal and Pac
The revolution

One Nation under a thug and bullet scar,
Young nation, no revolution and no cause,
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,

But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin what you thinkin' but you musta been the ship
Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin the reverand from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't bout talkin' bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin' back, for everything you owe
I'm comin' collectin the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
How do I plead?
Yes sir, how do you plead?
Shit, you know how I plead
C'mon!
Psssh
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin' for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin' bout, Where is the quaaludes? What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed Nigga motherfucker
Dropped me to my knees I proceed to bleed
Sufferin a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin?
I grab his gat and bust in self - defense, my only option, God damn
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, reposessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self - defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin this in federal prison, givin' everything I owe
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery,
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery.
Picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushing permanent twisting I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screaming when I did
Steady yelling out spots for me to hit, and aww shit
Soon as I seen her saw us playing hide the Weiner
Wanna Freak Like Me, fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holler out my name when a thug nigga ride, can I come inside
Say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this
Penitentiary dick, the trot caught your eye
When I walked by, I said, Hi
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me going first, and that ain't no 'Fair Xchange'
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery,
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery,
Open your legs got me watching like it's a million
You tremble from the feelin' look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceiling
And if you willing, then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I bet you I can make you cum sixty-one times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
'Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? 'I Get Around', and I'm haunted by my temptations
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around acting like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doing me no favours, 'Fair Xchange'
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm getting pussy, but baby you getting dick!
And since you being laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of faking like you can't hear the bed shaking
In bed naked you so twisted think yoour legs breaking
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumping on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait till you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you acting like you did something, giving me a piece
I had you muffling your screams in the sheets, fucking with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustling bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another 'Fair Xchange'
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery

Only one thing that you can do for me
Baby you can treat me right
We can do it all night
Nothing more than a fair exchange
Don't stop
And make me scream your name
You can do what ever you want
Got what I want, and gone
Nothing more than a fair exchange
Open your legs got me watching like it's a million
You tremble from the feelin' look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceiling

Nigga done stick and wet his dick
And then get tricked out all his riches by a -- BITCH!

Think you alla that just 'cause she let a nigga toss her
It's like a motherfuckin priveledge

When she call ya, ask that little tramp whassup
And if she hesitates nigga hang up, worrrd up
And let that bitch meditate to the dial tone
And call me when you're ready to bone, and it's on
A motherfucking mack tonight
Stay that stay strapped cause my raps is tight
You fuckin' punks, I hate you snitches
Went against the grain and the game to be fake ass bitches
And expect them to accept it; girl your heard me it gets skanless.
I can't stand fake ass bitches
Lyin' ass niggaz and you punk ass snitches
Time to show these bustas who's boss
Run up on a real motherfucker and get tossed
The game is deep, and thicker than a motherfuckin jimmy
Broke hoes runnin' round yellin' Gimme!
I can't stand it, hoes talkin' bout they got a man
Shit all I wanted her to do is suck my DICK
So how about hittin a motherfucker on my pager
Busy now bitch but you can give me the pussy later
Fly how I fade her, played her like a game of Sega
Fuckin' with the player that made her, huh
And I ain't sleepin' caught you creepin' for my money
So get the bozack, knockin' hoes back, keep my dough stacked
So where the motherfuckin hoes at?
Punk niggaz can't fade the mack, livin' fat
Gettin' paid to rap, it's like that, you motherfuckin bitches
Yeah, yeah that's my motto
She educated a whole bunch of you old raggedy-ass niggaz
So y'all take that shit back to y'all camp and uh
You sleep on that there, it's like
Oh you too nigga, don't think we ain't talkin' bout your punk ass
You old fake ass nigga
Standin there wearin all them Pendletons and khakis and all that
You soft as a motherfuckin grape

Some of these niggaz is bitches too, man I tell ya
It's gonna be harder and harder to be a Thug in ninety-fo'
But we gonna do this shit
Y'all take this shit and you play this shit for every single
Fake ass bitch out there
And there's plenty of em
You probably got one sittin' next to you right now
Bobbin his fake ass head to this, dope ass shit that he listenin to
Fake ass motherfuckin bitch, die in ninety-four
And my niggas say
We want the FAAAAME
C'mon c'mon
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
It's been nothing but pain stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to g's
Stresses after battle with success comes greed
They got me hot When they shot me plotted my revenge
To increase my ends enemies getting dropped
Win or lose red or blue we must all stay true
Play the game nigga never let the game play you
And for the fame niggas change fast that's a shame
What's the game lost souls who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? the world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane I'm hoping we can change with time
I'm living blinded searching for refinement
Curse, I know death follows me but I murder him first
And worse yet with each breathe steps I take
Breathless ss there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes coaster crystal glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards with a ski mask
I'm the first one to warn them blast it
Ain't nothing left now treated like a stepchild
Be rocking beats fake in fame
Block run and shoot slugs
We throw them back like hardballs
Without the gloves
No love for these fake desperados
And thugs I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts
Sipping Henney
Drunk nights and hot days
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways
A wife on the run full of common blunts
Unconditionally married to my gun
Fulfillin' my destiny on knees
And ones desires be pulling all my cabbage like priors
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher
Fortune and fame
Searching for fortune and fame lost in the rain
A lose of the game with life the cost of the game
We forcing the change mother fuck flossing the chain
All the blame belongs to the part of the brain
That we never use nigga plus my heart is in pain
And if I ever lose homey bet I'm at it again
Outlaws don't die so united we stand
And if family come before all the fortune and fame
As I walk up in the crib laid to rest me head
Say some rhymes to angels hope they bless my bed
Hope they bless me the righteous way
Got a homie locked down outta town I sent him a kite today
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog
I was passed down the street fame like glocks clocked and keep aim
Was raised up with a clock box and I ran with the local street gang
They say the light is faded but still shine in the dark
You can easy been a man but you is a boy in your heart
And that's some game that I got from generation of game
In the road of life dog we need to switch up lanes
Think about it
I can't complain I've seen my fair share of the fame
It wont change me now I've got this piece of change
I feel strange I got so used to the hood
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me
Ghetto ain't made me I made myself
Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help
I pray for my health my mind and my family too
State of myself my grind and my family crew
Where one hand watches the other no we ain't blood
But we still real brothers the struggle is real
Nothing can steal what we build and that remains the same
Till that day we killed and that's real
Life that I was aimed to be love by my family tree
That's fame to me, how about it
Because we all spring from different trees
Does not mean we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
Or in the vast forest in which it breathes?
I find greatness in the tree, that grows against all odds
It blossoms in darkness, and gives birth to promising pods
I was that tree that grew from the weeds and wasn't meant to be
Ashamed I'm not, in fact I am proud, of my thriving, family, tree
The rose that grew from concrete, yeah
The tree that wasn't meant to be
Though I, struggle in my life, I never give up
And you, know that I, will always be by your side
My family tree, yeah a family tree
Yeah, my family tree, my family tree
I find, greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
It blossoms in, darkness, and gives birth to a promising pod
You'll never see me give up
I will press on, never hold my head alone
Never no, my family tree, my family tree yeah
My family tree, family tree
Because we all spring from different trees
Does not mean we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
Or in the vast forest in which it breathes?
The tree must fight to breathe
Among the evils of the weeds
I find greatness in the tree, that grows against all odds
Ashamed I'm not, in fact I am proud, of my thriving, family, tree
Ha ha ha... fuck all y'all... fuck all y'all... I don't need nobody
Fuck 'em... Fuck all y'all
Money gone fuck friends
I need a homie that know me
When all these muthafuckin' cops be on me
I got problems ain't nobody calling back
Now what the fuck is happenin' with my ballin' cats
Remember me I'm ya homie that was down to brawl
Sippin' Hennessy hanging with the clowns and
All we used to do is drink brew, screw and common knew
We had bitches by the dozens oh we fuckin' cousins
You can throw ya middle finger if ya feel me loc
A nigga just got paid and we still was broke
It took time but finally the cash was mine
All the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind
Look around and all I see is snakes and faces
Like scavengers waitin' to take a hustler's pape's
And when you stuck where the fuck is all ya friends
They straight busted and can't be trusted fuck y'all
Fuck all y'all 2x
I'm sippin' Tanqueray and juice and what's the use
'Cause I'm a hopeless thug
Ain't no love reminiscing on how close we was
Way back in the day before they put the crack in the way
And heey how much money can you stack in a day
It's gettin' rough collect calls from my niggas in court
I recollect we used to ball now just living's enough
I stand tall in the winter summer spring or fall
Thug for life scrawled all across the wall
And all about my dollars make me wanna holla
Drop an album sell a million give a fuck about tomorrow
I know it's gettin' crazy after dark
These marks keep on huffin' and puffin'
Ain't no fear in my heart
What's going on in the ghetto still struggle and strive
I still roll with the heater smokin' chocolate thai
In 94 I'll be going solo
Too many problems with my own
So I'm rolling do-do
Fuck all y'all
I went from rags to riches quick
To socializing with the baddest bitches
Went from a bucket to a rag with switches
I'm seein' death around the corner
I'm bumpin' Gloriaaaa doin' 90 'cause I wanna
I'm getting high like I said it with some chocolate thai
Mixed with some indonesia watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
Will I get caught another ticket get to kick it in court
Fuck the law give a shit I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
But I ain't worried still throwing these thangs
Got me locked in these chains
And hey nigga what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout
Soon as I hit the cell I'll be bailin' out
And when I hit the streets I'm in a rush to ball
I'm screaming Thug Life nigga fuck y'all
Repeat of intro
You a what? Bad Boy Killaz
Hahaha yeah nigga, fuck em' all
Fuck all you muthafuckers
Ay Yo Biggie Put your hands up
Now I can make it happen
My rappin' is similar to muthafuckers
When they scrappin'
Blast and watch em' back up
Notorious biggie killer
Affiliation with death row
Niggaz get their caps pealed back
Fool this the west coast
Fuck a misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks
That thought I quit
Then got a drop top jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack
I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggaz to trip
Cause bitch I love to scrap
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga
With love niggaz
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines
Writing raps and movies
I went from trustin
Oh, who hoo hoo
Live from the crazy house
You heard that shit nigga
Live from the crazy house
Yo that nigga be crazy as hell
My ghetto love song
Lets be friends
Approach you and posed a minute
All on my double R tinted
As you pass bye
Winkin' my eye
Freshly scented
What's the haps baby, look
Get with me and perhaps lady
You can help me multiply my stacks baby
Currency seems small I need companionship
Do with that scandalous shit
I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitating, actin' like your shit don't stink
Check out my diamonds
Bitch everyone gon' blink
This be a thug thing, outlaw
Nigga with riches cream dreamin' mutha fucka
On a mash for bitches
Check my resume, sippin' on crystal and alizee
Smoking on big weed, key'd the Cali way
Don't like trickin' but I'll buy you a fit
I can't stand no sneaker wearing, nappy haired bitch
Let my pedigree read briefly
Their so cheap
Puttin' bitch made bustas to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so called car
Who the man while I'm thuggin' on your main bitch hand
Understand this, ain't no nigga like me
Fuck Jay-Z
He broke and I smoke dearly

While you trickin' on them other hoes

I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded
But at last, it was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass, got me checking for you hardcore
Staring and watching
Me and you
One on one, picture countless options
Was it prophecy, clear as day?
Visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, would possess my body
Far from a crush
I wanna bust your guts
And touch everything inside you, from my head to my nuts
You got my sweatin' like a fat girl going for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess
Money and fame made ya used to me
What's up in 96?
Lying tricks in drag
Fuck Dre
Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
Back to you
My pretty ass, caramal queen

Was it me or the fame?
My dick or the game?
Bet I screamed west side when I came
Scream my name
Cause baby it's delicious
Got a weak spot for pretty bitches
Up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby let your back dip into it
Make it fluent
In and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high, let me come inside
Love it when you get on top, baby let me ride
Who wanna stop me?
In my top notch
Fucking player hating niggaz 'cause they cock block
You probably hate to see a real thug envisioned with the game
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good, in this world of g's
Baby got me fantasizing of seeing you naked
It's a fuck song, so check my record

Haha, what you say?
Who you callin rapist? Ain't that a bitch
You devils, are so two faceted
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
And gettin' stalked by these crooked cops a-gain
Fuckin' with the young black male, tryin' to stack bail
And umm, stay away from the packed jails
I told the judge I'm in danger
And that's why I had that fo'-five with one in the chamber
Fuck the world!
I woke up screamin, Fuck the world!
Just woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Uh, I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Just got up and screamed, Fuck the world!
When I was comin' up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin', threats to me, comin' from my enemies
And, in they dreams it's, Hell where they sendin me
Have I, lost control or just another soul
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Never take yo' eyes off the prize, and even if you gettin' high
Don't ever hesitate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin, niggaz we all in
Fuck the world!
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Just woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
I got up and screamed, Fuck the world!
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Man, fuck the world...
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
'Cause I'm sittin' here sippin on Guinness
Weighin 165, and these tricks should die
For bein jealous of a brother when he rides
I can see it in yo' eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin'
They hate to see a nigga ballin
Some of you suckers is rottin, plottin on what I got
Stop givin' game for free, you wanna hang with me
Like being a thug is the thang to be?
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, fuck the world!
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Got up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Haha, fuck the world! Fuck it
I hear my niggaz screamin fuck the world!
They wanna know if I claim the click, that I'm hangin' with
And if I'm down with this bangin' shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or 'Cause
Long as ya got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
I been through, Hell and back, and if I, fell black
Then it's, back to the corner where we sell crack
Some of you niggaz is bustas; you runnin' 'round
With these tramp=ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
Fuck the world!
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
I woke up screamin, Fuck the world!
Ha ha, niggas
Fucking with the wrong nigga
My seductive introduction
Be specific, still elusive
But exclusives what I give you when I kick it
And I'm still lifted
Niggas can't get with Mr.Wicked
Picture me flipping
My adversaries getting the dick swiftly
Niggas is swinging wild but they styles miss me
You can bring that bitch with your whole click
And still get treated shitty
Business never personal, I'm up before the sun come up
I'm tired
Just a ghetto star
A drop-top double R is what I'm riding
Nigga if you was half the man your bitch was
Bring your artillery
When you come for me 'cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast
'Cause Syke was busting
Plus Bo had 'em ducking screaming get they cash
So...
So now I got the law on me
My phones tapped, so I had to send word through my little homies
Tell them niggas just be here when they pull the trigger
Shit
This is what you get, for fucking with the wrong nigga
This is what you get when your
Fucking with the wrong nigga
Ha ha, yeah nigga
Peep
Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray
And thank the lord for giving me another fruitful day
I wanna be a peaceful man, but still
When niggas come for me, all I can see is getting 'em killed
For real, it's how I feel
Perfect my thoughts flowing on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel, they caps peel
We still cool, but you played yourself
Give 'em the mack and make 'em spray yourself
Hey
Falling legends, clutching chrome 3-5-7
Putting two bullets to they dome
Wanted to die in heaven
While calling shots nobody real as clear it's me
Ain't trying to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder my foes, get disposed of
We all homies till the death
So my true niggas show me love
God forgive me for my lifestyle
A negative figure
But why they fucking with the wrong nigga?
You know, it's like ...
Why you fucking with the wrong nigga?
I was raised by thugs
Schooled by killers
Learned my mathematic skills from real drug dealers
Tried to rise but they tried me
I guess they all had to die 'cause we tried peace
I die on these streets
Blast till they recognize
Still do or die
All my niggas getting high watching time fly
Best strategize on a way to profit
Best organize how you ride so they can't stop it
Then keep it popping a lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked your bitch and now this new shit gon' fade 'em all
My niggas ball, made a call for some backup
The little homies and my dogs in a black truck
Buck Buck was the sound
As they gats burst
No need for ambulance
Baby bring the black hearse
Shoulda never fucked around buster
How you figure making moves on the wrong nigga?
This what it sounds like
Bing, Bing, Bing
When you fucking with the wrong nigga
Niggas getting hit when they fucking with the wrong nigga
Fucking with the wrong nigga
Hit them with a lil' ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns
If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, Thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
In our days, things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth 'cause the truth looks strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin'
Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human
I hope we see the light before its ruined
My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns
Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Living out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess she's given birth to a baby
I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when its said and done
I bet this Brotha be a better one
If I'm upset, you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace in that war on the streets
My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns
Lord can you hear me speak!
To pay the price of being hell bound...
That live the life of a ghetto star
Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggaz is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn'ta tried
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces, they wrists and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter, eat a dick BEYOTCH!
Mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
Bring it on, fo' whoever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
I live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin' game tight
Mug niggaz, slug niggaz for the famed life
Laced with game, practiced on taking pain,
Quick to slang, and let it rain through your brain,
Street smart, proficient, intelligent,
And keep suckers hittin till snitches start smellin,
Movin niggaz with telekinesis,
Keeping Channel Seven at work filming different features,
Leadin niggaz to an early death with they head blown,
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue, was just dead and gone,
And hope niggaz got punished,
Kidnapped jacked in the back with macs to they neck,
Rats waitin to get done in,
Tossed his ass out, mob related,
One more nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth,
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfucking G
Now the next generation's looking up to me.
Walkin' through the cemetery
Talkin' to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid
Two shots rang from the plastic glock, wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard, time to notify, his family
Shiiit, ain't nuttin left to be identified
Evacuate the crime scene fast
Why I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass
Fly, I won't touch down till I see Tiajuana
Set up shop sellin them crooked cops marijuana
Label me a success, I made the switch
Retired from the life that never gave me shit
With cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star
Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down
Straight to the morgue 'cause I plan on, shut ya down
Born soldiers! -- Fucked him up with a mac folder
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga's shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh
'Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
Death, apparently they wasn't sucker free
'Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggaz in protective custody
I guess they heard that I got them birds
Thought I was a nerd till I fucked one of them to the curb
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich
With a team and clientele on my motherfuckin dick
And gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin riches
By givin' stitches, my life as a ghetto star
This goes out to all you motherfuckers
That STILL, have to kill to make that money
All you niggaz on the block, sellin rocks
Hand to hand, runnin' from the police
I see you - live your life as a ghetto star!
Talk to the hood, claimin you gettin' riches
Runnin' from the flags... live my life as a ghetto star
Niggaz with two strikes that don't wanna see the third, I feel you
The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm takin' back what's mine
You motherfuckers can't stop me
Even if I die, I'm gonna be a fuckin' problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin', joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Damn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so God damn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, can't peep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin' at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggaz slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My Mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin' drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
Every step could be death till you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
A seven-deuce full of niggaz goes by
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
But everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, kill a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggaz in the seven-deuce
A mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do?
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN' DIE, hope yo' ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin' cops now
Barely breathin' tryin' to keep from gettin' shot down
BOO-YOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin' like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm runnin' to my fuckin' block
Took a shot, tired of runnin' from the niggaz and the cops
Time to be a ghost
And then we'll be ghost
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
God
When I was alone, and had nothing
I asked for a friend to help me bear the pain
No one came, except God
When I needed a breath to rise, from my sleep
No one could help me, except God
When all I saw was sadness, and I needed answers
No one heard me, except God
So when I'm asked, who I give my unconditional love to?
I look for no other name, except God
Rest in peace to my mothafucka Biggie Smalls
That's right boy, it's goin' on
Right here, Thug Life
God bless the dead
God bless the dead and buried nigga
Don't worry if you see God first tell Him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you're representin the crew
And I can picture you in Heaven with a blunt & a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlas, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggie
Sayin' shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' mothafuckas plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin', never meant to do time
My epitaph will read Was the last of Gs
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucka wantin to hang
I can see 'em in my head, pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin' back in my yearbook all the years took
Half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die will they all shed tears
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin' in the mirror
Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
Fuck the police and all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin'
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin'
By keepin' gun and never run unless I'm comin' at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckas that passed too early
All the young motherfuckas that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin Gz, this one is for you
Yo Stretch, Biggie
Yo Big this is to you my nigga
Springfield Hollis crew, Thug Life, YGz
Sendin they respect, know I mean?
You my nigga for life, forever
You're always gonna be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget that
I pray before I go to sleep
Dear God save my place before I start to eat, cause times is hard
So I'm covered to my knees, oh why?
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock I buy?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, uzi weighin a ton
Niggas terrified of comin' from the young gun
Hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind blowin', so I'm flowin goin' crazy
Slip for cock the gun but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
For spunk is what he had, kid, I'd ratha attack Big
Now ya bout to smell the aftermath of what the mack did
Wannabe suckers wanna test, I'm tellin' you, yes
The teflon's bout to rip through your fuckin' vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
The spirit Biggie Smalls and the ??? clique, yeah
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
I was so money orientated initiated as a thug
Fiending for wicked adventures ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of living insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell me if I'm wrong, but saying fuck the world got ya deeper in my songs
Drinking till I hurl, spending money till it's gone, it's the good life
Baby niggaz got it going on
No maybe if I died and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways
Fuck a bitch
Bad boys eat a dick a day bumping this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wetting niggaz like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked as hood fights
But I'm a baller now
Nigga
I live the good life
This is the good life
Fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggaz
That trust the hoes
I found a way to stack money
Guaranteed to rise
I live the good good life
Cause thug niggaz don't die
No one knows, what the future holds, for you, huh huh
Listen closely
They say reach in your heart and you will find your mind
Everyday in these streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is now, peeping down the barrel of a fo'
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know, so
Who makes the call?
Will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
The desperation, constantly drinking and I can't sleep
Make deep tryin' to survive, some wanna die I wanna stay alive
Eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucka ducking season
Ya need a reason, why she turned into a softy
After living so loftly
It cost me my soul out of control in the Devil's world
Me, and my niggaz and my girl
Living the good life
I spend my days and nights, not knowing if strays in flight
Will finally catch me
It's the good life can ya hear me
Cleary, over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook doing way too much
But it's the fast lane on that, big dealing, big sinnin', all for the money
Some kill, some squeal, all for the money
Most ain't even real but we still call them homies
Now what the fuck is that fake love, fake thugs all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall, while I come up again
Outlaw never surrender is the call when the day is comin'
But this nigga get to running for my click get to gunnin
Str8 in the mist of all this stress and pain
We're trying to get a hold of the game
Living that good life
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin' motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I gets deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced witha mirage
Breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...
So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
We must be based on nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shakin
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitches planned it
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin your soul
You know, the way the games gettin' sold
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearing my throat
I got my mind made up, come on...
Get in get in too
Let it ride... tonight's tha night
Well I comes through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fuckin' sac won't collapse
Cause nowaday's, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin' bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like Sam Time
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin'
Why is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, stickin up Jews wit German lugers
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggaz best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast
Aiyyo, lyrical gas spittin' tha criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on ya whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, tha dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from tha rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold ya nose and blow out till ya ears pop
Since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Coly
Guess who's back?
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press, wreck on your tech, here we go, set pass the Moet
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin' to rob me
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceivin those we, believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, till there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound deaf
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, Hi, and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test... of givin'
But be thankful that you're livin'... blessed
Guess who's back, comin' back with the track supplied
By Special Ed and Ak, comin' right and exact
I'm fightin it back, now snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back
Tupac is ... back!
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
One minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin dicks, to makin' hits, bustin' flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, 'cause they hate my black take
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin' to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, why me?
No lie, nuckas cried when they try me
Givin' up the roughness, justice
I'ma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back? No longer trapped
'Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick, guess who's back?
Makaveli in this, Killuminati, all through your body
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me, eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggaz coming for me, and my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killing fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go
Deep inside the solitary mind of a madman who screams
In the dark evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggaz is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust
It's just as well Hail Mary
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers, never realize
The precious time the bitch niggaz is wastin', institutionalized
I lived my life a product, made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we ballin'
Catch me Father please, 'cause I'm fallin', in the liquor store
That's the Hennessey I hear ya callin', can I get some more
Hail till I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nothing to lose, just me and you
On a one way trip to prison, selling drugs
We all wrapped up in this living, life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max, doing they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off of Hennessey and Thai
Chronic, mixed it, now I'm twisted, blisted, and high
Visions of me thug livin' getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
On the regular mashing in a stolen black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds till the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preaching church, I gave you love now you eating dirt
Needing work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
'Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle till dawn
That's when sun came up, it's only one way up
Hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggaz get ya pay and weight up
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
We've been traveling on this weary road
Long time till I be take off this load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
We won't worry everything will come real
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everything will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary

Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers, never realize
The precious time the bitch niggaz is wastin', institutionalized
I lived my life a product, made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we ballin'
Catch me Father please, 'cause I'm fallin', in the liquor store
That's the Hennessey I hear ya callin', can I get some more
Hail till I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nothing to lose, just me and you
On a one way trip to prison, selling drugs
We all wrapped up in this living, life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max, doing they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off of Hennessey and Thai
Chronic, mixed it, now I'm twisted, blisted, and high
Visions of me thug livin' getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
On the regular mashing in a stolen black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds till the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preaching church, I gave you love now you eating dirt
Needing work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
'Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle till dawn
That's when sun came up, it's only one way up
Hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggaz get ya pay and weight up
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
We've been traveling on this weary road
Long time till I be take off this load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
We won't worry everything will come real
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everything will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la

Kiss me every time you see me step inside a room

Plus I love ya so I know your gonna make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine

To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God knowing you'll get scarred though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's mama made her my wife now
I'm trying hard y'all
Maybe in time, I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of together and forever we rise
If it would help our child grow then together we die
Why, question my love? It's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone

From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
When I deliver
Criminal lyrics
From a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Mackaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
Like a south paw you get let
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men
The Heartz of Men
My lyrical verse with so much pain
That to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us
It gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And five-o, get your lights on, fight long
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight
So we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'G' to this till the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if ya let me
I'll Muthafuck ya
If ya do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men
In The Heartz of Men
In The Heartz of Men
To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear
My pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year
Like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a Don
If niggas is having problems
Smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back,
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
Scar'd up
But still flowing
Energized and still going
Uh, can it be fate
That makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass coward 'cause they evil and fake
What will it take?
Give me that bass line
I'm feeling bombed
Deathrow baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent
'Cause I've been sent
The heartz of men
Ah, Suge what I tell you nigga,
When I come out of jail what was I gonna do

Heaven ain't hard to find
Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information, alleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smiling through your frown
I'm askin' Baby Boo are you down?
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation
Mr. I get around
My temptation got me dripping wet
Perspiration
I'm activated by the moves you making
Baby why you faking? strip naked get the love making
See it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wanting, never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what I'm missing
Stop with the beeper, baby Listen,
I know you're grown, but pay attention
Let me hypnotize you with my tongue kissin'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believing in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby you're moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug?
And have you ever made love with candles and bubbles sippin' in the tub
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This Thug Passion
Help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alizé
Come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends
Perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life
Baby and you'll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven Ain't Hard to Find
Heaven ain't hard to find
You think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you
Been talking since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact, I wink and you respond back
Look at me
What's all that ? Huh
It's like the closer you get, Baby the quicker I'm speaking
I gotta fly down to Cabo, lets kick it this weekend
I'm sipping Hennessey and coke
Tho' addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh god help me identify my truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion who would have thought
Come holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends
I can soup you in my Benz
We'll ride
I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin
Until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind baby
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
Oh, you tink life is yours?
Life ain't na somethin' you can rap with
Ooh come na ordinary game
Da game na somethin' you can rap with
Me's a player you know?
I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars, every time seen?
Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just tryin' to make a livin'
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin they riches on skanless bail
Who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass, playa-hatin' but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin' no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin through my pager, know me
Don't have no homies 'cause they jealous, I hustle solo
'Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas, listen
Ain't nothin' poppin' 'bout no work, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough
Heavy in the game
Who da bumba claat him a come try take mine?
Ooh, me see you rushin up
I throw 'I'm blood claat P.M. to A.M.
All, all da bumba come ya take dis ting
For ya take dis ting for joke?
Oh! Dat's right
Well lemme shoot some of this how heavy type of stuff...
Certain wanna stick to the game, yousea trick to the game
Waitin upon your turn, so when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, be twistin and takin' it
Puttin' they sack down, then puttin' they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Be yo' own, meanin' buy yo' own dope
Cause that front is punk, somethin' I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin and robbin, despisin your homie
Ain't healthy, endin up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewin somethin' major
So what I reap is boss -- that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young gangsta livin' residential
To a, young gangsta workin presidential
Me boy Tu-pac ALWAYS look good
You know that's true 'I'm look good every time
Ooh, war? Step up
Can yi know I'm servin' up blood claat
Playin' yi games
Ooh, we take game, we WON
Any by now, all, yi haffa forget fi we WON
Everytime
I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doin' dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustlin since junior high
No time for askin why, gettin' high, gettin' mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five sales
Cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these people I despise -- them loud talkin' cowards
Shootin guns into crowds, jeapordizin lives
Shoot 'em right between them thugz eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin' to make the news, people confused
Quit tryin' to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself, go with the grain
And come the riches and the girls and the fame
Heavy in the game
Boy, ya nah bitch!
Major that's true we look good every time
When we at Beers Diamond
And Tupac drives vintage car
And fi dem frame dem look good, oh no?
This whole world ya call on
Gonna mass on a face
For any, section of bumba ras claat, oh!
Flush it! ... Oh!
Nobody wan come test me y'know
True dem we a drive pretty car
Wanna no part of any ting
And now you wan come drown a gun
But ya see we know, you haffa show 'I'm MAXIMUM respect
For when a blood claat run or when a pussy walk up
We look good every time
Nuff dollars, DOLLARS
Y'know about dollars dem right?
But we nah talk no shit
We haffa walk de walk for we a talk, see it?
Cause action, action speak louder dan words
You know da record!
Don't blood claat ting at ALL
Get on yo' knees nigga
Get on yo' knees and pray
Huh, increase the doses, bustin' whoever closest
Thug livin', hell or prison, never losin my focus
I'm makin' money moves mandatory
In a discussion my past records tell a story
Picture niggaz we rushin and still bustin'
Till the cops come runnin', duck in abandoned buildings
Ditchin my gun, homeboy the motherfuckin villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legitless
So I laugh till I'm cryin, when the law come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga miss me, why plant seeds
In a dirty bitch, waitin to trick me, not the life for me
Livin' carefree, till I'm buried - and if they dare me
I'm bustin' on niggaz until they scurry, I'm clearly
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Sellin dope to all the fiends, at times I wanna cry
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin' if this game'll last, feelin' ashamed
Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin my soul?
Got tired of small time livin', niggaz tellin' me no
I got MINE, FUCK THEM OTHER SUCKERS, that's the mentality
Jealous-ass bustaz, make it hell for a hustla
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it hell 4 a hustler
Now in these last days and times I takes mines so serious
Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If I fail, then I suffer, bein broke is hell 4 a hustler
So I stay strugglin and jugglin with all the might I can muster
Since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in
One's five's and ten's was funny money
So I sets my sights bigger, four figures or mo'
Real nigga fo' sho', out in the cold for dough
What you thought? War is war, lost homies in plenty battles
Last two years shed plenty tears, and I'll send plenty at you
Let me catch you slippin, you soft niggaz is outta here
In case you forgot, we on the same shit that got us here
Yo, to every step I take, every foul I make
Every jail I break, every mill' I ate
Head to head, whoever hustle hardest
On the block duckin charges, nigga fuck the sergeant
He got a job, all my bottles got a pinch of coke
Listen tho' I'm missin' dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell naw, dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words
For all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as fuck son
Dyin' luck none supply us with much guns
I buck one, just to let you know that I can touch ya
Slangin cracks or raps, still hell 4 a hustler
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it hell 4 a hustler
No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef till I burn
Censor me and void your kids from the lessons I've learned
And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social
Niggaz shakin like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em
Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu
Niggaz do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin' for my dogs in the mornin
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? Gettin' blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walkin' close to my third, I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustaz
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell 4 a hustler
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it hell 4 a hustler
This is how we ride
Not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild till they all die
This is how we ride
Not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild
Until they all die, Outlaw
The Black Jesuz guide us through this
Weary weary weary weary
Only God can save us
Nuttin but boss players
Outlawz and thugs
Major! Hell motherfuckin yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Coolin, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellrazor...
Born thuggin'
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned
Not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons
A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin
I was ganked for sexin
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin' class
And I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
Mobbin through the overpass laughin'
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger in the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
And mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin' paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark till I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin' richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin' major, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor
Dear Lord can ya feel me
Stress gettin' major, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin'
Mama raised a hellrazor, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggaz
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies restin in the early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin' else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin' Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin' but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin' triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin' better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin' blunts
Gettin' drunk off that Tanqueray gin
Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin' pen
Mama raised a hellrazor, uh, yeah
C'mon, uh, mama raised a hellrazor
Uh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin' major
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, I cause shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high till they bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin' 'Tasha
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, Thug nigga
Stressin like a motherfuckin drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die

Now let me tell 'em who I be
Big ballin ass nigga named Trice
Now I was born in Detroit on the side that's west
Troubled child, commin up I had to ride I guess
Tried to apply myself, but niggas was ballin
My momma couldn't tell me shit, the streets was callin
I was often involved with niggaz breakin the law
I look back Pac nigga, we was bankin off raw
P Funk, got it pumpin, he had the connects
Through the sack to us little niggaz workin the set
And if you got it you getting wet, nigga bet on that
Don't come around hurr on that floss shit

She's so fine and she love Henn too
After a couple of shots she said, I could do what I wanna do
Till the break of dawn, gettin' it on, Hennessey
For the people partyin, till the mornin light
We keep on sippin, and sippin, and sippin
I speak
For all my niggaz livin' in the rush
Slow it down just a notch baby
It's goin' be all right, it's goin' be all right
Life in High Speed
Fuck the punishment, tie weed
I gonna buy me a gun
Fuck doin' time
I live life High Speed
Slightly disillusioned by weed
I breed thug muthafuckas even worse than me
When I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly, on me
My army, niggaz deceive swiftly
Look at you now, why you wanna hang out?
I pull the hammer back
Strike wit' a cannon and blow your muthafuckin' back out
They blast but I'm still standin'
Slightly scarred deep
Questions for the lord, why he don't like me, guard my soul
Though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb bomb less it's without protection for the boss
Rollin' in my double, raw, rugged, and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
And my crew, who could should be mistaken for Jews
We all about our past, blast if he break the rules
Fools done snitched for the D.A., be heaven sent
Switched like a stone-bitch, turned straight severed then, why?
Then they wonder why niggaz die
Put your family in danger just to get high
Now, what the hell can we get from jail?
More tricks for the crime rate, this is hell
Bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jailhouse
Open your safe count and take all your mail out
Whatever happens happens
Whoever falls dies
We fresh out of time, livin' blind, so we all ride
In times like these, chronic and tie weed
Puffin' through these High Speedz
And people say
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Verbal assassin, I hit the corner fast, blastin'
I plan to stretch your chest plate back like elastic
No need to push me to slippin'
I love beef, like pussy and pistols
For all you pussies that's soft as tissue
I ride plottin' like the fall guy out the roof
Bustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof
Gettin' your neck joints low to verdict wit' mine
Get that ass attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind
Grab your shots', callin'
Catchin niggaz while they snorin'
Kickin' his door in
And get your whole fucking' family a' mournin'
Plus all you itchy-bitchy types can't touch me
Frontin' like your hard
I'll play your fuckin' yard like a trussel
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
At times, I look through times wit' so much anger
Wonderin' why it keeps on passin' bringin' me the danger
No singal hard time is a good one
At times I'm amazed
Now what the mutha fuck a hood done
What we do to get paid
All day, for the almighty, dollar
Don't even bother to holla
We all destined to be swallowed
By the same thing we lust for
Threw away our morals in bags of dust, more
Niggaz is dying tomorrow
We, bet on all time
Nigga the clocks tickin'
Approachin' is the day you only know your glocks spittin'
Cops sittin', politicians passin' laws you ain't knowin'
Soon that money goin' be illegal when you got it
Keep your dough up
But I ain't goin' tell you, what?, to stop chasin' paper
Man, I'm just like y'all, I worry 'bout that shit later
Put the metal to the pedal, slash up nigga, blaze
Let's get blowed out High Speed till the end of my dayz
Now my people say
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
For my niggaz on the WestSide and the EastSide

From Compton to Jersey
Gettin' it real hard
From Atlanta, Georgia to Utah

Pictures of a young brother buried
Was it me
The Weed
Or this life I lead
If daytime is for suckas then tonight we breathe
Out for all that
Knowing that this world brings drawbacks
Look how they shiver
Once I deliver these war raps
Meet me at the cemetery dressed in black
Tonight we
Honor the dead, those who won't be back
So if I die do the same for me
Shed no tears
An Outlaw, thug living in this game for years
Why worry?
Hope to God
Get me high when I'm buried
Knowing deep inside only a few love me
Don't rush me through the gates of heaven
Let me picture for a while
How I lived from my days as a child
I wonder now
How do we outlast, always get cash
Stay strong if we all mash
Hold Your head
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Too many young black brothers are dying
Living fast, too fast
These felonies be like prophecies
Begging me to stop
'Cause these lawyers getting money every time they knock us
Snatch they pockets lyrically
Suckas flee when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli
Had the rap game closed
Expose foes, with my hocus pocus flows, they froze
Now suckas idolize my chosen blows
And more money, mean litigating
More playa hating
Got a cell at the Penn for me waiting
Is this my fate?
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinking
We fall back
Never had too much Tequilla drinking
We all that
Make them understand me
You lie to say my posse
Everyone roll with me is family
'Cause every bodies got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision
This life we living
Got us all meeting up in prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog
Written in blood
Saying Please show a young playa love
Hold your head
Hold it
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Too many young black brothers are dying
Living fast, too fast
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Too many young black brothers are dying
Living fast, too fast
God bless the child that can hold is own
Indeed
Enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last
To my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Currency means nothing if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days
Trouble comes naturally
Running from authorities
Till they capture me
And my aim, is to spread more smiles than tears
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe mama had it all right
Rest your head
Straight conversation all night
Bless the dead
To the homies that I used to have
That no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus, nobody knows my soul
Watching time pass
Through the glass of my drop top Rolls
Hold your head
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Too many young black brothers are dying
Living fast, too fast
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Too many young black brothers are dying
Living fast, too fast
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
Hold on...
Yeah it's gonna be all right, don't trip baby
It'll get better...
Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to 'em bet
It's all good, uh
I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
Pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, 'cause they chasin me down
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you 'cause
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin' gettin' high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin' to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
I know them ain't tears comin' down your face
Wipe your eyes
In this world
Only the strong survive y'know
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
Welfare
AIDS, earthquakes
Muggings, carjackings
Yeah we got problems
But believe me when I tell you
Things always get better
God don't like ugly
And God don't like no quitters
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
God bless the child that can hold his own
Y'know?
You got to stand strong
And when these bustas try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face
Tell 'em hold on, and be strong
The game don't stop
Hmmm
This here is black main
If you don't never leave nothin', learn one thing
It don't stop, till the casket drop
Thug, for Life... feel me?
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin, hold on
I'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic
They try to playa hate
But they can't fade us tho'
We be mobbin' through tha neighborhood
Yeah
This goes out to you playa
You know... you know who you are
Gotta be careful, can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me nigga
Ya better Holla at me
Are you confused?
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside tha shoes
Of a nigga who don't have a thing to lose
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
How could you do me like that?
I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket
Made you a man again
And now you let tha fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape
It's a fools fate
Without your word
You're a shell of a man
I lost respect for you nigga
We can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do?
If it was up to you
I'd be dead now
I let tha world know nigga you a coward
You could never be live
Until you die
See tha mothafucken bitch in your eye
Type of Nigga, that let tha evil of tha money trap me
When ya see me nigga
Can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me nigga
Ya better Holla at me
So I gotta be careful, can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me nigga
Ya better holla at me
Courious
Spittin' lyrics
On tha verge of furious
I'm addicted to currency
Nigga that's why we're doin' this
I got shot up, I surprised tha niggas tha way I got up
And then
I hit the studio
It's time to blow tha block up
No hesitation
This information got you contemplatin'
Heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
Break him
And let him see tha face of a mental patient
It's a celebration
Of my criminal elevation
With the participation
I want members across tha fifty states
To keep tha nation anticipatin' until we break
Will I be great, is it my fate?
To live tha life of luxury
Some niggas bought my tapes
So much jelousy it scares me
So be prepared
Cause only tha strong survive
Probably never knew tha way it feels to die
So you figure fuck with me
I give that ass a try
Nigga, Holla at me
I shoulda saw tha signs
I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
So many brothas framed in this dirty game
It's a shame
So much pressure on my brain
While she blame me
Secrets in tha dark
Only her and I know
Now I'm sitten' in tha state pen
Doin' time for slow
Guess she made a bad decision
That got me livin'
Just like an animal
I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin'
Cause
Hell have no fury like a woman scorn
A cemetery full of mothafuckers got not knowin'
Picture my prophecy
Tha cops are attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from tha coppers
But never let'em stop me
'Cause I'm a soulja
Hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies
Of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid
Trust
A no no
Love is a mystery
Fuck tha po po,
Holla at me...
So when you see me nigga
You better holla at me...
They try to playa hate
But they can't fade us tho'
We be mobbin' through tha neighborhood
Yeah
Aww yeah, uh, uh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah!
Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin hearts and jackin marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin' down the barrel of my nine, get up
'Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got him in a smash, blast
How long will it last till the po' gettin' mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin' but be thankful that you're livin', blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me -
Hard! ... Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.
Tellin' you to hear it..
Hard! ... Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.
Tellin' you to hear it..

Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me - PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin' it up
One way or another you'll be givin' it up, huh
I guess 'cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin' dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin' my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin' in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin till other brothers bubble -
Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.
Tellin' you to hear it..
Hard! ... Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
Representin, never give up, on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -
Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.
Tellin' you to hear it..
Hard! ... Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel - P.E.

Oh shit, caught that nigga alone
Ain't that a bitch
Hey, uh, this one here is, uh
For them niggaz that be Johnny Dangerous when they be fuckin' fifty deep
But they be fuckin' cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin' about
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Now
Now every time I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
Out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga it's a god damn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
How long will it last, nigga don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggaz aimin at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck motherfuckers I'm loc
They all duckin when my gun smoke
Cause you ain't shit without your homeboys
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggaz is punks
Without your homeboys, you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggaz is punks, you ain't shit without your homeboys
Nigga, punk ass motherfucker
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Throw your hands up you little trick, coward motherfucker
Like Yak said, how the fuck you gonna shoot me rocks
When you got the Outlaw 'Pac shittin ya box
You was lookin' real weak walkin' down the street
Now a nigga thirty deep, oh you wanna beef
Talk cheap, shoot a nigga the fair one
Your homies like fuck it, what's this you the only scared one
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw nigga played you out
We could have took it to the firfth I would I have laid you out
Niggaz be actin' all different when they dogs come around
Watch 'em act like bitches when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget
Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin' these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys, homeboy
You ain't shit without your homeboys
My thug niggaz, I love niggaz
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
My homeboys, the only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggaz to death, we ain't shit without our homeboys
... You know what time it is
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up nigga
Now I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggaz is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggaz cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers they all die
Been tryin' to make a million, by hustlin since my adolescense
From crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggaz fiendin, I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggaz be together
Ain't shit without your homeboys
Thug niggaz I love niggaz
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys, the only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggaz to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
Love my niggaz to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
Love you niggaz to death
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it, yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk, am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alizé, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, you'se a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggaz top that
They wanna censor me, they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss, nigga tell me how U want it
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Sky Pager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
Ha ha ha, but I'mma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it, how do U want it?
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alizé, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, you'se a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggaz top that
They wanna censor me, they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss, nigga tell me how U want it
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Sky Pager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
Ha ha ha, but I'mma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it, how do U want it?
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it, yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?

How long will they mourn me
Yeah! This for my nigga Kato
It's still on nigga
Thug Life, Thugs for life
Ha Ha yeah, how long will they mourn me
Yeah nigga
2Pac in this muthafucka
All my homies drinking liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide
But I can't cry
Instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
Retaliate and pull a 187
Do real niggas get to go to heaven?
How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'G'
Bitch don't wanna die
Then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me though, I'm trying hard to make amends
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me?
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
How long will they mourn me
Every muthafuckin' day homie
You stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigga you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'lac
And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day
Ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie
How long will they mourn me?
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
Damn a nigga tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of putting in work
I'm tired of cryin while watching my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace
How long will they mourn me?
Ya know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy
It's fuckin' with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone
How long will ya mourn me?
Yeah!
I wish it would have been another
Yeah, how long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my bother
I wish it would have been another
Yeah! How long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my brother
How long will ya mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will ya mourn my brother

Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggaz to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, nahmean?
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin up shit out there, kickin up dust
Givin' a motherfuck, heheheheheh
Yeah, niggaz
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roll
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the tip, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshitin
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that'd
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin, playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin, knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminsce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin 'n' grindin wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', Hell, I know one day I'll be back
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha
Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nuttin to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the Luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Till God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggaz just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha
Iiiiiiiii,
I ain't, mad at cha, no
I ain't mad at chaaaaahhhhhhhhmm
Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggaz to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Iiiiiiiii,
I ain't, mad at cha, no
I ain't mad at chaaaaahhhhhhhhmm
I just don't give a fuck
They done push me to the limit I'm all in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cops bragging about the nigga he's baggin
I see no justice
All I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast
Then watchin the hearse pass
Just another day in the life 'G'
Gotta step lightly 'cause cops tried to snipe me
The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man
But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my cheque
I get more respect from the mutha-fuckin' dope man
The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hos
They got dough but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down
Just can't understand why we getting respect now
Mama told me they're be days like this
But I'm pissed cause it stays like this
And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait
Gimme a break
How much shit can a nigga take
I ain't goin' nowhere, no how
What you wanna throw down
Better bring your guns pal
'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailin' hate I bail and spray with an A-K
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
From the mutha-fuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a phychopath
The truth didn't last
Before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who'd do yah figure!?
A mutha-fuckin' night nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up
I had enough and I just don't give a fuck
Niggas!, isn't just the blacks
Also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
Tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
They say niggas like to do niggas
Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
A street walkin' nigga and a beat walkin' nigga with a badge
I had to shoot ya and the pass for the blast take his cash
And bash his head in dump him at the dead in
And that's just his luck
Cause a nigga like me
Don't really give a fuck
Walked in the store what's everybody staring at
They act like they never seen a muthafucka wearing black
Following a nigga and shit
Ain't this a bitch
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere
But where?
Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need?
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if knows that my income is more than
His pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your jive ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as casanova
And count another quick meal
I'm getting paid for my traid but its still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Useta come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up
They know we fed up
But we they just don't give a fuck
They just don't give a fuck
I gotta give my fuck offs
Fuck you to the San Fransisco police department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff department
Fuck you to the F.B.I
Fuck you to the C.I.A
Fuck you to the B-u-s-h
Fuck you to the AmeriKKKa
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudiced motherfuckers
And fuck yah
Fuck Y'all
Punk, gay, sensitive, little-dicked bastards
2paclypse mutha fuckin' know
Y'all can kiss my ass and suck my dick
And my uncle Tommy's balls
Fuck Y'all
Punks, punks, punks, punks, punks
Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around
Well I've been hanging sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around
2Pacalypse now don't stop for hoes, I get around
Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please
Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips 'cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone till the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around
Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets

It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around
I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit 'cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault papa didn't plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Down the block, got a glock, and I clock grip
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and
Why must I sock a fella, just to live large like Rockefeller
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
God damn it's a motherfuckin riot
Black people only hate police so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right but it's long overdue
We can't have peace till the niggaz get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more
It's been goin' on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, when will the violence cease?
When your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street
Niggaz had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Word to God 'cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them, cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggaz burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
Predicted the shit, in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggaz, felt good
In the hood bein around the niggaz, yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro
Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
Mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz
I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Just think, if niggaz decide to retaliate
I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit 'cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class

Just think, if niggaz decide to retaliate
Get money nigga
Yeah - aw yeah
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers
That get up every motherfuckin mornin and put they work in
I see you - I see you boy
I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked
Niggaz laughed, till the first motherfucker got blas-ted
I put the nigga in his casket
And now they covering the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck when it counts
Tryin' to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin' ghost on the five-oh, fuck them hoes
Got a forty-five screamin out surviv-al
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some ya-yo
And holla five-oj when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen, I'm hittin fences
NARC's on a nigga back missin' me by inches
And they say how do you survive, weighin one-fifty-five
In the city where the little niggaz die
Tell mama don't cry, cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'
Kinda boomin round the way, think today I make a killin'
Dressin down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops
Gettin' high I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin' paid today, ha hah ha
I live Thug Life and let the money come to me
'Cause they can never take the game from a young G
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
At point blank range 'cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin the dice
Now roll 'em if you can't stand pain better hold em
Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G
Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock till his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me 'cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling whooped tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a hoe and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging till the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug till six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a liar
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to dig me a whole of a ??
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millometer
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
They say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffin weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facing
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the player hating tricks, while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But y'all some hoes, the game should be sewed
I'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me
Addicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
I'm ducking the cop, I hit the weed as I'm clutching my glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block, what if I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
Polishing pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
When I get to popping niggas is dropping then they done
Calling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse
He got it by killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method, whenever stepping keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales
Picture perfection pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversatin' like they still here, if I die tonight
Pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for Thug Living when I die
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto for Thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a player
Overdose of a dick, while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whipping these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me nigga I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading murdered to death, my last breath
Take a look picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand, if I die tonight
? Like a mother-fuckin' Jew throws cash
Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Sayin' we cousins, knowin' that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope gaaaane, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call
It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang cane on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' cane
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rappin' tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
'Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call
Well it's ninety-one and I'm livin' kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell pal
But life makin' records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected it's hectic it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take, my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call
Tell me I will be there
Tell me I will be there
Tell me I will be there
Yeah...
If there be pain
All you have to do is call on me
All you have to do is call on me
And before you hang up the phone
You will no longer be alone
Together we can never fall
Because our love will conquer all
If there be pain
Reach out for a helping hand
If there be pain
And I shall hold you wherever I am
Every breath I breathe will be into you
For without you here my joy is through
My life was lived through falling rain
So call on me if there be pain
If there be pain
Every breath I breathe will be into you
For without you here my joy is through
My life was lived through falling rain
So call on me if there be pain
If you need me
If you need me
Eternally Thug Nigga Hilfigger made by Tommy
So when I speak hope to reach my ?? Mamis
Or come to Papi I love it when its wet and sloppy
In and out the mouth piece till I cum no one can stop me
My bump and grind will do you every time
Come get a blast of this Thug passion and blow your mind
Hey, throw up your legs, wrap those shits around my back

Walkin' down 125 while I'm peepin out hotties

It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

Keepin' it real
I take a shot of Henessey now I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggaz on the, other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change
And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain
Arguements with my Boo is true
I spend mo' time with my niggaz than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game
I'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame
I'll be hustling to make a mill-ion, lord knows
Ain't no love for us ghetto children, so we cold
Rag top slowin down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass, uh
It ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin' Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin like I'm hopeless, I can't cope
Me and the homies smokin' roaches, 'cause we broke
Late night hangin' out till the sunrise gettin' high
Watchin the cops roll by
It ain't easy... that's right
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free
I can't sleep niggaz plottin on to kill me while I'm dreamin'
Wake up sweaty and screamin, 'cause I can hear them suckers schemin
Probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizin
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why this the way it is, even now
Lookin' out for these killer kids, 'cause they wild
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representin
Doin' twenty to life in San Quentin
Gettin' calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nuttin nice
Yo 'Pac, do something righteous witcha life
And even thou you innocent you still a nigga, so they figure
Rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'm hold ya down and holla Thug Life, lickin' shots
Till I see my niggaz free on the block
But no it ain't easy, hahahah
Till I see my niggaz free, on the block, oh
It ain't easy
Lately been reminiscin
Bout Peppermint Schnapps in Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while D-Boys slang rocks
It's the project kid without a conscience, I'm havin' dreams
Of hearin screams at my concerts, me all my childhood peers
Through the years tryin' to stack a little green
I was only seventeen, when I started servin' fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dollar
So my apoli', cause these hard times make me wanna holler
Will I live to see tomorrow, am I fallin' off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all
Ain't nobody down with me I'm thuggin', I can't go home
Cause muh-fuckers think I'm buggin, so now I'm in
This high powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail, what
Do I do in these county blues
Gettin' battered and bruised by the you know who
And these fakes get to shakin when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin' in this, livin' hell, listenin to niggaz yell
Tryin' to torture 'em to tell, I'm gettin' mail
But ain't nobody sayin' much, the same old nuts
Is makin' bucks while these sluts is gettin' fucked
They violated my probation, and it seems
I'll be goin' on a long vacation, meanwhile
It ain't easy
No it ain't easy
Outlaw

Her moms let her do what she please it seemed no one loved her
Her eyes shined love a diamond in the rough
The kind that you can love
Not yet touched
With so much, potential
Youngster, let me got your mental
Into a place, with the sourness of pain you'll never taste
By God's grace you were born with that face
Nothing but pure beauty
So for an eternity I feel it's my duty
To be a souljah, oh yeah baby I got plans to mold ya
And in the coldest nights is when I hold ya
Like I'm supposed to
As we roll closer
I'll take your hand gladly
Anything ya need ask me
Spoil my baby girl just like daddy
You alleviate the stress spending time with you, I feel blessed
When you gone feel the pain so strong
Deep in my chest
When I got arrested
Came so close to going to jail
Throwin' blows at the po-pos breakin they nails
Screamin loud goin' all out
Damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house
Watchin the kids, through the whole bid
In tha V-I
I seen ya daily
When my fake homies try ta fuck you
You run and tell me
That's why I stay committed
I thank God every time I hit it
Hoping you'll forgive me, for the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world
We untouchable
Screamin like ya dying every time I'm fuckin' you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity
And through the years
I know ya gave me your heart
Plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up
You still love me
Come to me anytime you want
Dedicate slow jams on the radio
Oh I

Never leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy
Boo would ya, die for me?
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin' high
With mean sounds tougher than bristles
Fool when you cry I'll be ya tissue
Back in the county writing letters how I miss you
Giving you credit, apologetic how I dis you
Get you for thinkin' like a minor and on a level of one
And sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dine ya
Lace ya for total vigina and still
We right behind ya tru
Life just me and you no tellin' what we could do
Getting high between the sheets
Make the shit right here discrete
Putting hickies on ya belly while we fucking on the beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy
Shorty I lend my hand out to help ya
Lost soul looking for shelter
On the late night accept it
Treat ya good won't disrespect ya
My age is young
Out of place binge days is done
From a trixy to a missy, you know I raised ya hon
Placed her under my wing
Showed her how we swing
Now she rollin' blunts for a king
One day labeled thug Mrs
The essence of my ghetto sistas
Hugs and kisses
That's just for me to be a father figure
Come to me anytime you want
Dedicate slow jams on the radio
Oh I
Know your happy I can feel ya passion
Looking out for ya just like daddy
Come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close your eyes, and feel the magic
Never leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy
Little somethin' for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corrine
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see em
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter
Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know it's funny when it rains and pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
They say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
There ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up
And uh
To all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin' down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't fall down this week
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please... you got to keep your head up
Little somethin' for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corrine
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare

Please... you got to keep your head up
Let it be prophesized; niggaz'll die because ya crew's goon
Around the way niggaz get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones
Niggaz is bold and they choose to roll
I kill 'em all, watch now nigga truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
Niggaz dyin' by my 30-yard, brains'll splatter
Wonder why these niggaz cross me
I'm certified crazy, so sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, every time I ride it's for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga 'cause I'm comin' back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation runnin' from drug cases
Lookin' at my congregation so full of thug faces
Momma gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin' niggaz watch they every step
Label me a threat
And I ain't even got started with this shit yet
Thug style baby, hands on my pistol, listen I'm a ridah
Every nigga breathin pay attention
Bout to show you motherfuckers how it feel, to drop a body
The simple gun to my lifestyle, Killuminati
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
After the fire comes the rain, after pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin again
Till I make it yo; my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to, bitches that scary, get too near me we rushin
Visions of over-packed prisons, fiends and niggaz thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heater ammunition it cranks, psssh
Move without a sound, as we slide down, pistols in place
They got me fiendin for currency, the money be callin
It's like I'm - dreamin', see in season me ballin
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked fo'-five, snatchin niggaz pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
God damn now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati
I spend most of my time bankin niggaz
Because they hate a nigga, comin' across fake niggaz
But we made niggaz, old school and I'm thinkin'
Y'all some bitch made niggaz and you steadily sinkin
O-U-T, L-A-W-Z ain't nuttin fuckin' with that
We bustin' back comin' back for the stacks
Laugh last cash cash, all I want is the paper
Givin' them fuckers tool whips, I rule haters
Y'all can't fade us, we kill steal and peal quickly
The boss niggaz, definitely, put it down strictly
E.D.I. Amin, until the law come for me
Kill 'em all for shortie, ninety-nine Killuminati
They got me thinkin' strugglin and hustling's my only fate
Toppin grams on the kichen plate, tryin' to keep that money straight
Times is rollin' three up these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed it hurts
Got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
Preocuppied by the greed, in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend, or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's simpin naughty thangs
Real as these tatt's on my body, and it's Killuminati
Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain
Hold it down, hold it down
Makaveli up in this bitch, worldwide mash, Westside
Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain
The question we ask, do you know what time it is?
Hold it down, hold it down
You know what type of shit we be
Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain
You want that hip-hop real

Hold it down, hold it down

Outlawz...
Roll me a cigarette dog
They got me feeling crazier than a motherfucker
I got Bad Azz in this motha fucka
Puffin on Lye
Hoping that it gets me high
They got a nigga goin' crazy
Time goes by
Puffin on lye
Hopin that it gets me high
They got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Last year was a hard one
But life goes on
I hold my head against the wall
Learning right from wrong
They say my ghetto instrumental
Detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery
In which they live
Lately, for the outcome, damn I'm reckless
Check it
You don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck living blinded
Hennessy got me feelin' bad
Time to stop drinkin'
Rollin', in my drop top Jag
What's that cops thinkin'?
Sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came along way but still I got so far to go
Dear mama, don't worry
I'm a watch for snakes
Tell Seikywa that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me and I cried for weeks
This is what came out, when I tried to speak
All I heard was
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
One, two, three, four
I see bloods and crips runnin' up in hell
Lookin' for a better way
My brothas and sistas it's time to bail
'Cause even thug niggas pray
Hoping God forgive me
I entered the game, look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent
Casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house
This your land
Your only son done became a man
I'm watchin time fly
I love my people do or die
But I wonder why
We scared to let each other fly
June 1-6 7-1
The day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me nigga get paid
No one can understand me
The black sheep, out-casted from my family
Now packin heat I run the streets
A young runaway live for the day
When we die
I could hear ya say
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
Krazy, Krazy, Krazy
God help me out here
'Cause I'm possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
This money's like a strong prescription drug
It's got me addicted to the pleasure and the pain it's inflicted
Something about the paper with the pictures of the presidents' head
Damn it's like a motherfucking plague that spreads
It's epidemic
Forgotten, forgot, and it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin' money 'cause it's cursed
Makin' money makes a difference day by day
So you gotta stay paid, no doubt
Day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin to live
No matter how hard you try, you see death
You gotta die
Alotta my Peers didn't make it to these years to come
Dear life doing right
Or dear life leaving dumb
Who has the answers?
I wonder
I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me
That there'll be light at the end of the road
Why?
'Cause they don't even know
A million thangs run through my mind
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time
You ain't gotta be in jail
Remember this tune
Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy
Feelin' fucked up in this bitch
Smoke half a ounce to the head.
Drop the top. Indo. Hawaiian. Lansbread. Buddha. All that shit.
I'm fucked up in this motha fucka.
And Hennessy don't help. And Hennessy don't help.
Thug passion in this motha fucka.
Makaveli the Don putting it down to the fullest.
Maximum overload. 3 day theory.
Killuminati to your body, with the impact of a 12 gauge shoty.
Doublized slugs. No love. Straight thugs.
One time for my niggas in the jail cell.
One time for my niggas doin' life in hell.
One time for my niggas in the jail cell.
One time for my niggas doin' life in hell.
One time for my niggas on Death Row.
One time for my niggas livin'... broke.

You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga
But they can't take us alll
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Keeping the smile off their white fakes
I ain't racist but lets trade places
Trace the hate 'n' face it
One nigga teach two niggas
Three teach four niggas
And them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz

Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin
Packed in a suburban, screamin outlaw runin on the curb
They never try me cause right behind me your killer team
I get a word cut the head off a nigga like a guillotine
This Hennessey'll keep me calm though
Sittin' in the back of the club, tradin convo
Livin' like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi, nigga watch me with the chrome nine
All the time drinkin' champagne
Walk through the crowd let the tramps hang
Niggas playa hate but do a damn thing
Picture me doin' eighty down a one way
Stuck in the trunk, caught with gun play
So I gotta keep my eyes open
Gettin' high, wonder why we gotta die smokin'
My alibi, I'm victory
Like them other vile men I'm marked for death
Spendin my nights like it's the last one left
I'm an outlaw
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin' on
Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet submission I'm the last one left
Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin' on
Last to leave until I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher, guess I'm the last one left
I got my back against the wall
Gat chillin' by my balls
Prior to war is rider nigga only five six tall
Napoleon only knows on we outlaws fuck fear
Better strap down to the feelins 'cause we out yeah
Thug passion all up in me
Feelin' like I took some Henne

Last niggas with our tape

Lookin' for niggas that was roofin that shit when I was locked back
Hands on the pump, makem jump when its cocked back

Hey Pac, it's yo boy
Hey man so far I've been listening to your album
And I ain't heard nothing you could kick back and smoke a beady to
You know?
Yeah like that
Some of that mellow shit
Some of that shit that make bitches drink
Make niggaz think
And help you check a fat-ass bank, hahahah
So why don't you kick some of that shit nigga only you know how
Hahahah, feel me?
I'm barely standing and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanours is a small thing
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Running through the street lights 'cause we like
Young nigga get your mob on show 'em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggaz popping, welcome to our casino
Cause you and me know hundred percent like a c-note
Looking for a bitch that's half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some Indo
Tongue-kissing on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm digging I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game tight love fucking bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right
The club be popping so I'm stopping at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try, in the 'Late Night'
Last night... last night changed it all
Last night...
Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain till my socks is damp
Ain't nothing like being a thug when I can just
Sit on the Row of Death straight knowing that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosing on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent the town
Last night was popping like like cocked glocks with hollow-tip rounds
From booty calls to bail sheets
It ain't no telling if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and the bitches up in the late night
Probably involves me coming up with just to see another day
Might, If me who ride the bullet in these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who trying to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage spitting my shells in a gauge
Deadly as aids niggaz getting crossed like a maze
Now picture me living my life like a king maybe one day
Chilling I'm living Monday through Sunday
Bringing the gun play for all these beefs and battles
When we collide I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night
Money and multiple gunshots are shown large amps are blown
Niggaz in low-lows, pursuing more hoes, then go home
The life of a California star
And when you see me in the drop-top Jag how many niggaz wanna be me?
Game is automatic mandatory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
'Cause when you gettin' some riches watch for dumb bitches
They have you labeled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin'
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
'Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated ride whenever needed
For my niggaz up in Clinton getting weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and ducking
Slapping niggaz known for telling bitches fuck-it in the late night
Yo Quiero
Yo Quiero Cojer
Yo Quiero Cojer
I'll let your ass have it
Take care of business
Oh for real
Ghetto chorette
Now you been acting like you want it for a long time
All up in a nigga face, giving me them strong vibes
Look in my eyes and you'll find peace

Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
As you pass bye wink in my eye, freshly scented
What's the haps baby? Come get with me and perhaps lady
You can help me multiply my stacks baby
Through with that - scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitating actin' like yo' shit don't stink
Check out my - diamonds bitch everyone gonna blink
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreaming motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my resume, sipping on Cristal and Alize
Smoking on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't like tricking but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand no sneaker-wearing nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree, re-breed me, they're so cheap
Putting bitch-made busters to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called comp, who the man?
While I'm tugging on yo' main bitch head
Understand this, ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z
He broke and I smoke daily baby let's be friends
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass, it was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass got me checkin' for you hardcore; staring and watching
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, we possess bubonics
Far from a crush I wanna bust your guts and touch
Everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweating like a fat girl goin' for mine
Just a skinny nigga fucking like she stole my mind
Back in time I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre, tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs now, let me in between as friends
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks
I got 'em ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame? My dick or the game?
Bet I scream WESTSIDE when I came
Scream my name, cause baby it's delicious got a weak spot
For pretty bitches up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby let your back get into it
Make it fluid, in and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high! Let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride!
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player hating niggaz 'cause they cock block
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good - in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizing, seeing you naked
It's the fuck song, so check my record
And let's be friends
Where my people at? Show me where my people at
Where my people at? Show me where my people at
All my niggaz now, just my niggaz come
Where my niggaz at? Just my niggaz now
Be friends, tell me where my niggaz at

Why you trickin on them other hoes?
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
To my unborn child
To my unborn, child
In case I don't make it
Just remember daddy loves you
I did everything I could to make things good for you
So don't worry about it
To my unborn
You know daddy loves you
Now ever since my birth, I been cursed since I was born to wile
In case I never get to holler at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison
Blessed to be still living
Trying to earn every penny that I'm gettin'
Reminiscin' to the beginning of my mission
When I was conceived and became to be in this position
My mama was a panther, loud
Single parent but she growled
When she witnessed baby boy ripping wild
I went to school but I dropped out
And left the house cause my momma says I'm good for nothing
So I'm out, since I only got one life to live
God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again
Or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wanting revenge for the agony they did to me
See my life ain't promised but it sure get better
Hope you understand my love letter
To my unborn child
I'm writing you a letter
This is for my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you
Wanna let you know I feel this way
I think about you every day
I have so much to say
So complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand till we trade places
Tell the world I been guilty to being anxious
Ain't no way in hell, that I could ever be a rapist
It's time to face this, cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot 5 times but I'm still breathing
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
God believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way
Dear mama I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own not a hand out
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace
When I gotta die
On these cold streets
Ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again
To my unborn child
I'm writing you a letter
This is for my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you
Wanna let you know I feel this way
I think about you every day
I have so much to say
Dear Lord can you hear me?
Tell me what to say to my unborn seed
In case I pass away will my child get to feel loved
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs
Cause being black hurts
And even worse if you speak first
Live my life as an outlaw
What could be worse
Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who am I kidding?
I'm a thug till I die
I'm a ride
Maintain, touch base
Eat lunch
In plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a heaven for true thugs
I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not being there
Just know, your daddy was a souljah
Me against the world
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord I'm eternal
Resting in peace
Please take care of all my seeds
And my unborn child
I'm writing you a letter
This is for my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you
Wanna let you know I feel this way
I think about you every day
I have so much to say
Please take care of all my kids
And my unborn child
To my unborn child
This letter goes out to my seeds that I might not get to see
Cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothing but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I
'Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age you'll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I'll see you if there's a ghetto in heaven
If there's a ghetto heaven I'll be there waiting for you
Take care
Run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes there's confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it, all day every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Snakes come a dime a dozen
Work hard
Study
Get your mind right
Uh... dear Mr. President
Whas happenin'?
I'm writin you because, shit is still real fucked up in my neighbourhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin' changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected...
... They ain't came true
Tell me what to do, these niggaz actin' up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
Tell me what to do, these niggaz actin' up in the hood
Send mo' troops...
Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggaz fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin' I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
'Cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
Yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed us
I guess it's 'cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
I ride for Mutulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Oh youse a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
Cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
And young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
Launch it, leave a nigga flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin' pay the day besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin' to drastic measures tryin' to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'fuckers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin' better
But you keep, tellin' us, that it is
While your motherfuckin troops keep killin' our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherfucker
Dear Mr. President, tell us what to do
These niggaz actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggaz lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin and things, squeakin on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Till y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's will freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President
Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
And it ain't gon' get better
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin' up...
Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin in my own blood
Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
Y'all sniffin blow and postin what they hittin fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin' sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
Till then we gonna keep it comin', Mr. President
And I meant every word in my letter to the President
Word motherfuckin life
Fuck this nigga think?

How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
But life goes on...
How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
But life goes on...
As I bail through tha empty halls
Breath stinkin' in my draws
Ring, ring, ring
Quiet y'all
Incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school
He's getting bye
It's time to bury another brotha nobody cry
Life as a baller
Alchol and booty calls
We usta do them as adolecents
Do you recall?
Raised as G's
Loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on tha roof
Let's get smoked out
And blaze with me
2 in tha morning
And we still high assed out
Screamin' 'thug till I die'
Before I passed out
But now that you're gone
I'm in the zone
Thinkin'
'I don't wanna die all alone'
But now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death
I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' ta make it last
I drank a 5th for that ass
When you passed...
Cause life goes on
Yeah nigga
I got tha word as hell
Blew trial and tha judge gave you
25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time
Won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict
That's getten' old
Plus with tha drama
We're lookin' out for your babies mama
Taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from beatin' on her...
Life in tha hood...
Is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at your party
Me and you
No true a two
While scheming on hits
And gettin' tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you buried
Rest nigga
'Cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry
Sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Tho' memories fade
I got your name tated on my arm
So we both ball till my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die
Bury me smilin'
With G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral
Let every rapper rock it
Let tha hoes that I usta know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of Gin
In case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die
We outlaws
Let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
Got police chasen' me
To my niggas from old blocks
From old crews
Niggas that guided me through
Back in tha old school
Pour out some liquor
Have a toast for tha homies
See we both gotta die
But ya chose to go before me
And brothas miss ya while you're gone
You left your nigga on his own
How long we mourn
Life goes on...
Life goes on homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya nigga, trust me
I feel ya
You know what I mean
Last year
We poured out liquor for ya
This year nigga, life goes on
We're gonna clock now
Get money
Evade bitches
Evade tricks
Give players plenty space
And basically just represent for you baby
Next time you see your niggas

'Goddamn, them niggas came up'
That's right baby
Life goes on...
And we up out this bitch
Hey Kato, Mental

And we up out this bitch
Hey Kato, Mental
Y'all niggas make sure it's popin' when we get up there
Don't front.
In the life we live as thugs
Everbody fuckin wit us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin wit my gun in hand
Why explain the game? Niggas ain't listenin
Stuck in positions. If victims can't stand the heat
Then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Have these bustas switchin, lookin at me mean
Itchin, givin suckas plenty space
Have these bitch niggas snitchin
Where are we now? Guns found daily
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me for sellin dope
They backwards, make tracks burst whenever I rap
Attack. Words bein known to explode on contact
Extreme at times. Blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me. Truely effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice. Got a death wish, bitch
Run up, face me and trace wit an infared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin you back. Explode the track to confetti
Unload it. 'Cause niggas ain't ready. The life of an outlaw
Chorus repeats
Code 3. Attack formation. Pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils 'cause they itchin to get you
Mercy to this madman screamin kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire makin all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream
Dope got me hatin fiends. Scheam wit my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives. Come closer. Exhale the fumes
We got memories fadin fast. A slave for cash
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now. How you like it, raw
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws. Never surrender
Death is for a son to stay free. I'm thugged out
Fuck the world 'cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin
Believe in me and you could see the victory
A warrior with jewels. Can you picture me?
Life of an outlaw
Chorus repeats
City under siege. It's like I can't even breathe
I'm from the state of car theives. G, deep from the street
Plenty beef. I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb Deep. This nigga from behind tryin to creep
No halfs wit no straps, jack
It's on to bounce back
And an ounce so fat, they snatch my style ???
Get this grip wit hollows to get cha
Snip wit clippers. Get the picture?
I wrote my life down like a scripture
And I'm still on lost in the land of the lonely
Where ain't nobody holy. A matter of a fact, we unholy
Everybody livin soley for themselves. Too ?? on a land hell
Somebody need me. You know we lost hope and we needin it
Wit the evil it's forever. But it might be low down, scandalouz
Like a tramp is. All for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit. 6 months in advaced to what we plotted
Approved to go on swole and now I got it
Un uh, crack my window. Knowin they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin
Attach a strap under my pillow and a hand like we freakin
Creepin deep into morning. Peepin out the weak
While they yawnin and let my cloud speak for it's self
No doubt. Outlaw. Outta my mind, outta time. You're all blind
Some kind of life of mine Kato don't mind
Findin it funny, matter of fact, 'cause it is
Perhaps finally I look at that true over the years as an outlaw
Eh, Noble
What's up nigga
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah
Would you kill for me?
On my grandmother, nigga
Ah yo
What's up
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now
Watch out
Well now they all say they roaches and parasites
Snakes and all they might
Thug Life break night
Drink till we fist fight
Life or death. But you can't win with a vest
But there won't be no breathing for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark
So chase ???
Hide your stash
Beware foolin marks
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left for PO's belly
And let me bust back to them niggas till they all sweaty
Fucking Lil' Homies
Everybody Ducking
My fucking Lil' Homies
Lil' Homies
Everybody Ducking
Just pay attention, here's a story bout my lil' homey
Str8 thuggin', lil bad young mother fucka, you gotta love him
You can catch him in his G-Ride clutching his glock
Educated on these cold streets
Getting money, making dummies out the police
Ain't no peace for an adolescent nigga to wild to be a thinker
Bud smoking 24-7, everyday drinking
I got my diploma but I never learned shit in school
Mo money, mo bitches, mo murder fool
Always the young niggaz getting in shit
She wouldn't stop to conversate so you called her a bitch
Bustin' on paper thin mother fuckas
Drinkin' gin before you get to sinnin' on them bustas
Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me
Everybody duckin'
My fucking lil' homies
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets
I remember, when we was just a little G
Flirting with death, playing Russian Roulette
Screaming Kill Me!
Hey there young nigga what you smoking on
Mad at the world cause you came from a broken home
Let us sob cause your mom's is sick
A bunch of adolescent young niggaz spittin' major shit
Tell me, young nigga if you died let me know
Would your heart feel pain, watching as your mother cry?
Would all your homies ride?
Or would they all get high, and talk about how you died?
Young niggaz on a mission to complete
Getting g's, packin' heat, bringin' havoc to the fuckin' streets
Nobody knows why he took a 4-4 and unloaded on the whole front row
Buck! buck!
Try to tell him but he act like he don't know me
Pull out his pistol and show
My lil homies
First to bomb, 16 on death row
Busting on them phony mother fuckas cause the big homey said so
Niggaz knew, I was a nutcase quick to blast
Living under age but he'll blaze on your bitch ass
Is there a heaven for a G?
And if there is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streetz ain't no peace
Shell shocked shows making money off of crack sales
Young black male
Unable to change, 'cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows, the evil that they might do
Lil' Moo, Big Yak, K-Kastro
Big Malc, Hussein call them Outlawz
Telling the world to be equipped, when these young mother fuckas rip shit
They don't quit, shoot down on me
Pull a pound on me
Bust like they didn't know me
My fucking lil' homies
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police

California Love
California love!
California... knows how to party
California... knows how to party
In the citay of L.A.
In the citay of good ol' Watts
In the citay, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'! We keep it rockin'!
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-makin-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for
Californ-i-a
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it mama
Shake it Cali
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it shake it shake it...
Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
The life of a west side playa where cowards die
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rose Grands
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sacktown
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love!
Now make it shake...
Uh, yeah, uh, longbeach in tha house, uh yeah
Oaktown, Oakland definitely in tha house hahaha
Frisko, Frisko

Let's show these fools how we do this on that west side
Cause you and I know it's tha best side

West coast, west coast
Uh, California Love
California Love
----
So Many Tears
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past, you wanna last
Be tha first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears
Ah, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now that I'm strugglin in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
Of leavin' here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial, and when I die,
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin, bout to go to pieces, screamin peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin a picture of my enemies killin' me, in my sleep
Will I survive till the mo'nin, to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come...
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord knows I... tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drivebys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door -- shed so many tears
Lord, I've lost so many years, and shed so many tears...
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Damn, another funeral, another motherfucker
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they shoulda killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin' crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
And if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm loosin hope, they got me stressin, can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennesey got me queasy
Don't wanna earl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
Don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
Slangin rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin' from the cops -- and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows...
The Lord knows
I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
And every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
And still a nigga stressin over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
Take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath,
It's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin niggaz, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard
In the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breath
Got me thinkin', what do Hell got?
'Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin' shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin game
And Lord knows...
Lord knows
Lord knows!
The Lord knows
One-time! One-time!
Fuck the five-oh 'cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let 'em capture me
Done lost too many niggaz to this gangbangin
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin', fucked up!
I had to tell him it was all right, and that's a lie
And he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin' up
I'm gettin' lost in the weed, man, gettin' high
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out, and if I wasn't high
Probably try to blow my brains out
Lord knows...
Lord knows!
Lord knows... Jesus...
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin' crazy after dark, these narcs
Be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin' up
I'm gettin' paid, pullin raises on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama
Busta, you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckerss since I lost my momma
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocked, G, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game
Without no doubt I ain't no slouch and it ain't time to back down
So I jumps in and try to stop-a and watch-a
Slap you cock-eyed like Popeye fucks spinach
Forgotten more shit than most crews ever know, or ever knew
Was born with 7 flows and only heaven knew
For beat the boot sex, the news breaks, the you shakes
Worse, they heard we got more nerve than a 2-fake
Yoo-hoo to you crew and you too so you knew
I'm from Jersey and I'm a teen so your block more than you do
Whose the new crew?
Show me your neck brotha, and here's another
Smack your mother's mamma's mother
In the first mob of all those other crack lovers
Back was bitch-ass, trick ass, cluk-clow-cluk-clow
How ya like me then, how ya like me, hey-ho, how ya like me now?
Ow, pow, hurt, don't it? Bow, bow, don't run up on it
The same thing minus P hangin' possies like an exponent
Oh yes, rock in slums, ya gots to run it
It makes no sense to smell like shit
If old ass George could be Washing-tons
Now I be loyal to my niggas on the blocks, just buckin the shots
And packin the glocks
And dodgin the cops, and takin' over niggas spots
Poppin' after poppin' the fools be droppin', the hoes be hoppin
On my thing cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim
You lookin' grim, is it me or him or him
Or be with me, we be together
So what's up? We can do whatever
Cause real niggas stick together
Till they make it up to heaven
Through the stress, through the hell, through the 1-8-7
The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga
The deeper they dig the ditch-a
The Naughty the Treach
Then through to the Pac I brings the glock I wets up
You fuckin' body, I'm like, Oh my Gody
Did I really shoot him? Yo I shot him
So got him, now I puts the crime behind me
And finds me, a place to lays my head low
I lives doin' my rap, but I dies for my hood row
So all you fuckin' fools better recognize, and know my fuckin' name
I be Riddler to my niggas and I'm loyal to the game
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin' crazy after dark, these NARC's
Be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin' up
I'm gettin' paid, pullin razors on niggaz when they runnin' up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cock D, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game
My mama say I'm crazy 'cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggaz swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggaz rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggaz feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin' that he tellin' get to me, no surprise, nigga
Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
I'm like loose rollin', I'm growin' until the diesel hit me
I'm badder than bruised, and madder havin' to choose
'Tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin' I'm talkin' cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin' by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin' back
From him scrappin when niggaz was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
Thugs known to bust on sight
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin' that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggaz in penitentiary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as a shorty was full of car chases
While runnin' with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don of my own crew
A million niggaz with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
'Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches
Nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
Nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
M.O.B.
And you know we keep it money over bitches
I blow you up on the spot, these glocks hot till you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police, peep what these streets do to me
Actin' all new to me I creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin' Crystal, start thinkin' 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the whole world it's Fatal dog against everybody
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
My shit's phenomenal, droppin' like domino
Comin' with the real yo and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggaz nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin G's
My niggas crosstown got keys
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
I'm hittin sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contrived to strive never laggin
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin' up but I don't give a fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin my mind why you sweatin me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin, I hope he awoken
Payin' my own that's tokin chokin off-a glocks smokin'
Money and power watch these bitches 'cause they skanless
Gettin' niggaz fucked 'n' stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops
Gettin' kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin' my money over all my bitches
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
That's right nigga
Money over motherfuckin bitches
MOB. on 'em nigga
Keep your motherfuckin mind on your money, fuck these hoes
You need some motherfuckin money
Get your mind right nigga, keep your game tight
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid fuck the fools
We up out of this bitch here
We gone
Biatch!
Young mothers
That's right
I know how it is
Don't nobody understand
I feel ya
She was born a heavy set girl with pig tails and curls
A heart full of gold, still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans, witnessed a man die
Was only 15, should have been a beauty queen
Still see here crying by the caskets when here parents got killed
Little girl don't cry, 'cause even though they died
You can best believe they watching over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery but look at what you getting
It's a blessing in disguise, when you find out your pregnant
No money, no home, and even though you all alone
You got to do this on your own, so baby go on
I wish you luck and if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand the way it feels when you fighting the world
Facing all this drama when mama's just A little girl
Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Given that she is or not
Time ain't on her side
Mama's just a little girl
She gotta hold her head up high
At 16 what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet black ebony queen
And who could tell she would get pregnant at an early age
Got violated by someone she dated
If this is fate I hate to see the seed she created
So we wait, though it takes time to build the body and the mind
She reclines 9 months then finally its time
What do we find?
A little groaning boy of mine with a tortured soul
Addicted to a life of crime had no time for the growing stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
'Cause mammas acting crazy at the hospital about to have another baby
Like the rose from concrete groaning within
Blessed with twins how the hell can mamma raise 3 men
So we began close as family such insanity
A happy home for one act inhumanity
Plus mamas said the seed was corrupted
Used the rub her belly begging us to breathe if she love us
Now mama sits quiet sipping peppermint schnapps
How could mama bring a thug like me into this world?
She ain't the cause of all the drama cause mommas just a little girl
Mama
Don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Liven if she is or not
Time ain't on her side
Cause ama's just a little girl
She gotta hold her head up high
Now would she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the cane spot
Now look here I see her clutching her son in her arms she hurt
Her heart bleeding as she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfil prophecy but who could stop the grief?
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top of me
Probably be an innocent man but still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse? nothing but pain
Since my birth, taught me functions at the pen
Cause everybody's in paying back society I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watched the drama occur my eyes blurred 'fore I jet it
I wonder why we all have to die before we get it
Though we shed tears so many peers I done buried
Worried and scared knowing I'ma see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world no one cares
No it ain't fair but we all there and do our share
In this land of underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga having g's in hand
Mamma told me not to be a punk
They ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mamma in this world
Cause you know I ain't mad at cha you' just a little girl
See mammas just a little girl
Mama
Don't know why
They asked us why we mutilate eachother like we do
To ask us why we turn from bad to worse, is to ignore from which we came
You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals
On the contrary - we would all celebrate its tenacity, we would all love its will to reach the sun
Well... we are the roses, this is the concrete, and these are my damaged petals
Heeey
It's just me against the world baby
It's just me against the world
Me against the world baby
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin while makin' millions
Witnessin killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children 'cause they're illin
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby
It's just me against the world baby
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stones, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall
Everday there's mo'death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin' sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world baby
It's just me against the world baby
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this supression
They punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world baby
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world baby
Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it
Me against the world
Me against the world
It's just me against the world baby
It's just me against the world
Me against the world baby
Can you picture my prophecy?

Shit, you motherfuckin' right
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, Westside
What! Bring it on
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind
Our childhood years, recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor, father forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin', fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steerin' wheel, blush, while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire, exorcisin' all demons
Mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I can hardly wait...
To bust freely. Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Made the front-page, prime-time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend may be .45 but she still live
One shot makin' niggas heart beats stop
What!
I'm bustin' on you punk-ass niggas - run, nigga, run!
I'm on your ass nigga! Run nigga - duck and hide!
Nigga I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga, yeah! Westside!
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!
My girlfriend - blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made, she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside baby-girl'll always be mine
Picked you up when you was nine
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned .22, it's true
Nothing compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'
Me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realise how to treat ya -
The secret to keep ya -
We closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly; I shoot blind
In time I clock figures
Dropping niggas as we rise
We all souljah's in God eyes
Now it's time for war
Never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid
Sleeping with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang wit' the fellas
I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waiting by the phone
This is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed but you the realest
If you need me, call
I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall
Me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
I love finger fuckin' you
All of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut
Niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours
Behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore
Everything I'm asking for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy, you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin' loud when I tell you, Be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you
So no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone
I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home
Me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end...
Just me and my girlfriend
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this whirlwind
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in the whirlwind
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind

'96 Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend...
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde

Stand in formation
My motherfucking real troopers
Let's do it like soldiers
All in together now
Ready?
Hell yeah
No retreat no surrender
Death before dishonour motherfucker
Do it to them
Come on
Never got thuggish
Yes yes YES
Say whut
Westide eastside ride
Where you at?, where you at?
Where my real thugs?
Where you at?, where you at?
Where my real thugs?
Where you at?, where you at?
Where my real thugs?
The cases of a drug dealer
Real thugs, where you at?
Yo a motherfucking army
Do it to them
Do it to them
They love the way we do it to them
We do it to them
Calvary
Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas now player what it be like?
When will niggas see they got us bleeding with 3 strikes
Can't seem to focus hopeless with violent thoughts
I wrote this got these devils petrified hiding from my hocus pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated clearly click a military mind
May god forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealing from the womb to the block
My live mind got me surviving 5 shots
My 45 got me fortified with live rounds
When shit stick we plot hits when our block spits
All hail out on bail wrath of '2pacalypse'
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw thug niggas never left the boot camp
I'm a nigga for assignment
Skilled in gorilla warfare
And blessed
Work with firearm
My rap shit
Contains sections of bomb sessions
Says I'm responsible for black Smith and Wessons
Putting up on ?? in the military state of mind
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Cocoa Brovas pan the borderline
That's the sound and your dead son
Man to man
Judo stance
First glance
Animal instincts
Intelligence of an assassin
Mask my ninja style
Surround me ready to attack I react swiftly
What father taught me sticks with me
Never forget the methods stick and move strictly
Shit be seeming like its closing in
With no regrets I hold position
'Cause I circles
Picture being put in position to move
And you can't move cause your move is blocked by the knight at 12 O'clock
That's when the madness beings so I start to focusing
And the law that we live by is to stay true to self
Why try everybody lie
About the block true soldier mentality
Stick and move
Time to show what kinda nigga
Move or get moved on
In the days of the strange where nothing stays the same
It's a call for re-adjustment fine tune your positions
What did you change to get a break in the world of snakes
And those who fake elimination I'm facing destruction
Outlaw till I duck down from po po's busting
No one to trust in rushing to the goal line
Catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole mine
No swine I'm a soldier told cha I control mine
Time to take you back into time follow this here
One way out
This black hole
For this black soul
Shit is outta control
I'm fighting for my position
To be a fetus in this world I am entering
And my face is sentencing for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consuming weed
Cause my mom's use to smoke back in the 70's
Maybe that's why in the 90's I drop g's when I drop degrees
When I ease across the block with Pac
And got all you niggas shot
You didn't think Boot Camp click would link
With the outlaw minded If you do you press rewind
And you can peep gorilla tactics in every line
Yeah
And this is how we do it
Where my real thugs?
Where they at?
Let me see my real thugs
Where you at
Wont you see my real thugs
Where you at
Let me see my real thugs
Where you at
Now
Where my real thugs
Let me see where you at
Tell me where my real thugs
Gots to see where you at
Where's my soldiers
Where you at
Where's my real soldiers
Where you at

When Bob Dole and Deloris Tucker wanna know, where my soldiers at
Code Fo'
Layin around sittin' about from Friday morning to Saturday evenings Monday morning x2
They got a nigga shedding tears, reminiscing on my past fears
Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death
My heartless breath, the underlying cause of my arrest
My life is stressed, and no rest forever weary
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm getting worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, 'cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggaz on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutching on a four-five
My neighbourhood ain't the same
Cause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggaz give me props
Forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block
Living life is but a dream
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still pray
But on our block we still pray
Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life
Staying strapped forever strapped in this drug life
God help me, 'cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism 'cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home... on my block
And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know you feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, staying strapped
Fantasies of a nigga living fat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losing focus... on my block
And block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break nine
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers balling
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggaz understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
Trying to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is that everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain
For all the niggaz that I lost to the game... from my block
Me and my closest road dogz
To my dog named Musolini, Big Syke, Thug Life baby
The return of the mashers, you know how we do it
Shit half the times we flaunt cause trouble
My closest road dog it was cool 'cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin' bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty - nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy - haired juveniles, livin' wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, 'cause they was killin' me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin' deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night
Murder murder Mr. Lucifer
Pictures of the devil DUCK when he shoot at cha, it's all political
Runnin' from the future, escapin in the fog
Live yo' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin' through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine
Haha... bring artillery and ROLL with a nigga
They could never take the soul of a M. O. B. soldier nigga
Cowards get rolled up, mob on 'em Makaveli
Boy youse a boss player, that's what all the bitches tell me
Even if I died now
I live my life eternally and never lie down, why cry now?
Fooled a few but never 'came a gamer, ain't tryin' to hear it
Evil spirits hide at total strangers, yo' life's in danger
Prepare nigga be aware, 'cause we ain't scared
M. O. B., till I die, when we ride niggaz disappear
Fill 'em up with pistol smoke
Never forget to blow a hole in his head
For leakin information to the feds
The burnin bed was the tellin' sign
Two hired guns bustin' everyone, yellin' everybody die
Why the fuck they fuck around, we left 'em in the fog
Bleedin like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz
Fuck they feelings, that's what they get for squealin
That's the pressures of a gangsta, dangerous this drug dealin'
See me in physical form, my niggaz swarm
Take the figure of a circle beatin' jealous niggaz till they purple
Simon Says take they heads homies
And send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
Fishin for fake niggaz, observe and shake niggaz
The only way to see six figures, is break niggaz
Me and Musolini set to ride we high
Big Bogart got the alibi if homicide ask us way
Labelled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe
To live and die as a millionaire, on...
Set to explode, my M. O., is kill them hoes
My pistol's like a disease, my enemies and foes
Get murdered and disposed of, we in the fog
Makaveli the Don, and my closest road dogz
Niggas!
Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
Fuck the law, rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine, cross the line, my two nines
Go baya baya when I shoot 'em
Korean mothafuckers was crooked, so niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night
My Niggas! Straight take his life
So don't sleep when my Jeep creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip 'cause we did 'em
Lickin' of shots for Latasha that's proper
Love for my niggas but a glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now
I packed a .9 last year, in '99 I'm packin' 2 now
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
Niggas!
My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is head shots
Your last words'll be, damn what's all these red dots?
Niggas nowawadays, they worry me, my bars is therapy
As long as you usin' them thouroughly, muah till the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably will ever be
And I'm a product of the '70's
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eatin' with you, I'm probably beefin' with you
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin' with you
I know you got a gun but I'm hopin' you keep it with you
'Cause unfortunately, I'm one of them rappers that keep a pistol and
You know what the llama do, Shady/Aftermath, Ruff Ryders, D-Block, and of course Amaru
Lotta people honor you, probably 'cause of the way you used to bring the drama to
Whoever you wanted to, you a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But anyway, life goes on, so I'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do
Niggas!
Now of course I want peace on the streets
But realisticly
Painting perfect pictures ain't never work
My misery was so deep
Couldn't sleep through all my preasures
My quest for cash
I learned fast
Using violent measures
Memorys of adolescent years
Their was unity
But after puperty we brought war
To our community
So many bodies dropping
Its got to stop
I want to help
But still I'm stepping
Keeping my weapon
Must protect myself
Promise of a better tomorrow
Ain't never reach me
Plus my teachers were to petrfied in class to teach me
Sipping thunderbird
And grape kool-aid
Calling Earl since my stomach was empty
It seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil homiez
Lose there childhood to guns
Nobody cries no more
'Cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace
If you can't grant it
Niggas fighting across the whole planet
So we can never be peace
Will never be peace
Or all we all just headed for doom
Still consumed by the beefs
And I'll know there never be peace
That's why I keep my
Pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there never be peace
No time to rest
They stressed out
I can't remember the days my homie was here
Now a days we live in fear
The stuggle is still here
So now who's grabbing there strap
Who's getting bucked wild
Representing the generation of killers
When I was a child had many dreams
Reality kept me and my homiez stressing
Tyring to raise my baby girl to be the strongest
Know when I'm doing wrongest
I never had a bright day
Just drunkless smoking blunts
Getting faded
Wishing my partna made it
If it was peace
Or ????????
I know there will never be
All my tears were shed
When I lost my homie number three
It's getting harder to see
Impossibilty should we just face it
Can't get through the pain
But still I can't erase it
So many trials and tribulations
Things we facing
Wicked days
Can't see no brighter days
It's time to chase it
Cross dreams
Cause the scene is when you never get by
That's why I got to stay high
You'll never know when you'll die
My heart will never leave the ghetto
I know to rise only in peace
That's why I say
There ain't never going to be no peace
Will never be peace
Or all we all just headed for doom
Still consumed by the beefs
And I'll know there never be peace
That's why I keep my
Pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there never be peace
Living life lonely
But I can't even cry
Cause visions of diseption
All around me
Got my eyes full of despise
Who can I trust
Why even try
They say the world is mine
But I know that's a lie
Living to die
Set up from birth
Steady dreaming
Wishing for better days
But all I see is demons
Close my eyes
Reminisence of my childhood
All I felt was pain from my arrival
No memories of nothing nice
Nothing but blinded reminders of my future life
I'm freaking out
I'm getting closer to that other level
Will I be strong with game
Or just the heartless devil
I hope I'm able to find peace in me
Cause there's a storm sixty four inches deep in me
And I try to do the right thing
But it's the wrong thing
That seems to bring me right back
To this dirty game
There never be peace
Fuck peace
Will never be peace
Or all we all just headed for doom
Still consumed by the beefs
And I'll know there never be peace
That's why I keep my
Pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there never be peace
Shit fuck peace, on the strength to my niggas get a peace, we can't
Have
Peace, how the fuck we gonna live happy when we ain't got none, tear
Drops and closed caskets, these mothafuckas are smiling but don't mean
Much, why 'cause I got to be a thug, see drugs gonna turn this
Mothafuckn
Head out, all us niggas acting up, wild ass mothafuckn adolescent,
These
Niggas ain't got a childhood no more, how the fuck can you have a
Childhood when your at the funeral every fuckn weekend, you

Gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself, in his position but remain silent
I get to thinking 'bout the shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin, that got the both of us in trouble
But you you always stay down for a nigga so that's why I love you
Reminiscing needing tissues fighting over childish issues,
Swear I can't live with you but without you everyday I miss you
Word on roll you hold my pistol
My gangster bitch that you always in the mood for love
That's why I'm sleeping with you
Though not the man of your dreams, my planted schemes to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free
I see, yesterday I called you names, and played games on your mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world so girl just be a friend
I swear I'll 'Never Call you Bitch Again'
And that's my word
We came too far
To throw it all away
We came way too far pretty thing yeah
Do it all away, do it all away baby ...
I wake up early in the morning, at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawning, and now I'm gone
Trying to get my money on strong so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts
They envy me, plus we've been beefing with the east coast
Two casualties, got stopped in traffic
Had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed they ain't knowing
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards going
You paid bail got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Crystal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic 'cause we forged to top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend

Waiting to exhale while I'm sitting in the county jail
Keep your head up, cause things are getting better
My cell mate shed tears off your last love letter
Told him you would find a friend so keep your eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss, but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust, and if I bust, will she snitch?
Even though your not the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the board for a third time hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissing in the living room in the nude
Thanks for being there much more than a friend

So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Ain't nothin' hard about it why you lookin' sad? Shoulda though about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggaz up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom Perignon
Knowin' I'm a cash getter still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me; plus you was smilin' till the bill miss me
That's what you get for tryin' to dick me
Missed me with that Buy me this, buy me that syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin' mad 'cause I cursed and I scream I hate'cha
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me?
Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
But that's a thug's nature
I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tongue - kissin', you was truly with it
Little ecstacy, Hennesey, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggaz at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin walls till them bastard drop
Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite
Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!
Haha... started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin for creamin - bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' till I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly

Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God

Last year we was lettin these niggaz kick up dust
This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust
Thug Life nigga Westsiiiiide!
Straight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin' Hennesey, smokin' weed
Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
Had a partner named Snoop, loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shooting craps in the alley till they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies but don't waste it all
Oooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Having house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
Everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
Lookin' dumb, cause you waitin for your chance to hump
Straight grindin, everybody havin' fun
And it's cool till a fool pull a loaded gun
Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool now the party's over
Gun shots rang like it's thunder
And everybody bum rushing and I'm rushing to get a number
Says she got a man but she's lying
Why? I seen her talking to this other guy and...
He's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I ain't trippin' I just hope he get em, I got nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
Cause uh, old man still drinkin', his breath still stinkin
He'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin'
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin' here longer what that tell ya?
And little girls playin' double dutch
Still blush, 'cause she don't get in trouble much
It's uh, ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin' stick ball, quick y'all
Get out the street before they hit y'all
And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
'Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers getting rich slangin crack to folks
And the square's getting big for these sack of dope
Started thinking 'bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
Till the dealer on the block told me, That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tryed to make my way legit, haha
But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinking, since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin' like a waste, tears rollin' down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nothing but family, straight up down for me
Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out 
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out 
Pray to my God everyday but he don't listen 
The poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen 
Listen I can hear her crying in the bedroom 
Praying for money we never think would she be dead soon 
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else 
At 13 can't feed myself 
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me 
Wish he would've helped me 
Too much like him 'til my mama don't love me 
On my own at a early age gettin' paid 
And I'm strapped so I'll never be afraid 
Where did I go astray I'm hanging in the back streets 
Running with G's and dope fiends will they jack me? 
Can't turn back my eyes on the prize 
I got nothing to lose 
Everybody gotta die 
Say good-bye to the bad guy 
That one you fucked when you passed by 
Tempered glass fly 
Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes 
And you'd be crazy too 
With nothing to lose 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 
I thank the Lord for my many blessings 
Though I'm stressin' keep a vest for protection 
From the barrel of the Smith & Wesson 
And all my niggas in the pen' 
Here we go again 
Ain't nothing separating us from a mack 10 
Born in the ghetto as a hustla' older 
Straight soldier bucking at them bustas 
No matter how you try niggas never die 
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply 
See me striking down the block hittin' co'ners 
Mobbin' like a motherfucka' livin' like I want to 
Ain't no stoppin' at the red lights I'm sideways 
Thug Life muthafucka criiime pays 
Let the cops put they lights on 
Chase me nigga 
Zig-zaggin' through the freeway 
Race me nigga 
In a high speed chase with the law 
The realest muthafucka that you ever saw 
I'm livin' raw 'til they bury me don't worry me 
I'm high livin' like I ain't afraid to die 
And you could walk a mile in my shoes 
And you'd be crazy too 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 
Ain't no escape from a deadly fate 
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away 
I'm startin' to lose hope 
It seems everybody's on dope 
Mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke 
Sometimes I choke on the indo 
Peepin' out the window alone on my own 
I'm a criminal 
Got no love from the household I'm out cold 
In the streets give me motherfuckin' peace 
I got nothing to lose 
And something to prove 
What do I do live Thug Life nigga stay true 
I wonder when they kill me 
Is there a Heaven for a real G 
Lord forgive me if you feel me 
'Cause all my life I was dirt broke 
With no hope lil' skinny muthafucka wantin' dough 
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade 
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid 
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city 
No pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time 
If you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too 
With nothing to lose 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga 
We be the craziest, motherfucka'!
You know! 
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga 
We be the craziest!
Here we go; we gonna send this one out to the old school
All these motherfuckers in the Bronx, and Brooklyn, and Staten Island
Queens, and all the motherfuckers that laid it down, the foundation
Ya know what I'msayin? Nuttin but love for the old school
That's who we gon' do this one for, ya feel me?
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nothin' like the old school/ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
I remember Mr. Magic, FLASH, Grandmaster Caz
LL raisin' hell but, that didn't last
Eric B. & Rakim was, the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D
And Red Alert was puttin' in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill gettin' ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal, remember Raw, with Daddy Kane
When De La Soul was puttin' potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin' buzzed, cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggi don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic
Remember Push It was the bomb shit, nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Heheheh, it ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Yeaheheh, it ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Heheh... I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playin' skelly, ring to leavey, or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch, I remember
Way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin uptown, freestylin'
With some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin'
'Cause the hoochies was starin', thinkin', Why them niggas swearin'?
I'm wonderin if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall
Or takin' leaks on the steps, stinkin up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin' to stay away from Riker's Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin' to keep it true
Out on the roof sippin 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Heheheyah, that's right, it ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Hahah... remember poppin' and lockin to Kurtis Blow, the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Hoe back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin' La Di Da Di
Gamin the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties, I remem-ber
Breakdancin to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV, about to hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful don't let the transit cops see me
It ain't nuttin like the old school
It ain't nuttin like the old school
Hahahah, it ain't nuttin like the old school
Hey, heheaha, on the real though, ain't nuttin like the old school
Remember seein Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin party?
Member how fuckers used to go, Is Brooklyn in the house?
And motherfuckers would lose they GOD DAMN MIND
I remember goin' places that motherfuckers was scared to say
They was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfuckin old school nigga
Remember skelly nigga? Knockin' niggaz out the box, poppin' boxes?
Member stickball? Member niggaz to run that shit like that?
Member the block members screamin up at your mom from the window?
The ice cream truck, member all the mother...
Member the Italian icey's yo?
Yo remember the Italian icey's the Spanish niggaz comin' down
With the coconut icey's and shit?
I came through the door, said it before
That was the SHIT
Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming
'Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
'Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open free, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We can...
Only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take
There's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps and that's all it takes
You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't
Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I ain't hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow,
As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me
And that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free to this day
The game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts and your minds
We will never die
We are forever alive
And we continue growing...
One day at a time
Don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and light
Searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest.
Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
And kids think beef is the only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of him die, but makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun
And no pity with guns
And when your money is up
That's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back
Would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains
I spent my whole life, fighting myself
That I can't win so I'm inviting some help
And every now and then I take rights from left
I'm still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
And that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope god
Take a like to myself
I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm trying to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
And we continue growin'...
...One day at a time. Damn!
Pssst... psssssst... aiyyo
Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever
Tell me, which one?
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry
Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me unfortunately 'cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless -- I'm chokin off
Marijuana smoke, with every toke it's like I'm losin focus
Fallin' to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin, and goin' nutty
And reminiscin 'bout them niggaz that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money
Where am I goin' I discovered, can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it
Everybody's dyin' am I next, who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin', two to the head
While I'm in bed, leakin blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller? I'm gettin' suspicious
Of this bitch the line busy every time I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin' all her homies -- that I can fuck her
Like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennesey I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass
By me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh
I put up my middle finger then I dash
Niggaz don't like me 'cause I'm Thuggin', and every day
I'm a hustler lookin' to get paid
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost 'cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay Thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound... well Hell
Can't be worse than this, 'cause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you I don't want to, but I will
See motherfuckers killed over green bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack
I love it cause in heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin' you now, you motherfuckers don't know me
Only fear of death... You ghetto niggaz
Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated
Hahaha, I ain't scared to die
I ain't scared to die
To my homies in heaven
I ain't scared to die
Do you wanna live forever?
Are you scared, to die?
Or will you scream, when you fry?
I don't fear death
My only fear of death is comin' back, reincarnated
This is dedicated to Mental, R.I.P.
And Big Kill, R.I.P.
And all you other O.G.'s, who go down
I don't fear death
Only God can judge me, is that right?
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious, 'cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin' got me knockin' on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
Only God can judge me
And only God can
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Flatline!
Screamin I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies
I wake up strangled in, dangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery talkin' to the, dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin' round strapped
Mista, Po-lice, please try to see that there's
A million motherfuckers stressin just like me
Only God can judge me
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
Let me live baby, let me live
Pac I feel ya, keep servin' it on the rilla
For instance say a playa hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin' wearin a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want em
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggaz, You can fade him, punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
To get your safe, knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise
Guess you figure you know me 'cause I'm a Thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me
My only fear of death is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated
That's for the homey mental
We up out
All right now, here we go
Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
And freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high till I die, my competion's zero
'Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey
I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust?
Got my mama stressin thinkin' it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin', fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up
And recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
Over the fence and open fire
All right now, here we go
These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin' round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin' ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin' up, 'cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin' outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away 'cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin' loogies
At the coppers that pursue me, beotch!
I be a hustler till it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas
All right now, here we go
Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin' bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin'
Droppin' keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety, ah shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin' tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!
Hahahaha, Thug Life!
Oh, I posted bail?
I'm out this motherfucker?
I can go?
Oh, fuck y'all eh, fuck the judge
Fuck all y'all
'Cause I'm out on motherfuckin' bail
Y'all ain't never gonna see me in this motherfucker again
Drop that shit em!
Let these old punk ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
Niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches
I'm stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail if I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk 'cause I'm rappin'
They askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my glock cause its major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone that's my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures and make me some more riches
To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
I'm a thug I was raised in jail
Now I'm out on bail
Stuck in jail and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild through the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart 'cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
And sellin' products to the addicts 'cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I gotta lotta love
Hangin' out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me then it's on G
Got me sittin' in the cell a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me and the shit ull get better
I don't believe her 'cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
'Cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
I'm on bail
Out on Bail
Out on bail
I'll see ya motherfuckers at the next show, 2pac, the media is my bitch
It's that famous shit, you know?
Real thug shit
Real live thug shit, genuine, you know what I'm sayin'
I wouldn't waste your motherfuckin' time with no bullshit baby
Trust me, It's that real shit
I'm talkin' about that shit you never tell your grandkids about, you know?
I ran with a thug nigga, believe that
This my motherfuckin' nigga Em on dem motherfuckin' boards in case your wonderin'
We doin' this shit hell motherfuckin' yeah
An ounze of that shit sittin' in your motherfuckin' lac
Now press rewind nigga!
That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?
Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
Preoccupied with homicide, tryin' to survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require many closed caskets
Who can you blame? It's insane what we dare do
Witnessin evil that these men do, bitches sin too
In fact they be the reasons niggaz get to bleedin
For the fuckin' fire when I leave em, you shoulda seen em
And snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a
Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Excersisin, visualizin, everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggaz in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? and if we fail?
High speeds, and thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drivebys and niggaz die, murder without a motive
By making motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryin' to hover over niggaz till we drop
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, 'cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
Motherfuckers is crooked, is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin' an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a
Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggaz lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggaz bodies put to rest
So I just... swallow my Beck's and holla, Fuck em!
And if I'm next... just let a nigga step with somethin'
I ain't fearin nuttin
Young and thuggin', prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggaz can't get the best of me
'Cause when I bust 'em they gonna shiver, the killer squad soldiers
Got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?
Talkin' bout prayin' -- they need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggaz sprayin up my block, tryin' to take my wealth
Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggaz run the streets
Hahah, it ain't nuttin but muuuuzik
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin' REAL strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin' dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
But all I see is motherfuckers actin' less than G's
Stop bein a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
Cause you know these streets is real deal
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket
Jealous, motherfuckin bastards
I never die, thug niggaz multiply
Cause after me is Thug Life baby
Then the young thugs

It's that new 'Pac y'all
Pac's life
Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life
What do you know about Pac's life
Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life
Started with five shots, niggas plotting to kill him
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits
Dodging cop cars look how we come so far
Picture a high school drop out
Rolling a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out
So when trouble tried to find me can't
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change
It comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night
Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas
Conversating on my life
Mind your motherfucking business
I remember that
Ay
What's happening Pac
Yeah I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through
Meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for for nothing it was shame to see
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see
Now they all in the court room blaming me
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's
With the same sort of dude with he same short fuse
I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass
Nigga you scary
I been knowing you for years
We was high school peers
In Junior High
I was itching' to kill
And you was, 'Ready To Die'
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry
Still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd
And motherfucker's die
It's not the way I wanna live
My nigga it's how it is
Only real niggas stay on top
Why are all you niggas all up in my shit?
Tell them motherfucker's

Pac's theme
I was raised in this society so there's no way
You can expect me to be a perfect person 'cause I'm a do what I'm a do.
That's how I feel I'm a do whatever I like. I am not a role model
As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated scheme
To get us locked up shot up or back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history a mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty's a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man 'cause I'm strong and bold
With this gun full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation in this new nation
All you gave my people was our patience
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now I'm sitting here mad 'cause I'm unemployed
But the government's glad 'cause they enjoy it
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power from the strength that resides within
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
The rich get richer and the poor take less
The American Dream was an American nightmare
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out
With signs drew they know no blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
But now we're impatient
Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out
Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are
It's ya panther power that makes you a star
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
My Mother never let me forget my history
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know the true facts about my history
I couldn't settle for being a statistic
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic
Government cause it was meant to hold us back
Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
In my community they killed the unity
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity
I strike America like a case of hard disease
Panther power is running through my arteries
Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
'Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?
You think you living free don't let me laugh at you
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
Cause some time has passed seem you all forget
There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculate schemes
To get us locked up shot up or back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names

Daddy's home...
Heh, so??
You say that like that means somethin' to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
We been gettin' along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS... fuck you!
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin' sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...
I'm so sorry
For all this time
I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!
Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin' a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother
Moms can't stand me 'cause I'm lookin' like my father
Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin' care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother
Look at mama's lonely smile
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...
I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time
I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And oh -I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin' kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin', Jack
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that wanna be your father shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G
Now that that I finally found you, stay the Fuck away from me
You're so sorry...
I'm so sorry
For all this time, so sorry baby!
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger
If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast
But livin' slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin' time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the type you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...
She's a part time
A part time
Part time

Meet Cindi, she's twenty-two, lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic-Tac
Now what's that say about, this big epidemic
This hypocritical world, and the people in it
Now speaking of in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
Fuck with a smile single file she'll bust nuff styles
That would be cool, if she was your lover
But fuck that, Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
'Cause moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days, had me fiending for a hot meal
Now I'm a crook, got steel, I do not feel
So don't even trip, when I flip, with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a bitch, and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mutha, I'm touched
When moms come by, niggaz hush or get rushed
Maybe one day she'll recover
But what will it take, to shake, or break
My part time mutha
I gotta live with a part time
A part time
A part time
A part time
A part time
I grew up in a home where no one liked me
Moms would hit the pipe, everynight, she would fight me
Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest
He's feeling on my chest, with his hand in my dress
Just another pest, and yes I was nervous
Blood sensor tests, I just don't deserve this
I wanna tell mom, but would she listen
She's bound to be bitchin if she hasn't got a fix in
So... now I lay me down to sleep
Lord don't let him rape me
If he does my soul to keep
Don't let the devil take me
Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom
Thinkin' how my step dad, raped me in the bathroom
Every day I make class, and yet I'm missing periods
The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm fearing it
I gotta tell mom, before she sees me
I told her how he G'd me, and she didn't believe me
Callin me a slut 'cause my butt's kinda big so
Still that ain't no way to be talkin' to your kids though
I can't believe the way you call it
Gotta believe in him, and dissin her own daughter
Time for me to break and find another
That's when I discovered
The ways of the days of a part time mutha
I got a part time
A part time
A part time
Part time
A part time
A part time mutha
I rush to tend her, talked as I touch her
She blushed, the clothes came off, and I bust her
I'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block
Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cot
She's gone, and I'm thinkin' that my game's so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is hell no
'Cause she came back with the kid and yo
I been payin' ever since
The clothes the food the cars and oh the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me list in the first place
So I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I can't dream anymore
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha
And I, change the diapers and clean the shit
The tables are turned I can't take this
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha
A part time
A part time mutha
Now I'm a part time mutha
A part time
A part time
Part time
She's a part time
A part time mutha
He's a part time mutha
A part time
A part time
A part time
Part time mutha
A part time
A part time mutha
Pa-pa-pa-part time
Pa-pa-pa-part time...

Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Cold bustas!
Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federals wanna see me dead - niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands is swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'
Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Pictue me rollin'
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?
I got ki's coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug breded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start bang banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin'!
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some balding-ass niggas and they slipping in my spot
Checking in the park, 'Pac
We caught 'em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin' roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there

All you bitch ass C.O.'s

Picture me rollin' nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day
You can't stop me
You know I got my niggas up in this motherfucker
Manute, Pain, Syke, Mopreme
Can you picture us rolling?
Can you see me ho?
Is y'all ready for me? ... We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again
Rewind this track right here, close your eyes
And picture me rollin'
Clear enough for ya?
Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Cold bustas!
Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federals wanna see me dead - niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands is swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'
Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Pictue me rollin'
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?
I got ki's coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug breded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start bang banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin'!
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some balding-ass niggas and they slipping in my spot
Checking in the park, 'Pac
We caught 'em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin' roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there
I just could not forget about
I wanna make sure they can see me
All you bitch ass C.O.'s
Can you niggas see me from there?
Ballin on y'all punk ass!
Picture me rollin', baby
Yeah, all them niggas up in them cell blocks
I told y'all niggas when I come home it's on
That's right nigga, picture me rollin'
Oh, I forgot! The D.A
Yeah, that bitch had a lot to talk about in court
Can the ho see me from here?
Can you see me, ho?
Picture me rollin'
And all you punk police -- can you see me?
Am I clear to you?
Picture me rollin' nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day
You can't stop me
You know I got my niggas up in this motherfucker
Manute, Pain, Syke, Mopreme
Can you picture us rolling?
Can you see me ho?
Is y'all ready for me? ... We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again
Rewind this track right here, close your eyes
And picture me rollin'
Like watchin picture's in hazy vision
Tonight it's love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we satisfy, yesterday was stolen kisses
Blind insanity perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the death of me, had they plans for me
If I have kids, will I live to see em' grow
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go with broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Vision's in prison's, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven 'cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eye's and see nothin' but pain
The world's crazy, still lookin' for a queen
To plant seed's and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one, or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious,
If you play your cards right
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on, who
Who'll be the one who'll be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water we won't leave until the mornin'
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more
No one else can do, what you do for me
Take me away from the pain, I feel inside
And it's gonna be all right, and it'll be okay
If we try and take our time, yes baby, take our time
And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one whooo
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on, who
Who'll be the one who'll be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water, we won't leave until the mornin'
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more
Gotta play your cards right on one
Can't be rushin like it's a race, you know what I'm sayin'
If you be patient and take your time
And you finesse it
9 times out of 10 homeboy, you gonna wake up wit ya breakfast in bed
Play your cards right nigga, take your time, be patient
Go slow, it's better that way
You ain't heard?
Playa cards right
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on, who
Who'll be the one who'll be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water, we won't leave until the mornin'
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more
You got to be patient man, be patient
Bring some roses or sometihin ya know
Play some soft shit,
Got ta be patient, you gotta playa cards right on one
Can't be rushin like it's a race, you know what I'm sayin'
If you be patient and take your time
And you finesse it
Scott Storch
Why'd you sland crack? I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin' bills
Crazy, I gotta look at what you gave me, claimin I'ma criminal when you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in the holocaust headin for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war, and got a busted jaw for sayin' fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm mad, check the record
What's a nigga gotta do to get respected
Sometimes I think I'm getting tested, and if I don't say yes a nigga quick to get arrested
Restless
Walkin' round ready to light shit up, because my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up, other niggas pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga be a killer, I used to be a dealer but they wanted to see whos realer
Now them same mother fuckas wanna murder me, and I wonder if the lord ever heard of me
I need loot, so I'm doin' what I do, and don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes,
There's no other destiny to choose, I had nothing left to lose, so I'm singin' the po nigga blues
Coppin these brand new shoes, but what the fuck can a nigga do, my little boy gotta eat too
So why must I sock a fella? Just live large like rocafella
And did you ever stop to think? I'm old enough to go to war but I ain't old enough to drink
Cops wanna hit me with the book, and you hooked on my I don't give a fuck look
Makin' rules, I'ma break em, no matter how much you make em, show me bakin, I'ma take em
So don't you ever temp me, I'm a fool for mine nigga, and my pockets stay empty
To my brother in the barrio, you livin' worse then the niggas in ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion, you got love for the niggas in my section
You got problems with the punk police, don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me
We ain't free, I'll be damned if I played a chip for a blonde haired blue eyed Caucasian bitch
Down with my home boy rich, fuck a snitch and groupie ass bitch
And you wonder why we blazin' niggas, 'cause you punks haven babies can't raise the niggas
And they damned to be fuck ups too, drink 40s of brew, singin' the nigga blues
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
And now I'm headin for the mother fuck in PEN
Ah yeah, they love to point the finger
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
I thought I hit rock bottom, they ban my album, point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggaz need guns too
Wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
Them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin' major paid
But when I get my check they takin' tax out
So, we payin' for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin' rich
Whoopin on thugs and robbin drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell 'em your soul or they'll be on ya till a niggaz ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a law suit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin ass marks in the park
For tryin' to earn they stripes in the dark
Only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
As I run up on 'em madman, a nutcase with a screw loose
A zoot troupe full of foolies with toolies
Niggaz run to me don't come to me with beef
Take your jewels and your jeep, boom boom! Let that ass sleep
It's gettin' hectic, niggaz run, quick
Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggaz on the block tryin' to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin' to sleep
I'm steady pumpin bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to bustin', nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no
A quick flurry and he's buried with a swelled jaw
I came up from the amateurs to pro hits
At 5-0, so you know I take no shit
And everybody wants to kill a bringer
Of bad news, so they choose, to point the finga
One two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess till I'm ill, still feel me?
I say one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up
Best to duck or get fucked for your bucks
Scream one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
I can't give up, it's a black thang
And I ain't goin' back to the crack game
Bitches, let 'em point the finga
Snitches, let 'em point the finga
Yo, one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
I guess nobody loves a rap singer
Yeah
Pour out a little liquor for your homies, nigga
This one here go out to my nigga Mike Coolie
How you come up, man?
I started young kickin' dust and livin' rough
You watch you mouth around my mama, you couldn't cuss, man
I had a down ass homie though we ran the streets
And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh
I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five
We drinkin' forties, lil' shorties livin' naughty lives
You couldn't stop us, long as I got my glock, fuck the coppers
Hangin' on the block, slangin' rocks and makin' profits
I couldn't fuck with the school life, I was a fool
I'll play that motherfucker for a tool man
Tonight'll be the night that's what we figurin'
Hustlin' in the rain felt no pain 'cause we drinkin'
Playin' them hoes like manure
First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck, that's how we do it
It's two niggaz comin' up out the hood
Livin' life just as good as we could
But since a bitch can't be trusted
Hoes snitched to the police, now my nigga's busted
The cops whoopin' on my nigga in jail
Tryin' to get a motherfucker to tell
And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga, pour out a little liquor
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
This goes out to all you so called G's
Pour out a little liquor for your real motherfuckin' partners
Don't let the drink get like that y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor, pour out a little liquor
What's that you drinkin' on?
Drinkin' on gin, smokin' on blunts and it's on
Reminisce about my niggaz, that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
'Cause I'm losin' all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin' with them suckers till my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me, Son, there'll be days like this
Don't wanna think so, I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein' big time G's
Rolling in marked cars, movin' them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get to' down for my niggaz in the pen, yo
Your son's gettin' big and strong
And I'd love 'em like one of my own, till you come home
And the years sure fly with the quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin' yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be
Homie, if it was me, you'd do the shit for me
Homie, I can remember scrapin' back to back
Throwin' dogs on them suckers runnin' up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let ya know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
Look at you
Drinkin' got you where you don't even give respect to your partners
Pour out some liquor, nigga
It ain't like that, tip that shit over
Pour out a little liquor
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
This for my nigga Madman, Dagz, Hood, Silk, yeah
A little liquor for my homies y'all
We in this motherfuckin' piece, yeah
Pour out a little liquor, Young Queen, yeah
This one goes out to all my mack partners
Back in the motherfuckin' Bay
Oaktown still in the motherfuckin' house
My nigga Richie Rich, Gov'na
All my real motherfuckin' partners
And all my real partnas in Marin, fuck you busta ass niggaz
Yeah nigga, pour out a little liquor
Now up and at 'em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And Mama told me be a Thug since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a, killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin, never heard my friends callin
Couldn't stop myself from fallin', I'm all in
Shit's gettin' sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin from the gun yellin', 'One-Time'
Take your time to feel my record, and if you did
Chill a second, my blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone, R U Still Down?
Raise 'em up... R U Still Down?
I'm gettin' high, so a nigga think he touch the sky
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin' life as a Thug time to face the truth
What's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God
And got a nigga goin' crazy
I can't read the signs, I'm blind, but a nigga know
He need his nine, cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
And my niggaz on the streets, man listen
Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way I'ma bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay
It seems I can't find my focus, and homey I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, its hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin' lace niggaz with the game
Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but R U Still Down
I wrote this for my critics and my, enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh REMEMBER ME
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail
Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a living Hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped, and mercy Lord
Come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone, and so I'm angry
I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, Baby it's on
And now I'm hustlin and bustlin bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin' cheese
Buyin all the things on TV, and gettin' skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin' wild through the town
Please tell me, R U Still Down?
R U Still Down, to raise 'em up?
R U Still Down, to raise 'em up?
R U Still Down, to raise 'em up?
That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin middle finger
RAISSSSE 'em up
These hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?
Thug Life, niggaz, be, the sickest
You feel me? Now get that shit written down
God damn!
Took four years and a motherfuckin case for these motherfuckers to feel me
Ain't that a bitch?
R U Still motherfucking down?
Old hoe ass fake ass niggaz
We out this motherfucker
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
I'm smokin' these niggas like they endo
Breakin 'em like they windows
And still they rip till they get a whiff
Of this shit that I kick
And if they ever had a notion to stop me
Treat your best shot and get dropped
With your posse, nigga I got the ?mott?
I'm takin' 'em out, a lot I got
More than you could pop
I'm rockin' the spot, so now they jock
Dump 'em and get dropped
2Pac ain't tryin' to hear it, Ox
Screamin at your box
I'm swearin at ya not so uh
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Better have a bat or a gat to defeat me
Nigga, I'm a whole posse rolled into one shot
Takin' on your gat while your girl gets hot and rocks the spot
Fear funky flavor with the gift that only God gave
Hold it to my grave
I'd rather die than be a slave
Slaves come as dope dealers
Some come as addicts
Some come to run while the others cause static
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
I'm comin' up outta the cut
Sendin slugs to the guts
I'm bustin' up outta the page 'cause they got me locked up
I'm tryin' to survive but there's too many playa hatin' haters
Always want static, like boom holla at ya later
Homie this ain't no love in this town that I come from
Niggas be wantin funkin then I stomp em, they don't want none
Girls be on my jock and they playin' me for that
But fool I can't help it 'cause I was raised up like a mack
Jealous because I'm black, Jack wanna jack me
And Jill wants to marry me and watch the Klan bury me
Got to pack the steel for the personal protection
AK, 45's, assault rifles, Smith and Wesson
I'm no longer stressin
Learnin, gotta live long
Get a bag a spliffs for the homies, blaze up all of these
But if you wanna flex, get in my Kool Aid punks, raise up offa
These
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just back the fuck up of me, 'cause you can't get none a these
It's that OG female comin' straight up out the PP's
So step to the side then raise the fuck up off me, brah
'Cause if I take it to that level I'ma light this motherfucker up
Now it's on you, you better try to lose your shit
'Cause if you don't, trust me I got you trick
You better try to choose it and lose it
Stay outta mine 'fore this shit get way stupid
These niggas I fuck with believe in passin gats
Can't leave hoe, without my strap
Not givin' a fuck about nothin'
Slidin through the spot with my face mask muggin
Lookin' motherfuckers up and down
It ain't a future in your frontin
Why these fat niggas floatin around?
What happened to them real motherfuckin G's?
Fake motherfuckers need to raise up offa these
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
It's time for me to uh regulate
You feel me?
You fuckin' wit niggaz that's insecure, watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me till you sure
I ain't beggin just tryin' to relocate between ya legs
Drippin wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight beggin to sex me got you undressin to test me and uh...
Shut me down if ya want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharin skirts
I hopin you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is bangin' got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of tryin' to make my songs pay
Makin' love all day against the wall in the hallway
Ya fantasies come alive, ya heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this Thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a Thug in your life
Cause busters ain't lovin' you right
Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see ya blushin like ya want somethin', come get a taste
Of Amerikaz Most Wanted and let's get into some touchin, erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of bustin' until you learn ya lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass
You can ride out the spoke coke, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga whose spoke coke can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we wind and grind
And when I'm on the field keep him on the sidelines
Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got ya naked
Totally sweatin, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissin' till yo' head swang, I'm so into you
Witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know, now scream my name out
Do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss playa, freaky motherfucker, can I dig
Uh, it's on and poppin', now you see what I was seein
Why yo' eyes rollin', Luke seen ya girl I ain't goin'
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stresed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold da boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm goin' home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You in the presence of a playa, I'd rather be ya nigga
Hear me! Boo-yaow!
What type nigga be a Thug Life nigga?
There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggaz die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin' drunk to keep from goin' under
Gettin' lost in the madness, blunted gettin' tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin, Lord come and get me
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin my clip, I'm watchin every bullet spit when I kick em
Niggaz die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggaz that's caught
Had a motherfuckin ward but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon
It's all about makin' money, gettin' yours
And knockin' coppers off the motherfuckin planet
Word to the motherfuckin nine nigga
We gonna make this motherfucker ours
If they don't feel me, they gon kill me
After all this shit I did with my Mac-11
Did I sell my soul? Mama woulda saved me
That's the way that daddy raised me
Oh God, help me I'm losin it
So fuck it! Take me I'm doin' it!
I need to change and look for a better way
I got a hundred round clip to my AK
Committin sins I might die in vain
So fuck it! We'll live off the street fame!
God didn't send me in the right direction
I'm gettin' hit by a diesel in the intersection
Till then I'ma smoke motherfuckers
Things wouldn't be so bad
If we got the things that we never had, I'm ready for whatever
Big ballin-ass Syke
Yeah nigga, you schooled them young bustas
On how it is to be a real motherfuckin G
In the nine-trey motherfuckers is dyin' daily so you best be packin
Dear mama I know you worry 'cause I'm hardly at home
Every other night in jail, got you patient by the phone
Wanna shake it 'cause I can't take it got me livin' in Hell
Like I'm walkin' with a secret that'll kill me if I tell
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
Not to the brain, going insane, just a part of the game
So much caine in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
And let the devil feel the wrath of a nigga
Goin' to Hell with my finger on the trigger
Now everybody's starin'
Got a nigga losin hair and they wonder if I'm all there
Well don't blame me, blame the flame that flickers
Now tell me if you wanna live forever

In the city wit' no pity, down wit' Thug Life, we doin' it live!
Everytime we side on you trick made bitches.

When we glide wit' my nigga Pac we bustin' 'em niggaz
On th block wit' Gangsta-D back up me your real OG
Comin' up outta the 7 T rees.
Strick 9 to the LHD
We claimin' to bring we make 'em fiend
For the fact we havin' 'em stack on the map
For the city of Sac al the way to the Jo' when stroll
Rebel, rebel, rebel
They just can't stand the reign
Or the occasional pain
Of a man like me who goes against the grain.
Sometimes I do it in vain
So wit the little bass and treble ain't missed a
So it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel.
Cold as the devil.
Straight from the underground, the rebel alone laughs.
They came to see the maniac sychopath.
The critics heard of me and the aftermath.
I don't give a damn and it shows.
A when I do a stage show I wear street clothes.
I give a shout out to your homies.
Maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G.
On the streets or on TV, it just don't pay the be a truth tellin' MC.
They won't be happy till I'm banned.
For point blank in your face, pump up the bass, and join the human race.
I throw peace to the Bay.
'Cause from the jungle to Oaktown, they backin me up all the way.
You know ya gotta love the sound.
Now I'm face to face with the devil.
'Cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto.
And police brutality,
Put you in a nip and call it technicality.
So you reap what you soe.
So read the wrath of the rebel jackin 'em up once more.
Now the fox is in the henhouse.
Creepin' up on your daughter, while you asleep
I got her sneakin out.
Tupac ain't nuttin nice.
I'll be nothin' how I wanna and do it when I'm gonna.
Now I'm up to no good.
The mastermind of mischief movin more than most could.
So sit and slip into the sound.
They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down.
But I never let it get me.
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me.
In fact, they tryin' to keep me out.
Try to censor what I say 'cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout.
So what's wrong with the media today.
Got brothers sellin out 'cause they greedy to get paid.
But me, I'm comin' from the soul.
And if it don't go gold, my story still get told.
And that way they can't stop me.
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy.
It's sloppy, don't even try to.
I'm a slave to the rhythm and I'm about to fly through.
When ya hear the bass roll, go ahead and let go.
Now everybody wanna gangbang.
They talkin' street slang, but the punk still can't hang.
By makin' records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent.
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin out, just to get your record out.
But 2pacalpyse is straight down.
Rebel, rebel, rebel
They just can't stand the reign

And baby you can be my lady
But you gotta give a nigga space
Or you'll drive me crazy

But I ain't tha one to play tha fool
Can't make no money in bed
So ain't no future fuckin' you

Can't do a damn thang for you
If you ain't about money
Nine outta ten
I'll ignore you

Throw up tha block

Then twist you lame tricks
Holla if ya understand my plan ladies
Fuck havin' babies by them shady ass niggas

Checkin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss ya
Soft as tissue
So my next issue is 'how to diss you ?'
They call me Storm
From tha day I was born

Till his hearts warm

Just 'cause we bone
Don't mean you own me
Nigga, I'm grown
I'll be waiting for you
Until you get through
I'd rather run tha streetz to make some mail
And put tha game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm chosen
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples
How I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this
Because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspecious and to wonder
And at tha end I make a come up
Nigga, was raiseed up
Off of M.O.B.
Fighting over something
That's tellen me don't run tha streetz
So tell me am I wrong?
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in tha morning
By sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plotin' on plans that we made
And all tha fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3'
And don't be late nigga
We hagin' out all night
While drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's popin' at a club
But they say I can't get in
'Cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die
I'll be game related
Got me strivin' for a million
Stayin' motivated
Now that we made it
It's a battle
Just for tha big money
I'm livin' wild
No smiles
Cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry
Just a little nigga
Tryin' to make it
I only got one chance
So I gotta take it
Ya never know when it's all gonna happen
Tha rappen or tha drugs
But until then
Give me love
And let me Run tha Streetz
I'll be waiting for you
Until you get through
If you a bad boy
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
I focus my locus thought on my enemies
Sip off the Hennessey it's necessary to finish me
I'm in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them niggas they think I'm crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin' to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin' on to spin the tires
My man define ya 357 anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin at Prodigy
Mobb 6 feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict, who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted
Ever since mama got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin less love in the drug house
Similar to savage it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
Why fear me, fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin' street
Like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath, a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Halfway thugs are buged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big pussy throw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked extorting
Block shots with 22's with my socks with the butt hangin' out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin
Catch my body like haitian 5 minutes from the station
Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick don't mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around 10 niggas bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfucker bleed
All the money was bloody as shit, y'all niggas shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bow down on your knees shit
The glock to your head nigga, don't let inside action
Hit innocent by - standers when he blasted, shot fucken backwards
Little homies puttin' work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g - rides runnin' red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since I'm an outlaw like Napoleon ain't no cell they can hold me in
Caucassian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some niggas fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product nigga I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with I'm some immortal shit
Outlawz we straight hurtin' shit use artillery to murder with
Put then on the box gangsta party like Pac
Lifes hard from the ox me and my niggas on top
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
With the leaded Pac, fuck the law
Carry steal 'cause I live in the nigga side of the law
Ridin' foes 'cause I can't let hoes catch me slippin
Quick to blow and dispose if you block on hittin
Ridin' high, blazing, kryptonite got a nigga dazing
Burpin and smurkin got on his knees before I grave em
Ride em, look behind him, I see him, he slipped
At a stop light in a growin' night, this motherfucken trick
Slide over so I can dip and put it in him
Damn, I guess this motherfucker know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speeding
With the metal trying to make these motherfuckers die freezing
Up the way I seen him slow down
Shit! I think I'm gonna bust these hoes down
Caught them runnin' on e it kind of funny to me
They know they was fuckin' with me but they dumb to see
Open up fire watchin me spy when my shells split em
Plus all them tricks and the bitches go to hell with em
Fuck 'em they phony claimin they homies but the foes
Speakin' on thug niggas daily while we nailing they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
Crooked thoughts cops get bought no longer caught
Did you cry when my girl died
Put out the hit politc niggas worldwide grabbin my dick
I'll never learn take away the pain with sherm
Throwin' gas on my enemies watchin them burn
Call my posse, I'm shootin up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a piaata and party
His last breath a straight lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
Between you and Biggie was like who gon', who gon'
Who rules the entertainment industry, basically
I was like this, is like a fuckin' election, you know what I'm sayin'?
It is, it is that me and Biggie situation was smaller
Than that me and Biggie situation was like
Why am I fighting to live if I 'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no-one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
Check it, I grew up a fucking screw up
Got introduced to the game got an ounce and fucking blew up
Chopping rocks over night
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into black Frank White
We had a code dress to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Showed they codes know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch an asthma attack
That's why I bust back and don't face me
When he drop take his glock and I'm swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold a glock
Bust some weight, lay back I got some money to make
Motherfucker
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no-one gives me a try?
But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crash
As I laugh pushing the gas while my glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple movies now the whole worlds trying to screw me
Even the cops trying to sue me, so what can I do but stay true
Sippin' twenty two's of brew
And now the media is trying to test me
Got the prest asking question, tryin' to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police's shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slip got arrested and flipped
He screamed Thug life! and emptied a clip
Got shot runnin' from the police
Why am I fighting to live if I 'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no-one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
I was shocked at everything, know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked at him
Pac is a strong dude, you know, I know, dude, know what I'm sayin'?
He's real strong
So when they was like he got shot I was more like Again?
Huh, you know what I'm sayin'?
He always gettin' shot or shot at
He gon' pull through this one again
Make a few records about it and it's goin' to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But he when he died I was like Oh!
You know what I'm sayin'?
But even though we was going through our drama
I will never wish death on nobody, you know
'Cause they be coming back from death
Yo, we've been all around the world
I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
Eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song
That I'm singing, dinga-linging
Funky beats ringin', everybody's swingin'
In the place as I kick the J A Z Z Y style
R&B mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it won't be long
Till I'm gone - It's just the same old song
It's just a freestyle, meanwhile we keep the beat kickin
Sweat drippin, girlies in the limo eatin chicken
Oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezin, but still I'm pleasin to all the slimmies
Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a Jenny
If it's good and plenty, don't you know
There I go, there I go, there I go
When I'm rappin', as if she's clappin, then I'm strappin', 'cause I'm smarter than that
Then, girlie, maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song
All around the world, same song
It's the same ol' song, y'all
All all around the world same song
Uh, it's just the same ol' song
All around the world same song
It's the same song
All all around the world same song
Money B, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky
Up and down, well, as a matter of fact I'll be right back I gotta take a leaky
So I'm drainin' entertainin',
But I got fame and the bases I touch to much for me to try to be namin
Aiyyo, you saw me on cable and grinned
I busted in and I was goin' to win
A Clark Gable back in Oakland, it's the same old song
To sporty shorties, same freckles and hat
Drinkin' the same 40
Hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip
Just like butter, my ryhmes are legit
'Cause I'm the humpty. Not humpty dumpty, but humpty hump
Here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump
Ah, shut up and just listen, not dissin', don't get me wrong
But to me it's just the same old song
So just watch, my name is Shock, I like to rock and you can't stop this
2Pac go ahead, rock this
Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground
Girls who used to frown, say I'm down, when I come around
Gas me and when they pass me, they used to diss me
Harrass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high
Same song can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
All around the world, same song
The same ol' song, y'all
All all around the world same song
And ya don't, ya don't, check it
All around the world same song - it's the same song
Ya don't stop - it's just the same song
All all around the world same song
Hibbie dibbie ya don't quit
All around the world same song
Ah yeah, Humpty Hump in the house y'all
All all around the world same song
You know what - it's the same ol' song
All around the world same song
All all around the world the same song
Ah...
All around the world, same song ...
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
War Time
War Time, it's either yourz or mine
Outlawz be on a grind, and a mission to shine
And ride on em', leave em' stuck and fucked from the gate
Hesitate, aww, now you know what
Y'all niggaz were here to go
If you know it was good for ya
Buncha toy souljahs all dressed in fatigue
But I'm Edi Amin on a mission to make 'em bleed
Nigga what?, Nigga who?
It was cool? and at you?, what the fuck is gone do?
Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga splippin', fall at the same time
We all laced in the chain, tryin' to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine
But when you could do yourz, we'll bring these muthafuckas war
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
As I approach the scene, from smokin' green
Got my eyes closed, niggaz so cold on my foes
I make em' die froze
Watch me make em' bleed, make em' G's
Lord help me wit'it
Got me paintin' pictures of a mil-ticket
Help me get'it
See me and pray for options
And this pressures, nonstop
Niggaz get the pistol poppin'
And watch they body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set
Flash on, blast on them bitch-made niggaz wit' my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons hittin' weed
Got me hearin' screamin'
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope-fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggaz pass the cush and watch me bring em' to the floor
I got the Secretz of War
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
We do this thug life shit, like 4, 5, 6, dick em'
Squeeze the lead off, I blow his mutha fuckin' head off
Signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
These streetz is black hockey and raw we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar
Locked in the slammer, while I'm laid cocked back like a hammer
Y'all newly weds that in honey moons, times bout up
Y'all, that means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce, stuck
Your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gonna do?
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
Yo, we go to war
We check the murder rate percentage
Niggaz is finished
Get blood checks from clinics
This thug shit is in us
Flowin' through my system, you a victim
Blunts, I twist em', fuck the whole world
It's us against them
You got some teeth?, pull it out
Cock the hammer if you wit' it, don't make
No difference if, wit' 20 by the life sentence
We already doin' life on the streetz
Like Ali G, niggaz be heated, when they walkin' the beat
This shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggaz hate me
Scared to face me, knowin' that the Outlawz blaze me
Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I suck my money muscle, all the G's got devils
Movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggaz like Rodney
Turn a killa like Kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
We go to war
Bring it on
And all you lil' young ass souljahs
You play this shit back about fifteen times
You'll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin'
Teach these bitches a lil' somethin', you know what I mean?
Secretz of muthafuckin' War...
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
War Time
War Time, it's either yourz or mine
Outlawz be on a grind, and a mission to shine
And ride on em', leave em' stuck and fucked from the gate
Hesitate, aww, now you know what
Y'all niggaz were here to go
If you know it was good for ya
Buncha toy souljahs all dressed in fatigue
But I'm Edi Amin on a mission to make 'em bleed
Nigga what?, Nigga who?
It was cool? and at you?, what the fuck is gone do?
Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga splippin', fall at the same time
We all laced in the chain, tryin' to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine
But when you could do yourz, we'll bring these muthafuckas war
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
As I approach the scene, from smokin' green
Got my eyes closed, niggaz so cold on my foes
I make em' die froze
Watch me make em' bleed, make em' G's
Lord help me wit'it
Got me paintin' pictures of a mil-ticket
Help me get'it
See me and pray for options
And this pressures, nonstop
Niggaz get the pistol poppin'
And watch they body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set
Flash on, blast on them bitch-made niggaz wit' my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons hittin' weed
Got me hearin' screamin'
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope-fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggaz pass the cush and watch me bring em' to the floor
I got the Secretz of War
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz

Secretz of muthafuckin' War...
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
Game rules often slang to the right fools
Heavy hittin' at this motherfucker's straight spittin'
Diggin' deep into your brain while tryin' to explain
Why real niggas need to stick to the game
It's the same got these motherfuckers changin' on me
Jealous-ass player-haters gaming on me
Look out motherfucker homey-G
As in gettin' motherfuckers 'fore they come get me
Get down for the right for the wishes
Fake ass nigga, you in shit, for fightin' over bitches
You call that a player?
Straight-ass sissy
See me at my show nigga miss me
'Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit
Got a pistol motherfucker better pull quick
And just 'cause I'm rappin' don't mean I ain't scrappin
And if you clip when the shit happens, it don't stop
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin' at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
See the shit don't stop
My 9 goes pop
Your body drip-drop
Throw that ass in a zip-loc
Now you've been hauled away in a body bag
Get your Sammy D said how your blood got sneeze me
Yo you fuckin' with a thug yo your ass gets plugged
With this hollow-point slugs
With ya under the rug
That's why my deaf niggas don't play that shit
In thug life niggas be the craziest
So when you think about fuckin' this
You better wear a vest
But it really don't matter
We ain't aimin' at your chest
Nah we blowin' holes in your motherfuckin' skull
Make sure your ass is smoked
That's all the fat lady wrote
You heard that fat bitch sing when my shit went bang-bang
But it don't pay when I flaunt your brain
Nigga, ain't no plain cane brothers come no show
In the casket
Git'n they ass kicked
And blasted
It don't stop
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin' at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
All I wanna do is try to Mac the hoes
Spin bank on thangs sellin me a sponsor on my foes
It's like each and every one they got the look of death
I got my 9 nigga
Don't be silly
You better watch your step
And pussies we crossin when my crew is flossin'
Bitches we tossin'
And niggas we crossin'
It's like a murder rhyme when we hit your hood
It's all good
The punks? I wish you would!
Wouldn't better to just corrolate what we bust
Instead of kickin' dust
Gets a press y'all from nuts
Cause ain't no herbs here
And ain't no morgues
Beware of the water 'cause they full of sharks
But in every state
Niggas perpetrate and test
Where I come from fools die for less
And thugs keep thugin' till their casket drop
It's on till I die
And the shit don't stop
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin' at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
Say he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug
Said he wanna be
One day he's gonna be
Said he's wanna be
Shorties gonna be's a Thug
Said he's gonna be
One day he gonna be
Say he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug
Said he gonna be
One day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug
He was a nice middle class nigga
But nobody knew the evil he'd do When he got a little bigger
Get off the final blaze
While puffing on a Newport
Plottin' on a another way to catch a case
Was only sixteen, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas
But you the only one who ain't telling
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me it's a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, 'n break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commencing to money makin' tactics
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My fingers on the trigga, Tell the lord
To make way for another straight Thug Nigga
I'm sitting getting buzzed, looking for some luv
From the homies, 'cause shorty wanna be a Thug
Straight from the Hall to the Penn
Adolescent nigga scaling weight and standing Six feet Ten
He carried weight like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on some playa haters
If the mutha fuckas act tuff
Then that's when the lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast pull the trigga
Could take the life of a young nigga guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the niggas all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Released with this game till it's a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear and it ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm trying to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark getting buzzed, looking for some love
Out with the homies, 'cause shorty wanna be a Thug
Shorty gonna be a thug
You little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
Gotta stay sharp nigga, play your part
Watch the signs
Damn, you ain't but sixteen nigga?
Sixteen?!?!
That's a bad muthafucker
We's gonna talk about these scandalous hoes
I know you that's why we gonna do it
Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin' around with the piano nigga
Just drop that shit like uh, this here
I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no lovin' from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, Never breathing again
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin ass, triiick
Used to watch you money grabbin, who you baggin beeyitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin' scandalous
Scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
How's it hangin'? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin'
I've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin' to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin'
This bitch'll have ya wakin' up with all your cash missin'
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin' at a bitch who specialize in tellin' lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister ? in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't where we're goin', she's makin' me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin'?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me off guard
Went in the purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous
Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin' riches
I'm spittin' at tricks 'cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded
This is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin' you could be true
When I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggaz doin' time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin' well
Bustin' at niggaz who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me
I'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans
Can't wait till I see L.A., 'cause it's so scandalous
Aiyyo... how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be
A bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin' with a nigga 35
Gettin' him for ends
Hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent
When these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long
Watch them hoes
All you niggaz out there
Beware these lyin' ass scandalous bitches
Quit'staring at me like a infra-red nigga
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close there eyes seeing dreams in they sleep
But don't fall a sleep
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on
Pictures of plenty
Sippin' my glass full of Henny
Hands on my Semi -
- Automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact
'Cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire
Niggas die with open eyes
Scared to take a nap
It's a trap
A long maze
Dreamin' of getting stacks
Makin' scratch the wrong way
What song says
We murder motherfuckas daily
Black out
Blow the the track out
My lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed
Then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the East to West
Like Yayo
Niggas pull out
When I say so
Commence to poppin'
Motherfuckers copy it's fatal
Efficiently I delete and flee
The art of war living sucka free
Get with me
Mutherfuckers just don't sleep
I'm staring through my rear-view doing 'bout 90
The pedal to the metal
So I can't see what's behind me
Buckle up your seat belt
Eyes on the road
They know we riding dirty got playa hiding Gold
They go down to the projects, the clubs been closed
And then they wonder why niggas braking down O's
I'm a runaway slave
You get it nigga, off the chain
I got that Thug Life shit running through my veins
And now they scared
They knowing that I've been heaven sent
And yeah we know the dop coming from the President
But look at us
We ain't got shit to lose
The life we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes
In the Ghetto
Or better yet home-sweet-home
This is the land of the free, but to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the White House
Strapped with my heat
So don't fall asleep
Come on nigga
They say that the more they hate you
The more that it motivates you
My minds set on crime, my mentals set on the paper
62 hours and counting and I'm still awake
And they slipping me sleeping pill's with the will I break
Broke niggas always telling you how to make your cash and just
So I just stop listening and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media they always mad at us
I don't see them trying to mediate when they get they Gat's and bust
They just instigating as soon as they get the tape, it's dropped
And my niggas locked as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't tripping on all that rapping stuff
I'm taking back my money counter's wasn't fast enough
Yup
I got a couple problems
And none of them is money
And pretend they love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to mauve with the Ruger
Kill ya like Freddie Kruger
These nightmare's just ain't as bloody
Money talks to I always have voice to answer this
I can't relax 'cause it's like I'm a fetty activist
See me on TV never a mattress
Don't go to sleep nigga
Don't close your eyes
Don't go to sleep
Sleep baby
Yeah! ha ha yeah... that's right!
The F.A's comin' striaght from the wild wild west
Look at baby girl born in 19-7-deuce
Pop's on his fix, Mom's stuck on that crazy juice
Went to school, It's all cool but in Junior Hiiigh
Little hooker in the bathroom getting hiiigh
What she doing and what she smoking, nobody knows
Is she addicted or just slipping into melbose
A bad ass broad running with the girl gang
Just got some tat's, Talking all that girl slang.
First one to slap, because La vida don't matter
Wip out a cuete watch your brains get splattered
Selling them doves, hanging with thugs and all that
Beating up fools with a baseball bat
Started having sex at only 14
Imagine O.G. wears his clothes all crisp and clean
Got pregnant had a baby in December
She wont see the daddy till next September
Mom's and Pop's gave her the boot
Kicked her out La Casa, Now what Raza
With the money she got, She bought a spot of the block
Started paying the rent by slangin' phat ass coca rocks
Now she's 23 her four kids all alone, and loc'ed out
And plus she's all smoked out, the base face
You could see it in her eyes, it could also tell the tears
Of a life long cries.
They was headed for self destruction
Her own kids gotta healp, 'cause they knew she was slippin'
Took the devil away homegiiirl, You was Slippin'.
Slipping into Darkness
When you slip you trip and fall
Slipping into Darkness
Ain't no sense to give y'all no love at all
They say we're slipping, as a whole one race
So, what we gonna choose, Don't want the blues
I turn to the news and what do I see
We got blacks against blacks, browns against browns
Whites against whites, from governments to undergrounds
So, Peep the sound as it bumps through your stereo
Ear to your brain now check out the scenerio
Cali got quakes, Mudslides, and Floods
Hustlas, Pimps, Shot Callers, and Killas
O.G., Macks, and the big Coca Dealers
We got homeboys who just like kicking it
And Vato's like me who grab the mic and start splitting it
So get closer to the funk and slip into the backseat.
They wanna band me cause a brothas makin' noise a lot
Ill shoot they ass in a sec wit a poison dart
They got me runnin' down the street gettin' hotter
Runnin' from the cops as I try to clock my glock
The war wont stop
That's why they wanna band the music
You ever notcie how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin wit a Mexican
We can all have peace, the sun sets again
They try to shove us in the pen
But we clown and we frown every time we hit the top ten
Once again, it's your friend outta oakland, hopin
To keep the hip hop clubs open
Now we can lay back and let them close'm
Or we can have beef and show that we control'em
Now ain't nobody gettin' paid, it's a damn shame
Why gang bang brothas in the same gang?
They say securitys to blame, 'cause they lettin it off
Brothas come to have fun but they settin it off
One time, make it worse when they sweat us
Send an army of pigs to come get us
Now I'm runnin' outta time and I'm cool down with the aztecs
This is sorta like soul food
I shall not fear no man, but God
Though I walk through tha valley of death
I shed so many tears
Please God walk with me...
Back in Elementry, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside mind couldn't find a place ta rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can ya feel me?
I'm not liven in tha Past, You wanna last
Be tha first ta blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deseased
Call on tha sirens, I seem him murdered in tha streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a 'G' ?
Remember me, so many homies in the cemetery
Shed so many tears
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business
By any means, label me greedy gettin' green
But seldom seen
And fuck tha world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leaven here in a hurse
God can ya feel me?
Take me away from all tha pressure and all tha pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial
And when I Die, babtised in Eternal Fire
Shed so many tears...
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Now I'm lost and I'm weary
So many tears, I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a compilated step
Ta bring me closer
To embrace an early death now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on tha streets
I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screaming peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' ta break free
They planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
Will I survive till tha morning ta see tha sun
Please lord forgive me for my sins
Cause here I come...
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
God
I lost so many peers and
Lord knows I've tried, been a witness ta homicide
Drive-bys taken lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken hearted as I glance at tha chaulk line, gettin' high
This ain't tha life for me
I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me
I'm stuck in tha game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tangaray influenced me ta gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately
I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady
'Cause she's a product of this poison, I'm hearen noises
Think she's fucken on my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to tha floor
Beggin' for tha Lord ta let me in Heavens door
I shed so many tears...
Lord
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
I suffered through tha years and shed so many tears
I shall not fear no man, but God
Though I walk through tha valley of death
I shed so many tears
Please God walk with me...

Remember me, so many homies in the cemetery
Shed so many tears
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business
By any means, label me greedy gettin' green
But seldom seen
And fuck tha world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leaven here in a hurse
God can ya feel me?
Take me away from all tha pressure and all tha pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial
And when I Die, babtised in Eternal Fire
Shed so many tears...
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Now I'm lost and I'm weary
So many tears, I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a compilated step
Ta bring me closer
To embrace an early death now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on tha streets
I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screaming peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' ta break free
They planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
Will I survive till tha morning ta see tha sun
Please lord forgive me for my sins
Cause here I come...
Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
God
I lost so many peers and
Lord knows I've tried, been a witness ta homicide
Drive-bys taken lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken hearted as I glance at tha chaulk line, gettin' high
This ain't tha life for me
I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me
I'm stuck in tha game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tangaray influenced me ta gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately
I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady
'Cause she's a product of this poison, I'm hearen noises
Think she's fucken on my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to tha floor
Beggin' for tha Lord ta let me in Heavens door
I shed so many tears...
Lord
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
I suffered through tha years and shed so many tears
So what I'm gonna do, hopefully is... I wanna be, uhm not a wannabe I am 2Pac Shakur!
2Pac!
2005!
Guess who's back? G-G-Guess who's back?
G-G-Guess who's back? G-G-Guess who's back?

Posse deep as I role through the streets
Muthafuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so long you think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beat, I'm robbin' niggas through the teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play tuffy
Last time them niggas rushed me, I ain't bust but now I'm touchy
Trust me, ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buck shots
Them niggas got enough knots, I'm poppin' corrupt cops
You muthafuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem, now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Muthafuckin' Soldier, ready to role and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Role to the door, through a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' 'cause wouldn't stop until they rugged out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's & them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
20 cops, one for every year in jail
Tryin' to keep a nigga down, but you failed
Before I let you take me, I told ya
Fuck bein' trapped, I'm a Soldier.
I betcha that I got something you ain't got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G 'cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do 'cause that ain't you, you just frontin'.
You ain't?
It's 2Pac in the mad bitch
In them .64 rag on them things, that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghosts on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the backseat, nigga when we clown.
Homey is you down?
B got the strap and she anxious
Hurry up 'fo she spank shit
Comin' round the corners, spittin' rounds
They payin' homey down
Caught them sucker ass bitches outta bounce.
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day.
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day.
Stinkin' biatch!

I've changed...
You mothafuckas kill me
I've changed...
It ain't that I've changed
But it's strange how you mothafuckas rearrange
When I found fame
Point ya finger at tha bad guy
You know what my momma usta tell me
If ya can't find something ta live 4
Then you best, find something ta die 4
Repeats through interlude
Deep deep
La'tasha Hardings
Remember that name...
Cause a bottle of juice...
Is not something 2 die 4
Young Quaid
Remember that name...
Cause all you mothafuckas
That go to your grave with that name on your brain
Cause jelousy and recklousness
Is not, something 2 die 4
All you Niggas out there
Got a crack that crumbles
Unite
One nigga, teach 2 niggas
4 niggas teach more niggas
All tha poor niggas
Tha penn niggas
Tha rich niggas
Tha strong niggas
Unite
There's more of us than there is of them
Look around...
Check your strip
Deep deep
That's something 2 die 4
Black
That's something 2 live 4
What do I know?
Something wicked this way come
Something wicked this way come
Something wicked this way come
Something wicked this way come
Something wicked this way come
Something wicked this way come
More than an adversary I' m very quick
I' m ready to hit 'em with this gift
I' m equipped to kick
Grab you coat and you hat, 'cause I' m prepared to clamp
Oh shit 2pacalypse is back and strapped
Attacking the pacs, I' m kicking the facts for stacks to rap
And those that max, relax and let the blacks get jacks
I' m getting taxed, my pacs is packed with angry blacks
I' m ready to go
I' m ripping the shows, hitting the dough
Getting the hoes
Pumping the flow, gangster ho
Cause the nose knows
Check the pose, froze, when you see me close
Punks you gonna roast, host, in a cloud of smoke
Broke, choked on a rope, and then smoked
Wrote, crimes that'll bring me back notes
Nope, I ain't the type of fella that you use though
Kkkkkkicking the funky flava
Run for cover when you hear the bass drop
One verse is all it takes
Something wicked this way come
Wicked wicked this way comes
Wicked wicked this way comes
Wicked wicked this way comes
Something wicked this way come
2PAC
Soon as I get home...
Soon as I get home...
Dear baby it's me
Again stuck inside this mad pen
Tryin' to pay my debt fpor all my sins 
These is penitentiary times
Be so heavy on my mind 
At times... it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell
Stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail 
Waitin' for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks 
And mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder how long will I last
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Bustas is shady 
So I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin'... so crystal clear I see it
Even though you mad at me 
You'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come... so easily
I max out in the morning baby life is good
Me and you against the whole hood 
Soon as I come home...
Garb my strap
Locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a warzone
Soon as I come home...
Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin' 
But now you out in the world... while I'm twisted in prison
Love letters come daily
Words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures... beggin' for some sex 
Stay wide open keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is keep it it real or you could die squealin'
Plus I never have to worry about a visit 
'Cause you're there daily
Gaurds tryin' to get your number
You don't dare tell me
Tongue kissin' steady humpin'
Tryin' to touch you somethin'
'Fore the C.O. in the corner jump in
Frontin'
Late nights reminiscin'
Everybody's queit
I think somethin's in the air 
Prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks
Steel from the bed springs 
I touch 'em with thug love
And then let they heads ring
Started a war but now I'm gone 
Release me to the streets in the morning
It's on 
Soon as I get home...
Grab my gats
Locate my comrades 
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Let's get my money out the safe 
It's time to turn the streets into a warzone
Soon as I get home...
Kadafi
Since you've been gone 
My whole life's been like a game of c-low
Take and pick like they keep a c-note
Fillin' my dreams like Nino... Brown
The whole town be shook up
And me and mama survivin' 
Depends on how many rocks... the young nigga cook up 
Narcotics got drastic
Seen 'em niggas you blated 
Wantin' me in a casket
On the grind coppin' plastic
Yeah nigga I heard
Little Moo gave the word
You get parol on the third
It's all out we just heard 
We out here frontin' 
Still here but all about nothin'
My double o's what I'm wantin' 
And I'm tryin' to see somethin'
That we ain't never had
Luxury life results... livin' bad
Tricks of the trade 
Shit that should've been taught by dad
But learned through the crew 
Lessons between me and you 
And once we lock this shit down 
It ain't a thing they could do
Meawhile I stay waitin' by the phone 
Hopin' I get the call
Tellin' a nigga that you home...
2PAC

You got whites killin' blacks
Cops killin' blacks
And blacks killin' blacks
Shit just gonna get worse
They just gonna become souljas
Straight souljas
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja

Crack done took apart of our family tree
My momma's on tha shit, my dadies splitten, mom's steady blaming me
Is it my fault, just 'cause I'm a young black male
Cop sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sells
Only 15 and got problems
Cops on my tail, so I bail till I dodge 'em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
Remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass
Now I gotta murder case
You speak a' Heaven punk, I never heard of tha place
What is it ta come up fast, got a Uz and a black mask
Drop tha fuckin' task, now who's tha jack ass
Keep my shit cocked, cause tha cops got a glock too
What tha fuck would you do
Drop them or let 'em drop you
I chose droppin' tha cop
I got me a glock, and a glock for tha niggas on my block
4 of'em tried ta stab me, I moved out
Sold a pound a weed, made g's, bought a new house
I'm only 17, I'm tha new kid
I got me a crew, bought'em jewels, and a uzi
But all good things don't last
Task came fast, and busted my black ass
Coolen in tha pen, where tha goods kept
Now my little brother wants ta follow in my footsteps
A soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
Buck, buck, pigs get fucked, don't step ta this
Quiet has kept them blessed, on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em they come and test, and tha rest, nigga gets hectic
Here's tha aneirexic, I'm making it to an exit
Walkin' through tha streets on tha black tip
Packed with several gats, 'cause I'm also payin' back shit
Niggas don't wanna try me, brotha you'll get shot down
Now I'm kick'en tha block, cause my bigger brothers locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other cops see me on tha block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brotha what he needs is some weed up ta season
Tell him just be ready set, pack ya shit up quick
And when I hit, be prepared ta jet
Niggas from tha block on tha boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke pow
These punks about ta get hit by tha best
I'm wear'en double vest, so aim at my fuckin' chest
I'll be makin' straight dome calls
Touch tha button on tha wall, you'll be picken up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout, hit tha pig nigga
Break your bigga brother out
I got a message for tha warden
I'm commin' for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in tha mess hall, yes y'all
A crazy motherfucka makin' death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin'
For every minute you stall, one y'all bleedin'
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walken out, I caught a bullet in tha head
Tha screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gonna pull through, he deserve to
Tha fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following tha tracks of a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
Straight soulja, 1993, all of it.
Mr. Shakur, can you please explain the meaning
Behind your violent lyrics?
Explain the meaning?
The fuck these niggaz talkin' bout?
My message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
Take a closer look
Tryin' to stay jail free
Of young black males?
Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
Than the 4th of July, if I gotta die, I gotta
Game is what she gave me
That's not the way we made it
My message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
Cops pull me over, check my plates, but I'm legal
Message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
On the streets till the niggaz get a piece, fuck em!
Till the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, hear them screamin
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Till the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, hear them screamin
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Till the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, screamin
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Till the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, screamin
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
The niggaz scream fuck em!
Thinkin' they run the motherfuckin streets
It's mo' niggaz than it's police
One nigga, teach two niggaz
Teach mo' niggaz, and we could run this shit!
They finally pulled me over and I laughed
Starin' through my rearview
Just lookin' back at the world
From another level
Starin'...
Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society, first they try
To murder me, then they lie to me, product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed, now the little baby's
Crazed raised off Hennesey, tell me will my enemies
Flee when they see me, believe me
Even Thugs gotta learn to take it easy, listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turnin' Bad Boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin' with a posse
Full of paranoid drug dealers, to the end my friend
I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview,
See I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview see
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers
Now you see em, now you don't, some niggaz
Be here for the moment, and then they gone, what happened to em?
Well let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the, truest
Thug life until I check out of this bitch, I thought you'd know this
Who is, gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview
Half you, is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I feel like southpaws
But still we keep mashin till our dreams come through
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin' days in this livin' black Hell, do you feel me?
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin'
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father I'm a soldier, I'm gettin' hotter
Cause the world's gettin' colder, baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
I say
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly and all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly nigga can die
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets, somethin' I learned
In school, on some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since the seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run
By young guns, Outlawz and truants, shit's deep
Turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burn my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too while starin' through your rearview
Hahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview
So since you ain't knowin' what we mean let me break down understandin
The world, the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin' at the world, from like, behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do, just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggaz do they wanna do, bitch niggaz do what they can't
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, ya know
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time flyand we'll be
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
Heart beatin' fast... time to die
High, watchin time fly, ya know
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you heart beatin' fast... time to die
High, watchin time fly
Starry night, an unknown creation
Written by, and from the archives of Tupac Shakur
Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh
A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
This dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
And you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
But for you there's only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
This world could not accept your masterpieces, from the heart
So on that starry night, you gave to us and you took away from us
The one thing we never acknowledged, your life
Yeah, game laid down by Q, why'knawmsayin?
Vocals by Rasheeda, fly beat by QDIII
And flows by the M-A-see why'all, Mr. M-A-see Mall
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us
Uh, uh, watch me live my art; writing words from my soul in blood
I speak the truth on every thang I love
I'll probably sacrifice my life, to send my message through mics
It's like a war drum calling soldiers at night
It's bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So it's cold n dark and deep like a universe, but nah don't start
It's for ya entertainment but it's my life why all
And I can't rewind, fast forward, or press pause
But when you give your all, it's like the fans demand more
And after the tour I sit alone like before
When ya name is hot it's all love, the world is yours
But when you fall off, you get ignored
You on the cover of da magazine, flossing on the TV screen
Toastin' wit yo' champagne, playin' life like a game
Loaded in the limousine, love to hear the fans scream
Swimmin' wit the sharks now, ain't no love money king
People got they hands out but ain't nobody lendin' hands
Can you really blame dem for tryin' to get what they can?
Late night, bright lights, lust n lies
And anythang goes under the Hollywood sign
Well you might lose ya soul and who knows what you find
But go ahead main we all want to shine
But go ahead main we all want to shine
There you have it
Why'know, when I was younger I prayed, to get in this game
Why'know to hold dis microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs, to let me rock a crowd one day
Why'know let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy Tupac did fo' sho'
And he gave that to me
But he didn't he didn't he didn't let me know
About all the shady shit that's in, in between
You and yo' dream, why'know?
See it's more than the music, I spit it from the heart
So sometime it's cold n it's dark, but it's raw
And that's how I'ma bring it to you every time, why'know?
Yah nigga, Drop the top on your muthafuckin ride
This how we do it on the west coast BAABBBY
Rollin' down the Four O Five
Gettin' high
White boys done wrecked their shit
Tryin' to check my ride
I ain't being bootsy
Crusin' in a Six-o Impala
Drivin' like I'm in a Hooptee
Car full of ballin' caps
Keep yo hand on the strap
And take all the craps
Niggas know my steel-lo
All legit
But I'm drapped
Like a nigga movin' kilo
Shit don't stop
'Cause I can make that ass drop
Make the front pop
And Hit the three wheel motion
All Day
Hit the freeway
Take it easy, uh
Let's slide
And pick-up some hoochies
Ride
Right back to the movies
High
Talking back to the screen drinkin' liquor
Havin' big dreams of gettin' richer
I'm livin' that
Thug Life, y'all know the rules
Big Stretch represent the real nigga
Flex, Live squad and this mutha fucker catch wreck
Thug Life
Sharp as a roughneck
Shakin' the dice, we roll long, ain't nothin' nice
Another one, had to throw another gun
Don't need another case
You can see it on my face son
But I ain't fallin' yet
And I gotta give a shout to where my ball is at
Mophreme Tell 'em why the hoes dream
Gettin' high off a nigga like a dope fiend
'Cause I'm non-stop, and I'm always hustlin'
Twenty four seven, ain't nothin' buck
But when a young G's flippin keys for a livin'
Try to make a mill off the time I'm givin'
Trippin'
Mad
I'm crazy
Can't nobody fade me
And I been goin' insane lately
And everybody tryin' ta hold me back

Thug Life, y'all know the rules
Maaaannnn, I don't worry about the Five-O
If they start,
'Cause it's all about survival
Just stay smart
Keep your mind on your bank roll
Always
Stay ahead of these stank hos
These days
It's an all out rat race
And look at MEEE just caught another cat case
That makes three
My laywers getting cash up the ass
Don't even ask
Why I'm buck wild?
Don't smile
Don't laugh
To the young G's comin' up
Peep game
Don't let the money make you change
Or act strange
Stay broke
It's all in together now
Keep pumping loud
Till the crowd
Bring the top down
Is that Tupac Thug Life?
Hell Yah
Try to dirty up my name
But it's still here
Which way do I turn?
I'm strapped
Lost in the storm
I can't turn back
With that...
Thug Life, y'all know the rules
Straight muthafuckin' ballin'
Part two-
Still ballin'

Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still Ballin'
Ridin' on these niggaz 'cause they lame
In a 6-1 Chevy still heavy in this game

Bust on these bitch made niggaz hit em' up

Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger lord forgive me if I smoke niggaz

And hope the lord understands

Boy I won't be playin'
But clienteles
And rhyme sell's
Question is will you fuckin' niggaz ride for real
Bitch nigga this is g rated
Plus your homeboy won't make your street game fool daisy

Muthafuckers still ballin'
Niggaz wonder why
You can bring your crew

Thug Life!
Still ballin'
Muthafuckers still ballin'
Ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown...
Somebody wake me I'm dreaming, I started as a seed the semen
Swimming upstream, planted in the womb while screaming
On the top, was my pops, my momma screaming stop
From my single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plans for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me asking white Jesus
Will a nigga live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
In the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleeping
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creeping
I can live or die, hope I get some money before I'm gone
I'm only nineteen, I'm trying to hustle on my own
On the spot where everybody and they pops trying to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong 'cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a heroin bong
You can ask my man he's a mind reader
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed nigga
That Hennessy y'all keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggers holla at me, Keep it real G
And my reply till they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise.
Ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown...
I stay sharp as always
Running ya bricks with blitz, do your project always - don't be
Cruz by tools - nigga knows all their
Secrets so war prepared me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems thou, be placing triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot popping out my jeans
...
In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blasting bastards
No faces for open caskets, peeling ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress - Leaving holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew bobby Mo-green in topic
And loot to keep the seams in my motherfucking jeans popping
Leaving ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggers is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker -
And still I rize, and still I rize. and still I rize, still I rize.
Ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown...
Check it
I grew up a fucking screwup
Got introduced to the game
Got a ounce and fucking blew up
Chopping rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying
Ta turn into the black Frank White
It's a red light
How many homies gotta die tonight?
Oh, yeah, stop the gunfight
I can feel it
Somebody's trying to start up a fight
Come on and keep game, uh oh
But you cannot cease the blame
And if you ask me, it's a damn shame
We be taking lives that we can't replace
Over B.S. that don't make sense
We gotta get better than this
We started fighting at our own risk
It was something we couldn't resist
It's a red light
How many homies gotta die tonight?
We had to grow dreads
To change our description
Two cops is on a milkbox missing
Showed they toes
You know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets
A chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and
Catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back
It don't faze me
When he drop, take his glock
And I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape
Sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make
Motherfucker
From the five-oh
Ducking and dodging and my survival
Depends on when I let off with my nine-oh
I'm moving swifter
Than the next nigga
No time for sex
'Cause in my mind
All I wonder is who's next
Nigga, my homey slipped
And now he pays the price
He did a drive-by, sixteen
Now he's doin' triple life
Tell me is it me or my upbringing
I spit that thug shit
Nigga motherfuck singing
I hope you got your
Timberlands on tight
'Cause I ain't givin' up
I'd rather duck these
Motherfuckers all night
I'm running through
The projects, beyotch
They'll never catch me
'Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy
On the sneotch
Don't say you never heard of me
Till they murder me, I'm a legend
Do Thug Niggas go to heaven
I'm rolling with the thorough heads
We getting ghost on them hoes and yo
I got no love for the five-oh
I'm running from the police
Stop the gunfight
I can feel it
Somebody's trying to
Start up a fight
Come on and keep game, uh oh
But you cannot cease the blame
And if you ask me, it's a damn shame
We be taking lives that we can't replace
You got swishes in your system
Juice up in
Now you're red again
Over what he said
Over what she said
Now somebody gotta end up dead
I would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks...
But now...
The game is to be sold and not told
So eh, fuck me
I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block.
Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks.
Learn to throw them thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked.
And niggas laugh, till tha first mothafucka got blasted.
I put the nigga in his casket,
Now they coverin' the basket with plastic.
I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts.
I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce.
And gettin' ghost on the five-o, fuck them hos.
Got a 45 screamin' about survival.
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo.
Hollar one-time when I say so.
Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences.
Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches.
And they say how do you survive weighin' 165
In a city where the skinny niggas die?
Tell Mama don't cry.
Even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
I'm str8 ballin'!
Str8 ballin'!
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it.
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'.
It's kinda boomin' round the way and today I'll make a killin'.
Dressin' down like a villain', but only on the block.
It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops.
Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends.
I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz.
I hate to strip let my music bump,
Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck.
Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo.
A need money in a major way.
Time to fuck my BEEEYATCH! Hey!, and getten' paid
You other mothafuckas callin',
But me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas,
We str8 ballin'!
Str8 ballin'!
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do.
So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to RAISE UP!
But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes
Young nigga time to do or die.
I keep a pistol in my pocket,
Ready on my block.
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit.
And now they see that mothafucka beat pain,
At point blank range 'cause he slept on the game.
Ain't a damned thing changed
Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em,
If you can't stand pain better hold 'em.
Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll.
You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga.
Better live your life to the fullest,
You 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it.
Cause even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
We str8 ballin'!
We str8 ballin'!
To my niggas in the penitentiary,
Loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me.
Cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born,
And once again it's on,
I'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone.
Who the hell can you get to stop me?
I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse.
I keep my glock cocked
I need it 'cause they're all shady.
I finally made it
Now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me!
I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back.
I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack.
And I came up a long way from food stamps.
And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps.
Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire.
What could I do? Pull my trigga or watch my nigga die.
I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs.
I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs.
And mothafucka, we be ballin'!
All mothafuckin' day long, stay strong!
We str8 ballin'.
I would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks...
But now...
The game is to be sold and not told

It was a dope spot front yard, one on one strapping
That's the way it was way before all the scrapping
Earned my fucking props from the G's in the hood
Put in work, did some dirt, never snitched, never would
Rollin' the fat Jaguars with my nigga P blowing up
Time coming back sipping Hennessey
Seventeen years old and I felt like God mad rich
And I had my pick of any fine bitch
And my family was known to be great, seen slightly more
Representing no matter who sets it on
Street power, why you niggaz flip and you thug shit
I be bout my motherfucking grip, nothing else
Gets between me and mine, just remember that
Damn it's a shame, but still I'm in the game
I'm trying to get street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
Don't blame my mama, don't blame my daddy
I know they wish they never had me
In and out of jail by twelve, failing out of school
'Cause I was living by the street rules
Hanging with hogs, dropping dogs as a little loc
I was getting my respect but I was still broke
Into the game and expanded to the cocaine
Went from double-ups, to slanging them whole things
Focused on my mail name ringing like a bell
And even with no proof they gonna put me in jail
Everybody says he's sold and I'm outta control
Bitches want my cash on my dash of my cockpit
They wouldn't know a motherfucker if he didn't have shit
So while I'm balling and kicking up dust, get yo' skull crushed
Bitch-made niggaz know not to fuck with us
'Cause I'm living on the edge, I'm blasting lead
Wanted by the Feds, they got to take me dead
So fuck it drive a bucket in the inner city
In the land of no pity, I made it by the street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a super star, made it by street fame
I had to make some people feel the pain, in this dirty game
I know I'm on my way to hell
Ain't no yellow bricked road for all the niggas that I done smoked
The hood done took me under, a nigga gots no heart
Don't get it twisted 'cause I'm there with my homey's car
I kill for my niggaz, my niggaz kill for me
That's the love you get, from the drunk one, you put in work see
I'm a G with a gang of niggaz after me
Trying to peal me, 'cause I smoked they homey
What comes around goes around is what makes it worse
I smoke blunts all day to keep my mind off a hearse
They don't stop stop till my casket drop drop
Let me ride, but all I want, thou shalt not beef or die
And it don't matter if I rap or plays
'Cause I blow out back of some minds, fuck the fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
... Made it by street fame

Yo 'Law, is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?
Yeah, Mr.Fuck-a-Cop is back and I still don't give a fuck yaknahmsayin'
Puffin on this indo, in the studio with my partners out here
Pacific Heights in the house, know what I mean
I was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga
You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
'Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send 'em upstate 'cause they straight-up hate the niggaz
So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggaz
Straight fools into rules and do niggaz
And one-time had enough of me
I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
They wanna send me to the pen, punk picture that
I stay strapped motherfuckers better get your gat
It ain't easy bein' me I can't take it
Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
And ever since the movies, these hoes try to do me
If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now, can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And aww yeah, I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
You'll get smacked behind the hill with my phone on my pager
It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor
I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous
I got no mercy for these niggaz tryin' to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop, now drop it
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's
Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
You're just another rapper who swears he's makin' records
That's what they said whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though always kept my head up high
Eventually, I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night, always comes a brighter day
And some would say that turned away is all you'll get
I just said, bet, and never let 'em see me sweat
'Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell
Yo get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
I hate the studio 'cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it till you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you and that way you can never fall
But beware these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car, nope
And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed
Remember how it felt, and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
'Cause they can all suck dick, it's strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's
Listen, this is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stickups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not Tupac will cop the glock and come knockin' to getcha
I told you once motherfucker I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked
Niggaz know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down
I'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around
And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore
Nigga, it's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin' all that shit
Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggaz that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches should've pulled the fuckin' trigga
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass, nigga
Mr.Troublesome, niggaz tried to play me with the gat
But like Terminator nigga, I'll be back
Yeah, and I'll be back with a fuckin' army
You tried to harm me, ruh-ring the alarm G!
'Cause most motherfuckers love to act up
Without they backup, when they get jacked up they crack up
It's strictly for my niggaz at the show
So they know, not to play me like a ho-ho, strictly 4 my
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz

Eat a dick up
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man
Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the ruffneck niggaz with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin' streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, 'cause either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore... theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Stickin up spots and jumpin' in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin
And always keep a hand on the gat
'Cause a niggaz straight strugglin
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin
I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun 'cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
'Cause of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dog got it goin' on
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, 'cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
'Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin' changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggaz on they back
Till I call back, niggaz runnin' free better fall back
I'm fifty niggaz deep beat sleep
With a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin' motherfuckers to the moon
Niggaz need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin
See me on the block, strugglin
And rollin' with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
I get in niggaz ass, blast
Straight strugglin
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Live back at 'cha Westside baaaaby
Aight fuck it, we gone flip some new shit now
You heard All Eyez on Me, niggaz know what time it is
Rhymin and stealin, sellin five million
Fresh out on bail, niggaz still can't see me
That's how it is
Now we got a new motherfuckin plan, and a new mission
Competition, so they say, these niggaz is gay
Blast me? It could never happen
At least not while I'm walkin' and rappin'
Heard of some niggaz on the other side of town who wanna ride wit me
They can't hide, listen to the rough shit, my click
I said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead 'n' buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll
Never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggaz get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fuckin' mo', exposin tragically
How can we find some peace and niggaz still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satin infiltratin; my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin'
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
To become a man, we sheddin tattoed tears
I said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug? HUH? WHAT?
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug?
Yo, criminal ways of thinkin' made me crave Abe Lincolns
The days I spent stinkin caught victims on the weekends
Seeking a better path, expose a better half of me
Blast for me, the task after me
For a few years sheddin tattooed tears
Like Gram' Sammy, we feudin for the whole damn family
We scarred up, homies is barred up for mad time
Outlawz locked down for some past crimes
Fast dimes made my stash grow smaller
Your block ain't no harder, fake baller
Nigga it's like this
I been thuggin' just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
That'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggaz flexin
Po-po's guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet 'em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry, but it ain't my time to either die-die
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life
For the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin tattoed tears
I said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
Shit... ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein my opprunities through these bars of hell while gettin' high
As life replays like time; underhanded schemes
To get that cream and thangs while livin' this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals dare be last mental me intitutionalize
Locked down, got many shell shocked, now
Holdin' down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style
Yo I been loosin sleep, stay awake way past late
Visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne
As I lay here gatted down and tatted
Knowin' now it's hard to slow down for a addict
It's been years of stugglin, guzzlin beers
Beefin and never even, ain't no love in the air
And I suffer my shit in hell, talkin' to the heavens
Walkin' through the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot, startin with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
I'm through with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
Step in my shoes, nuttin to lose, but my brain
I'ma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear
Ain't nothing to fear, cryin these tattooed tears
Come on...
I said many times busters still can't see

It's like all we got left - teardrops and closed caskets
Tell me how you feel homey
You recollects and see how crazy it sounds
Since birth, eyes set on gettin' bigger
Just anotha wild-ass nigga
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus
Seein visions of people smokin' and niggaz catchin vapors
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin'
Still no one's knowin', so they kept goin'
But wait a minute back to Precious
She's snortin dope in the back seat of Trigg's Lexus
Teardrops and closed caskets
Hopin God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighbourhood kingpin, who's gettin' bigger
Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
But Precious was lonely while Lil' Trigga was makin' dough
She's slippin in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo
The neighbourhood's buzzin, now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'
How his baby's mama could disapear with another man
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'
Just the smoke from the cap peelin a man with no feelings
Teardrops and closed caskets
Bury you dead and look ahead
A man with no feelings
That's all we got left, that's all
Now with the problems of poverty
And the tricks to these tales
How many people'll die
How many'll live to tell
Although best friends before
Lil' Trigga and Mo
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out
Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out
All the while let's look at Precious
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin ki's
I can't believe the shit they tellin' me
They open fire, three bodies drop, so call the cops
Teardrops and closed caskets
Teardrops and closed caskets
We dedicate this to all the fallen comrades
All the homies that didn't make it to see this day
With teardrops and closed caskets
It's like that's all we got to look forward to these days
Murders, brothers dyin', funerals
I done ran out of tears
Know we gon' have to do somethin' y'all
We gon' have to do somethin'
Teardrops and closed caskets
I send this out to M'thulu Geronimo
And to, all the fallen comrades, all the soldiers
May God bless your families
May you always live in the motherfuckin heart
Rest in peace nigga
May your enemies be deceased, dead on the streets
We can't have peace till the niggaz get a piece
Yo Mo Bee main, drop that shit!
Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy
You know what time, boo-yaow
I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand youknowhatI'msayin
And uh, throw up that finger
Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?
Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, 'cause I get caught up
And the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
The day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin' and you lookin' good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
Witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony
'Cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crack game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...
Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy
Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go...
Give them the finger!
Ya know what baby it's like
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by
Everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven
Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...
Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy
Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go...
Throw your fingers up!
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
A lot of people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin'
See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was
Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy
Give 'em the finger
And all my homies go...
Yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?

Oh shit! Jumped on my man's dick
Heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie?
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me
Ooh-wee! This is the life
New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
Don't try to flip with the lip 'cause I run shit
Hip hip, hooray for the AK
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day
Make pay, next is the wet sex
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check
Bloody as a Kotex, snappin motherfuckers' necks
Revenge so sweet when it comes from
Niggaz get done with the drum, watch my foes run
Nigga keeps comin' when they can't slip
Full of that shit, another hit from Tha' Lunatic
Yeah, fuck that God! Word up
Blowin' niggaz out the motherfuckin frame yaknahmsayin?
Constantly... fuck that trick, we ain't havin' it
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las
'Cause I'm nothin' nice and, I'm icin like Tyson
I'm grippin the mic and, my DJ is slicin
I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin to me with the SAME OLD
Tryin' to do me like Nintendo
How the fuck you think I ever got this far?
By bootin motherfuckers like a shootin star
'Cause I'm out to show, that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin, wait'll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick like a motherfuckin condom
Niggaz wanna flip, let 'em step, and I'll bomb 'em
See somethin' you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin' there, wonder where your money went
While your bitch is callin me, tellin' me to come again
Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin' like a bitch, cause your whole fuckin' posse, broke out
Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
Feel the wrath... and revenge of Tha' Lunatic
Yeah Tu', tell them motherfuckers, word up
We ain't havin' it, NONE of that shit!
Bitch ass niggaz, niggaz can't fuck with us Tu', word up
Ninety-one, we takin' this WHOLE motherfucker over
Niggaz got PROBLEMS in ninety-one
Ninety-two, and ninety-three
And all that other shit, word up!
Recognize game when it smacks you, bitch I'm back to rip
Puttin' this on the map with this mackin shit
Time will tell if it's made well
Well I raise hell and excel cause it pays well
Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
I'm funky, that's word to the father
Act like you know 'fore I thump, the bolo
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin for my solo
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin that he's ruthless
Ducked, and now he's fucked and left toothless
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin', I guess I let the beat keep bumpin
Stop trippin' off these niggaz 'cause they ain't about nuttin
Or should I say NAYthin
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
I'm sick of the bullshit
Come equipped and get ready to rip
Or get the dick of Tha' Lunatic
YouknowhatI'msayin? Yes Tu'!
Tell them niggaz what time it is knahmsayin?
Niggaz can't fuck with us, word up
Bitch ass niggaz, FUCK EM!
Fuck all them niggaz
I'm tellin' these niggaz that they ain't got...
NAYthin on a nigga like me
We squashin these punk motherfuckers in ninety-one
Ninety-two ninety-three... and SO on
So let the beat FLOAT on
While I spray these PUNK BITCHES
With these dope ass lyrics
Thanks to Poppa for supplyin the DANK
Now it's money in the BANK
And all y'all niggaz shit STANK
Compared to this shit...
Fuck y'all punk bitches!
Tha' Lunatic
These is hard times we livin' in
Churches burnin, planes fallin' from the sky
Murder, the good die young
The good definitely die young
This is a lil' somethin'
To help you get through the day
If you could
It was more than a tragedy
Emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky
We tryin' to figure what happened
Burnin' churches, fearin' God
Who can be so cruel
We all ignorant to AIDS
Till it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans
Listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions
We should leave them a choice
Cause who are we to say who lives and die
Breathes and stops
All this judgement on other lives
Needs to stop
What are we livin' for
Givin' more back than takin'
On my knees still waitin' for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned
Cause Pat Buchanan say I'm greedy
You can take my taxes, send me to war
But can't feed me
It's so easy to regret things
After they done
Babies catchin' murder cases
Scared to laugh in the sun
The tragedies that we all need
Love in doses
In times like these we feel closest
The good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Now in my world will it get worse
When I been trapped since birth
But I had to sleep in a hearse
Cause it was my bed first
My grands probably burnin'
Turnin' in they grave
Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin' like a star
And this murder got me
Feelin' like my death ain't far
And the land of stolen cars
Don't get no better
Don't get no weaker or no harder
I was raised in a rush without my moms
And my father
So tell me somethin'
If I grab my gat and get the dumpin'
Would God get to lookin' at me funny
Rest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale
Rest in peace to my father Salek Beale
Rest in peace to my grandparents
And thug in peace to my brother Seike
You know I love you
Which is worst, first Storm and then Al
Pac and then Yak
Redrey Brown
Coulda' sworn I seen ya face in a cloud
Family grievin' on your last breath
Close to the heart whether you know it or not
I swear the love won't stop
Jewel, that's my boo
Mom, Duke and Lou
From jump
You kept it true, helped to feed the crew
The good die young
Livin' fast jumpin' the gun
Mama blamin' the community for killin' her son
My cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'
But never knowin' he was dyin' slower
I guess I see ya when I see ya soulja
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
I know my life ain't promised
That's why the wise move in silence
Analize these scandalous times
It's hard dogg but we manage
Schools turn to war zones
Even homes unsafe
Leavin' children to play caged and raged
They hate, how come
Someone explain why the good die young
Why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
It's time somethin' is done
For our young kids
They growin' hopeless
That ain't the way to live
Tell me why
Days go past and as they pass
Time move quicker
No time for wastin'
Put your hustle down my young dealers
Cause the end is nearer
But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers
Ain't ridin' 4 3 felonys
It's time to plan, plot, and strategize
Capitolize, mobilize
We in the war y'all
It's for all y'all
My family to the ones that stand me
Little bit mo' love is what's recommended
Yeah, and it's plain to see
The seeds from you and me
Gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity
That's if we treat them right
Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does
But if you don't
Man, we sho' to be done
And we'll all see exactly why the good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
I send this out for all my homeboys that passed away
And all yo' homeboys that passed away
I send this out to all the former fallen soldiers
That's in the cemeteries buried
Never got to see they dreams
For everything I touch you touch
For every step I take you take
For every breath I breathe you breathe
Every dollar I make you make
I told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day
You just got there a little quicker
But like my homeboys Thugs say
I'll catch ya at the crossroads
The good die young
This song is dedicated to all them
Young kids that died innoccent
That died young
At Columbine High
Outlawz
Lil' young Xzandafer
Tasha, all them
All the fallen kids
The dead babies
The closed caskets
Yo, Red Spider...
Is that 50 Cent and Pac ready?
Lemme know, holla
It's go'n be some stuff you go'n see
That's go'n make it hard to smile in the future
Yeah nigga... ha ha
Lets go nigga, dis is what it is
Tupac cut his head bald, then you want to cut yo head bald
Tupac put a cross on his back, You wanna put crosses on yo back
Nigga, you ain't Tupac
Is it
Money and women, funny beginning's tragic ending's
I can make a million and still not get enough of spendin'
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound
Rather be buried that be worried, livin' held down
Yo, that shit is crazy Whoo Kid
Bring that muthafuckin beat back man
It's go'n be some stuff you go'n see
That's go'n make it hard to smile in the future
Yeah nigga... ha ha
Lets go nigga, dis is what it is
Tupac cut his head bald, then you want to cut yo head bald
Tupac put a cross on his back, You wanna put crosses on yo back
Nigga, you ain't Tupac
Is it
Money and women, funny beginning's tragic ending's
I can make a million and still not get enough of spendin'
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound
Rather be buried that be worried, livin' held down
My game plan to be trained in
Military mind of a thug lord sittin' in a cemetery cryin
I've been lost since my adolescence calling for Jesus
Ballin' as a youngster wondering if he see's us
Young black males
Crack sales got me three strikes
Livin' in jail this is hell enemies die
Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listnin'
Got my hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitchin'
Please god can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all before we fall into insanity
I'm makin' a point to make my beatin' bumpin' raw life
Drop some shit to make these stupid bitches jaw tight
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's go'n be- go'n be
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we go'n see- go'n see
This is a cry for mercy, I promise
My success would be the death of you
Low and behold, you sold ya soul, there's nothing left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself, who are you
If you don't know who you are, how could ya dreams come true
Muthafucka, I sat backed and watched ya, you pretended to be Pac
I see it so clear, you can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me, and chills, run up ya spine
God made menace in war, but ya heart ain't like mine
And plus, they look at me like I'ma menace
I was playing wit guns, while ya momma had you and yo friends playing tennis
I'ma nightmare, you see me in ya dream
Wake up, and turn on ya TV and see my ass again
You cowardly hearted, you couldn't make it on ya own
Fuck the source, I'm on the cover of rolling stone
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's go'n be- go'n be
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gonna be- gonna be
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gonna see- gonna see
Growing up as an inner city brotha
Where every other had a pops and a motha
I was tha product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
And since my pops never knew me
My family didn't know what ta do with me
Was I somebody they despise
Curious look in they eyes
As if they wonder if I'm dead or alive
Poor momma can't control me
Quit tryin' ta save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies
A ticken timebomb
Can't nobody fade me
Packin' a 380
And fiendin' for my mercedes
Suckers scatter
But it don't matter I'm a cool shot
Punks drop from all tha buckshots tha fools got
I'm tired of being a nice guy
I've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
So they label me a lunatic
Could care less
Death or success
Is what I quest
'Cause I'm fearless
Now tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
I just murdered a man, I'm even more stressed
Wearin' a vest
Hopein' that their aimin' at my chest
Much too young to bite tha bullet
Hand on tha trigga
I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in tha state
Penn
Counting pennys over tha years
I'd done stacked many
Proven wrong those
Who swore I'd wouldn't live till twenty
Now they gotta cope
Since it's tha only thing I know
It's difficult to let it go
I'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause I worry
Hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
But now I gotta move away now
Cause these suckers wanna spray where I lay down
My homie lost his family and snapped
Shot up half tha block to bring them back
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
I'm dangerous
When drunk I only drink beer
Gin makes me sin
Unable to think clear
Heneesee, makes me think my enemy is getting close
Boom boom boom
Got me shooting at a ghost
Some call me crazy
But this is what you gave me
Amongst tha babies, who raised up from tha slavery
I sport a vest and hit tha sess to kill tha stress
Moved out west and I invest in all tha best
Those who test will find a bullet in they chest
Put ta rest
By a brotha who was hopeless
Grow up broke on tha rope of insanity
How many pistols smoking coming from a broken family
I'm sick of being tired
Sick of tha sirens, body bags, and tha gun firing
Tell bush to push tha button 'cause I'm fed
Tired of hearin' these voices in my head
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Tha streetz R Deathrow
This goes out to my partners in tha Live Squad
And all my homies out there involved in that 187
Watch your back...
There got to be a better way...
There's too many of us in tha cemetery
I love it when they fear me
Come on, what we gonna do now
I love it when they fear me
Tha streetz R Deathrow
There you go... acting like a hoe...
Was it the liqour
That makes me act blind?
The times I'm with her
Anonomous pictures
Of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her, or shall I dis her
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin' to paint a perfect picture!
My memoriez of jealousy no longer care free...
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriendz keep tellin' me
I'm on tour but now my bedroomz an open door
So it got me thinking what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb
Eager to please, a lil'Trick on a mission tryin' 2 get'em a piece
Me and my niggaz is Thug niggaz!, former known Drug Dealerz!
We don't love bitchez!, and believe they don't love niggaz!
I got'em playing my attraction
But you became a distraction a threat to my paper stacking
I thought you'd change, but now I know
Can't turn a hoe into a house wife baby
And there you go...
There you there you go, acting like a hoe
There you there you go, acting like a hoe!
There you there you go, acting like a hoe
Acting like a hoe, acting like a hoe!
See tha word on tha streetz you're a... hoe
Just a groupie on a world tour... hoe
Now I find out for myself you're a... hoe
Girl you need to check yourself...
These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim'em, just bang'em...
Papa raised a playa, so playa I'll play'em
I got hoez, that got more hoez than me
So how I look getting hooked like I ain't got G
Truly, cutie, booty big!
But that ain't enough
And tha head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, bitch be lying too much
She be dying to fuck me, you be buying tha stuff...
See old friend I know...
Your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown town coast to coast see
I been trying to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that shiesty shit that you do
Knew from jump you aim
Straight through them spandex don't front just name
Spots on your body for me 2 touch while ya clutch this game
I keep flowin' like h2o
It ain't nothin' for me to say why you keep actin' like a hoe but there you go
When I first met her I told her I was busy all the time
Now she call me flippin' like she miss me all the time
How she gonna even trip she got a man at home
You need to stop chasing dick, bitch and raise your son
I'm like damn we can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time
Girl ya thirsty and stop callin' while I'm workin'
Ya hurting me all this bullshit is hurtin' me girl
There you go
I blame it on ya momma she need to holla at you
Or should I blame it on your daddy for all the thinds that you do
'Cause there you go just like a hoe caught in the streets
Like giving your number out to every nigga you meet
I'm tired of games you playin', so stop playin'
You hear what I'm sayin' you only good for parlayin'
I'm laying down the rules, it's a game that you lose
So the streets can have you baby 'cause I stay on the move
Y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured
And just looked at the whole situation
Cause once you look at it
You know
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody give a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
Some say niggaz is hard headed 'cause we love to trick
Equipped with game so we bang wit this thuggish shit
I see you trying to hide, Hoping that nobody don't notice
You must always remember you're still a member of the hopeless
See ya black like me, So you snap like me
When these devils try to plot, Trap our young black seeds
Look it, Cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin'
Lookin' for role models, Our father figures is bases
Some say they expect Illuminate take my body to sleep
Niggas at the party with they shotties, Just as rowdy as me
Before I flee computer chips, I gotta deal wit brothas flippin'
I don't see no devils bleedin', Only black blood drippin'
We can change, whatcha now say?
Whatever it takes to switch places wit the bustas on top
I'm bustin' shots make the world stop
They don't give a fuck about us
And if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
And if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did 'cause they saying you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons dawg, I don't doubt you
See the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
No including yourself, All you want is wealth they perceiving itas greed
So as you loaded up that mack and continue to buck 'em
I was on paper, Thinking they don't give a fuck about us
I'm seeing it clearer
Hating the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior
So why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watching my nation die, genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath, The aftermath is y'alls
I told ya last album, we need help 'cause we dying
Give us a chance, help us advance 'cause we trying
Ignore my whole plea, watching us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They don't give a fuck about us
And if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
And if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
Now all my homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply
Now that's love, Shit
Nobody else could give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down
Six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong
How long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song
Ain't gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame 'em?
Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck
I don't, feel what I'm saying?
Now thug niggaz die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic, Or closed casket for our troubles
Present times, We busted like bubbles
With the police, This nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Man I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain
So I spent your time in poor and working
I see no reason, So I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinking that they give a fuck?
You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga your lying
Cause half of my niggas, long gone,
Buried in the dirt just for trying
Sometimes I think my block is dying, And that it's awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't change that awful
I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
While I'm layin' in the coffin
The shit comes around so often, So tell me something
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
Nigga I been so through pain go through the struggle
Doin' the same thing you did at my age and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin'
Well since you don't give a fuck, you frontin'
And I'ma drink my Hennessey like it ain't nothin'
Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
While I'm kickin' rhymes, getting to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die, they kick us every time we try
They don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm getting high, I'm watching as the world goes by
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
While I'm kickin' rhymes, getting to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die, they kick us every time we try
They don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm getting high, I'm watching as the world goes by
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
Get your money nigga get your money!
Rise my nation rise
They don't give a fuck about us... rise
Get your asses on the right path nigga
They don't give a fuck about us
Get your money nigga get your money!
2Pac
This Ain't Livin'
This ain't livin'...
Nigga - I hear even the smaller G's be dippin Chevy Impalas
While flossin they gold D's, O.G.'s, is who they follow
We swallow tomorrow see, what we leave is hollow
We feed violence and greed, let 'em bleed tomorrow
In time, they grip a nine, sippin wine - hit grass
Till I be starin' watch the parents sacrifice they child
The love's gone, a thug's home, with no love
Feelin' so strong, make young boys into drug lords
Now one for adolescents, now dos for dose
Keep yo' friends by your side, even close your foes
Now three for Johnny Law tryin' to make my chips
I never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch
Throw yo' hands in the air, it's a robbery
... Thinkin' 'Pac, would you ride with me
Let's go see what our enemies talkin' bout
When G's enter the house nobody's walkin' out
This ain't livin', it's similar to prison, we trapped
My homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
I watch my back twenty-fo' seven
And never let a busta send a G to ghetto heaven, you know!
This is how it goes when we floss with foes
Before I toss yo' hoe, it'll cost you mo'
I do shows make a lot of dough, murder my foes
But I'd give it all up, if it would help you grow
This ain't livin'
Can't find a better way to break you
This ain't livin' I gotta do what I gotta do
Peep it - gunfire is produced at alarmin rates
Today's youth, grip the shit, get in the car and break
It Takes a Nation of Millions if we intend to stop the killin'
They our seeds and when they bleed, we bleed
That's what becomes of lonely children, they turn to G's
Heavenly father can you rescue, my young nation
Rest the Lord will protect you, respect due
Not a threat as I step in blue, and check those
That oppose when I froze them fools, and who are you
To watch me fall farther
I disappeared, reappeared as the ... follow me now
Skippin class, and livin' fast, will get yo' ass
Stuck in the pen, doin' life plus ten
Young brother pump yo' brakes for me, before you choke
Won't ya soak up some game from yo' big homies
This ain't livin', we givin' you jewelsl, use 'em as tools
Explode on they industry and fade them fools
You know the rules, gotta be a rider
You can run the red lights but read the street signs, hey
This for all of y'all that keep on raisin hell
Put a pistol in your hand and let you fade yourself
It ain't right, what you put your momma through, young G
Gotta change your life, take the game from me
This ain't livin'
This motherfucking life I lead, shit
A hell of motherfucking road blocks and crooked cops
We still ride though
What side?
Westside
I want money in large amounts my garage full of cars that bounce
Moving my tapes in major ways cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these nigas is punks
They running off at the mouth till I fill up with my pump
They jump my automatic keep them weary
While you fronting like you Billy bad ass nigga you scary
I been knowing you for years we was high school peers iIn Junior High
I was itchin' to kill and you was ready to die
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leaving no trace they see my face and then they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry still I ride I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live my nigga it's how it is
Homie got into a fight last night they killed his kids
In this life I lead fiend for currency

Been blessed for sure to eat from out the ghetto

When you see me nigga

Steady seducing us and I'm all for it
It's the life for me and the law can't spoil it
My mamma ain't raise no punk and even dead Pac
So when I jump off I breathe for Yak
Been puttin' in work so I walk with a bop
Thug living Ugh what the fuck would be better
I do my dirt with the family so we dying together
We on a mission for mo' gangster shit on you hoes
We ain't fucking with you lawyers crossing niggas up out there dough
Trying to live Godzilla Edi went from a bad boy
To a anybody killer Look out
Wanted man guns in hand stand firm
Nuts are my pride now lets burn
Bound and profound going down swinging
Holding my ground we the last ones breathing
No stopping till we eating deep in the trenches

You gotta watch your back stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt

And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun

Love within a storm
First it was nothin', not even, a fake?
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes
Thought I'd never feel this way again
And you were supposed to reach my heart
And find love within, love, love
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me
Wonderful
I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near
Any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly disappeared
It was re-birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend
'Cause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again
Fall in love again, in a storm
Just when I thought I'd seen it all
Our paths crossed, amen
And I knew, from the first glance
That you, would be hard to forget
Your eyes, attracted me first
But you reeked of sultry confidence
I couldn't wait, to touch lips
And kiss, with my heart's intention
When we didn't, was what I expected
And for that moment, we erased the tension
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters
And the initial blind date, first impressions
We kissed again; and I felt the passion
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessin'
We made love, within a storm
In the midst of passion and chaos
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder
Those who prevail this drama
Will learn to bring their love farther
But now, the storm has past
And the seas of our friendship are gone
But as long as I live, I will remember
The love within a storm
Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love
Ya know that I miss you, and love you
Ya know that Tupac broke my heart
We need to hear ya, hear ya voice
They say, this ghetto fabulous
On 125th street forkin' around
This village, and the village uptown
South Central, Compton, Philly
Sha-Town, Southside
It's hot in 'Lanta, hot in 'Lanta
Jersey peeps, I hear ya
Miami, South Beach, uh
Yeah, got love for you, love for you
My Brooklyn knights lovin' you, lovin' me
This open, rich city
Ya know, I got love for you
Put me in the car JoJo

Heh heh, yeah, maybe it's the thug in me
Yeah, that type of shit
You know what time it is
Maybe it's the thug in me
By Age thirteen I was buck wild
Good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood
Never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man

Now I can't wait to get you home
Get you all alone

Into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly
Switch and How it supposed to be?
And Dirty money
Can't be evil 'cause it's filling up my tummy see
Born in a position
Death collision
Was futuristic
Twisting riches
But there is only one way to make mo'
So I'm standing on the corner
Trying to hustle in the snow
And My bigga bro
Couldn't know
But buy a four four
Blasting at playa hating
Wantin' mo'
With a Thug Passion
Putting down mashin'
Control by this Thug's Passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin'
I'm asking, What Happened?
To the niggas who kept it real
Like they claim to
That's when I bang do
See thang true
Traveling this road my poor soul
Has been consolidated
With all this bullshit I done tolerated
How I made it
Can easily stated
It's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
To be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit
Make this to some high dollar gangster shit
Jack a stack till we got enought bank to split
Creep with me
Through that Imortal flow
Thug Passion got you tremblin'
Like Death on the Row
Make your move
So I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowin' up tha scene
Like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke
As your heart goes full arrest
I got tha bomb
So nigga, fuck tha rest
Ya need a 3rd to get ya flowin'
And let that loc see smoke
Feelin' tha strokes of tha nine squeeze tight and slow
They say money don't make tha man
But damn I'm makin' money
Observin' you muthafuckers
Cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it
But you bullshitin'
Lickin' them lips
You got me about to act a fool quick
Sippin' on some Alize and Cristal, meanwhile
Buy me a drink
And get to winking at me
She smiles
A niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlastin'
How does it feel?
What I'm askin'
While I'm rubbin' on that ass
Why you laughin' ?
See, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious
Baby get a grip
When I be doin' this
It's so physical
My attraction
Driven by alcohol
Beware of my reaction
Baby I'm born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize
And picture what I said so
Now you can feel it
It's a potion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin'
Bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G
We ain't dead yet, hit me!
I got my Hennessy find ya foes
In a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm getting high off buddha
'Cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough
You never find me broke
And who meee a nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep living in these wicked times
Peep, niggas after me 'cause they see I'm stacking G's and heat
You can holler if you want to pleeease
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew bleeeed
Enemies and my range is on
You're in the danger zone
My fuckin' game is strong, Hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
From hustling and busting them rhymes
To my niggas up in Quentin
Down on Riker's Isle stay rile
But a nigga gotta use his styles
These,
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
It's like they stuck
From making niggas duck from Glocks all the time
My mind's full of thoughts of ends
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Cause in the dark see they hearts' full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell
Straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucka screaming like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the morning
Only the strong survive
I cry but in my own way
Swallow my pride pick a reason to hide
Cemetery full of brothers I buried
It's going down even now I wonder
Will I still be around my hometown is the gutter
I was born a wild came up out this dust
With my heartless style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
I remember Uptown huh got to get to listenin'
To Mr. Magic cuttin' up the hits
And even though I had habit makin' words rhyme
I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
And Pete and Lee young G's
With a gift of gab and tryin' to hook up with the hookers
Who was quick to stab remember mama's cooking
No school straight hookin'
And tryin' to get with light skinned
'Cause she good looking
And jumpin' over turnstiles 'cause we ain't paying
I'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot
'Cause my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
Had to move to the West to regain my style
These,
Chorus till end with ad libs
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasin' me around
And it's always drama
Whevever I wanna get around
Mama told me
Long before I ever came up
Gotta be true, to watchya' do
And keep ya' game up
'Cause things change
And jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wifes house tryin' to mack her!
I'm on tour
But still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry
I'm steady wantin' more
Every day is a test, yes
I try hard
But I'm strugg-a-lin' with every breath
I pray to God that the woman that I left at home
All alone
Ain't nothin' like tryin' to bone
Over the phone
In my mind
I can see her naked
I can't take it
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew.
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad 'cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
I call you up long distance
On the telephone
I wanna tuck you in
Even though I know I can't make it home
I whisper things in your' ear
Like your near me
Wonder if you feel me
From far away
Or can you hear me
It seems to me
That your' jealous
'Cause I'm hustlin' and makin' money
With the fellas'
In the back streets
Tryin' to trap me
Baby hold up
Thugs get lonely too!
But I'm a soulja
And there's no way I'm a' stop makin' money
'Cause your' attitudes changed
And your' actin' a little funny
Always complainin'
Sayin' we don't spend time
Can't you see
I got enough stress on my mind
And hangin' up like you all that
And get mad when I'm tell you that
I'm busy baby call back
Please, ain't nothin' left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too
You know.
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad 'cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
I sit alone in my room, drinkin'
Without a care
Talkin' out loud to you'
Like your' there
Take your' picture out my back pocket
Man it's on
You the first face I wanna see
When I get home
I wanna love you till the sun rise
Buckwild
Touchin' every wall in the house
Thug style
Put your' hands on the headboard
Think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you
Sick of scenes in yo' head
That I'm makin' love
So turn the lights down
Reminice 'n' relax
'Cause baby right now
I feel in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear
Baby tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly
Watch the ceiling
Scratch my back
How you react
Lets me know you feel me
'Cause everything I'm givin' to you
Is so true
Thugs get lonely too
You know.
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad 'cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
Yeah! 
Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You na'mean?
Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga, that's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At Thug Mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and would have tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the sky...
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the sky...
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion
Dear Mama don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, till the day came
Little LaTasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in 'Thugz Mansion'
Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggaz need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Ya know what I mean? Where do niggaz go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
... At thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind

We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessey, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rolling by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm trying to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ozzie Davis, grey hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much suffering
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
Where angels soar, with golden wings in 'Thugz Mansion'
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday

Little LaTasha sure grown

Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion
No doubt... to live and die in LA
California -- what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
And everybody got love
To live and die in LA, where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knok it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin
Worldwide through the hard times, worryin faces
Shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark, cold hearted 'bout it
Nigga got smoked by a fiend, tryin' to floss on him
Blind to a broken man's dream, a hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessin, plea bargain
Ain't an option now, so I'm stressin, cost me more
To be free than a life in the pen
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset likin this sin
What's the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
To live and die in LA on bail, my angel sing
To live and die in LA, it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
What everybody wanna see
It's the, City of Angels and constant danger
South Central LA, can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggaz gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen the right across from hell, I can't cry
'Cause it's on now, I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life Thug style, so I can't smile
Writin to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches, hahaha
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggaz copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love woman
'Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of Thug in him
We might fight with each other, but I promise you this
We'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in LA
'Cause would it be LA without Mexicans?
Black love brown pride in the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke, I'm on some bullshit
Out for everything they owe, remember K-DAY
Weekends, Crenshaw -- MLK
Automatics rang free, niggaz lost they way
Gang signs being showed, nigga love your hood
But reconize and it's all good, where the weed at?
Niggaz gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this muhfucka burned out, M.O.B.
Big Suge in the Low-Low, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex, wit a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggaz with me, OFTB
They got some hash took the stash left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Head Ron, Punchy too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin it pay
Gettin' high watchin time fly, to live and die in LA
This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin my shit
Makin' my shit sells katruple quatraple platinum, hehe
This go out to all the magazines that supported me
All the real motherfuckers
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A&R people, all y'all motherfuckers
LA, California Love part motherfuckin Two
Without gay ass Dre
No doubt... to live and die in LA
California -- what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
And everybody got love
To live and die in LA, where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knok it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin
Worldwide through the hard times, worryin faces
Shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark, cold hearted 'bout it
Nigga got smoked by a fiend, tryin' to floss on him
Blind to a broken man's dream, a hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessin, plea bargain
Ain't an option now, so I'm stressin, cost me more
To be free than a life in the pen
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset likin this sin
What's the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
To live and die in LA on bail, my angel sing
To live and die in LA, it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
What everybody wanna see
It's the, City of Angels and constant danger
South Central LA, can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggaz gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen the right across from hell, I can't cry
'Cause it's on now, I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life Thug style, so I can't smile
Writin to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches, hahaha
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggaz copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love woman
'Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of Thug in him
We might fight with each other, but I promise you this
We'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in LA
'Cause would it be LA without Mexicans?
Black love brown pride in the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke, I'm on some bullshit
Out for everything they owe, remember K-DAY
Weekends, Crenshaw -- MLK
Automatics rang free, niggaz lost they way
Gang signs being showed, nigga love your hood
But reconize and it's all good, where the weed at?
Niggaz gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this muhfucka burned out, M.O.B.

LA, California Love part motherfuckin Two
Without gay ass Dre
The money behind the dreams
My right hand, my other Capo in this big motherfuckin war we got
My other Capo in this big ass, conglomerate called Death Row
Snoop motherfuckin Dogg, Tha Doggfather
And who he comin' through right now, Makaveli the Don
Feel this, Killuminati
Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supllied yo' phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversatin, we relaxin, kickin back
Got you curious for Thug Passion, now picture that
Tongue kissin', hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you movin in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweatin up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespectin when I tongue kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, gettin' busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your, hips and glide
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got ya lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shakin back-breakin when we're tossin it up
In this baby, I like the way it's goin' down
When all that is around, slip slide ride
Givin' me love nice like
Female I like, what I wanna give all night
You and me alone everybody's gone toss it up
Baby let's, get it on!
I like the way you please me, babe
The sexy way you tease me, sugar
The way you move your body
It really drives me crazy
Your body hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me, I like the way you give it to me!
I like the way you give it to me -- let me see you toss it up
Play on, play on, play on, play onnnn!
Oh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm that want you lady
Oh, don't act so shady, baby your taste as fine as gravy
The way you move that thang, you make me wanna sang
Girl you make my bells rang, make them go ting-a-ling!
Now the man, I'm here again
Don't want it to ever end
It's feeling too good
Gimme some more, oh lady lady
Your body the kind I like-ah
Big booty so I got to keep it locked up
Bag it up yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me!
Do you want me what's your phone number, I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searchin for paydays
No longer Dre Day, arrivederci
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plottin Child's Play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gon' run to?
Lookin' for suckers 'cause you similar
Pretendin to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screamin Compton, but you can't return, you ain't heard
Brothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, 'cause we Untouchable
Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushin you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust, only time reveals -- toss it up!
Chorus w/ variations
Play on playa, play on
How can some non-players do a song about Compton
And then wanna do a player song?
Tellin' lies, who?
Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon
You still ain't touchin us, all that peace talk
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street boy
It's on
Toss it up, we took you on, and we took y'all beat
You know we beat you down, and we took y'all beat
'Cause you wasn't rockin' it right
Tired of suckers rockin' it, toss it up, is how we did it
Yeah, toss it up now!

A military mind nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know
We tradin war stories
We outlaws on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise
Now can your mind picture
A thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to god quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a
Hair trigga Semi-Automatic Mac-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry
But suckers is born everyday and fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries
A legend in my own rhymes
So niggas wishful when they mention
Makaveli was my tutor and Donald Goines
My father figure
Mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Henceforth
We thug niggas and we came in packs
In the back, my AR 15
Thuggin till I die
These streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin
Fat as that ass that honeys' shakin
Repeat chorus 2X
I must stay thuggin and shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the war
To watch all these playa hatin niggas position
For I could see em all
Made it up out of there
Lucky to be here
to tell you, but it'll never be a repeat
People I'm tryin to tell you
Now picture the scenery
I'm thugged out smokin greenery
This game something deeper
My eyes only see these
That's why I'm definately bugged out
Learned to know how
Well to do now
By 18, turned out
And why I do it?
The ridin and smokin, collidin with foes in the first place
that shouldn't have fucked with us in the first place
Y'all don't want no fun
'Cause y'all be the next in the long line of ??
Chorus repeats 2X
I starts em off with this gansta raw story tale
Stackin loot up in the coup that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber
Fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumpin insane
Call me ?? Major Payne
Ya slay and move and gain
I be the nigga pullin the trigga and
Dumpin the hollow points in your brain
Mo bigger balls that RuPaul
Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against a wall
? As for men ?
We bucks em down on the way to the ground
Ain't nuttin but the hog in me
Killin the Po's and keep mobbin, G
???
?? with a sawed off
'Cause they dirty as drawers, y'all
And had them bitch niggas hauled off
Chorus repeats 2X
Mama had me lived and raised on shit that ain't ok
Ain't nuttin on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminissin and catchin flashbacks when niggas
Ran up in my house and I was too young to try to blast back
What happend then, no one would tell me since I was 3
Heard they got to my peoples
Now they livin somewhere free
But fuck that
You got whats mines and I want that
Never drop my guard
Been on the squad
Since ways back
And now I'm sittin
Holdin in anger because my parents missin
Thuggin and murderin
Got some war stories for ya
Now look at me
Straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck 'cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlaw from my tits to my clips
Don't try to figure 'cause the murderous tendencies of my mind
Can be controled, nigga
So who's the bigger?
Who's the quickest killer?
Would ya try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
Prayin to god as your life goes back and forth
Chorus repeats through the rest of the song
War stories, nigga
Heh, heh. Ya playas, too
Thug Life. Outlaw Immortals. Mother fuckin Tupac AKA Makaveli
Can you feel me?
Just say never
Say Death Row
My niggas love that shit
Dramacydal in this mother fucker
Heh, heh. Yeah nigga. Shout outs to my niggas Fatal and Felony
See ?, ya bald head nut
What?
You know what time it is
You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do to me
'Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse off than when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harassed me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped...
They got me trapped
Trapped
Trapped
They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha man's slain
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
I'm tryin' to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped
You know they got me trapped
Trapped
You know they got me trapped
Now I'm trapped and want to find a getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use tha phone
'Cause I'm sure someone is tappin in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
But now he's tha devils friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was tha ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin' Damn homies is dissin you
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in tha hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see tha light
Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
What do I do?
Live my life in a prison cell
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped
They got me trapped
Trapped
You know they got me trapped
Trapped
You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion

Troublesome nigga
Troublesome 19-motherfucking-96
Westside
Let it be known nigga
The boss of all bosses
Makaveli
Menacing Methods, Label me a lethal weapon
Making niggas die, witnessin' breathless imperfection
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her mob bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me ya little brat
Shit them niggas done shot me and still terrified I'll cut they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside
We outlawz, motherfuckas can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit but that's after I'm gone
'Cause they fear me in the physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome
Troublesome nigga
Outlawz
We put it down to the fullest
Spitting rhymes and bullets
Troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets Haha...
Troublesome
Yeah
Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on them first
Niggas knew we came for murda, pullin' up in a herse
Westside was the war cry bustin' all freely
Screaming fuck all ya niggas in Swaheli
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless trap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on your ass like an avalanche
A soul survivor, learned to get high and pull driveby's
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta ass motherfuckas tried to flee
Picture me lettin this chump survive
Ran up on his ass when I dump he died
'Cause I'm troublesome
Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck

I live a thuglife, losing my focus baby

Badboy Killa
There is no one realler
What you saw was the rough, rugged and raw
Outlaw OUTLAW
Murder murder my mindstate shit ain't change since my last rhyme
The crime rate ain't declined
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost their mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearn to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how can I cry
Try to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid' pictures of my enemies and family times
God forgive me cause its wrong but I plan to die
You can take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell 'cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothing worse than this cursed ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome
In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
I'm troublesome I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome
Like my nigga napolean said nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
I'm troublesome

Making niggas die, witnessin' breathless imperfection
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heata
Got me a dog and named her Mobb bitch nigga eata
What could they do to me that little brat
Shit them niggas shot me and still terrified I get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside
We outlawz, motherfuckas can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit but that's after I'm gone
'Cause they fear me in the psychical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome
Troublesome nigga
Outlawz

Spitting rhymes and bullets
Troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets Haha...
Troublesome

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on them first
Niggas knew we came for murda, pullin' up in a herse
Westside was the war cry bustin' all freely
Screaming fuck all ya niggas in Swaheli
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on your ass like an avalanche
A soul survivor, learned to get high and pull driveby's
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta ass motherfuckas tried to flee
Picture me lettin this chump survive
Ran up on his ass when I dump he died
'Cause I'm troublesome
Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck

I live a thuglife, losing my focus baby
I'm troublesome
Badboy Killa
There is no one realler
What you saw was the rough, rugged and raw
Outlaw OUTLAW
Murder murder my mind states shit ain't change since my last rhyme
The crime rate ain't declined
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost their mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearn to bang
Sniffed a lot of flowers, but how can I cry
Try to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid' pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me 'cause it's wrong but I plan to die
Need to take me in heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell 'cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothing worse than this cursed ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome
In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
I'm troublesome I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome
Like my nigga Napoleon said nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
I'm troublesome

This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets
Right now, it is it is almost... it is almost uh,
IMPOSSIBLE for you not to see how strong rap has gotten
Why'knowhatI'msayin, it's it's like umm...
Our our brothers and sisters, our youths, and some of our adults
Their ear is PINNED to rap music right now
And if you really wanna get our message out
And really wanna start teachin, we need to start doin' that
We we really need to start usin', our methods, why'knowhatI'msayin?
The Last Poets did it with poetry
And uh, and and... even in our history
From a ancient Afl- African civilization
Poets went from village to village
And that's how, stories and messages and lessons were taught
Why'knowhatI'mssayin, and so like you say, history repeats itself
And so... it it was, it was... at it was, why'know obvious
It was, pick it up, why'know?
Bein the race that we are, bein the strong race that we are
We picked it up, we picked up those positive, those positive vibes
And we started rappin' and so
I think it is, it's a very good medium too
Life...
What the fuck is life for niggaz like us?
Been waking up to another muthafuckin' day
I'm the type of soldier,
A nigga that seen
Everything in my muthafuckin eyes
I seen my parents get killed
To my muthafuckin eyes
I seen my brother kill his-self in my eyes
I seen Pac... Yak... die in the struggle in my eyes
So I know anybody can be touched
You know what I mean?
Oh God forgive me
Somebody please say a prayer for me
Needed my parents
But they was never there for me
Believe in everything they feed me
I'm seeing demons
I wake up screaming
Who believe me or was I dreaming?
Five fingers on the .45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, I want to see what's after this
I'm living blind writing rhymes
Till they capture this
And if we die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes hate to see a young thug cry
They seeing us inside a casket
That's how they see us
Oh God forgive us ghetto bastards
We human beings
They leaving us inside this hell-hole
Just waiting to fail so they tell us
That's what jail for
Adolescense young teens turned violent
It's floating, in a world turned silent
Cause you could be touched
Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched
Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched
I live life High Speed
Moving a million miles per hour
Towards my destiny
Making decesions carelessly
Yeah it's me, yo nigga man child
Bomb first stand proud
Ain't looking for hand-outs
Twenty-five years up in this bitch
And I'll be damned if I ain't leaving rich
And leave my kids a grip
I let my blood drip off in this thug shit
You can be touched, I catch you slippin' while I'm on a money mission
Like right now, 30 dollars to my John Hancock
Try to get mo' so my shit don't flock
I lick off shots for everything they owe me
And when it's my time to go
I pray the Lord hold me
I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggaz
That ever breathed
And I was big when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb
My nigga... Lonnie just got hit with 10... 10 years
For trusting a friend
They left him stuck in the Penn
I love him, we all here just to die here, plus
Nobody cares what got here
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Praise the thug ways and I'll never be bored
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Y'all praise the thug ways
So forever it's on... baby
My Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched
Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched
Why grieve this life
Planted by the fiends and pipes
Green lights so
I'm seeing-seeing everything twice
Pretty much of nothing nice
Even when we get a job, we fucking it up
Like it can't happen to us
I could never be a bum
Yeah right, you wound up one
God forbid I'm touched, y'all keep living it up
Look and learn
Next it could be your turn... word
Yes this a felonies' hobby
That got me here thinking robbery
Day to day all year long
Teflon protects my body
It's such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I'm caught and supporting me
So in these streets of hockey
I play the goalie,
Secretz to war licks, and score shit
Share between clients and homies
Remember what Patcino told me
Before he past
Watch them clowns with them crocodile smiles
'Cause they phony, I get that cash, stay lonely
And I'm point like a thong
And it's survive for the strong
Living outside the laws of this crooked world
I was born touched
My Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched
Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched
Dear baby you the picture of perfection
Straight from your million dollar smile to my attraction to your complexion
No hesitation needed; you got me
Inhaling the aroma of your perfume, and feeling heated
I move closer to drop the lines of my introduction
Hold out my hand, and grab your hand, now we touching
My lyrics are poetry
So baby get a ticket to go with me thugged out so you notice me
It's a positive attraction; see pictures of us
Layin butt-naked on the beach kicking back relaxing
And only you can calm, the savage beast
Look in my eyes are you surprised, that it's me?
I wanna make you mine
I'm so lonely in my bedroom, looking at the walls
With ya number in my hand, wondering should I even call her tonight
Any time you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want, and girl you know I got you
You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me
Been getting nothing but bad news, ever since the day you left me
I sit and wonder is there a way, you could forget me
Remember my phone calls, my late visits
Us having breakfast in bed, then we straight kick it
Me and you in satin sheets, till after two
Come take a walk on the wild side, enjoy the view
Whenever we collide; it's bound to be a pleasurable time
Making love till the early light
Sweetheart don't fight the feeling
Come get a shot of this plain dealing and concentrate on the ceiling
It's my intention to brush up
Beware of the fireworks, cause every time we touch...
... It's bound to be, so relax, clown with me
As if you're down with me, get around and see
The brother with tattoos and no fears
Running my fingers through your hair if you call me
Pardon me, but let's be specific
Baby 'cause if you down with me, nigga we can kick it
And let's take trips and ride aeroplanes
A hundred thousand dollar car on them gold things, so can you hang?
I got a big suite at the Hyatt, if it feel right
My only wish is to be with you
You got me steady striving to get you fantasizing of friendly pictures
The pressure's getting major
I wonder will you answer my call, if I page ya
Got me goin' wild with anticipation
Face to face with us locked up in strange places, what will it take
Cause the heartache be heartbreak, is my prediction
When you falsify and start fake, in my position
I'm a careful man, but a player when I ball
Got my eyes on you baby, can I call?
Yo c'mon man, what do you mean you don't wanna ride with me nigga
C'mon, get in the car, get in the fuckin' car man
Yo why you trippin' man? Get in the fuckin' car man
Get in the fuckin' car... get in the car
Cause you, you think niggaz gon' be blastin at it
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggaz are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes
Repetitive blows are thrown, to my foes
No love shown get disposed of blasted full blown
My unknown tendencies to mash my car
Getting wicked with my ski - mask, find the stash and dump
While niggaz run I'm the last one standin, the rest die
Victims of my lethal chrome cannon, Westside
Though it's worldwide no one can deny my views
Tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew
Five shots changed my whole life, throats were slit
Niggaz die by my orders when I wrote this shit
Though we go back like wild knights at Latin Quarters
Niggaz tried to kill me, and I fed they wife and they daughters
Blazed the weed, draped they seeds, gave 'em cash
Pass the fame and let the game go rollin' past
Why you change, it's a cold world taught me life
Retaliation proves niggaz never caught me right
Say they shot me in my nuts, out of luck quick
Bullshit nigga 'cause I'm still fuckin' yo' bitch
Niggaz got me twisted in a bad way, why you change?
Fuck with me, all this shit pay, nigga fuck the fame
Don't remember Hit 'Em Up, don't make us do it once... more
Yo' niggaz know, you ain't fucking with them Out... lawz
We keep souljas, souljas from Compton to Brooklyn
Your the type to get sniped, when the cops is lookin'
Don't nobody give a fuck cause you done crossed the game
Lost in fame, and you should take, all the blame
You made yo' bed nigga lay in it
Scared to come up out that cell nigga stay in it
It's not a game only got one click we Outlawz from the do'
Dirt stains when I buck on the fo', you kissin' the flo'
We dirty as the motherfuckin streetz of Jerz
We sweep niggaz with the words though the heat's preferred
Holla
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggaz are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck these hoes, let the punks know
'Pac I wish I was in the motherfuckin car wit'cha
I'd have took every bullet that they threw, hand of God nigga
I only got one click, Outlawz till I'm gone
Heavy in the game and we coming for they fuckin' throne
The love is gone well it is what it is
And plottin on us, they best be prayin' for they kids, mayne
You don't have to worry 'cause I ride for ya
Like K said over loyal even tell 'bout a lie for ya
You put me in the game and dog I owe it all to ya
And when it get to poppin' I'ma fuckin' ball for ya
And everything I do gon' have your names on it
I'll never let them forget I put my seeds on it
You gon' die before yo' time, come face the truth
In the middle of the desert nigga lace your boots
As a youth, hundred proof, tap my chest is a dead rest
You studio niggaz still remind your vest
Why the fuck you ain't done yet swallow yo' teeth
In the field you woulda been need a straw when you eat
Fuck a glock nine that shit is weak on the streets
And if you can't strategize then you just can't eat
If your life in another nigga hand, you deaded
And if it's beef and your man disappear then don't sweat it
Another fake nigga usin' my strengths to get credit
I was born ugly, unlucky and dusty
But now I'm a rider, connivin gutsy
And I don't trust nobody, so don't nobody trust me
And that's how I'ma go about it till somebody bust me
I play for keeps like the OG's raised me
If I sleep I won't eat, who gonna feed my baby?
And I think I'm goin' crazy cause my hair is gettin' thiner
I've been drinkin' on the daily, I can hardly remember
I got - bad nerves, paranoia destroyed me
I love the Lord but the church can't cure me
I sleep light, I wake peekin out my window
With guns under my mattress and guns under the pillow
And that's the way it's gonna be till they bury me
But don't twist it cause none of y'all niggaz worry me
What the fuck you didn't know?
Kizza - Kastro, Young Noble with the criminal flow
You nervous nelly ass niggas belly up in the river, no dizoubt
Y'all niggaz can't fade me with the clippers
We put it down, look around, till we find you we hound
Penitentiary bound, to remind you
Kadafi I bring the lingo to the click
Tasty like a Pringle, sneakin through your chimney like Kris Kringle
On some shit, get me free to let my ice click
Ka - pling, ka - plow, I been a thug shootin slugs since a child
Talking 'bout the stuff that don't wear off
It don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
I'm guna still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama why God deserved to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try, maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare shit with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it the fighting and the hurting
In my room crying 'cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thang, with unconditional love
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
Just got the message you've been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's on G
We could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation if could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to play and strategize, my family's gotta eat
When we make somethin' out of nothing no pleasure in the suffering
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing sending love out to my block
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
I'll probably never understand ya ways
With everyday I swear I hear ya
Trying to change your ways while gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe it's the way the played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatter us
Cause after all the lights and screams nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days maybe a peaceful night
Baby don't cry cause everythang gonna be all right
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that, unconditional love
Chorus 3x until fade
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
Under Pressure
Yeah, Baby
When tha pressures on...
Thug Life
When it's on it's on
One of these days I'll learn
Don't fuck with trick ass niggas
'Cause they turn into bitch ass niggas
I'm sick of bein stuck in tha county jail
My niggas clown, bring a pound
When they posten bail
Smokin' blunts in tha driveway
My four-five screamin fuck tha police
Won't fly away, thug, till I die
You wonder why I'm made this way
I wasn't, turned out
I was raised this way of thinkin'
These are tha dreams of a young teen
Sceam, and stack green on tha crack fiends
One time can't hold me one of these days
We gotta bust back for tha homies
Locked down in tha penitentry
Finally loose my mind if tha pigs succeed
Stress, smoken weed and nicoteen
But what a nigga really need is Thorozine
Right before I die I'll be curseing tha law
Reincarnated bitch even worse than before
My four-four's givin' payback
My underhanded plan
To get them niggas while they laid back
And big stretch hit tha scene with tha mini 14
Servin' suckers like dope fiends
And lead tha whole team
Under Pressure Nigga
That's right
Never run throw your gun in tha air
Oh yeah nigga bust ain't no time to spare
Called tha ruffest mothafucker and we fuck shit up
Flash and blast a nigga with tha quickness
Cock tha four pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this
Damn, my mind is in tha depths of hell
But when I'm walking on tha street kid my name rings bells
And I never fell nigga I stand to tall
I'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl, givin' my all
So niggas wanna bring it to me
So I'ma sell my cocain and lay they ass down 'G'
Under Pressure
Yeah, look here tho
Runnin' wild
I never smiled as a juvenile
Even now I keep a frown when I come around
Don't ask me about tha past, it was all bad
Shots blasted will I last in tha wrong path
In tha dark is where my heart saw tha most grief
Mothafuckers is getten shanked over gold teeth
Am I sick? 'cause I'm addicted to get splifted
Watch tha stupid ass tricks get lifted
Nothens changed cause in tha came it's a steady aim
Fuck friends 'cause when in danger those niggas change
Puff weed and stuff G's in my sock G
Call Ki's and Hennessy where tha glock be
Times passen will I last here another day
I put my gun away and grab my AK
It's getten hectic I can't call it
House full of alcoholics
Now we're niggas under pressure
Yeah, that's right...
Under Pressure, we're niggas under pressure
Yeah
When tha Pressures on it's a hit
Ski mask
Extra Gats
Bring tha clips
Don't nobody move when we walk tha streets
They stay silent
Cause talk is cheap
Perhaps I was addicted to tha dark side
Some where inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from tha same places
Tha money and tha fame made us all change places
Could it be through tha misery
That came to past,
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask,
For currency,
But you could run to me when you need me,
I'll never leave honestly someone to believe in as you can see.
It's a small thang through and true
What can I do real homies help you get through
And comin' new he'd do tha same thang if he could
'Cause in tha hood true homies make you feel good
And happy times we be actin' up call tha cops
Bringin' tha cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but it's clear I'll always be tha same
Until the end of time
So take, these Broken Wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again,
So I can fly, until the end of time
Verse Two
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know I don't hang around tha house much
This all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of tha ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watchin' tha whole world move in slow mo
For quiet times I disappear and listen to tha ocean
Smokin' pots think my thoughts
Then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phoney homie had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't trippin' I'm a playa
I ain't sweatin' him
I sex his sister had her mumble like like a Mexican
His next of kin
No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' tha only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until tha end of time
So take, these Broken Wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again,
So we can fly, until the end of time
Take these Broken Wings,
You've got to learn to fly, n learn to live so free
So we can fly, until the end of time
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life,
As an Outlaw all alone
Remain strong in this planet full of playa hataz
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinkin' henessey made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for their right to breath
While beggin' me to keep tha peace haha
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a G
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and tha trainin' to make a G'
Remember me?
As an Outcast Outlaw
Another album out that's what I'm about - more,
Gettin' raw till tha day I see my casket
Buried as a G' while tha whole world remembers me
Until the end of time
So take, these Broken Wings
So we can fly, until the end of time
Take these broken wings,
You'v got to learn to learn to fly 'n' learn to live so free
So we can fly, until the end of time
If the angels come down
And takes me away
Memories of Me and my songs will always stay
Until The End Of Time
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Some where inside my childhood I missed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be through the misery that came to pass
The hard times can make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency
But you could run to me when you need me
I'll never leave honestly, someone to believe in the shit we see
It's a small thing through and true
What could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And comin' knew he'd do the same thang if he could
Cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
But half the times we be actin' up call the cops
Bringin' the cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time
Take, these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
So I can fly
Till the End of Time
Take these broken wings
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto child's

Watchin' the whole world move in slow mo'

Smokin' ports think my thoughts
Then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phony homey had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't trippin' I'm a playa
I ain't sweatin' him
I sex his sister had her mumbling like a Mexican

To life my life as an Outlaw all alone

So cold when I flow illuminatin' easily
Falls to they knees
They plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a chief
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin' to make a G

You've got to learn to fly and learn to live so free
So I can fly
Till the End of Time
Till the End of Time
I don't know what it is that has me acting all crazy out here
Guess it's just my arrival?
And how you been poorly treating
Until the end of time
Shit, we ain't got no other way
It ain't no mystery, you get what you give
Feel me
What comes outta that, I can't tell you that
Maybe it's the thug in me
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Get it on till I die
Get it on till I die
Y'all, Y'all remember me
Y'all, Y'all remember me
After the fire comes the rain
After the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons
Million's of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenceless I'm hitting fence's then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless?
At these niggas throats
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlaws rushing you busting you
We untouchable
You niggas better not try to run up
And don't try to say we ain't told you
You're dealing with killers and soldiers
Nigga these explosives, trying to blow shit, running you over
Nigga controller
Whenever y'all niggas try to roll up
Thinking I'm a ho, well, come and let me show ya
I'm a light up the rhythm like dosia
Dumping so potent, nigga don't choke up
Flow up
Makaveli The Don, got niggas strapped and ready to bomb
As soon as I send the alarm, and when we're done
We've committed a red rum, leaving the enemies dead and gone
Leaving 'em niggas head's blown, 'cause they know they dead wrong
Shut 'em down, busters be knowing to keep they distance
Thugs don't fuck around
We get back at 'em so swiftly, niggas is with me underground
Slug in a niggas mug, reppin' Midwest Side
Niggas if you a thug get your weapon, let's ride
Ride for Pac, Pac, get live for Pac, Pac, Pop off the Glock, Glock
The thugging it don't stop
Only wish to breed
I explode into a million seeds
Y'all remember me
Legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces 'cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screaming peace 'cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take them to places, stake they face then erase 'em and brake 'em
Murder motherfucker's at a rate and then quicken the pace
Blast me but never ask me to live a lie
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Now I'm worldwide
Niggas gossip like girls then hide
No offence to Nas but this whole fucking world is mine
Even if you blind you can still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me
Fiending for currency the money be calling
Can you feel me, dreaming?
Seeing scenes of me balling?
Fuck you bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlaws rushing you busting you
We untouchable
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?

I wanted to bring back that reality, nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin' Mike Tyson
And I'm the heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga, that's why it's so raw to just watch me
Battle lions, 'cause I'm a little skinny nigga battlin' niggas three times my size
Watch this uppercut, here it comes... watch the jab nigga... ugh... here it come, look out, watch
My arms...
Now see so many motherfuckers wanna take a piece
Commin' equipped with some shit that niggas just can't believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikazee
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you hoe niggas
Run up on me, and I'll be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you wanna try, why, stayin' high
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Whose runnin' these streets I said that cocaine
Cause in the the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
Another hustler makin' major cash
Till the punk police come an raid ya ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time, and it's a bitch
Cause the judge gave you 8 years, you doin' 6
And we know that you can't hang, you a trick
Rolled over turned snitch like a biatchhhh
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!
They got a nigga in the dice game, I'm feelin' lucky
But the nigga just a little bigger, he tryin' fuck me
Out my cash, imma blast nigga, he don't know
I gotta tell ya like the last nigga, gotta go
Don't need to roll for the truck, I get em' up
I'm known to walk the streets on any block
I love my niggas, but I ain't puttin' down my glock
The gun shots rang when I lose nigga, and ooh nigga
Lay it down just to prove it
And fuck the rappin' motherfucker we can do this
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!
They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
Roll on our enemies, beat em' at they own game
Molotov cocktails, release an up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' 'bout the pay back
Wanna see my kids grow don't know if imma make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto
Society lied to me so I'm strapped with the metal
Push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel
Have ya face down goin' in ya pockets if ya let em'
I done lost too many homies for me to ever forget em'
I done made so many mistakes but still I don't regret em'
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends, and the felons
We all lost souls tryina find our way to heaven
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!
To all the conrads no longer with us, see you when we get there
'Pac, Yak, we gon' keep on ridin', give these cowards the uppercut
Till we get up there with y'all, YOU KNOW!..
Thug Life we still livin' it
Outlaw for life, in the name of the Don, let's go!
They claim that I'm violent
Just 'cause I refuse to be silent
These hipocrites are havin' fits
'Cause I'm not buying it, defying it
Envious, because I will rebel against
Any oppressor, and this is known as self defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm tha Lunatic
But when tha shit gets thick, I'm tha one you go and get
Don't look confused, tha truth is so plain ta see
'Cause I'm tha nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
And every jeep and and every car, while they stop us
I'm never ignorant, getten goals accomplished
Tha underground railroad on an uprise
This time tha truth is getten told
Heard enough lies
I told'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's coming from
Look through our history, Americas tha violent one
Unlock my brain, break tha chains of your misery
This time tha pay back for evil shit you did too me
They call me militant and racist 'cause I will resist
You wanna censor something
Mothafucka censor this!
My words are weapons, and I'm stepin to tha sirens
Wakin' up tha masses
But you, claim that I'm violent
Tha cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, 'cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by tha police, didn't have my ID
I said, excuse me, why ya tryin' ta ride me
He had tha nerve to, say that I had a curfew
Get out tha car, or I'lI hurt you
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my 9 up or hit tha line up
I choose B steped into tha streets
Tha first cop grabbed me, tha other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and threw him to tha concrete
They tried ta say I had some dope in tha back seat
But, I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie packed, he tried ta run
My homie dropped, so I hit tha cop
I kept swingin', Yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beaten tha cop senseless
Tha other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Given him a taste, of tradin places
And all this, cause tha peckerwood was tryin' this frame up, but I came up
Now they claiming that I'm violent
As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click
Then tha gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with tha gun in hand
He shot tha cop, now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us ta get away
They called for back up, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in tha car, and tried ta get away quick
Tha car wouldn't start, we in deep shit
We drove a little ways thinking that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gun fight
I grabbed tha AK, my homie took tha 12 gauge
Load'em up quick, it's time for us ta spray
We'll shot'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we threw spraying, then we stepin
This is a lesson, to tha rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, tha police against us
Dark at dusk, and waiting for tha guns ta bust
What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One things for sure, tomorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm taken all these punks with me
Pass me a clip G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Ta claim that I'm violent...
Just because we play what tha people want...
Please... wake me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Where my couch, I am told, Hold no significance
I waited and died in ignorance
But my inner eye can see, erase
Who reigned as king in another place
The green trees were reached from fall
And every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as people
War was gone because all was at peace
But now like a nightmare, I woke to see
That I live like a prisoner of poverty...
Please... wake me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Fall, I will have a ?, stricken blind
Than to live without expression of mind
Ya know...
With my nigga vp
Get scratched nigga
In the place to be
Check it
Comin straight from the town releasin so much pow
Up an down ur block my sound shakes the ground

-------------------

But ima keep flowin, keepin much pride, its the best side
Where you from soul dawg?? West side nigga!!
What'z ya phone number
Now I could make miracles with pimp hoes.
It's instrumental.
Waitin for the nyphos.
That's the intro.
Shook when ya rush me.
Walked up and touched me.
Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just 'cause I'm paid in the worst way? True.
Lookin' kind a good in your birthday suit.
I wonder if your wild and ya act shy.
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips, shake your hips.
Goddamn, I love that shit.
Yo, let's stop fakin and be real now.
I got a room and a hard on. Still down?
Met ya standin at a bar full of black dudes.
Said ya wanna see my scars and my tatooes.
When we head for my hideout, act right.
Boss playa when I ride out, that's right.
What'z ya phone number?
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready.
Baby, let me give you a call.
How long will it take to break you off?
Oh shit, baby is a dime piece.
Wanted this fine seat.
If I see ya right.
Now she can get me hard
Didn't wanna talk to me, till she see my car.
Never had sex with a rich rap star
Till I got her in the back of my homeboy's car.
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches.
What'z your phone number?
Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone.
Time for your girlfriend to take you home.
I had fun,
But baby, gotta leave me alone.
Picture in my rhyme.
If you open your mind,
Bet in a minute you'll find it's time.
Let the Outlaws play.
What'z ya phone number.
Chorus repeats 2X
Stroked it up and down.
What did I do to the pussy? What a nigga do to the pussy?
Wipe his ass with a rabbit.
It ain't gon take but a minute. Eh, light the candles.
Get the baby oil out. Turn all the lights out. Drink a little
Bit of that shit. I'm on my way babe. I'm gon knock that pussy
To the next week.
Your head. I'm a tie you up, blindfold you. And we gon play which hole
Feel the best.
So fucked up. I'm playin' with myself and shit.
I started out dumb, sprung off o' 'hood rats
Listening to the radio, wishing that I could rap
But nothing changed, I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fucking me, man
Drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas ain't wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case, lord knows how they hate me
Got a playa in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards living as a thug
Count my blessings and don't stress in this land with no love
Maybe they see me rollin', look at all this green I'm holdin'
I guess that's why they're envious and get their eyes swollen
Hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
Be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me, Have a heart - fuck they're feelings
I've been trying to make a million since we started
We cold hearted niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
Me, Makaveli, I'm a motherfucker
We break bread, now we thug brothers
Niggas talk a lot of non-shit I choose to ignore
A war? They ain't ready for it
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Tell me now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
My nine is Thuglord, my mind on my grind
Outlawz is my heart, they shine when I shine
My ryhme is my grind, my team be on role
Proceed with the onslaught, indeed they all talk
They all marks and it's an Outlaw holocaust
When I got the sawed-off
Niggas gettin' hauled off
Yeah, nigga beware, stand clear
This nigga's scared
Man, I don't really care
I fight with a grudge
The life of a thug nigga might need gloves
But you'll never know with a price on your mug
Them fight strips snug right around your hands
Make it sure you can never grab the mic again
Dog, you fucking with a grown man
And I can't afford to lose
Where we from niggas torture dudes
So whatcha wann' do?
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Tell me now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Tell me now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Watch me clown, give me lovin' when I'm high
I'm an outlaw baby, I'll be thuggin' till I die
In my drop-top double-R, life as a rap star
Hustle like a crack fiend till they catch me
Go ask somebody to your show
Watch them niggas out the sight of my night scope
Cooking white dope got my nigga 25-to-life stretched out
Trying to have all the better things in life
Well Makaveli - a born leader; 10 millimeter
Change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader
See the meek shall inherit the Earth
And the strong will lead
Hittin' weed like it's all right
I'm in the studio makin' music all night
My enemies cry whenever I rise, they hated till the death
Trying to beat me out my last breath
Whatcha gonna do?
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now whatz next
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now whatz next
Caught up in the middle, my life's a riddle, don't let it get ya
I wanna be legal but it's this hustle that get me richer
One love to my peoples makin' money, I can see you bubblin'
Avoid all trouble beware of devils continue strugglin'
Nothin's impossible if there's a will there's a way
So get your mind on official business, you can be great
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave so get paid
My niggaz do this every fuckin' day we parlay
Through politics and conversation
This information to my thug niggaz in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation
Separation is self destruction, what's needed is unification
'Cause the world ain't hardly scared if not prepared
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there
But no one cares it's there to share all we get is stares
Because of fear we'll evaporate say your prayers and whatz next?
Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Whatz next
Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Makaveli tried to warn us but niggaz ain't listen to Pac
Naw, listen, listen nigga really listen to Pac
Shit yean got it yet no then you won't get it
Might as well measure 'em up and have his ass fitted, why
Caught slippin' dog trippin' didn't soak game
Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane
Never will change niggaz wit' no name, no shame
Might open ya head foe mess broke change
I stay posted like a flag
Starin' through my rear view ballin' in a jag
Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town
We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now
Time foe a change, real niggaz rollin' wit' me
Money makin' swift decisions we controllin' the streets
Side track by the broads and the frauds, ain't it strange?
It's the reason so many niggaz get scarred in the game, whatz next?
Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Whatz next
Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
That money gotta make it what I gotta do to make it
Do I really gotta take it put this mack up to you face it
Doin' what we gotta do to survive
Just ask Kweli doin' what we do to get by
Some niggaz stick to the crime pitchin' nickel and dimes
What the fuck we suppose to do? Who gon' give us a job?
So I tried and tried, tried to get out the grind
But the block kept on callin' me back, fiends kept on callin' for crack
So I supply 'em wit' that, gave 'em a reasonable fee
Nigga don't blame it on me shit just look where I'm at
Niggaz in gardens L A P D is the target
Niggaz is heartless hustle regardless
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin, whatz next?
Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Whatz next
Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
Now whatz next?
Damn...
What I'ma do now?
When I get free...
Oh shit!
Get free...
Yeah yeah
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
Then bitches is foul, take a look at the evening news
You'll see a nigga gettin' cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin' to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin' to dirty up my name, but
I'm slippin' quick as the wind, It's me or them
Fuck friends my foes be on a mission tryin' to do me in
Fuck'em I'm bout to get out, they all soft
I blow up like gauge, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggaz tryin' to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitches
Main thang was to make a nigga meal ticket
Only if you the real, the nigga will kick it
I'll enforce it with the steel use the lessons that I learned in jail
Network with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin' again
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
Still sittin' in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin' to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin' maybe
Me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
'Cause she keep on callin' me baby
To a young motherfucker facin' eighty
That's enough to make you crazy
Now how long will it take, to get her hooked
Got her watchin' me liftin' weights, sneakin' looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives the van
Ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin' it to Hell
All them niggaz that was frontin' while I sat up in the cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned your misery
Then nigga you don't want to see
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
Stuck in my cell
The pen ain't nuttin' like the county jail
When will they let me bail?
Walkin' through the yard, I play the God
First Nigga disrespect me first nigga gettin' scarred
I'm, back on the scene
I'm hitin' knees in the back of a limousine, puffin on weed
As we game on the drunk hoes
Hit the skunk I reminisce just on the way
We used to play, you punk hoes
What I possess is to be rich, in currency
Paranoid niggaz like bitches whan they come and see me
Laid out, played out, the nigga barely breathin'
As for that bullshit punk, nigga n-now we even
But I wait, until it's time and try to find a crooked way
To porfit off this crime
This life of mine... until I get free
My prophecy is niggaz screamin', as if they bleed in agony
As soon as they popped my gate
I knew these motherfuckers made a mistake
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free
Hahaha... yeah nigga, when I get motherfuckin free
Pop the gate, I'm back baby!
When I get free... we up out this bitch
Damn...

When I get free...
Oh shit!
Get free...

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
Then bitches is foul, take a look at the evening news
You'll see a nigga gettin' cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin' to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin' to dirty up my name, but
I'm slippin' quick as the wind, It's me or them
Fuck friends my foes be on a mission tryin' to do me in
Fuck'em I'm bout to get out, they all soft
I blow up like gauge, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggaz tryin' to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitches
Main thang was to make a nigga meal ticket
Only if you the real, the nigga will kick it
I'll enforce it with the steel use the lessons that I learned in jail
Network with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin' again
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
Still sittin' in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin' to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin' maybe
Me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
'Cause she keep on callin' me baby
To a young motherfucker facin' eighty
That's enough to make you crazy
Now how long will it take, to get her hooked
Got her watchin' me liftin' weights, sneakin' looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives the van
Ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin' it to Hell
All them niggaz that was frontin' while I sat up in the cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned your misery

Punk ass bastards, long as my AK flexes
We gonna play these bitches
That's how we do this shit
Fuck that I'm out, C.O. turn the fuckin' lights out!
When Thugz Cry
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray to Lord my guns to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray to Lord my soul to take
Got us dyin'
When Thugz Cry
Times is hard
Born thuggin' and lovin'
The way I came up, big money clutchin'
Bustin' while evadin' cocaine bust
My po's rushin'
To my cushin' into insanity
They shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family
These cowards wanna see me buried,
I ain't worried
I got a loan on the D.A. 'cause I'm fuckin' the secretary
I black out, start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all
They panicin', bitches duckin'
I rush 'em and fuck 'em all
Probably be an old man before I understand
Why I had to live my life with pistols close in hand
Kidnapped my homie sister cut her face up bad
The even raped her so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out on every block
The puttin' hits on the politicians even cops
I ain't lyin', they got me sleeping' with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear muthafuckas screamin'
What's the meanin'?
When thugz cry
Oh why
Should you send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk
When they die
Let the rocks cry out
When thugz cry
Dear God
Oh why
Does it have to be this way Ah
Children of today won't stay by
Let the children hear
When thugz cry
Dear God
Oh why
Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'
Where is the love, never quit my ambitions to thug
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
Niggers I used to love enclosed in penitentiaries
Still homie keep it real, how does it feel?
To lose your life over something that you did as a kid
You all alone no communication, block on the phone
Don't get alone with your pops and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in this song
To help us grow in time but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters to niggers and bitches
We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches
But somethin' change in this dirty game
Everything strange, lost all my homies over cocaine, Man
See they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See, you gotta get high or die
Cause even thugz cry
Oh why
Should you send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk
When they die
Let the rocks cry out
When thugz cry
Dear God
Oh why
Does it have to be this way Ah
Children of today won't stay by
Let the children hear
When thugz cry
Dear God
Oh why
And all I see are these paranoid bitches, illegal inventions
Bustin' muthafuckas with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures
Cause in my criminal mind nobody violates the Don
I write your name on a piece of paper, and now your family's gone
Well perpetrate like you could handle my team
So merciless in mind try to take command of your dreams
Leavin' muthafuckas drownin' in they own blood
Clown and takin' pictures
Later laugh at the punk bitches that turned snitches
Regulate my area the terror I represent
Make your people disapear, your wonderin' where they went
Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to the streets
Never found true peace I'm told
Come take my body, God
Don't let me suffer any longer
Smoke a pound of marijuana so I know it ain't long
Where is the end to all my misery?
Is there a close?
I suppose that's why I murder my foes
When thugz cry
Oh why
Should you send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk
When they die
Let the rocks cry out
When thugz cry
Dear God
Oh why
Does it have to be this way Ah
Children of today won't stay by
Let the children hear
When thugz cry
Dear God
Outlaw Immortalz
Bow down to somethin' greater than yourself trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know
You watchin but you ain't seein what lies before you, beatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
Blessed with the gift to speak, the power to reach
Each nigga on every street
May the Heavenly Father look down and be proud
Of what transpired since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs livin' like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
I pull revenge on bitch niggaz that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga bellt
Bust him to see if he bleed, he shoulda never fucked around
With a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggaz run, best be prepared
For the Outlawz, here we come
They call me Hussein fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin ya niggaz cradle wit a knife in your navel
Rap-related criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
Till the end, I'm tellin' all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggaz bleed, I see Mo
I be shinin like white diamonds and crystal, glistenin holdin' pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'ma last yo past all these Glass Joes
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin those same niggaz runnin' late, to their fate
My alias is motherfuckin Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
Robbin again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin
But the shit ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin
Befo' a nigga finish with puttin' in work I betta end up with somethin'
I think these niggaz got the game fucked up
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin cases, fuck probation
Is what I'm screamin when these money hungry cops be chasin
Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
On these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride!
Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
On these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride!
It's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini
Mentally unstable, G status, so you can't see me
Drug warlord, riding Concorde jets
Rag Vette's, shakin bitches and snitches and trippin' on sets
Ingle-Watts banger, keepin' one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurkin for kin, no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini
They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin' up on these niggaz easy
It ain't nuttin, 'cause if they wantin somethin', so I'ma commence
To dumpin stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin, Thuggin'
To my fuckin' last nut, with lil Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin' this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride
My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she drop me
Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon
While beefin with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin
Since a short I been livin' life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'
It's like it's me against myself with all these
Backstabbin snakes grabbin at my fuckin' wealth
Mo Khomani goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cal. caps, with the murderous stacks
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make 'em feel a nigga when I'm mashin
Now I'm surpassin any assassin
Hahahaha, Outlaw Immortalz baby
Y'all niggaz can't fade this ol crazy shit
Makaveli, Hussein, Kastro, Khadafi, Mussolini
Amin, Naploleon, Khomani
What y'all really wanna do?
Haha like them niggaz said
What would you do? If you could fuck with me and my crew
Hehahahahaha, Thug Life, yeah nigga
Flashin on niggaz
Thug Life right? This year we Thug Life
But we Outlaw Immortalz
We die nigga, but we multiply, we like legends nigga
Like I'll make you famous motherfucker
I'm talkin' about Newsweek and Time Magazine and all that ol good shit
My niggas make the papers baby
My niggas make the front page
Fugees! Fugees and Mobb Deep tryin' to diss now too huh?
Hahaha! Well I ain't prejudiced, I don't give a fuck
This is what it sounds like - when we ride on our enemies
Biatch! When we ride on our enemies
Hey! Got some static for some niggaz on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggaz?
Used to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz
Am I wrong? Niggaz makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I bust! Then we ride till the sun come
Shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me - look bitch!
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie
Then! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
Bam! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uh
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride - on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody dies, when we ride, on our enemies
They think they crazy but they ain't crazy
Lets face it
Shit basically they juss playin' sick
They ain't shit they ain't sayin' shit spray 'em 50
A to the K get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem you stayin wit me?
Don't let me lose you
I'm not tryin' to confuse you
When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your isuzu
You get the message?
Am I gettin' through to you?
You know its comin'
You motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top
What the fuck do you got?
You got tha realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not
It's like a fight to the top
Just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothin' like survivin the shot
Y'all know what time it is
As soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats?
'Cause I get a lot
Shady records was 80 seconds away from the towers
Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
Nuclear showers there's nothin' spookier
Your now about to witness the power
When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Bet all you mutherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
You was heartless on yo' hits
Niggaz love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggaz wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant, every motherfuckin word
When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
I make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Power... pow... power...
Guess who's back? Hahaha, here we go
It's ninety-fo', what's next?
Power... enter my world
I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggaz
I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power
It ain't all good in the hood
Least not on my side, from where I stand
And the law? Man, fuck the law!
Niggaz must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart
The motherfuckin law, in every way
Key word in ninety-four is 'down low'
Gots to be struggling
I see how the rich got theirs
Nigga I'm legit, shit
Where do we go from here?
Hey niggaz, where your heart at?
See motherfuckers killin' babies, killin' mommas
Killin' kids, puttin' this in they motherfuckin mark
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race
Before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs
And they wonder why we loc'n up
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
All you niggaz out there
The clouds shook, the world listened
We stood together in April of ninety-two
With duty, and a sense of honor
There is no limit to what WE can achieve
That's all on us... us...
Not my niggaz, not the whites, not the enemies
Or none of them motherfuckers, US
What can WE do? Shit
I declare a death sentence to all child molestors
Fake-ass bitches, male and female
And all you punk-ass snitches
We can do without your asshole
Let no man break, what we set
Where do we go from here?
Rest in peace, to Cato, I miss you
All the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three
In ninety-four, and more
What do we do? For us?
You done busting your fist against a stone wall
Your not using your brain
That's what the white man wants you to do
Look at cha
What makes you ashamed of being black?
Even I know how hard it is
Being a woman
A black woman at that
Shit
It's white man's world
Sometimes we over look the fact
That we we be riding hard on our sisters
Not knowing the pain we can cause
It's white man's world
I ain't saying I'm innocent of all this
I'm just saying
This song is for y'all
For all those times that I messed up
That we messed up
Dear sister got me twisted up in prison I miss ya
Crying, looking at my nieces and nephews picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya, kinda suspicious
Swearing one day you might leave me for someone that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make if I have to beg and borrow
Reading love letters, late night, locked down, and quiet
If brothers don't receive their mail, best believe we riot
Eating jack mac, staring at walls in silence
Inside this cage where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Apologizes to my true sisters, far from bitches
Help me raise my black nation reparations are due
It's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black, in this White Man's World and all I heard was
Who, knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That you're not alone
Being born with less, I must confess, only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homies head died in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleeding for his family to see
I pass his casket, gently asking, is there heaven for G's?
My homeboys doing life, his baby mama be stressing
Shedding tears when her son, finally asks that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama, why we live so poor?
Why you crying? Heard you late night, through my bedroom door
Now do you love me mama? Why they keep calling me nigga?
Get my weight up, with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigga
Still thuggin' in this jail cell missing my block
Hearing brothers screaming all night, wishing they'd stop
Proud to be black but why we act like we don't love ourselves
Don't look around busta, check yourselves
Know what it means to be black whether a man or girl
We still struggling in this White Man's World
Who, knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That you're not alone
Oh, who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That you're not alone
So tell me why you changed, choose a new direction
In a blink of an eye, my time away just made perfection
You think I'd die, not gon' cry why should I care
Like we holding on to lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me, God bless me please, keep my seeds healthy
Making all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hoping they bury me with ammunitions, weed, and shells
Just in case they trip in Heaven, ain't no G's in Hell
Sister sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if ya help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Little Yummy, and Kato
To much for this cold world to take, ended up being fatal
Every women in America especially black
Bear with me, can't you see that we under attack
I never meant to cause drama, to my sister and mama
Hoping we make it to better times
In this white man's world
Who, knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That you're not alone
Who, knows what tomorrow brings
That the mainstream while the masses of the people,
White and black, red, yellow, brown,
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That you're not alone
Who, knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That you're not alone
Who, knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That you're not alone
Who, knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That you're not alone
Mumia Abul Jamal... all the real OG's we out
The seal, in the constitution
Reflects the thinking of the founding fathers
That this was to be a nation by white people, and for white people
Native Americans, Blacks, and all other non White people
Were to be the burden barer's for the real citizen of this nation
Heavenly Father
Hear a nigga down here
Before I go to sleep
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
I see mothers in black crying brothers in packs dying
Plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why
Watching our on downfall, witness the end
It's like we don't believe in God 'cause we living in sin
I asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed
Pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
It's just another murder nobody mourns no more
My teardrops getting bigger but can't figure what I'm crying for
Is it the miniature caskets? Little babies
Victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy
Maybe its just the drugs visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlying facts they hide explain genocide
It's when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear? Reflections in the mirror
We can't escape fate the end is getting nearer
Who do you believe in? I put my faith in God
Blessed and still breathing and even though it's hard
That's who I believe in before I'm leaving
I'm asking the grieving who do you believe in?
Can't close my eyes cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddon murder in mass amounts
In this society where only getting the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven
And all the Hennessey and weed, can't hide the pain I feel inside
You know It's like I'm living just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy not knowing if I'm worthy
Living life thinking no man can hurt me so I'm asking
Before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me, my misery
I rose up from the slums made it out the flames
In my search for fame will I change?
And I'm asking
Faith in Allah, believe in me, and it's plastic
Cause so far I done witnessed to many dead niggas in caskets
With they chest plates stretched like elastic
And what's worse I'm on front line, holding down camp still mashing
Heard my cousin one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of '95 back in Yardville stuck
With a three to five if he don't act up
Now he realize if you don't stay wise then in this game you fucked
Talk to my baby girl give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimmies is snitching diming, a stool pigeon
I talked to him he said he didn't, my man said he did
In fact he sure 'cause he just came home off a bid
Who do you believe in?
Is it Buddha, Jehova
Or Jah? Or Allah?
Is it Jesus? Is it God?
Or is just yourself?
Definitely, not to be imposed
Even a demon
Cause this is the joy of the movement
Men, to believe in yourselves
But for sure, the higher power
Resides only to ride through the heart of the true
From the soul, of the man
For truth never has an alibi
In the poetry or in this round
That's what pulls our words together
Just to understand
That every man is his own man
And only man can satisfy the man
Only the soul of the man
The feelings of the man
The for realness of the man
You can't shake the man when you feel the man
You know the man
And you gotta call yourself because you are that man
Tupac over Female Singing
Put my faith in God, and
Blessed and still breathing
Before I'm leaving
Who do you believe in?
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggaz slangin drugs
I'm runnin' from the narcs when they pass by don't ask why
I'm a hustler till my ass die
Even if I do come up I be ready when they run up, huh
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
I never trust these hoes at all, fucking with them tramp ass sluts who Suppose to fall
Since she played you for you money but the shit was cool
Guess its true niggaz be bitches too
You can't see how she worked you, all up in her skirt
Now you looking like a jerk, 'cause she hurt you
Now heads up don't be a playa hater
Just peep game keep your mind on your money watch the bitch change
See hoes love thugs, and thugs love loot
Hand it over motherfucker before I shoot
Who do you love
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me, Who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?

Thug life baby, steady smoking endo going crazy
Baby come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down
We in the dark do you love me
Everyboy is talking bout they know me
But they ain't down like my motherfucking homies
Tell me what you need when you see me
And we can get it on biatch take it easy
Don't try to hold me, control me
But you can take my number, baby call me when you lonely
'Cause it's a man's world, ain't no need to ask why
I'm high till I die, and strapped with my 4-5
Cause you can loose it in the gutter
I wonder if I die by the hands of another broke motherfucker
They call me the alcoholer I'm all in, thug 4 life nigga ballin
I'm gettin' tired of these hoes tryna play me
You can't fade me, me and my niggaz going crazy
All day long I'm straight thuggin', and contantly mean muggin
Breakin the bitches that be buggin, tell me who do you love
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me, Who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?
Old switcharoo ass bitch made mother fuckers
Just because I can bitch
Outlaw nigga, westside, throw it up, yeah
Used to have love for me. But why you turning on me?
Why me?
Westside, how you do it?
I went from, nothing to something now they all wanna see me fallin'
Playa hatas hate to see a thug nigga ballin'
They say we hate the east coast, but that's funny, got a lotta love for any nigga gettin' money
I made a song about my enemies and niggaz tripped
It was hip-hip until Tupac fucked Biggie's bitch
Y'all niggaz hypocrites your bitch made
Now either love me or hate me, but real thug niggaz get paid
Had me catching cases all across the nation
I went from jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facing three strikes, and we might, just blast
God bless the child that can get cash
With all these niggaz turning they'll never learn
Got a long line of niggaz playa hatin' me for spittin' words
Talk a lot of shit but you'se a trick in drag
Like the mac made you fall back and stick your ass, for back stabbing
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggaz see me you flee
'Cause I'm a t-h with the u-g
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggaz see me you flee
'Cause I'm a t-h with the u-g
It, started so innocent but ended in the 5th precinct
A bunch of juvenile delinquents, we still decent
Playing catching kiss, you was dissing the herbs
Fuck school we was skipping drinking drinking 5th on the curb
Me and you, no closer two, while drinking brew
What you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, you think I'd die?
Never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Tell I got raped in jail, picture that, revenge is a pay back bitch
Get your gat
Ya choke on the next dick down your throat
For turning on me
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggaz see me you flee
'Cause I'm a t-h-u-g
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggaz see me you flee
'Cause I'm a t-h-u-g
I'll put Jenny Craig on your fat ass you fat troll
Why you always wearin' spandex you fat bitch? I know your pussy stink
You fat ho
I'm puttin' Jenny Craig on you bitch
I'm bout to put a twenty thousand dollar hit, through Jenny Craig
To come find your ass and put you in a fat farm you fat bitch
Thuglife, outlaw, westside, bitch, it's Tupac so you know who said it
If everybody did like what I said about that other trick and Mobb Deep
Fuck you too nigga
If a nigga didn't wanna get talked about, he shouldn't of stepped in the fucking ring
If Tyson don't wanna get knocked out, he don't step in the fucking ring
That's how this shit go
When Tyson get in the ring, he knock mother fucka's out
Well that's what Tupac gon 'do
When niggaz come against me, I'ma knock they punk ass out
One way or the mother fucking other
This old mother fucking nigga in the south told me nigga
There's more than one way to skin a cat
There's more than one way to shoot a gat
There's more than one way to die nigga
When I'm though, everybody cry nigga
This is how we do it
Why you wanna turn on me?

When you niggaz see me you flee
'Cause I'm a t-h-u-g
Why you wanna turn on me?

Tat chat, chat, ooh, 4th Avenue Jones
K-Ci himself
Shabba dabba dee swee swee
Ha, ha, oh, yeah, lemme tell you now, oh, yeah
I never planned that I'd be married to settle, no chance
Wedding bands rock the heaviest metal
And I'm the center hip hop
My M3 seat three, don't need commission
So either we rhyme or design the beat to flip with
Don't stick with music 'cause I hand lose it
It serenades me while I land cruise it
If I'm stressed or soothing
Something I can make the fans move with
Said I be singing till I saw you was like man, who this?
While JD Mingle be gettin' at you with a brand new twist
Switchin' my linger, wishin' I could be the one you cling to
I ask you for you number maybe I can ring you
Six months later when I'm sick my baby bringin' me food
Hang with the fellas, I said, Mainly, I'll be hangin' with you
Ready to have that satisfaction of you saying I do
Since you finally did it, now we together mind, body, spirit
That's something can't no body interfere with, for life
4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife
4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife
I bet you be strapped at point little pubs
Said she never give her number out to dudes in the clubs
That's the boogies and exceptions
'Cause she's showing me love
Body bangin' like the county but I avoid the rub
Prolly to use to dudes jockin', all I asked was a hug
So she slid me the digits, mashed out in a bug
A couple months pass, and we the item 'round town but
I'm feelin' like the worm, like she just want me for the rebound
She fresh outta, relationships that only got her
Heartache and pain, frustrated because of drama
I'm look at your face picturing kids and I can see em
Till death do us part we got the match and mazzaliam
On poppa's DM, I'll put you in the chrome BM
You different from the rest you love God and MCing
Whether it be tattoo, rings or bling
50 karat, you my wife 4 life, we got our backs and it's apparent
4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife
4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife
So you heard when I asked that night you'd be my wife
Not for this year or next but mine for all life
To accept me when I'm seein' and to understand
Not to make this dim in the rain which comes as hard as any
I'm not the best of men
My fault has come scarce tonight
But my heart has always been to give to my wife
Yes, you are, baby
Tina Jones, been picky bout men
Don't want some common fella
Contaminatin' me like salmonella
Workin' undercover like my rhyme umbrella
Keepin' it shady, I'm not going for it though, not even maybe
Showin' proof to you the difference from a rag and from a lady
I can do for myself, makin' my bacon living gravy
And thankin' the Lord 'cause more importantly he saved me
I shot for the moon, lookin' for comets like I'm Haley
I found me a star companionship is what it gave me
I'm beautiful too and not because my hair is wavy
That's my baby, I said
4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife
4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife
4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife
4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife

Dear Ms. DeLores Tucker, You keep stressin' me, and fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind. I figured you wanted to know, you know, why we call them hoes bitches. Maybe 
 might help you understand! It ain't personal. Strictly business, baby. Strictly business!
So if you wonda why we call you bitch
If you wonda why we call you bitch
Hehehe, these are my words to my first born...
Can you picture, young niggaz in a rush to grow
Till hard timers in the pen, had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw it comin' - too busy bullshittin
Caught him with his mouth runnin'; ain't this a bitch
They got me twisted in this game
The feds and the punk, po - lice pointin pistols at my brain
I wonder if I'm wrong 'cause I'm thugged out
My homies murdered execution style runnin' in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit - now shit is flipped
Cause niggaz died over bullshit - it's not my dream
I'm seein pictures of a broken man, no witnesses
Only the questions of who smoked the man, young adolescents
In our prime live a life of crime, though it ain't logical
We hobble through these tryin' times, livin' blind
Lord help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow?
And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer one love
To the thugs in heaven I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my first born, feel me
... My words to my first born
... My words to my first born
Since my very first day on this earth, I was cursed
So I knew, that the birth of a child would make my life worse
And though it hurt me there was no distortion
Cause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions
Quiet your soul, cause you know what you had to do
And so did victims of a world they never came to
I understand it's a better day comin'
Sometimes cats be sleepin' on the dead end
Drivin' with the car runnin' blinded
Ain't no love in the hood only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died up on the table
Wasn't able to breathe, cause the family wasn't able
Can't - blame her I would do the same
All I could give it was my debt and my last name
Cause in the game things change livin' up and down
This hard life got me walkin' with my head down
Flashin frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?
But I'll never get to know, so I carry on
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
My words to my first born, feel me
... My words to my first born
... Hey nigga talk to your born, talk to your seed nigga
Two thousand somethin' somethin' it's a new era
A nigga's too real, now see shit too clear
See there's more than just this scrilla and this tilt
The velvet and the silk, and makin' sure my kittens got they milk
Attack this, the Mack must roll, hood stroll
Ain't no question is it? Above the Law hustlers
If it's related to chips, homey we'll handle ya
Yo...
Although we never take advantage though we always into ery'thang
By all means, stack green, gangsta lean
They say money make the world go 'round
So only 'ssociate yourself with paper chasers
And niggaz that's truly down - and keep God first
And give thanks for the good times, as well as when it hurts
It's player haters every corner you hit
Touchin their tits, hella thick, tryin' to get you for yo' grip
I know you stressed out and fed up
But come out, gun - blazin', and keep yo' head up
You can call it what you want to but it ain't gon' change
Above the Law, 2Pac, O. G. 's in this rap game
And we done lived a long hard life
And we done shed so many tears under these bright lights
Y'all, although we grew up, corrupted and scorned
We still got a lot of wisdom, to give to our first born
What you gon' tell your kids nigga?
Who was you? What was you doin'? How did you put it down?
These my words to my motherfuckin first born
So they can know, y'knahmean? Hehehe
Ain't nuttin but a motherfuckin rider, Wessyde till I die
That's all it was, it's a crooked - ass hand they deal a motherfucker
I just played to win, just played to win
Motherfucker gotta bet against the odds...
Killing us one by one
In one way or another
American will find a way to eliminate the problem
One by one
The problem is
The troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
And one by one
We are being wiped off the face of this earth
At an extremely alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact
That we are not fighting back
Brothers, sistas, niggas
When I say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But to me
It means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Acomplishes, nigga
Niggas what are we going to do
Walk blind into a line or fight
Fight and die if we must like niggas
This is for the masses the lower classes
The ones you left out, jobs were givin', better livin'
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're the superior
Break the chains in our brains that made us fear yah
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honour a man that who refuses to respect us
Emancipation Proclamation, please!
Lincoln just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me it's all about hyprocracy
The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me
Lady Liberty still the bitch lied to me
Steady strong nobody's gonna like what I pumpin'
But its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching childern
That they can be all that they wanna to be
There's much more to life than just poverty
This is defaintly ah words of wisdom
Amerika, amerika, amerikkka
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people
I charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor do you have any more evidience
Words of Wisdom
They shine upon the strength of an nation
Conquer the enemy on with education
Protect thy self, reach with what you wanna do
Know thy self, teach what we been through
On with the knowledge of the place, then
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text
Why is that?
'Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, They act as if asking questions is a crime
But forget it, one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
The American dream, though it seems it attainable
They're pulling your sleave, don't believe
Cause it will strangle yah
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
Swear that your mother is living in equality
Forgeting your brother that's living her apology
Thought they had us beat when they took our kids
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
NIGHTMARE that's what I am
America's nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and evil that you gave me
I shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
For Four hundred plus years
You should be scared
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
But you can not escape fate
Well it is my turn to come
Just as you rose you shall fall
By my hands
Amerika, You reap what you sow
2pacalypse America's Nightmare
Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob America's Nightmare
Above the Law America's Nightmare
Paris America's Nightmare
Public Enemy America's Nightmare
Krs-One America's Nightmare
Mutulu Shakur America's Nightmare
Geronimo Pratt America's Nightmare
Assada Shakur America's Nightmare

Hey come the fuck on
We out nigga, westside!
Outlaw ridahs biatch!
Yo, I can see
That you obviously don't know me or my homies
We O-U-T Lawz, fuck the phonies
A wise hustler once told me, it's on you
Though it was dreams when he first told me Now it's true
I got love for you only to a certain exstend
Niggas ain't worth shit
Cops and ride dick permits
I heard this and heard that
About them O-U-T Lawz
Some of them soldiers got shot
Some of them soldiers fell off
Fuck y'all now everybody tied to us
Hollering out a nigga name
But never said what up
That shit critical, despicable, unforgivable
I too like Hot ??
Your own fan won't remember you
Thuggin' but we still spriutual, clear lyrical
I'm like the fuckin' Deff Squad
My ears ain't hearin' y'all
Pump fearin' y'all
But damn I ain't even wantin' to scare y'all
Listen to what I tell y'all
Fuck the world,
Your baby moms and your baby girl
You muthafuckas so fake,
Yo they made me wanna earl
Blake, hate snakes thug hatin' the degree
Outlawz on a paper chase
Can you relate thug niggaz
We will never fall
Through it all, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us
Now I been trapped down
And fucked from day one
This industructable style of mine ain't no fun
Where I'm from
You sure to see about 10 niggaz in a bedroom
Eating off the same spoon
Sweeping with the same broom
It's hazard, it's you don't want yo life
Well give me grab it
I was born inside a love zone
With a glock-nine young marriage
It's critical
Then one of them sat down living so
Mystikal and empoious
With a heart full of anger it's so redicilous
So give me some with 21-gun soldier salute
With a 19-inch black handle snake knife in my boots
I'm straight from the strong, thug to your life
Right to yo wrong, I'll put the good to your evil
I'm the shells to your chrome, you dig that?
I'm life, I'll bring the moon to your night
I'll put the dick to your wife
And I'm the Jesuz of your Christ
You dig that? respect this
I'll bring the end to your claw
I'll bring the loc to your heart
And I'll put the snoop on yo dogs
You hear me?
We follow, this little bullet so hollow
I can promise that estacy ain't promised tomorrow
With this two man mades
Me and my soul death astrayed
I watch my parents get blowed away
Now look what it made
I'm something to face
This ludacy then with me, then with chemistry
Got my eyes on you, the first time you cross me
I'll be frying you, cause y'all don't know me
We will never fall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
When we was kids, the loving felt good
But of course have the respect
Though it's even better
Now for this chedder
Niggaz is laying deader
Then Malcolm and Martin put together
Oh Lord only knows where we'll end up
Remember what Pac said
Watch the fuckin' signs
But we wasn't listening
Too busy trippin' off his shine
Now one time for my muthafuckin' Outlawz
Napoleon, Noble, and Kastro
May we all roll
And if you don't know
We got the rap game petro
Scared 'cause we bout to release
Like heavy metal
Nationwide, underground
We running the ghettos
Stealing all of ya fan base like we kleptos
Bitch I can't let go
I been strugglin' too long, thuggin' too long
And niggaz is stealing my shit
And busting it wrong
Hot shots holla back when you get 'em
Outlawz'll sic 'em, bustin' back at the system
Military wisdom
Preparing myself for armegeddom
Breaking my balls at this game
Knowing it's a dead end
And my only weapon
Is my believe that I'm superior
Yeah we the muthafuckas
That you niggaz is liery off
Controling my steam
Knowing my team to deserve more
Fuck the reframe
Stick to the game and earn more
Holding my head, rolling the head with focus
Laughing inside
Cause deep inside y'all don't know us
We will never fall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us
Through the war, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us
Ain't never know niggaz like us boy
They don't make niggaz like us no more
See ya soon... uh
Young black male!
Young black male
I try to effect by kicking the facts
And stacking much mail
I'm packing a gat 'cause guys wanna jack
And fuck goin' to jail
'Cause I ain't equipped to stop how I look
I don't sell ya-yo
They teachin a brother like I was in books
Follow me into a flow
I'm sure you know, which way to go
I'm hittin 'em out of the dopes
So slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow
I'm fuckin' the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
The gimminy jimminy grows
Then whaddya know, it's off with some clothes
Rowd when the crowd says hoe
That let's me know, they know I can flow
Love when they come to my shows
I get up and go, with skins before
When I'm collecting my dough
I never respect, the one that I back
The quicker the nigga can rap
The bigger the check, now watch how they sweat
What kind of style is that?
The style of a mack, and ready to jack
I rendered up piles of black
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
I hate it when real nigga bust
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust, and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales... of young black males
Yes nigga, N-I-G-G-A niggaz
Ay nigga you can't handle that shit!
Pass that man!
Hit that shit, that's the shit!
It smell like skunk, skunk smell like that nigga momma
We ain't nuttin but some low down dirty niggaz
Keep it real nigga, fuck you nigga!
You ain't givin' me near a dime on this real motherfucker
Fuck St. Ide's it's an Old E thing baby
Strictly some of that Hennesee
Can I drink with you fellas? Can I get it on it?
Fuck you Capo. You ain't in baby.
I tell you what! You guys are not gonna be talking
All that shit, when I come back, OK?
We gonna say who the big mouth, when I come back
Young black male!
I wanna dedicate this one to Robert 'Yummy' Sanderford
And all other lil' young niggaz that's in a rush to be gangstas
As a young nigga, I'm almost swellin in the wind
Give anythang, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin' with the homies
Tell them niggaz started slangin that they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin' to make a bill-ion, can you play me
With that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
Someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin with a twenty sack of indo, feelin' good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, know it's bad
But all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
As young niggaz
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known
Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin' by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin' high
My neighborhood was full of drivebys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin' short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
Let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
Me Against the World stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitched 'cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play,
But that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known
I'm tellin' you...
... To be young, have your brains and have every ? and all that
Yo, y'all niggaz don't know how good you really do got it
Muh'fuckers need to just calm down
And peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
'Fore you end your life before you BEGIN your life
You dumb nigga
Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein somethin'
Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin' nuttin
Tryin' to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
And I will even if it kills me, my young niggaz
Break away from these dumb niggaz
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come nigga
Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin
Puttin' niggaz in a casket, murdered for hangin'
At the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin'
'Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
The epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
The projects lookin' hopeless, where
More and more brothers givin' up and don't care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed
And I proceed to blow the track up, for young niggaz
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
For these young niggaz
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
Take it slow nigga, it's for the young niggaz
He's the downest G I've ever known
As a young nigga
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
Memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
He's the downest G I've ever known
Them niggaz that's thirteen and fourteen
Stay strong nigga
You could be a fuckin' accountant, not a dope dealer
Fuck around and, you pimpin' out here
Niggaz gotta get they priorities straight
Especially my little cousins don't be no dumb guy
Just the two of us
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Now I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
And mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin dinner while you were sweepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?
See honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And dada's probably on his way to all of them except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
I told you it's okay Hai Hai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter
Wake up, sweepy head, we're here
Before we pway, we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
That's why you can't get her to wake
But don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk
Just the two of us
Your dada will always be there for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me I'mma always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you baby
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired,
Feel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up.
But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
You're coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For sizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when you're real
And you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And it's absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I, I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one can beat me.
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Yeah, too late
I can't keep, chasing you
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
I don't think she understands, the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right, I would have stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I would have laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain
Bitch you, took me for granted took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it, I'ma take control of this relationship command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this, I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase, it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
I told you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left, I'd laugh while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah funny ain't it
You neglected me, did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you, in my heart I have kept, it's unfortunate but it's
Too late for the other side 
Caught in a chase, 25 to life 
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
I feel like when I bend over  
 backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you
Still man I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcin' you, go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom, like you did to me, treat 'em
Like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you, feed 'em
The same shit that you made me eat, I'm movin' on forget you
Oh, now I'm special, I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was dissed, helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me, why I can't just walk away from 'em
I'm addicted to the pain the stress the drama, I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed
But this time I ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And it's just
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life 
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
Patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed
But kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now
It's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
That smashed into your Honda Accord
With a 4 door Ford
The mozarella
Worse than a hellacopta propella
Got you locked in the cella
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia
While I'm standin next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins
Feeding you liquid darvicet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance
And driven
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
And given
A less than 20 percent chance
Of living
Have a possible placement
It's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream I'M STILL ALIVE!
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson
To set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombas
We blowin' up your house killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more 'cause I smoked crack
Today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath
Walk the block with a labrador
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure
Ohh ohhh
Oh ohhh
Ohhh
Oh ohh
Oohh
Oh, Ohh
Good bye
You're walking down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the morning and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible
Right there's the coroner
Waiting for you to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
'Cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowing a Klonopin while I'm noddin'
In and out on the ottoman at the Ramada Inn
Holding onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must have just blacked out again
Not again
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em
I said, it's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanolin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantling
Every candle on top of the fireplace mantle and
Grab my flannel and my bandanna then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standing in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do
Hey, the prodigal son
The diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter 'dem
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em
I said, it's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
I duck and I slash, slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint of the Jack
My last Vic' and a half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December I think it was I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinking tub
Cut him up into pieces, then just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I aught to drink his bath water, that aught to be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 A.M. and here I come so you should probably run
A secret passage way around here, man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none, he can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
'Cause it's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em
I said, it's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em
Yo 
, a-ya 
Yo 
, a-ya 
Yo

Yo

None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus, my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperament
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know
So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A, B, C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
Fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack
So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see
None of these skills that you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see
Of course I rap till I'm hoarse
Add the sauce to them dry turkey MC's
Say what you like, I toss
In theory when you hear me
Like the guts of the Dutch
Snap caught you in the act like Vivitar
AF 2-5-5 auto-focus clear vision
Precision mics for people of all types
Call the cavalry
My brutality switch the pitch gradually
Aqua turntable knocka
Fresh like binocca
Jot the thoughts in my chronicles
Remarkable styles Shadeeq taxed it
Make an exit to spark mine
Nuclear physics with cannibals and phat rhymes
They know the time like it's a sundial, X-File
Went to bible class with a gun
Blasted a nun
Fuck hell, Satan sent my ass to the sun
I wasn't born I was hatched
And dumped in the trash
With a note attached saying
Someone please whip this brat's ass
I never gave a rat's ass or a flying fuck
Driving drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
Slammin' the brakes
Skiddin out 'cause the tires suck,
Went to pull you off my dick
And got the pliers stuck
You better run 'cause I'm probably the only one
Crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife
And stab you with a gun
I like fire, you might see me start it
I'm slightly retarded
I miss my sanity since the night we departed
Oldworlddisorder on some outnumbered shit
We rather go outta control then to be under it
Yo, how you goin' against us
When we got nothin' to lose?
Must be confused
Prayin' to a god that don't excist
That wouldn't save yo bible kissin' asses
Even if he did
We like to twist the misted
Genetick dead end
Don't got friend
Skam is chatter man
Posin childeren for depression
Stressin ANY language
Say my name IN SPANSIH
Suck the life outta you-ou
There won't be enough of your brain left
To fill a tea spoon
We two vanishin man that make the bad things blend
And probably go platinum on the day that the world ends
When it comes to beef
I get relieved when I kill it brief
Send you a reef
Get your family ready for grief
I knock your teeth
Take a seat like a thief
Make a change of release
Burn or leave before you go beneath
Rappers I kill em
Down is to hell is where I send them villain
My plan is illin so much I need some peniculine
Cats is spillin 'cause I'm down here
Kickin shit that's solitaire
You crown is rip
Cause rapper you sound counterfeit
You get a round of clips
If you play hard
You stay scarred
Thinkin' of graveyard
You're in a caveyard
One in the mill
Son I'm ill when it comes to skills
Wanna get killed and catch a dum dum in your grill
Rappers demenishing is I get to the finish
I'm speaking English
While your brothers is speaking in gibberish
You touch a mic and
I'm out to burry your fingers
You want some fame?
I'll beat you up in front of Jerry Springer
So pay the price
Say the nice
When I pay the dice
I take your life
Slay it twice before your arrive
Them cats who ride are feminine,
I'm singin' this without,
The benefit sense of cinnamon,
So submit it in your mental
Since you find it essential to sub the sentence
In sentence
This sentence is simple
You banned from using writing utinsels
Wether cry line, crayon pen or pencil
Observe verse with syntax
That causes skin cracks on impact
Send a rap shot before I spark back
And then send them whack men
Way back to the lab to add what most of them lack
I can hand you a manual of what I plan to do to you more tangible,
You still wouldn't understand the full concept
It slips through your fingers like sandgranuals
Skam will land, and we'll hand
And a blue sea anually
And you will see which animal me,
And fifty of us spittin' up that written stuff
It's all the same and
Is the reason for cyphas prematurely spittin' up
Ironic, phonic flow fo
Sho my flow is far from enbionic
To be honest when I'm on the chronic antibiotic
I'm beyond it!
The texure of my lecture is complex like a professor's
Scepticals think I'm exceptional when I bless sound recepticals,
What runs through my vest
To be turns crews to vegetables
Then grab my testicals and cup em
Fuck em, let's see whose fucked!
Yeah, can't stop now
Maybe the last chance I get
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed up post office worker
A murker wit a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster ya sure did shit your pants when you saw
That chainsaw get to waivin' like a terrible towel
How things turn around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowin' your mind, when I cum back like nut on your spine
I'm the thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come screamin' 'a tac' like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed em defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he out-growed 'em
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em
To try and thwart em, he'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck wit a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips em in P.F. Chang sauce
Games off homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think im backin' down, you must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for
I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some are wrote on a napkin, I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his jack-o-lantern and smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick
Get off my anti-disestablishment-arianism, you prick
Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves wit enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Vern Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards, your Meni Me's
See he's in a whole 'nother weight class, he's slugs, you're bb's
You're bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D-R-E
He's almost famous
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for
Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' 'em shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark when it scars
Till Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out awww
His metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a necktie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they're at it, he's fuckin' had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to Hell and build a snowman, girl
The bully's become bullied, if pussies get pushed then they better pull me
Take me back to ninth grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot, blow it
Who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
And while im being poetic, let me get historic
And raise the bar, higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bare witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it
He's finally famous
Da-dum, da dum
da da dum, da dum
dadada dum, da dum
dada da dum, da dum, dum
 Mentally ill from Amityville
 Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will
 Mentally ill from Amityville
I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this
 Mentally ill from Amityville
 Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will
 Mentally ill from Amityville
 Mentally ill from Amityville
 Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will
 Mentally ill from Amityville
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was asleep
That's what I said at my dad's funeral
 Mentally ill from Amityville
 Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will
 Mentally ill from Amityville
 Mentally ill from Amityville
 Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will
 Mentally ill from Amityville
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fucking shoot it out with 'em too
'Cause once I snap I can't be held accountable for my actions
And that's when accidents happen
When a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around and they found you
God damnit he meant when he tells you
 Mentally ill from Amityville
 Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will
 Mentally ill from Amityville
 Mentally ill from Amityville
 Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will
 Mentally ill from Amityville
Da-dum, da dum

If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning so definite-wait
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, being, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Mama to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle, I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things-time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than two hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'-now I know
I dont know why this world keeps turning
Round and Round
But I wish it would stop, and let me off right now
Yes man
As the World Turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and Tribulations
That we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience
I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby and we suing the courts
Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool, takin a shit in a warm pool
So they threw me out the Ramada Inn
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin teachers and jackin off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin'
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed
Maybe true, till I told this bitch in gym class
Yeah bitch, you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
As the World Turns
These are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through
Day by day
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders and we suing the courts
Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundry-mat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
I met a slut and said What up, its nice to meet ya
I'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money and don't try nothin funny
'Cause you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to out run me
I went to grab my gun
Thats when her ass put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors, started causin a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin crack all day and doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but so I gotta catch her first
Ran through alleys, parkin lots and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room, that's when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!
You might as well come out now
She said Come in, its unlocked!
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said Come here big boy, lets get acquainted
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg No, please let go
But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!
Come here bitch!
Come here!
Take this motherfuckin dick!
Bitch, come here!
And as we go along
Throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through
These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere
Every day
Every single day the world keeps turning
keeps turning
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing doing doing 
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true 
I ain't never seen an ass like that 
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go 
D-doing doing doing
The way she moves she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'm gon' answer
Police saying, 
, d-doing doing doing
What do you mean 
?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not till I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees 
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes I make R&B
I sing song it go, 
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend I'm sorry, please please forgive
For I am Triumph the puppet dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh so temptin'
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see that show on MTV my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they're getting older, they're starting to grow bum bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying, 
, d-doing doing doing
What do you mean 
, geez, I just got my seat?
I have ticket look, I put away my zipper-zip
Please do not remove me from this movie theater please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh, 'cause there's a puppet on my hand
The way you shake it, I can't believe it 
I ain't never seen an ass like that 
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go 
D-doing, doing, doing 
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing 
The way she moves she dances like a go-go
In that video she sings get out your poles, so
I need a new boyfriend, hi my name is JoJo
Police saying, 
, d-doing doing doing
What do you mean 
, my computers would be seized?
And my keys to my ranch, I just baked cookies
Mr. Officer, looky, take a whiff of these
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word pee-pee, pee
On the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast, I think I just saw a tit?
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing doing doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing 
 Fuck is wrong with you?
I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped to think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked, sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember
Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling
Like I'm always under attack man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling
Women dish him but really thinking
If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
When I'm ripping shit, but since when did this many
People ever give a shit but I had to say, it's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living
Put a dick in your rear end and guess what
Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it
For drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude
Thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battle for it, mad awards, act paranoid
Attaboy, they told me to slow down and I just zone out
Good luck trying to convince a blonde
That's like telling Gwen Stefan' that she sold out
'Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down
In history think they know now because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Thanks for the support, asshole
Thanks for the support, asshole
Quit acting salty, I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth
When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history
But goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Lay'em off it
But what the fuck is all this thrash talking about
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knock me down, I went down for the count
I fell but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt, word to Pacquiao
Mama said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Gotta go in that ring and knock them out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revolting
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke till you're bullet riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock
Just to go out watch Batman
Who needs a test to test the testicles, not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model
Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo
My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole
With a pack torn of paper
But I'm not taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the back pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go
Trying to dip through the back door retreating 'cause everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Holy mackerel, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
I smack the girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull
Thinkin' we have some magnetic pull
Screamin' ICP in this bitch, how do magnets work!?
'Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, It's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen? That ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
'Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one track mind
Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
'Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor
Been tryina hunt me down like a dog, 'cause you're on my ass
But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent
With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents and motherfucking Father Time
And it ain't never gonna stop
A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime
So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Throw all my half empty glass in a cup, now my cup is runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster
I'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah cocky, and can't not been? rude off?
So fear not my dear and dry up your teardrops, I'm here, white America's mirror
So I feel awkward and weird, you stare at me and see yourself, 'cause you're one too
You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one ouch
What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar ray leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
Fuck it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, till Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god 'cause If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place' went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
It's like I'm in this dirt digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You could just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered but tonight betcha that whatcha
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying let it go, fuck this
Heart's saying I will once I bury this bitch alive.
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset
I flee the scene, like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
Follow me I run, I run, follow me, follow me
I just hate to be the bad guy
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshiped? Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, knit wit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed?
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long
That I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through
?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
I flee the scene, like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
Follow me I run, I run, follow me, follow me
I just hate to be the bad guy
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like nine fricking hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived and my mouth is fulla saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But I ain't here for your empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low then
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag almost hacked up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it, we're in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's the sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
Well, how's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
Hope Fox Trot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot
New plan Stan
Slim chauvinist pig, drove in this big, Lincoln Town Car
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge, ha ha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go, all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds, toilets clogged
Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lotta shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears, I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on ya every woman you insult
Batter but the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers persona's half a facade and
Matthew and Stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you have till it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, I told you so
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away
I'm every guilt trip the baggage you have
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Less it makes an impact then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers left off
We never saw from each other's sides or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue lashing, then you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different, 'cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused
Because
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults, they got thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we could have read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin' still if I said
I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband
We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was fucking harder than
Sawing off a fucking body limb
Once upon a time we're all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me, and I was thinking
I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
Till we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard Mockingbird
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was partly yours
Partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm getting choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck
But there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder
How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop em
Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold blood
That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a sismograph
Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed
Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations collaborating
Attemptin to take over the earth
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
Cuz I can't find a decent vain
The disaster wit dreds
I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger wit money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you
Whippin human ass, throwin blows crackin jaws
Wit my fists wrapped in gause, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's
Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche
And bust till volcanoes errupt
STOP, THEY KNOW IT'S US!!
And this time I'm comin back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
'Cause this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady
And so that's the story when Bad Meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Oh, it's music to my ears
Oh, man!
How can I describe, the way I feel?
Fuckin' great man
Ok, let me see, how can I begin?
Locked in 
's wine cellar all I had for lunch
Was bread wine, more bread wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up and in between snack crackers to munch
Mariah whatever happened to us
Why did we have to break up, all I asked for was a glass of punch
You see I never really asked for much, I can't imagine what's
Going through your mind after such
A nasty break up with that Latin hunk
, 
 better back the fuck
Up, I'm not playin' I want her back, ya punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that ya want
I mean I really want ya bad, ya cunt
Nick you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster, my signature
Sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant wow
Man, what an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma-
ceuticals this beautiful pill dust in my palm my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama
I’ll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fucking annoyin' drop the shovel boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doing
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon ya prick I wish ya luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born
Snuck up on Malachi
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck of, shuck of corn, shuck of corn
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fucking on
Man what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're running over the snow blower with the lawn mower
Blow on your bagpipes from Baghdad 
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag
In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty fuckin' you till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends? You need a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other especially when your joined at the hip
I'm going to get a needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch them back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate Chips Ahoy chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid flick
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag of bagpipes from Baghdad
I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles
In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you 
I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like 
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you 
Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid
Aunt Edna always told me, 
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet
In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you 
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful. 
I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today's a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
And right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, cause
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya, your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal, and hit the corner fast, the more asserted, never looking back, may hit the curb, but everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to, to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage, 'cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass, and threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes, and that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline, and while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
So familiarize what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleek and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keeping you from leaping off the motherfreaking deep end
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and flame retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
'Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's gone down in flames
Throw the match at the past up place
So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the lightt
Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
Flame of love, we're going to fight the word, fight
Now it feels with these wings that I will fly
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman, ground-up
Like round chuck and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit-tick, tick, tick-no remorse, pew
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on wick-wick, wick, wick-with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now and walk out
I will never let you live it down
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might want to think it over twice
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warheaded birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me
You're gettin' yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of tunnel
So people are always lookin' at me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since Cleanin' Out My Closet
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up
Like you're tryin' to fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compare
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you Proof because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that apron and mo-
-Tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans left you two-faced at the show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginning
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
Till I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pains once you've won the race?
When that fuel exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and go berserk
All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and go berserk
All night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem ti'l the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So 
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang -- bang, bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang
P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down, br-bow-bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and go berserk
All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and go berserk
All night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem ti'l the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So 
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn’t everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur’s Cargo's
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man
You bird-brained baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and go berserk
All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and go berserk
All night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem ti'l the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So 
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem ti'l the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So 
I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man
You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now, I need you to open your mind; your eyes, close them
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now, why did they make Yoo-hoo? Hippity ga-ga boo-boo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listenin' 
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask; it's been itchin' at me
Is it just because
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright, now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was; I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot; no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay?
You're droolin', you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting
What the fuck d'you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks; wanna chew some gum?
You, sir, are on truth serum
Marshall, I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed; I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
All these terrible, evil, and awful mean things
It's my own insecurity
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright, now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like; want to check to see?
Here's a mirror; notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on
Now look in this mirror; how about now?
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you; I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why're you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is tortuous
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a...
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Get the fuck off my dick
Justin, its Zoe, Um Kellie did not have me call you
However I just listened to Eminem in her car
It is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard
In my entire life and I seriously want to call his
Fucking agent and tell them how fucking disgusting he is
It like makes me upset, I am now nauseous and I cant eat lunch
Goodbye
Nah-uh, nah-uh, uh-uh, oh no, he didn't 
They didn't do it again 
Wha-what? What? 
Uh-uh, no 
You smell that 
This is special right here 
It's a toast to the boogie baby 
To the boogie oogie-oogie 
Yeah, y'know 
What's cracking, Dre? 
Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, start riots like 
Throw on Guilty Conscience at concerts
And watch mosh pits till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds, me and Snoop draw
Not these niggas again, these grown ass ignorant men
You and what army could harm me
D-R-E and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach
We came a long way to making these songs play
It a be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uzi, and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being Andre
But I
Somehow, someway, hello, nigga
You know about Doggy, Snoop Dogg
Now let me cut these niggas up
And show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' with the shit that I be spittin', son
Hit and run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about 50 guns, and I love all of 'em the same
Bang bang
Damn, baby girl, what's yo name?
I forgot, what'd you say it was?
Hangin' in the club wit my nephew, Eminem
What up, cuz?
The great white American hope
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, baby
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
I'm the head nigga in charge
I'm watching you move
You're found dead in your garage
With 10 o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it, 'cause I expose the fasciad
Your little lungs is too small to hot box with God
All jokes aside, come bounce wit us
Standing over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a body bag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough
When things get rough, I'm in the club shooting with 
Bitch, please, you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
Back up in the heezy, baby
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right?
I'm just a criminal making a livin' off the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right?
To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin' at night and screamin' at mom's schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down is a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude is being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard tea CD using the fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot
You happy now? Look here
I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know
I start some shit, they throw me out the back do'
Come back and shoot the club up wit a fo-four
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, Nate Dogg
Come on, yeah
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in junior high, this kid said
It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die
He said, Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Something told me, Try to fake a stomach ache it works
I screamed, Ow, my appendix feels like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse
Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee
But don't you wanna give me after school detention?
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage
Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him, We shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, You gonna die honkey
And started helpin' him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it till I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home, later that same day
Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryna to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', What are you on, drugs?
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, Look bitch, what have you done?
I said, Fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage
It's brain damage
I got brain damage
It's brain damage
It's probably brain damage
It's brain damage
Brain damage
I got brain damage
It's brain damage
Who can say fore sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society would reap a great benefit
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
on who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourettes
Fuck f-fuck fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbor's hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches
With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this
Mess and make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch this predicament's despicable
I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freaking wuss, a pussy
This kid just took my stick of licorice
And threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's using your head
Mama always said If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous 
Mama, I'mma grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus 
I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness 
Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless
Fast forward some years later, a teenager, this is a fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud for what reason, you stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you be down and be upbeat
When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life
Chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street
But if I had just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicing trash talking in a trance
Locked in my room yeah, but I got some plans mama
These damn rhymes are falling
Out of my pants pocket I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more, school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
Threw my first punch, end of story
Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void
Been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge
Syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board
A bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
'Cause I'd probably be Dahmer 'cause mama always said
Mama always said If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous 
Mama, I'mma grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus 
I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness 
Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless
Now my mum goes womp womp womp
'Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go, they scream out 'Go'
I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out
Middle America, hear them yell out
Until they were so scared, and those kids
Just about, belted out
Whatever spout that it fell out
Of my smart-aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, yeah, till then
Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
Till emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin' 
Who the fuck would've thought that one little lone MC
Would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it
And boy did they flock
Can't believe this little hick locked
This Hip Hop shit in his hip pocket
And still the shit got that
White trash traffic and gridlock
Shit hopping like a six blocks from a Kid Rock
Insane Clown Posse concert in mid-October
And God forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog
'Cause I turn into the Unabomber mama always said
Mama always said If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous 
Mama, I'mma grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus 
I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness 
Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless
Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't
Better watch out sucker now I got ya where I want ya,
Onslaught, coming and I'm packing in my lunch a,
Bunch a missile launchers and a bunch a contra-
Ban van full of ganja, now come on jump,
Man stop marchin' Marshall oh my God ya,
Doin' the cha cha and the cucaracha with a quadri-
Plegic boogieing down to Frank Sinatra,
Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya,
Who da knew the Buddha do ta me what's its done,
Such cynicism when this isn't in my system,
Blunt hypnotism lift the spliff up to my lip son,
So much on my hands, I got to give my kids a fist pump,
Chris-to-pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks,
Mis-ter, help me's what he said to me and then sunk,
Women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks,
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones,
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill,
Skin 'em up, hem em,
Sew 'em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,
Upa up in those kilts,
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,
Buffa-buffalo bill,
Always, you can see 'em lurking in the hallways,
Carcasses of caucasion females in his crawl space,
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place,
Hide 'em in the wall but how long will the drywall take,
Well f-ck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait,
Until it dries for the moment I guess your all safe,
After I sand it and buff it I guess that I'll paint,
My chainsaw's outta gas my regular saw ain't,
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling,
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within,
Someone's in, the back of my damn house rummaging,
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin but I want her skin,
Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end,
Evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win,
Severing legs, arms, damn there goes another limb,
Pull the lever then trap door, death is evident
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill,
Skin 'em up, hem em,
Sew 'em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,
Upa up in those kilts,
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,
Buffa-buffalo bill,
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill,
Nothing so chill,
F-cking hoe, you better f-cking hold still,
Make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don't spill,
Cut 'em gut 'em and just keep stuffing those girls,
Man I think she had enough of those pills,
Sedate her, then I wait I come back later just to clutch on those steel blades
Baby when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises I f-cking told you,
I keep hearing voices like
Wouldn't you like to go and get ya butcher knife
And push it right through her while ya put ya shish-kebab skewer
Into her, barbecue her or would ya do to her what you usually do to a girl who's skins newer,
In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a torment tournament of sorts,
Christmas Ornament you are,
Ill be sure to Ginsu ya till there's no more skin to ya,
Boo ya who ya think you f-cking with,
Duck because here he comes again,
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill,
Skin 'em up, hem em,
Sew 'em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,
Upa up in those kilts,
Man you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,
Buffa-buffalo bill,
Yo
Check it out
It's fucked up
'Cause I don't see either one of us budgin'
I'm with-holding my anger
Though id like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's punie neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect
That's when he says to himself as he
Uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that hes manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
And he don't exist in his world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
And its destroying him slowly
'Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now hes acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so hes mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared
You ain't no muthafuckin
Buuully
And I ain't bowing to no muthafuckin
Buuully
I won't allow it, ain't no coward to no
Buuully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a
Buuully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a
Buuully
And I know it must be fuckin' with you emotionally
Now I'm not tryin' to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many other muthafuckas that just are
They just keep houndin at me
Now that I'm down wit 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at Bay
So now Ja thinks that hes so tough
And Murder INC's the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff
And blow our label down
But our buildings made out of bricks
So you ain't takin' our shit
And dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card
And it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus that stylist that you fucked
When you was extacy'd up
Was just a man who's dressed up
As a white bitch
You must be takin' too much eeeeeeeeee
Now what bothers me the most
About hip hop is we so close
To pickin' up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master Jay
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugs, Snake Tongue and Freaky Tah
It's like a neverending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybodies gotta be so fuckin' hard
And I'm not excluding myself
'Cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men we learn
To let shit go but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to up hold
When someone steps on our toe
Its no exception it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
And wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
They just keep feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg I'm talkin' to you straight
If the situation escalates and worse
Were gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailey's name
Irv go get your boy up off that Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Get at me dawg, holla
Yeah, Shady, Hahahaha
G G G G G G G G-Unit
Here we go again
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire cause Shady said so
I'm on fire
Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin stone
But don't compare me
I'm better off jus' left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there wit record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself
Say what up, keep steppin, and just rep D-12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin' wreckless
But if you go check my belt
You may see something else I used to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja musta lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Juss keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along and fight you
Me and Hailie danced to your songs we liked you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after syllable I just slap you
Killin' you fasta than you poppin' pill afta little pill of them tabs of that shit you on
But if you want it you got it you'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads wit any motherfucker that wants to
So what's the, deal where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg?
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'ma grown man dawg come holla
All you did was slapdance, smile and swallow,
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be come on
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars'll melt you
Ja you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome 38
And put six through your hats of seven 3/8
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you should shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe and freeze ya on the turnpike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got robbed two times so ya ass is laid
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You betta stick to tha movies with Steven Seigel, bitch
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Fuck that I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
I'ma find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man
Tellin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate out tha game an'...
They see me more pop a boy for icey 'cause I could
Shootin' guns for money you probably forgot your way around the hood
Bitch when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
Now you want it wit' us, half your artists got to make a point
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer picture
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nuttin' about what pain is sucka
I'll put your ass to the ground like a train conductor, muh'fucker
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Yeah nigga yeah
Shady Aftermath G-Unit
Fuck you think they call us G Unit for
'Cause we move units uhha
Don't think we ain't billin you for this motherfucking studio time
A matter a fact keep call it a 50 we'll call it even
Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
And punch a bitch in the nose, till her whole face explodes
Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets
Call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin' through the airport, sluggish, walkin' on crutches
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out
Lookin' for some other thug, to beat the crap out
I'm bringin' you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate in English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speakin' so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it
I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse
And waste the paper on you, choppin down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'
You motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nuttin
Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily
Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily
A person from another planet might disagree with you
Well if you want my opinion, it comes from right here on Earth
Slim Shady... Misdemeanor...
Timbaland... Slim Shady...
Misdemeanor...
I'm homicidal, and suicidal with no friends
Holdin' a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin tecs at you until you see your fuckin' legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin next to you
Fuck mouth, my whole house, is foamin at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped 'em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin again
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy! Get back
Uh, I'ma put you all in the line
Uh, and I'ma watch you MC's die
Yo mommy, mommy, Missy done lost her mind!
I think somebody done pissed her off this time!
Yo, I'ma have to bust you through your chest and
It's rainin rainin and it's pourin loud
Never fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
Uh, I hear the gats go cha-pow
Who shot me damnit? Bitch get down
For the sound, that me and, Timbaland, we found
Get your ass, kicked later, or get your ass, kicked now
Uh... one-two
Misdemeanor, Slim Shady
Timbaland, motherfucker
Uh uh uh
Cool, cool, cool
Triple zero

Holy wack unlyrical lyrics André, you're fucking right!

Bitches and gentlemen

Hurry, hurry step right up
Introducing the star of our show; his name is…
Marshall!
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without futher ado, I bring to you…
Marshall! 
Your 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old doc is back
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh god, Sadam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrrm, vrrm, yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-11, so
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
Quick; gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers, 
, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone. Time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou, while I do what I do best 
You ain't even impressed no more; you used to it 
Flows too wet, nobody close to it 
Nobody says it, but still everyone knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exagerate it all so much 
They make it all up; there's no such thing 
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin', and you know what for 
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll
To Marshall and André's carnival. C'mon now!
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
Two old friends; why panic? You already know
Who's is fully capable, the two capped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0
You can even call collect, the most feared duet 
Since me and 
 played career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink or get to busting a sweat 
People stepping over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats MC's dont see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone; the game needs me
Till we grow beards, get weird, and disappear 
Into the mountains; nothing but clowns down here
But we ain't fucking around 'round here 
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
So there you have it folks 
Marshall!
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend André
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because

And André are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray
Marshall!
So until next time friends 
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night everyone; thank you for coming
Your host for the evening

Oh, hah

Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrrm, vrrm, yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-11, so
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
Quick; gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers, 
, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone. Time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou, while I do what I do best 
You ain't even impressed no more; you used to it 
Flows too wet, nobody close to it 
Nobody says it, but still everyone knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exagerate it all so much 
They make it all up; there's no such thing 
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin', and you know what for 
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll
To Marshall and André's carnival. C'mon now!
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
Two old friends; why panic? You already know
Who's is fully capable, the two capped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0
You can even call collect, the most feared duet 
Since me and 
 played career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink or get to busting a sweat 
People stepping over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats MC's dont see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone; the game needs me
Till we grow beards, get weird, and disappear 
Into the mountains; nothing but clowns down here
But we ain't fucking around 'round here 
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?
Let's get down to business

So there you have it folks 
Marshall!
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend André
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because
Marshall!
And André are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray
Marshall!
So until next time friends 
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night everyone; thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
Marshall!
Oh, hah
I, I wanna grow up toon
Poppa Marshall, will you tell us a bed time story?
Heeere we gooo
Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went letter double pop a wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
Me and you clef we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass
Hey mister, would ya care ta bear witness ta
The ass-whippin I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blista
Stan-abis, little Marshall Mathers sista
Annanis, corner, we have a mister
Not havin' it it's the machinista
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonist bag of dick-suckin
Ex LL Cool Jay fan from Windsor
I'm bout to murder little guinea fag Anista
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at I miss ya
Can-a-bitch oh can-a-bitch where for art thou can-a-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with that style that you were rappin' with?
Can-a-bitch oh can-a-bitch are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor from Canada? Oh Can-a-bitch
Now at first I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in a bat man chair an relaxin
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanner
It's 'Can-a-bitch' or some Stan lives shit
They creep me out at first man this is sick
But me being just a sick as conflict gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were
Tellin' me shit like you respect me like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask
How come I ain't return none of the messages at Shady Records you left me?
The fourth Letter Slim you really startin to upset me
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building
This crazy mother fucker's really tryin' to kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters
That said some shit about a message you left
Oh shit that's not an e that's an a
This dude wants to leave me a massage he's gay
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
We got a bogey Marshall I'm on the way
Can-a-bitch oh can-a-bitch where for art thou can-a-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with that style that you were rappin' with?
Can-a-bitch oh can-a-bitch are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor from Canada? Oh Can-a-bitch
So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib
Only thing is we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
Shit oh Dre wait a mintue that's it
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost
We can fly over the border Let's go whoosh
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin speed
Keep goin' no time to waste
Fuck now he's draggin under the car
Oh well only 30 more thousand miles
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hatin'
And tryin' to figure out what happened to Jermaine propaine
He couldn't have fell of that hard ain't no way
What happened to the way you was rappin',
When you was scandalous then Canabis turned into a television evangelist?
Plus he raps with his regular voice
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin but his ass was rotted
He kind of smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork he's done
So I stapped him twice kept jabbin Christ
He won't die this guy's like a battered wife
He's like Kim he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw
Hold up Bis quit foldin up
Punch me in the chest make my shoulders touch
Do somethin' at least one punch line
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-tey-nine percent of my fans are blonde
Bis c'mon answer me man respond
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars
Intergalatic or metaphors from Mars
Raw to the floor raw like Resovoir dogs
Bite another line from Red Man's song
Suddenly the stub of a dead man's arm from a midget
Reaches out from under the car
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again
Dre all right he's dead dawg quit kickin him
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again
Breaking news, Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour
To check himself into rehab, after admitting an addiction
To sleep medication. We'll have more on this story as it develops.
Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently
Survived a gunshot to the head, in what appears to be
A random drive-by shooting. Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be...
Alienated... on again/off again relationship with...
This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus...
Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire
At an after-hours club we've learned that the rapper Proof
Has been fatally shot.
Shady/Aftermath recording artist...
Long-time best friend of Eminem, and a member of the rap group D12.
D12 back in the news again today...
Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation
Continue to swirl around Eminem. He insists he's just taking a break
But doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask,
'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
There's somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me to a monster, I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert, I was rakin in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losin my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it, every CD critics gave it a 3
Then three, years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic, The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleepin' pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk
So be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
Then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I said be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
Then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I got a letter from a fan that said, he's been prayin' for me
Every day and for some reason it's been weighin on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But somethin' told me to go ahead and open it
But, why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least, a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin it from a opposite standpoint, man boy it's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now on how, to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit
So be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
Then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I said be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
Then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
This is your song
You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'mma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously assuming you will be
Just thinking ahead, I'ma make it if it kills me
Let's see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter, maybe they can feel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to Mom and Dad's crazy world
Love, Daddy, maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes and syrup
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1996, dear Hailie
You got your mama's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into 'em, baby, I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering, I'mma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'mma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping that you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
As a goodbye note, 'cause your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go
I'm getting sleepy, love, Dad... shit, I don't know
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travellin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go-hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
Till your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend, that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch
I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Yeah, uh, and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
You still ain't in the building, boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drillbit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tales
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
Till I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Dick is a bargaining tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't?
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause
I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah
You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash, stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talkin' reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Columbian neck tie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribe
Ending your life to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your motherfuckin' throat like
Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
You know technically, I'm not even supposed to be here right now
So fuck it
Some of us don't get a second chance
Who can catch lightnin' in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme to freeze the clock; take the hands of time and cuff 'em
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start the bug prick, you better flea 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap; I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
It's a trap; fuck my last CD, that shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'; no remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin' for no one
Knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zeroin' on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot; parked in it, too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up; stand behind you like, wooh
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan, too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you; frankly, he would, too
This game could ill-afford to lose him; how 'bout you?
Now guess who 
, here's a clue 
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
Now, what's his name?
Fuck catchin' lightnin'; he struck it; screamed Shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
Rewound the future to the present, paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past, motherfucker; he's the shit right how
He's 
Cinderella man, Cinder-fella, Shady Dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell; from hell he came
But didn't come to bore ya with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same ol'; can't afford to be a lame-o
In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old, H-I to the new, Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grace; raise 'em high
In the sky, keep 'em out, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient; I won't make no more mistakes, shit
My potatoes baked homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed; yeah, faggot, the stakes are high
Shit, I ain't even s'pposed to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and a hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you, how much in your face am I?
And ain't shit you can do but fear it; Proof is here in spirit
And I'm his spittin' image; I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I cunt hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists?
Who 
, here's a clue 
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass 
, he's in your ass; he's all up in your psyche, too 
Now, what's his name?
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama

I never meant to make you cry

I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
'Cause some things just, don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
So on a, bigger stage they came to see you spit your game, oh
But it shouldn't be difficult, to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice, you remain
Fuck 'em all, tell 'em all, eat shit, here we go again
So, goddamn.
Is it that time again already?
Haha, y'all don't look too happy to see me.
Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once?
All right, fuck y'all then.
You can get the dick, just call me the ball sac, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch dog, fall back, you mutts
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck-sicked, mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble 'em up trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucka
Motherfucka' might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cock-sucker
This shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off, now I'm shittin' and pissin' on
Everybody, give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So buck the Buddah, light a bong
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't, know
Kno-kno-know, know-know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh
Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon
Bruce Banner's back in the booth, y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Mo'fucker, I'll show you pussyfootin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt, 'til it makes a queef, and sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin', you must have mistook me for some
Sissy soft punk, lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead fuckin' hater push me, I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot, 'cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, 
, naw I can't goddammit, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens, the world will
Stop spinnin' and Michael J. Fox'll, come to a stand-still
Durin' an earthquake, urine in your face 'cause you're fake
Ow what the fuck, that hurt, wait
Ow what the fuck, I just got struck
By lightnin', alright then I quit, God I give up
Call it evil that men do, Lord forgive me for what my pen do
, and just then the wind blew, and I said...
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't...
Know, kno-kno-know, know-know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh oh-oh
How long will I be this way, Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long, 'til then I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man I'm a, cold soul, I roll solo so don't compare
Me, to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to dis me I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
The last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writin' this and I thought of you, so...
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't...
Know, kno-kno-know, know-know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh oh-oh
I don't know... I don't know what caused...
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know... I don't know but I'll...
Probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so... I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me
Good mornin
Haha, wake your mother fuckin' asses up
Hey yo what is the what?
Well come on in, you know what time it is
Stop sleepin' on my group, bitch
For whatever it's worth, it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever get ass squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That wanna be brauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad, they can't stand it
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap Then it's a wrap, Then it's a scrap
An it isn't rap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' a slappin
Believe me I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now your not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a bit, boy, you get bit, B
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me 'cause they just bounce off me like bullets do, 50
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
I do this for Swifty
Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy, and Proof are you with me?
Come on in Everybody come on in

So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in
They said of me, the epitome of a beef starter
In a party with heat. It's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs, I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly poppin' slugs. they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses, A halocaust to whoever ain't cautious
In a house full of dark shit, I'ma gothic death prophet. yo stop breathin
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin frequent
An Your leader is a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it an won't even keep it a secret
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?
Well Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
'Cause we get it on un- till the break of dawnin'
Wake your ass up, mother fuckers. Quit yawnin

Everybody come on in
Yo yo
I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?
I can see that he just a punk
I mean these niggas'll squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
To fight you in front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get points across when I write
Just emotion's enough to say fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT?!
I might as well give this up
But tha'd be selfish as fuck to leave D12 an' it's What?
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin' off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fifth
Your carcas'll split even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shootin at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
So when they bust you better bust back
Or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
So get to gunnin if you comin'
Well Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
'Cause we get it on un- till the break of dawnin'
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
'Cause we ain't leavin' till 6 in tha mornin
So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in
Oh!
Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for...
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults and 4 murders
Slim Shady!
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Ok! Let's go!
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick frumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup, the lady give her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us, it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention, It's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Ladies and gentlemen... Dr. Dre!
They see that low rider go by, they like, Oh, my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that six tre like, Sick 'em, Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like precision collision
Or maico, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
And I take great pleasure in introducing... 50 Cent!
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajaun do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what?
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, Mafucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what? I trick
Fat ass, burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes, I say, Move a-bitch, move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?

Jimmy Choo shoes, I say, Move a-bitch, move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
I tell myself that I was doin' all right
There's nothin' left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
Can't you see what you do to me, baby
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us
We can't figure out if it's lust
Or if it's love which that is attractin' us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserved it, you hit me first
And provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire, it's baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you, I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside, I see a freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise
You're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your, personal vibrators
And dildos, you've fucked yourself so much
You barely feel those anymore, you're only 24
But you're plenty more mature
Then those other little ho's
Who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool
Chillin' you play your position you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business
You've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did maybe you like me in charge
Baby, 'cause we're crazy in love
I go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
You are the ink to my paper
What my pen is to my my pad
The moral, the very fiber
The whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being
The meaning of my existance
If it wasn't for you
I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony 
Is you rely on me as much 
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid to fuel in my fire
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel
I don't need you as much as I really need you
So you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me
You're the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me
I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall
You're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem
The Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillow that props me up
The beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half
The wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you
Before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much too much is never enough
Baby, 'cause we're crazy in love
I go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
A lot of people ask me, stupid fuckin' questions.
A lot of people think that, what I say on record, or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life, or that I believe in it.
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody that, I'm actually gonna do it, or that I believe in it.
Well shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you, you know why?
'Cause I'm a criminal
Criminal, you goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah I'm a criminal
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or les
Or a homosex-, hermaph- or a trans-a-ves
Pants or dress, Hate fags?, the answer's yes
Homophobic, nah you're just hetero-phobic 
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you better let go of 'em 
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em
Hey it's me 
, whoops somebody shot me
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail
Come on relax guy, I like gay men 
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus 
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons 
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause, I watch TV and 
 cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
And to think, it's just little ole me
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck, still won't leave
I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
My mother did drugs, hard liquor cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you s'posed to grow up when you weren't raised
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word
Sex in his 
 on top of his desk
Off of his own employee, now don't ignore me you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white blonde-haired and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die in plane crashes
And laughs as long as it ain't happen to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
In place of the doc, because 
 couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thing put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh
I'm a criminal
 Uh huh?
 Aight.
 Aight.
 What?! 
 Aright!
God damn, this motherfucker gets on my fuckin' nerves.
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it, I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Then fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards brats pests
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a 
 mask
I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

I am a criminal
Testing one, two, um, twelve
This is my dance song, can you hear me?
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud, All y'all get the hell out now
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry
I'm bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think that I'm a mothafuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like, Gee I don't know, he might be
I told 'em meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster
Peace out, then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out till I started bustin' freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset
Uh nmm
This thing on?
Where'd everybody go?
Uhh
Guess whos back?
Back again
Ken is back
Tell some men
Rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back, ooh
Wait
Hello?
Uh, goodbye
Still on? 
Yo, is the mic on? 
Check, check, check 
Alright, let's do it 
Let's go, come on 
Still on? 
Yo, is the mic on? 
Check, check, check 
Alright, let's do it 
Let's go, come on 
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah...
B.I.G. 2000 Born Again... c'mon...
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace... smack the bitch in the face;
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins till amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was Humpin Around and Jump-in Around
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, B-I-G
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya till you're gushy, so please don't push... me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?
Human sacrifices, cannibalism; candles and exorcism
Animals having sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fucking, meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lying, I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dying to cock him
Who's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, red on the third;
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah...
B.I.G. 2000 Born Again... c'mon...
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong

Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, red on the third;
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong
Girl you gimme writers block
I'm at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That's what I call a Roethlisberger
You drive me bonkers I'm about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops or syrups
Probably should have never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should have been one of the first signs to cause to learn
Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I can't be apart from her
Cause nobodies body's awesomer - I lust it, and she loves me 'cause I'm popular, but
You know this ain't love
Oh, no, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love
No, this ain't love
She's lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
I can't even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her
And here I go again
Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you till I went to the lengths I did to meet you
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I don't see nothin' but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can't do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can't, specifically to describe it I just can't seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout I live and breathe you
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you, don't wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek, cause this ain't...
You know this ain't love
Oh, no, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love
No, this ain't love
Just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else
What the fuck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain't the same as mine, I think
You need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
I'm just mad it took the time it took me to discover
You been using me for loot like I used you for looks
Thought you was too good for me, huh? yeah used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack, but I can't stomach this
I'm leavin' you, not comin' back. She said The fuck with that
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?
She grabbed that fuckin' bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and that's right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100 yard field goal, through the uprights
You know this ain't love
Oh, no, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love
No, this ain't love
Used to get, bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spitting like vintage Pac, demented
Demonic sinister, ever since the the Doc replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just 'bout to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shocking image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me broccoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at this
And put emphasis on the dope, so when names come up
In that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere, where it fires and I unload my pen explodes
Till there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly even sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jean's I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Begging my mom for K-Mart MacGregors 'cause they were new
St. Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adios, I did it
They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument
Cause you know I'll win it, name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Rest in piece to Big Proof, you was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fucking tone that you speak, feel like I'm in the zone
I'm in a whole different league on my mothafuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete, and I've never been known to retreat
From beef, beep-beep, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say bon appetit
'Cause I don't know what to eat, fucking microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
'Cause I rhyme like I'm still trying to get signed, up in the Ebony Show-
-Case with Denaun screaming Who the fuck passed you the mic?
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'mma strike that bitch first
Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills cracking
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down
Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbing it and holding some grudge now, but don't front
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump into tonight
'Cause I'm hyper or something, needing someone or something is lighting
This fire under me, it's breathing new life, it's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke was so long ago, I lost my concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fucking nickel from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm having a stroke of genius, Elizabeth I'm coming to you, honey
From boy to man, it's still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man, don't put me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense, precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
But convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's this good with the fucking mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Whose mentally disturbed, you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin being Indian burned
Hah, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served if memory serves
I'd battle that till my own recollection remembers these words
You know I got you open kid, stop fronting
You know I got you open, Word Life
I need you pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win,
I need to know where I'm headed,
'Cause I know where I been
Flows, bones crushin', it's nothin'
I come up with sum'n
Come through your strip, frontin', stuntin'
It's sum'n you want
745 chrome spinnin's,
Haters hate that I'm winnin'
Man, I been hot from the beginnin'
Muthafuckas, envy the kid
Control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control ma temper
I'm in to catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie
I'm down to get it top
Who wants to squeeze da first shot
You know I ain't stop, till ma clip is empty
I'm simply,
Not that nigga used to try your luck,
What da fuck, wait--
Holla tip shells is strup
Wit' yo bones broke, gun smokin', still open,
What-nigga lay yo ass down, paramedics get ya up
Right now, I'm on da edge
So don't push me
I aim straight fo' yo head
So don't push me
Fill yo ass up with lead
So don't push me
I got sum'n fo' yo ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy
Right now, I'm on da edge
So don't push me
I aim straight fo' yo head
So don't push me
Fill yo ass up with lead
So don't push me
I got sum'n fo' yo ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy
I almost lost my bigga nigga, and
I didn't cry
Too young to understand
The consequences of a man
Livin' a lie, I,
Gotta get that money, I be damnin' from bummin'
Gotta watch my back around these niggas
'Cause they fun in 20 years
And watchin' ma momma tears, got me heated
Heavenly weeded
Smokin' that bomb, 'cause I need it
These niggas don't want me ballin' they want me buried
Balled in the dirt from shots flurried
Layin' wit' bombs all on my shirt
I got plans to hop up in da Hummer
'Cause I'm a stunner
I sit back and wonder
When dem angels gon' call my number
Under
My chest is a heart of a lion, lion, lion
Pound me, honeys got me flyin'
Wit' my iron
Eyes are giant
I'm runnin' from nothin'
My stomach is touchin'
While I'm clutchin'
To give you more than a concussion
End the discussion
My brothers told me so I'm bolder
And to see a solder
Hurt on my shoulder
Look in the mirror
I see a soldier
Right now, I'm on da edge
So don't push me
I aim straight fo' yo head
So don't push me
Fill yo ass up with lead
So don't push me
I got sum'n fo' yo ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy
Right now, I'm on da edge
So don't push me
I aim straight fo' yo head
So don't push me
Fill yo ass up with lead
So don't push me
I got sum'n fo' yo ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This I shit that I saw with my eye balls, my ears
This is me who's gotta be
What you see on TV
What you hear on CD
What appears easy
Man, these teeny-boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies, in these rags
Live in fantasies, frontin'
Like it's all fun 'n' games,
Till the shoot-'em-up, bang
And you see your brains hang,
And you see we ain't playin',
Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night 'n' ain't prayin'
I bullied my way in this game
And I'm done playin', man
I'm done sayin' that I'm done playin'
I'ma start, layin' any of dese, mothafuckin' cocksuckas
There's no way I'ma back down like a god damn coward,
I can't
How would I look as a man, bowin' to his knees,
Like the mad cow disease
Let somebody lash out at me,
And not lash back out at 'em
Please,
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall?
I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you jus' pick it apart
So I see I hafta start
Showin' you fuckin' old farts
A whole other side,
I wanted to not show you,
So you know you not
Dealin' with some fuckin' marshmallow
Right now, I'm on da edge
So don't push me
I aim straight fo' yo head
So don't push me
Fill yo ass up with lead
So don't push me
I got sum'n fo' yo ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy
Morning, Marshall.
Morning, doc.
So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?
Anxious.
Anxiety?
Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous.
Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?
Um, not yet. But I mean, when I get back
Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't.
Well, yeah, I mean, I gotta start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?
Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your schedule, we know you're a busy person.
Well, yeah, but I thought sobriety was the most important thing.
So what else are you thinking?
Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps, and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them.
The steps?
Yeah, steps.
There's a lot of them, aren't there?
Well, twelve.
Christ, I don't even know them all.
Really?
Anything else?
Um, well, I mean the only other question I have is like, what do I do if I find myself in a situation where maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?
Take a drink.
What?
Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off.
Take the edge off?  Man, if I have a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to.
Now, what the fuck!?
Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts, are we?
Oh, no, no, no, come on, man!
Marshall, you can't leave me...
Oh, FUCK YOU, man!
....you'll never leave me, Marshall.
NO!
We'll always be together, Marshall.
NO!  NO!!!
Marshall...? Marshall!?
NOOOOO!!!!!
Oh, shit...
Obie, yo? 
I'm sick 
Damn, you straight dog?
Bitches
Getting sick
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit 
From these bitches on our dicks 
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time 
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk 
I had a bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk 
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaners 
Fucked me good, you should've seen us 
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french role styling
Body like a stallion 
Sizing up the figure while my shit getting bigger 
Debating on to fuck her, do I wanna be a nigga? 
Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
Sipping on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like taking ho's money, but that's another story
For surely your pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop and Juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, inserting my john
In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop
Response I got when I was knocking it
Clocks steading ticking, kinky finger licking
The cannon, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foaming at the lips, the ones between her hips
Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though 
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks 
Me in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut, then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is going on here? This bitch evaporated
Pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated 'cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley telling me I ain't really got that shit
Fuck
That's why I ain't got no time 
For these games and stupid tricks 
Or these bitches on my dick 
That's how dudes be getting sick 
That's how dicks be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit 
From these bitches on our dicks 
Fucking chickens with no ribs 
That's why I ain't got no time 
Now I don't wanna hit no women but this chick's got it coming
Someone better get this bitch before she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's egging me on, begging me to throw her
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But what's she shoving me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to going toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
And you find it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visiting
Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan, now the plot has thickened in worse 
'Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hurse
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweating every minute you're in it
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta to call in you the office to say it
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
And when you see her, you're gon' bend her fucking neck back yo
'Cause you love her, you never would've expect that blow
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaners
Bringing me home diseases swinging from Obie's penis
She's so deceiving, shit this ho's a genius she g'd us
That's why I ain't got no time 
For these games and stupid tricks 
Or these bitches on my dick 
That's how dudes be getting sick 
That's how dicks be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit 
From these bitches on our dicks 
Fucking chickens with no ribs 
That's why I ain't got no time 
I'm busy! 
Yeah, fuck these bitches 
Fuck 'em all 
Get money 
Ha! 
Shady Records 
Woow! 
Eminem, mothafucka!
New millennium shit 
Yeah 
Turn this shit off 
Turn this shit the fuck off
Yeah, boy
You better ring the alarm, boy
Them know what's coming, boy
Buck, buck, buck, Ha-ha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh my god, fucking bombaclot,
I'm hard as Kenard, The little boy that shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire in nothing but a Bra
Boy, I'm the real deal, and charbroil on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch, I'm like Chef Boyardee
In this bitch, send the bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy, you think your Tom Sawyer
Till I pull you out the fucking storybook and stomp on ya
Fucking fictional characters and fairytales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact, boy, beware it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. fly by the seat of his pants para-sail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounch and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing no nada
Like your father fucking your mother
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no dog gone beef
You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no dog gone beef
You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Boy, I'm the real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids, kill the noise, here comes the Killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys, the rap crown royales
The scalp cowboys, now how that sound for ya?
Yeah, boy, you know we bout to put it down for ya
So, kick your shoes off, and before you have a sound voyage
Sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some marinara, marinate in some maranara
And have a coke and smile, don't make me open a jar
Whip ass on ya, that's the last straw you hoping to draw
Yeah, you fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy, them boys them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy I told you, boy, I'm a soldier, boy, I'm DeShaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy ya, boy, fuck around and blow you decide
Oh my god, boy, you didn't go there, no you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, your the plot
You getting got whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefing, ain't no telling at what point it'll stop
All I gotta do is point to the spot
When the bomb drops, boy does it drop
And when it does, boy, there's a problem
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no dog gone beef
You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no dog gone beef
You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Michael Spinx with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringing hell, boy, singing telegrams or get dealt
And to that boy I'm upsetted in mental said he was better
I bet that he's never seen Freddy in that black and red little sweater
Back better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Giving haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By saying Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm bout to turn this fucking place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit? Couldn't agree
With ya more if you were to say that my fucking shit doesn't stank
Shady fucking aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fucking water till we fill up the tank
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no dog gone beef
You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no dog gone beef
You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Guess what?
I ain't coming in yet, I'll come in in a minute
Hey yo, this is my love song
It goes like this
Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Henn' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is that you gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinning, you're beginning to think
Women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wildin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyeing you
Get in the car and start it and start driving
Over the island and cause a 42-car pileup
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flying
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so
In third grade all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However I do show some respect to few
This Ecstasy's got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like Yo what the fuck we do?
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheating then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all, wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're going
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning
But you're young, you got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't
I woulda did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growing up to do
I still gotta whole lot of throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap
Babysitting for Hailie, while Hailie's out getting smashed
Drugs really gotta hold of me
Really gotta hold of me
These drugs really gotta hold of me
They really gotta hold of me
DMC, we have a mid-30's male found down, unresponsive. Possible overdose, substance unknown.
Pulse is 60 and thready. Respiration's 8. He's intubated, and we're bagging him now.
Has aspirated. Uhh, GSC is 3. We'll update en route.
As I, fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil like I think I'll just have a taste
Couple of sips of that, then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like, Yeah, that's great.
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face Mommy something is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie, 'cause I don't and why I just don't know
Maybe just a nice cold brew What's a beer?
That's the Devil in my ear I been sober a fucking year
And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fucking hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game, it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half, I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine
Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall, aim for the couch I'm 'bout to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out, 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?
Man, fuck am I hungover and goddamn I
Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off please stand by
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie, 'cause I don't and why I just don't know
So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach then ahh
Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helping you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self-inducing a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from school, Holmes. Relax
And since I'm, convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium, three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's, sleep
Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia, thing
It was bologna was it the methadone, ya think
Or the hydrocordone, you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases, with you Amb!en CR, great paces to hide 'em ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie,
I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor
Damn
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie, 'cause I don't and why I just don't know
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what if you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touche me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsy down a fucking daisy
That's an honor who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking AV
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, palm is in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brains all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I outta just be honest but
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what if you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both fake it's
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the shizer, pass doctor dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, fake it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what if you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Thinkin' about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em, just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what if you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide,
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fuckin-A even got a bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator
Aye yo Paul, it's Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not thrilled about the video
What does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Well I'll show him who's really bad
Paul, the way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the man in the mirror and tell him to beat it because I won't stop till I get enough
Do you remember the time we were watching the Billy Jean video?
Well he'll always be that Michael to me, and it doesn't matter if he's black or white
Because I can't stop loving him
And I hate plastic surgeons, and I hope they all fucking die
How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I want to touch him, but I can't
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit, sorry
Anyways, call me back, I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shady 
Aftermath, ha ha 
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, ha ha 
First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight 
And if they don't let us in through the front 
We'll come through the side
'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without 
At least saying goodbye 
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 
Get your ass up for the Doctor 
One more time, get your ass up for the Doctor 
Come on now, here we go 
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger 
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat 
Get on down 
Times up, game's over, you lose, I win 
'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here 
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin 
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in 
I go out and just come back full circle again 
You a fad, that means your something that we already had 
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad 
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you 
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you 
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin' 
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why 10 multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin' 
First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight 
And if they don't let us in through the front 
We'll come through the side
'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without 
At least saying goodbye 
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk 
Crunk, crunk, crunk 
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump 
Jump, jump, jump, jump 
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it 
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches 
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges 
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus 
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk 
Doc is all washed up, knock it off 
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'? 
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression 
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'
That's why we always save the best cut last 
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators 
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers 
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap 
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces 
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages 
Broke down barriers of language and races 
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic 
And we can play the back and forth all day 
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to 
First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight 
And if they don't let us in through the front 
We'll come through the side
'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without 
At least saying goodbye 
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 
50 Cent, come on! 
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do 
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know 
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved 
And plenty honeys involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees 
Cali, every day it's just another party from the valleys 
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally 
Hands up for the grand finale 
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak 
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week 
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to 
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker 
So nervous, ain't never 'cause Shady Aftermath together 
No one could do it better 
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh 
First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight 
And if they don't let us in through the front 
We'll come through the side
'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without 
At least saying goodbye 
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 
Yeah, ha ha 
Still Aftermath, 2006 
And don't worry about that 
 album 
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, ha ha 
50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre 
We ain't leavin', let's go! Ha ha 
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace! 
Ha ha, bye bye!
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Mama had a baby and it's head popped off, head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
My mama don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring ring ring, on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle Edna 'n' Charles
Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
Sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song
It went a little something like Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Mama why do they keep saying this, I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, well what about me
Where does that leave me, well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like a comedian to you
Do you think that I'm kidding, what do I look like some kind of idi...
Wait a minute shit, don't answer that, why am I so misunderstood
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it such bullshit
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again, whining about his millions and
His mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it, if you only knew the half of it
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds, please release me
From these demons, I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused, this Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this, everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what to feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do si do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass 
 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
I said father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Oh!
Last one, baby...
Let's go...
Detroit!
Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think.. I think the lines are starting to get blurry
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Mase when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
'Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
'Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated 'cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of wack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
I'm strapped for battles, suck a duck, crawl out the back, bar fight
Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
And bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping till the swear jar's full
You done called every woman a slut, but you forgetting Sarah, Marshall
Oh my bad, slut
And next time I show up in court I'll be naked and square a lawsuit
Judge be like That's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?
Smart ass, you lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you au jus
'Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's on you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic Kmart chains panic
'Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
'Cause it works when they're reversed, motherfucker
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming fuck, shit, fuck
Adult with a child is like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like merits, fuck that
I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like tight lyrics, dreamy eyes
But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
And the opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies
And comes again
That ain't me, he's my evil twin
He's just a friend who pops up now and again
So don't blame me, blame him
My evil twin
So who's left? Lady Gaga? Messed with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than struck with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3’s
Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'
Bed-written and destined to never leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath Ledger
My suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by The Joker
Lorraine said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener, I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch
Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers
I'd ever left it at beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with the cleaver
Golly, Wally I bet he registered Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definite lean
My destiny went on the steps, I met Deshaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes, but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They was sleeping, I made them stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip top form
Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming fuck the police like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin
Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck do you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for?
And as crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin 
Please come in, what was your name again?
Hi, faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I ain't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's just small up there
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
That I should call the looney police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish somebody finally admit me
Into a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, ho
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony
Hey ho, hey ho
I sound like I'm trying to sing the chorus to fucking hip hop hooray
No, I'm hollering, you got bottom in like an a-hole
Eight and a base whether I'm fucking off that instead of your face, ho
Let your low hand raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho?
Slow dancing in the bowling
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What? You think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skiddish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'Cause we are the same, bitch
This bitch can twist like a damn contortionist
Condom on my dick of course it is,
This bitch don't know what abortion is
So I can't cum in her,
Fucks like a porn star, looks like Jenna,
Fuck I'm gonna, cum
I think my rubbers comin' off,
But oh it's so fucking wet and soft,
Fuck, I'm gonna start lettin' off
I'm squirting and she's not gettin' off,
And she's on top
I'm gonna fucking, oh god,
Oh don't do that don't, stop,
Stop don't, I don't mean don't stop,
Ow wait a minute
Ooh wow, boom that pow ooh ow I need a cigarette now!
Ow I'm so fucking hot,
And you're so fucking hot,
Oh my god,
I wanna fackin' fack
No not fuck, I said fack,
F-a-c-k, f-a-c-k, fack, fack fack fackin' freak me!
Oh yeah girl see baby they call me Mr. Freaky,
Let's call your sister, three-way have some three-some, me so horny!
And you're such a fuckin' babe I wanna go down on you, fack you shave!
Oh god damn here I go again, I'm gonna cum I am
Ok I'm done,
I already came twice,
You ain't gonna make me cum,
I'm all outta gas,
Not so fast! Uh your finger just went in my ass!
Ow that hurts! Take it out now
Oh wait a minute no put it back in, in in in
This don't mean I'm gay I don't like men
I like boobs, boobs, boobs
Now see that gerbil, grab that tube,
Shove it up my butt,
Let that little rascal nibble on my asshole, uh, yeah, right there, right there,
Ah I'm coming ah yeah,
Fack, I just came again, okay pull it out now,
Oh fuck yeah, wait he's not out he's still crawling around up there,
Ow fack I think it's stuck
Ow but it feels so fucking good!
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube!
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube!
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube!
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube!
Ew ew ew ew
Packin' this third eye vs. you, a cyclopse
They trade in their high tops for nice sized white rocks
Words in my right, they pass my left ear
It's solid decked out, write the books for next year
Bear this grenade you got stun like virgin
Who that cat splurgin' instead of rehearsin'?
Tough guy, DJ Travi your high rise
Lookin' more like Ronald then the fuckin' fry guys
Go on uptown, fucking señoritas
In Taco Bell screaming, Viva gorditas!
Bring all your dogs, I give 'em rabies
Got Pope John Paul the Second prayin' to Satan
Have your vegan girlfriend cooking up bacon
I'm obituite with that shit that you hit
Smoke my spliff with ya 'cause spina bifida?
My nine is lifting ya six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with 12 shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
The eight straight strays to a kid's hair on the playground
No pun intended, snapped out of your whip
And leave it unattended before I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
'Cause I can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it
Snap the airbag, hit the corner and park it
You cornered a market, I got her tied up in the chair and gag
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cave women, while I'm grave diggin' with Marilyn Man's
If you got a bowl of hash, better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit
And if you're spittin' whack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'm gonna detach it
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in a knapsack and latched it
Yo, yo, Eon's whack now, how you dig that?
Couldn't get on my record if you were street rap
Get the greater rate with these rhymes I be totin'
Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem
I got stupid mucus from these loose lips
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak
To the point that you stand up on your feet, best retreat
Best go back in time and steal my whole seed
The quickening, did a briss at the christening
I'm exercisin', to uplifting the foot stage
This thing's the nicest, I keep tellin' you
What the fuck this guy on the corner been sellin' you?
I'm e-mailing you at the wrong website
Mispelling you, break you and put the fear of Hell in you
Escape Bellevue you, stuffed the nurse in a purse
Disperse like I added too many words in a verse
Slim Shady, a perverted version at birth
Driving off, leaving the murdered virgin at church
The first person who searchin' the Earth for the motherfucker
That pulled the plug when they should of alerted the surgeon first
You throwin' curves and hit with your own words
Leave me alone bitch, I get on my own nerves
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
If y'all got a bowl of hash, better cash it
And if you're spittin' whack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'm gonna detach it
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in a hatch-back and latched it
Any disease out there, I'm willing to catch it
Slim Shady, all praises to the High and Mighty
Eminem Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first-name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped a mix tape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country-wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
Ever, ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Nah, super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
Uh, you such a fuckin' loser
You ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out, and God damn, they snap
I used to want this thing forever, you can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop, like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur To the top
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't want to hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last
Uh, uh
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh, no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap'll never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes, and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you got at me, how's it taste,
When I slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place?
I'm Hannibal Lector, so just in case you're thinkin' of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
Y'all know me, still the same ol' G, but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full o' tracks, to add to the wall full o' plaques 
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies, Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's, and the group that said motherfuck tha police
Gave you a tape full dope beats to bump, when you stroll through in your 'hood
And when your albums sales wasn't doin' too good, who's the doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I'd turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all o' y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all gon' keep fuckin' around wit' me, and turn me back to the old me
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by, with a Walkman on, when I caught a guy 
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not, I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck, right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs, tryna walk it off, fuck you too bitch call the cops
I'm 'a kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through, me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
So from here on out, it's The Chronic 2, startin' today and tomorrow's anew
Slim Shady, hotter than a set o' twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up, when the temp goes up to the mid-eighties
Callin' men ladies, sorry Doc but I been crazy
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop comin' up to me wit' yo' hands out, lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free, when my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I gots lil' company, everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
I told 'em all, all them lil' gangsters who you think help mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none, what you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off, now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab, with a pen an' a pad tryna get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath and ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So gimme one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at, it's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats, when you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Feeling kinky
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear
She's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said I'm here to do sink repairs.
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there
But damnit, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed
Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on as the Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon
Me, 'cause I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' up sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember
Destructive temper cut my public defender's
Jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler
Discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed
Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's, Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For rapin' eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's play pen, I lay and wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remaining patient
While stayin' complacent blatant
Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho, I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see
I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed
I got a riddle,
What's little and talks big,
With midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle,
That'll do anything to throw dirt on my name,
If it means walking the whole Mediterranean,
Is it an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian,
No, his name's Raymond and oh,
Oh sorry, yo, so sorry, whoa
But that was a long time ago,
When I was just Joe Schmo,
Rapping in Joe Blow's basement,
I apologized for it before so,
Either accept it or you don't,
And let's move on,
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts,
Keep walking around sniffing each other's butts,
Or should I say asses,
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses,
The question I ask is how can I explain this,
How can I swing this in English language,
If I switched to slang and turned man to mane,
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain,
Am I being real or am I being fake,
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine,
Or am I caught up in this hot water,
Word on my daughter,
I told you That I love this culture,
Don't let 'em insult ya,
I'ma tell you once more again
This is the environment I was brought up in,
But every now and then,
I use my pen to get rid of some frustration,
Or should I say shun,
Your face is numb, you're stunned,
And it only gets colder,
Which is why I understand,
You can't be mad at a 44 year old fan with a chip on his shoulder,
Who only owns a half of a magazine,
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again,
Papa can't stand me,
Papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down,
In his new chair that goes round and round,
That he bought from the money in his bank account,
That I get him every issue when the thing comes out,
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out,
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side,
Yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide,
But ain't nobody over here buying two white guys,
Disguised as pro-black,
There is no slack for a Harvard college great in a fitted hat,
And a hunchback standin by the clearance coat rack,
Shady in the place to bc,
Still not gonna cater these punks,
A shimmy shimmy go go motha fuckin' pop
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips
I get all the money pussy falls like rain
Been gettin' laid and paid that's why I never complain
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me
You don't be fuckin' with the blue eye
Fuckin' with my 2-5 up your fuckin' ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like Voodoo
You do what we say and we'll do what we want to
We're fuckin' up your city and we're fuckin' up your progam
Fuckin' all your bitches we can fuckin' give a goddamn
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence
Persistance pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fuckin' planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no takings
So let me get what I got comin' and the rest I'm fakin'
I'm shakin' like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like the motherfucker's new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit given' my heart and soul
Been shinin' like a diamond but gettin' passed as coal
So Fuck Off
Yeah
With my pants half hangin' off my ass and shit
Bowl filled hash pockets stuffed with cash
I be the mushroom trippin' sippin' shots of Jack
'Cause the kids don't listen gettin' lots of flack
I be the do wa diddy up and down you block and
The 10 karat Kid with my triggers cockin'
The K the I the D R-O-C K motherfucker and you still don't know me
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit
I ride like Setta in the Indy 5
And get live with that which get's me high
Strive for perfection this much is true
We do what we say you say what we do
Kid Rock I couldn't be no Bozo
And I get too much nina
I'm an easy rider dreamin' of Wynonna
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Put faith in lust and in God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And Harry Carey couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast
Fuck Off
Yeah right in your mother fuckin' ass bitch
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit swift we're on the same script
Nothing new since 76 Kid Rock
Yo Slim Shady come break these mother fuckers off
Yo tell the world to hold their breath they're breathing the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two Withe boys who spike punch and light joints
Hang around drugs loud music and like noise
Slim Shady and Brown Trucker another bunch of mother fuckers
Who hate the world as much as each other
And I ain't leaving this party tonight
Till I see some naked bitches dancin' around drunk touchin' each other
Rum and Pepsi got your whole perception of me sketchy
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do 'shrooms you all better give me two rooms
'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules
People that straight fool
And ever single teenager that hates school
Fuck Off

Eminem
Fucking Crazy
Hi!
Oringinal bad boy on the case cover your face
Came in the place blowed and sprayed Puffy with mace
I laced your weed with insect repellent better check the smellin'
Eminem starts with an E, better check the spellin' with a capital
Sombody grab me a snapple
I got an asprin capsule trapped in my adam's apple
Sombody dropped me on my head and I'm sure that my mother did it
But the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feelin' these kicks cunt?
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have the cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker then sperm cells with syphalis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick till you plummet
If y'all don't like me you can suck my dick till you numb it
And all that gibberish that you were spittin' you need to kill it
'Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
My mic's grillin' you, staring you down with a grin to grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag at a women's gym
I'm Slim, so Shady is really you're fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A braniac with a cranium packed full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly cumbustible head, spasmatic strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flat lined, jumped up and ran for the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed, lookin' Chinese
With my knees stuck together like siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Pins and needles hyperdermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killin' my girlfriends
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Last night I OD'd on rush, mushrooms and dust
I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say
I call in to work cause all I do is frolick and play
I swallow grenades, take a bottle of water a day
A Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be
Gimme eleven Excedrin and my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine
Scratch my balls till I shred the skin
Doctor check this rash, look how red it's been
It's probably Aids, forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dikes using dildos
So reach in your billfold for ten duckets
And pick up your Slim Shady shit is on rucus
Somethin' somethin' somethin', I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Hi! Something's not right, I'm sorry, I'm mentally retarded
Slim shady, I think that's my name
Rucus Records, fuckin' crazy
You hear us? We're fuckin' crazy!
All of us
Hi, Bye
Night, something
My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
You see me standin outside of your buildin; screamin,
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; 'cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryin' to get my porno career started
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters
And make 'em come to your basement and listen
Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
And all three of my main girls said SEE-YA
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin' Aaliyah
Grab a handful of pills, break 'em in half, take 'em and laugh
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass
So if I hurt your self-esteem
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
What a wonderful day; I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
The demon is here, steamin this year
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
Yeah I don't think this guy is well.. I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin'
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris-topher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beatin' your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleedin in jeans
Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
Or a damn... or a fuck... or a shit
So suck my motherfuckin dick
My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
You see me standin outside of your buildin; screamin,
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like

Or a damn... or a fuck... or a shit
So suck my motherfuckin dick
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, till I see, what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work
For me, it just wouldn't be sufficient enough
'Cause we are just gonna be enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be no reason speakin' wit' me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speakin' Englais
So we gonna beef and keep on beefin', unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangsta pee on himself
I see you D-12 and thanks but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all you, Ja, you'll get it too
Now go to sleep bitch
Time's up bitch close ya eyes
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes
Die motherfucker die
Bye bye, motherfucker, bye bye
Why are you still alive?
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch
We got you niggaz, nervous on purpose
To hurt your focus, you's not MC's, you's worthless
You's not them G's, you's a circus, you's no appeal, please
You's curtains you use words cool heard slurred in two thousand third
You's purpin', you's no threat, who's ya servin'
We lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the deaths
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth
Now go to sleep bitch
Time's up bitch close ya eyes
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes
Die motherfucker die
Bye bye, motherfucker, bye bye
Why are you still alive?
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch
Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin' New York wit' the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk wit' my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sweet
Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin'
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy going with the same one, that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get, when dog gon' bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ, and my Blood Line is tight
'Cause it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line and we can go track for track
Damn dog, why did you have to do them niggas like that?
Now go to sleep bitch
Time's up bitch close ya eyes
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes
Die motherfucker die
Bye bye, motherfucker, bye bye
Why are you still alive?
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch
All you motherfuckers, take that
Here, take this too, bitch, uh, uh, uh, uh, wahoo
We're killin' all you motherfuckers dead, all you
Fake ass gangsters, no more press, no more press
Rot, motherfuckers, rot
Decay, in the dirt, bitch
In the motherfucking dirt
Die nameless, bitch, die nameless, no more fame
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, ha ha
Lately I really, feel like, I'm rollin' for Delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complainin'
But life keeps on complicatin'
And I'm debatin' on, leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dyin', I am finally realizin' I need
Help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been havin' ups and downs, goin' through peaks
And valleys, dilly dallyin', 'round with the idea
Of endin' this shit right here
I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight in mirrors
I can't stand what I look like yeah
I look fat but what do I care, I give a fuck
Only thing I fear is Hailie, I'm afraid if I close my eyes then I might see her
Shit
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall what happened that you can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin' at you
You've become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man would have had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say 
 just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm poppin' Vic's, Perc's and Methadone pills
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin', best friend, so fuck it I guess then
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
My friends just can't understand this new me
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do
I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame's startin' to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watchin' the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurt, so I fast forward, sleepin' pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on dull 'em out
Daddy don't you die on me, daddy better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice, yeah baby hold me down
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back, I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change, think about her every day
We just could never get it together hey, wish there was a better way
For me to say it, but I swear on everything
I'd do anything for her, on any day
There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows I never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture almost if to say
I miss you sub-consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say
I guess I'm 
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
What would it take to push a man, far enough
To put somethin' material over a human life?
What would drive someone completely over the edge
To do some shit like that?
The green and gold.
I done filled my lungs up
With so much of this crack smoke
My necks bloated, my tech's loaded
I'm flat broke, and I'm pissed off
Mad at the world I've had it with girls
And I'm frustrated, ran to the bus stop
Just made it and hopped on
Ready to drop bombs on the first person
Who had a nice suit and a watch on
I spot John, a white collar worker
In clean cut, walked up to 'em
He was like, What?
Whatchu mean what?
You know what time it is, man
At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch
With that diamond wrist band
Got his green and his gold, dashed it,
Climbed in his van to steal it and seen
A man holdin' a nine and then
Shot him from the bottom up
Stole his keys, put 'em inside the ignition and got 'em stuck
Hopped out to flee on my feet
Fucked around, forgot that I left my ID on the seat
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off, and beat him over the fuckin' head with the peg
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty
Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44-D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombest?!
We blowin' up your house, killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more, 'cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Sabateur; walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul-style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack
On Aunt Edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work, so we moved
Back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision, discipline, last thing I wanna do
Is listen she's like Lex Luthor, bitch, and rules are Krypton-
-Ite so the walls I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind Superman, 'cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
Then one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
I remember it clearly, even today
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma nan
Always itching for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered
This DJ who was mixing, I say it to this day, if you ain't listened
To the wizard, you ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J cooling systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this, that's how I know my mission
Little boom box booming, spitting, practicing numerous written
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit, couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go complete ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant, we touched a mic that both of us
Two existed to do this shit, never quit, too persistent
We are the underground empire
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, 'cause if they caught you slipping
They'd take your spot if someone got to ripping you
And you forgot your written, opportunity knocks once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding-dong ditching shit, I fucking got that bitch
In a headlock, cut off his oxygen Slim, it's not cordial
Like cocksucking cynderblocks in the wind, now I got my pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, hopping over that opposition
Looking like a dog is pissing, leg up on the competition
Promising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in, Ali's my colleague bombing 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em, like stomping 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place to battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now where's your bluebirds? Ooh
No more tripping in bird shit, this songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but this discouraging
The Rap Game's God, but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift, cause all I got is bars
For you dumbbells and doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first, and you ain't got to wear
No shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served bloodthirst, revenge of a nerds
They will not escape my vengeance
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the Uncle Ron, I'm turning into an unhumble Don
You blind dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched up your arm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo on the fucking Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yarn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The GOAT just ate eight acres and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove
Soot, charred debris floating like Oakwood
Was burning, return of the no good and I won't quit
And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a plane
And I don't quit, won't change, it's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around y'all, cause you may, so you can't pop your head
I'm not so sure I want to know from once it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing
Meet Eddie, 23 years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store.
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play.
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You'd better think of the consequence
That's nonsense.
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you.
Think about it, before you walk in the door first.
Look at the store clerk, she's older then George Burns.
Fuck that. Do that shit. Shoot that bitch.
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Don't even listen to Slim, yo. He's bad for you.
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude.
Meet Stan, 21 years old.
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
Thing's start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play.
Smearin' her lipstick,
I slip this in her drink.
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe...
Yo, this girl's only 15 years old.
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair.
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Till she passes out and she forgot how she got there.
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie 
?
No, but I seen the porno with Son Doobiest!
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail.
Meet Grady, a 29 year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work, 
He walks in the door of his trailer park home 
To find his wife in bed with another man.
Alright, calm down. Relax, start breathin'.
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'.
While you at work, she's with some dude, tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat! Cut this bitch's head off!!
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?
Alright, Shady.
Maybe he's right, Grady.
But think about the baby,
Before you get all crazy.
Okay! Thought about it. Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her
That's what I did. Be smart, don't be a retard. 
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes!?
What'd you say? 
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
Imma kill you, motherfucker! 
Ah-ah, temper, temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.? Mr. AK
Coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cuz he don't need to go the same route that I went.
Been there, done that. 
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead and talkin' 'bout a pencil
Lookit what the fuck you done got into
I see you found yo niche, you just a bitch wit a menstrol
Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong
You put 'e' before the'd' 'cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a regular guy
If Pac was still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real
Life is more than imitating niggaz and eatin' pills
And kind of muthafucka ruins three deals
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover 'cause he need it
And all you niggaz hatin', shut you mouths
It's just that real niggaz ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out
Do-ra-me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me 'cause you lost your boss's spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac
Don't make me, too hot and you're not
Shootin' at me, with the only shot you got
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop
Slim did it simple to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on
But you?? the?? for sucking your??
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz?
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business you ain't caught the concept
You talkin' nonsense to walk and find press
Contact was blown by Munsetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on ya porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggaz?? and ain't scurred to bust
Yeah!
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again!
Fuckin' punk pussy little bitch!
I'll fuck you up boy!
Never! Never in your muthafuckin life!
I'll choke the shit outchu little muthafuckin bitch!
Hailie can whip your muthafuckin ass!
No honey, you guys are the same size...
Yo, I can't sing it.
I feel like singin'.
I wanna fuckin' sing.
'Cause I'm happy.
I got my baby back.
Yo, check it out.
Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
My baby girl, keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, 'cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
Man if I could sing I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't want her
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world, and I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't've ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin'on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me
Woo! 
I told you I can't sing.
Oh well, I tried.
Hailie, 'member when I said If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what?
Daddy's here. And I ain't goin' nowhere baby.
I love you.
People Say that I'm a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal teenagers newest idol
Come on!
Do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
People Say that I'm a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal teenagers newest idol
Come on!
Do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
Hand me an 8 beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world and shit on brandy and mase
I'm more then ill scarier then a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot and people who feel me 'cause I'ma still be the mad rapper weather I got money or not as long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot I'll be in a cannoe paddling making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award for the best rapper to get one mic and a source
And a woredrobe I can afford otherwise I might just send up
Pack striking at ford and you wonder what the fuck I need more vicoden for
Everybody's pissing me off even a No Limit tank looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off
No shit I'm in grave danger to my health why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself
Course
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless patroling corners looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action then rosco beating james star Sr. across the back with vaccuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth with a fucked up childhood that I use as an excuse and ain't shit changed I kept the same mindstate
Since the 3rd time I failed 9th grade
You probably think I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it I don't promote violence I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps and land aside a bed of spider webs
Course
My laser disc will make you take a razor to your wrist Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
To sew you back and be a waste of stitches
I'm not a Role Model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin' me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than 80 Kim scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I know that Just the Two of Us would make you hate me this much
And Just the Two of Us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why's the power off and I'm fucked up
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst, the brunt of it
But as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far
Cleaning Out My Closet and all them other songs but regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
Ma let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats, 'specially when dad he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close, nope
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine and car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home and all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
Now the medication's takin' over and your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
One thing I never asked was, where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'dve flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me, that you could've bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma
Once, you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this, overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I will always love you from afar
'Cause you're my ma
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life
Wanna take it from the top?
Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two asscheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually said to myself
I gotta meet her like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue, you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'mma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm running
All day, all night
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore, like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out, like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull up behind you when you're leavin'
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air
It's somethin' to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit
Ain't steppin' to you, bitch, I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail
Like a skunk in heat, I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
Let her come to me
Male sweater, heat, some degree, fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her, with a so bright a
Ass that she wants a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm running
All day, all night
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that ho musta been dug
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together, don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl, your body is lit
You're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're
Just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too, look at my pedigree
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle one to finger you
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm running
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat
On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
He's mixin' it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
Who the fuck? It's my big dick
So everybody get ready right fucking now!
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping
I want them fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies, won't you fill your cups?
Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the E-R, we are strapped with so much T-N-T
We may blow, no, not even C-P-R from the E-M-T
Can help you to resuscitate
You bustas must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
What's my name? Shady came to crush the game
Instantly, not even fair to them 'cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear a skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit is getting embarrassing
The fog is thick, and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe, dadidadidadadi
He makes it look so easy
Girl, you just hit the lottery
Now, this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
This is when shit hits the fan, like it just flat out don't stand
This is the only moment that matters, your homey rolling with Mathers
Then chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say and once it's over like a suance, it hums
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smokin' something, think I ain't smokin' nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose, I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose, I'm like a goose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose, Me and my goons are like animals
Wake up like a pack of wolves and we came here to extract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth?
Girl, your man's is like in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, you swing? all hell breaks loose
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick, no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Now, I know you're feelin' discouraged, but homey, just mark my words
I'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' ho
With speakers knockin', it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop
E and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffin' for nothin', we'll knock the stuffin' out you
Revenge is so sweet, move till you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it' freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat, Dre fall off, that's news to me
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick, no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Welcome back, to the stage of history
Yo... Slim Shady!
Yo... I fuckin'... I
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You think I pulled the fuckin' ground out from underneath you
I ain't tryin' to shoot you,
I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes just strapped to a soakin mattress
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gases
And close it back with a lit match in it
While I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin' in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink till my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, fuck the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leavin' the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke till I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just to rock
Do I still have to hold my tray very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Northface
Nickle nine at my waist, on the Lord's faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?
Maxi was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin' the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin' with some niggaz like this who just don't care
But every time I take a step, it gets dim...
Tell me is this hell we're livin' in?
Haha...
Time's up!
You lose!

Hello 
, allow me to introduce myself
My name is, Shady, so nice to meet you 
It's been a long time, I'm sorry I've been away so long 
My name is, Shady, I never meant to leave you 
You see that chick in the gym checkin' me out
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the necklace I lost right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oop jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth
Down the hatchet the feelin' you can't match it
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Ata-ta-tackin' a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like 40-some Xanax's
Shorty come back, I'm tryin' to score me some lap dances
I'm 'bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula 44D and 40's with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya
Girl I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating baby, my little friend's waiting to say hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty's shakin' like Jell-O
Girl I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello, yeah
My equilibrium's off must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extra-curriculum
No reason in-particular it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
Fifty one people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me hon' but what is your name, Vivienne?
I woke up next to ya naked and uh did we umm
Of course we did, but didn't I strap jimmy hon
I'm lookin' for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool I immediately run, like Speedy Gon-
Zales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of Three's I'm fiendin' for some
My head is poundin' to the beat of the drum
Girl I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you that make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello
Oh those are the days they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' that curtain for good
Rushed to emergency surg-
Ery to try to flush me, because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free, hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's getting to be, where he'll lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
Tirelessly on the phone tryin' to rustle up muscle relaxers
For his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he's doublin' backwards and he's stumblin' back
Slipped and fell hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's bustin' a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just bustin' my own chops, while I'm bustin' a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it I'm back
Girl I don't mean, any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have any thing on you that make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello

You never, heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waiting for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as Hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
Till I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
{Mom! MOM!} I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success?  It sucks, too much press I'm stressed
Too much cess and breasts, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick 
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say, Hi
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-T-E 
'Cause MTV was so friendly to me can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now is it worth it?  Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips bitch, what, my mouth isn't working?
You hear this finger?  Oh it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now
That's why they call me Slim Shady

I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational {Back is the incredible!}
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the internet
Trying to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it
Mind with no sense in it, fried to get schizophrenic
whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoking 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doing lines of coke in 'em with a bunch of guys hopping out
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me
That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back 
 I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back 
 I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back 
 I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back 
 I'm back
I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
A Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
as the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, 
, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this!
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?
That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back 
 I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back 
 I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back 
 I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back 
 I'm back
Guess who's b-back, back
Guess who's back
Gue-guess who's back
D-12, Guess who's back
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back
Dr. Dre, Guess who's back
Back back back
Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt
Fuck
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world
 So come and kill me while my name's hot
Think I've got a generation brainwashed
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
 and acid raindrops
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
Gotta make 'em fear you before you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
I'm Shady
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
And this is how I am in real life
I don't want to just die a normal death
How you wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they're high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife says this is the biggest knife
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
I'm Shady
I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit
But they love it when you make your business public
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playing when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms
Do drink beer
I just wanna make a few things clear
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itching
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
I'm Shady
I told you I was Shady
Y'all didn't wanna believe me
I'm Shady
And that's my name
Check check
One, two
One, two
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Dr. Dre up in here
Y'all know what this is
It's what y'all been waiting for
Funk Master Flex
Big Kap
Def Jam Records giving it to you, baby
Yo, Eminem
Show these motherfuckers what time it is, baby
Until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair
I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of 
's chest
Before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again
It was an accident
I had my back against a fan
Who chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket, it ain't latching
They can't lock it
So they stapled my hand
To my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered
Like someone else had it before me
And just kept throwing them-fucking-selves at it
My head is aching
I'm dedicated to medication
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, Fuck the police
When you still had your mother's fucking nipple
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holler, Bravo
Hell yeah, I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face, but I won't
'Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it
With your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough
I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block
Stumbling, mumbling a bunch of dumb shit
Like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'm just high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs
When I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers
Slim Shady
Dr. Dre
I'm drunk pass the test
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it moving
Off and on
Eminem is on
Off and on
Dr. Dre is on
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it moving
Off and on
Eminem is on
Off and on
Dr. Dre is on
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
Psych I'm just joking, for Christ sakes
Don't get so bent out of shape
'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it
But I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of its own
Sometimes I can't find it at home
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
Hailey Jade
Daddy loves you, baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter
Fuck you, lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
The neighborhood that I grew up in
You could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me
So try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth
And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what
I can and what I can't say
Or change 'cause of the
Age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it
I'm tired, bitch
I'm dying to quit
Hip hop is universal now
It's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it
So they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic, it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it, let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder
I committed since three years old
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it moving
Off and on
Eminem is on
Off and on
Dr. Dre is on
Yo, fuck that
Turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do
Life; by Marshall Mathers.
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down, and every time you think you gotten past it, it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground.
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends, but they really your enemies with secret identities and disguises to hide they true colors.
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers, they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'.
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny.
Money is the root of all evil.
Money'll make them same friends come back around, swearing that they was always down!
What is life?
I'm tired of life!
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck, driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square, tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, 'cause I'd still be out robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
Tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me on Nobody's As Ill As Me
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying Where Hip-Hop Lives
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, 'cause I'd still be out robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit!
Telling me to be positive?
How'm I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?!
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see, know what I'm sayin'?
Right now I'm tired of everything!
Tired of all this playa hating that's going on in my own city, can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up!
That's my word!

Just fed up wid it
That's my word y'all
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems till all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive because there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
Case you're wonderin' why my inside's showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine so I'm
Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap if I wasn't on the verge of Relapse
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
It seems to be the reoccurring main thing
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
Isn't it though amazing, back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this dang thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I did it, pay me, and be, it just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen let's strip away everything
And see the main reason that I feel like a lame piece of shit
Or should I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy
And lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy what's in my
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, 'cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, 'cause they be actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
Twistin necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass in the track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring, gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
That eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful, track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed.
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head, bust a nut, get some rest.
The next day my mother said
I dont know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard wont even eat, nothin' he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead!
Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you, I bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course, unless you object.
Aw, go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed an' up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed an' up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up an' played Ping-Pong
Then he played Ping-Pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything except his tanktop and his trainin' bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady dog
Man, that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog?
Shady dog, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed an' up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed an' up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp, belch and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm sayin', man? Could you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fuckin' melting
Marshall, I just love you boy, I care about your well being
No, dad! I said no! I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsea
Well, this is called Ass Rape and we're shooting the jail scene
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed an' up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed an' up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
Whoooo!
Hey, how you guys doin'.
You want more?
All right, then SHUT UP!
Shoobeedoo Shoobee Snoobedeebeebop
You're my world, world world.
Here's a song for da ladies.
Eminem!
No!
Eminem!
No!
Wake the fuck up, motherfucker!
What do you want from me?!
Remember me?
I killed you!
You thought I was dead, didn't you?
What do you want from me!?
I'm alive!
Oh, my God!
Get up.
No!
Get up and look in the mirror.
I don't want to!
Look in the mirror, to see your reflection.
Leave me alone!
Look in the mirror --- you're nothing! you're nothing without me!
Look in the motherfucking mirror!
Its its its its its... murda!
Wait stop the questions please
I've been on my knees
Beggin these disease
To stop from killin' these
Messed up cronic crease
Of the diseased
Uh oh
Letz go slow
On the radio low
Down south where they know
How it's gonna be
To me
Reapeat the laws
Dynamite flaws
All over yaws
Dis ting ain't no joke
Just go slow
To the hip hop show
Uh oh uh oh
Datz it for me
But wait till ya see
What's next for the
Slim shady
One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Till I'm glad to be buried
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
'Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q
I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheap
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grant's and Jackson's
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth
Uh, it's ok, yeah it's all right, even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah, it's ok, it's all right, I can't sleep
It's like that Eminem, Eminem all right bust it
It's only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward dropping an acapela
To chop a fella to mozerella
Worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid darvocet
Pumpin you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of slugs
So were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with their asses ripped out of their pants
And given a less than 20 percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Dr. Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy on you while you scream I'm still alive!
Drivin' a rusty scalpal in through the top of your scalp
And pullin your adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department I've hired an arsonist
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment
Jealous!?! What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?
He just mad 'cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!
He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, What do I got to be jealous for?
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean...
I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only squabble only irrelevant issues
Too many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all I hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company now you always bugging me
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?
Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem, he just mad 'cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying? He just mad 'cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
He goes, You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now
Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and every time you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house y'all, Fellas sing it...
Whoa!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin' 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is... what you thought it wasn't...
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jan Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic 
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' Fuck the world, like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!!
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials 
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' Fuck the world, like 2Pac

Somebody let me out this limousine 
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' Fuck the world, like 2Pac

Okay!
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
Alright stop - pajama time 
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean wrap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusation
Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
Having touched on everything but little boys
An' that's not a stab at 
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like tee pee for my bunghole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip
Now I'm gonna make you dance
Get your chance, yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright now lose it 
Just lose it 
Go crazy 
Oh baby 
 Oh baby
It's Friday and it's my day 
Used to party all the way to Sunday 
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy 
Got the top down, let my hair blow 
I dunno where I'm goin', all I know
Is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body
'Scuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feel just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out...there
What's your name girl, what's your sign
, aah aah, beer goggles, blind
I'm just trying to unwind now I'm
Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright now lose it 
Just lose it 
Go crazy 
Oh baby 
 Oh baby
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming 
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much 
I'm not guilty 
They said save it 
Boy we got you on tape
Yelling at an old lady, 
Touch my body.
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real intense no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 
 now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
A step back to reality 
Look it's B. Rabbit 
You signed me up to battle
I'm a grown man 
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba 
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Tubba Teletubbie
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls 
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor 
It's your chance for a little romance or 
Butt squeezin', it's the season 
Just go aah aah aah aah, it's so appeasing 
Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl

Alright now lose it

Go crazy 
Oh baby

Mmmmm touch my body 
Mmmmm touch my body 
Ooh boy just touch my body 
I mean girl just touch my body
Okay!
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
Alright stop - pajama time 
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean wrap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusation
Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
Having touched on everything but little boys
An' that's not a stab at 
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like tee pee for my bunghole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip
Now I'm gonna make you dance
Get your chance, yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright now lose it 
Just lose it 
Go crazy 
Oh baby 
 Oh baby
It's Friday and it's my day 
Used to party all the way to Sunday 
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy 
Got the top down, let my hair blow 
I dunno where I'm goin', all I know
Is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body
'Scuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feel just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out...there
What's your name girl, what's your sign
, aah aah, beer goggles, blind
I'm just trying to unwind now I'm
Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright now lose it 
Just lose it 
Go crazy 
Oh baby 
 Oh baby
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming 
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much 
I'm not guilty 
They said save it 
Boy we got you on tape
Yelling at an old lady, 
Touch my body.
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real intense no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 
 now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
A step back to reality 
Look it's B. Rabbit 
You signed me up to battle
I'm a grown man 
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba 
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Tubba Teletubbie
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls 
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor 
It's your chance for a little romance or 
Butt squeezin', it's the season 
Just go aah aah aah aah, it's so appeasing 
Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright now lose it 
Just lose it

Come on hey hey we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat
Where's Mama?
She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell dada must have run over a skunk
It's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama she's one of those types of women
Who does crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
Don't play with daddy's toy knife, honey, let go of it
And don't be so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help dadda build a sand castle?
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you was sleepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, isn't she, we'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?
There's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say that mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her in time out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out
I told you it's okay, hey hey, wanna baba?
Take a night-night, nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga
Humma goo-goo caca, dad'll change your dighty
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
You're dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter
Wake up sleepy head we're here
Before we play, we're gonna take mama for a little walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sleepy to hear you screamin' in her ear
That's why you can't get her to wake
But don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mama at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock?
We'll tie it to her footsies then will roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of three
One, two, three... weeeeeeeeee
There goes mama splashin' in the water
No more fightin' your dad, no more restrainin' order
No more step dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her
We'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk
When I was just a little baby boy, my mama used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man, she used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older and I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it, 'cause that's just the way she was
They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They didn't say I can't rap about coke no more!
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore,
Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin',
Thinkin I'm sayin' this shit cause I'm thinkin it, just to be sayin' it?!
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you -
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos!
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?!
Oh now he's raping his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke, and we gave him the 
 cover?
You're god damn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn
, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives
Lives, wives, nuns, sluts
Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said, you don't... wanna fuck with Shady 
'Cause Shady... will fuckin' kill you 
I said, you don't... wanna fuck with Shady 
'Cause Shady... will fuckin' kill you
Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't acid rap but I rap on acid
Got a new blow up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours, let us in
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither! You ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You'd better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, you don't... wanna fuck with Shady 
'Cause Shady... will fuckin' kill you 
I said, you don't... wanna fuck with Shady 
'Cause Shady... will fuckin' kill you
Know why I say these things
'Cause ladies' screams, keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks}
This eighty G's a week to say the same things tweece
Twice—whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks!
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink?!
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Till I have you at knife-point, then you beg me to stop
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet!
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you! You hear me? Answer me!
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither! You ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you, you ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big? Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Don't make me wake this baby, she don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?
Oh, what's the matter Kim, am I too loud for you?
Too bad bitch, you're gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
How could you let him sleep in our bed, look it Kim
Look at your husband now 
, I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?
 Shut the fuck up!
You think I give a fuck? Come on we're going for a ride bitch 
Sit up front 
We'll be right back, well I will, you'll be in the trunk
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
You really fucked me Kim, you really did a number on me
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen, that was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean, that's fucked up
 Oh God, my brain is racing
 What are you doing? Change the station
I hate this song, does this look like a big joke? 
There's a four year-old little boy laying dead with a slit throat
In your living room, ha-ha, what, you think I'm kidding you?
You loved him didn't you? 
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you asshole, yeah, bite me
Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me? You think I'm ugly, don't you?
 No, you think I'm ugly 
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
I hate you, I hate you, I swear to God, I hate you, oh my God, I love you
How the fuck could you do this to me? 
How the fuck could you do this to me?
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
Come on get out 
I said get out bitch 
Fuck you! You did this to us, you did it, it's your fault
Oh my God, I'm cracking up, get a grip Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny, wasn't it? 
That was funny, wasn't it? 
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced 
And while this is going on, his son just woke up and he walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut 
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should've known better when you started to act weird
We could of - hey, where you going? Get back here
You can't run from me Kim, it's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha ha, got ya, go ahead, yell
Here I'll scream with you, Ah, somebody help!
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed bitch, bleed!
bleed bitch, bleed!
Bleed!
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
'Cause I don't belong in this world that’s why I'm scoffing
At authority, defiant often, flying off at
The handle at my mom, no dad, So I’m non-com-
-pliant at home, at school I’m just shy and awkward
And I don’t need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding off in
The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker 'cause he said that I eyeballed him
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words
'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything, in my mind small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit I'm fine long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look on the bright side, at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts
That I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try an' start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin' they're kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to that kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic in my conquest
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you whack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now you fucking worship the ground on which I am walking
Me against the world so what, I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions' offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks butt-kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon' die a ball-licker
I've been diabolical with this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the fire marshal and
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
Yeah, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to agree
But if you feel like me
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?
He's tryin' to divide us
The shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage that's what we get pride from
When we can't wear stars and stripes
'Cause this type of pickle we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from the scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get ride of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where we're from
Here's to the land that made me
Here's to the land that raised me
This one's for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off Nazi
I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing The Star-Spangled Banner, this man
Just praised a statue of General Lee 'cause he generally
Hates the black people, degrades Hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went
To shake his hand at the event
Or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we're from
Here's to the land that made me
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go
Here's to the land that made me
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure 
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders 
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it 
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a 
 it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to 
I'm supposed to set an example 
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em 
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
Now the 
 shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it 
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it 
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it 
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some 
 and 
 shit 
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted 
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it 
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it 
That was never my object for someone to get killed 
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good 
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' it
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth 
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus 
 told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef 
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth 
While he's all over TV down talkin' a man
Who literally saved my life, like Fuck it, I understand
This is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause 
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme 
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' 
But now it's elevated 'cause once you put someone's kids in it 
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin' 
We actually tried to stop the 
 and Ja beef from happenin' 
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it 
Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at 
 who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up 
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin' 
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
When I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think 
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc. 
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind 
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus 
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is 
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered 
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it 
Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further 
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' 
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at your jaws with the knockin' 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure 
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders 
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it 
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a

I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's
Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
And now you're lying in the corner crying
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded, must just be the powder from the power of love
But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon to be spouse’s moan
And the further I walked allowed her
I paused for a minute to make something, that's what I heard
Cuz after all this is her place
So I gave her the benefit of the doubt-a
Think I might be about Busta Busta
The thought's so scary, yo that it hurts, brace
Hope it ain't, there we go, yo
Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario, though, in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory, though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date, coulda made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
No, you don't, under, stand, I, don't, do this for, anyone, ever
Yeah, that ain't what they all say
I'll say it, you can suck a softball through a straw, used to be my fiance
Till you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
Lebron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow Tha Don, Drake, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin my goddamn Jigga on
'Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la, la-la-la-love
She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head as my bags hit the door
She screamed she loves me like she never did before
And I told her
And I told her
I told that bitch
I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Suckin' dick in your momma's tub 'til your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned
Like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter, you beat the case and I called you
Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' ferris wheel
Fuckin' spendin' on me, fuck you think we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day
Bitch you serious? I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me up, a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the dillinger hit'em diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for yah
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore yah
This is me talkin' poetry, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was famous
As Marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle, singin'
I hope she's good enough, meanwhile you're chasin' her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool that pity the fool in me, I'mma live with the
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la, la-la-la-love
She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head as my bags hit the door
She screamed she loves me like she never did before
And I told her
And I told her
So needless to say I'm feeling betrayed
Snatched my housekey off my keychain
She jumped off, Wee-Bey from The Wire, escape
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliche, it's all my fault anyway
She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
Treats my face like seratos
She cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an instant replay
They sayin' we display cinethematic abatic behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day, cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes
Then I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline, stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
But them other F-U-C-K's all would of hit the off ramp
So I coast into a gosh damned aww hit a fuckin' tree
Now here she comes at full speed, she's racin' at me, okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she screamin'
I body slam her onto the cement, until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Bury this stink ho in it, then payed to have the street repaved
Fuck, woke up in a dream state in a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray durin' a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got to much baggage
Or I'm just too dramatic
Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction, a tragic event
I said hit the road and after she left
I sent that bitch a text
I said be careful driving, don't read this and have a accident
She glanced to look at it and write, too bad
Thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than a model covered in L'Oreal and mace, who fell from grace
Eleven stories for story telling but the whore was yelling rape
So the vocal cords were swelling and her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spelling's face
Still they swarm the gates and my fans making stakes to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date, don't be late
Well the sentiments great, but wait then there's been a mistake
You want an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of--
 Wait, dinner at eight
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la, la-la-la-love
You don't see me in the hood
It's 'cause I'm doing this man 
I'm still hearin' those sirens 
I'm still getting chased by those lights 
Only the lights lime and my mic's on 
And my time is none because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness 
And I can't let y'all derail me man 
I got young Kobe hommie, you gotta let go of Obie 
We got them craps going on and that yak going on 
Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin' 
It's whatever, put that on the chedda man
But in the meantime it's Jimmy Ivean time 
Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out 
This is i,t my nigga's, this is what we boast about 
Now I'm here, so shut your muthafuckin' mouth 
And show me love bitch 
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning 
Hold you through the night 
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning 
There's a certain mystique when I speak 
That you notice that's sorta unique
'cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat 
You can't sit still, its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped
Just knowin' any minute I could snap 
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped 
I bully these rappers so bad, lyrically 
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, its cock-a-many 
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady 
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's cuckoo 
I got screws loose, yeah the whole kit 'n' kaboodle 
I'm just brutal
It's no rumour, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humour in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
You better love me, bitch
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning, 
Hold you through the night 
And all the bitches say
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning, 
Hold you through the night
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holler my name 
If it ain't about the flow
It's about the stones and the chain 
If I was you, I'd love me too
I roll like a bus, 9/11 Porche same colour as cranberry sauce 
I ain't gonna front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit 
Then we find out he fuckin' round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eatin' popcorn, right, rewindin' the tape 
Now Shorty, Momma in the precinct, hollerin' rape 
I'm convinced man, somethin' really wrong with these hoes 
Used to listen to Lauren Hill and tap my feet
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell
My back shot help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charli B'more to deep throat
Yea'
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning
Hold you through the night
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning 
Hold you through the night
Yeah
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
It's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
We say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us
It's lust, 'cause neither one of us trusts each other so we fuck
Till we bust, till cuss each other out, we know what it's about
Shout till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
We fist fight till we turn this mother out and apologize after, laughter
Pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you
There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do
'Cause the more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me? 
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I FUCK other people
You're a SLUT, but i'm equal, i'm a MUTT, we're both evilin our ways 
but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one of us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumours
But they ain't got proof, till they do, it's just the two of us
You and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me
But you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin', yeah I would 
'Cuz the sex is too damn good, if I ran, who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm? So it's off and on
Usually more off then on but at least we know that we
Share this common bond, you're the only one I can fuck
without a condom on, I hope the only reason that I cope
Is 'cuz of that fact and I can bust in that, and that's why
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, you silly hoe why must we try
Is it really so rough that we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
We're lying to ourself, that's the beauty of it, yeah
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fight
And all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear, it ain't gonna change, this pinned up rage
We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we both been someone else's someone else
The problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction
And it can't be fixed, our family's mixed up
There's a baby sister in the mix and it hurts
'Cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time on every song
Every lyric and every rhyme, all the hoopla, all of the woopty woo
What you put me through, fuckin' woopty do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time girl i'm tellin you what
You do it again and i'm fuckin' you up 
No matter what you say, what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'till I find you
No matter where you run, i'll be right there
Right behind you in your nightmares
So much for them flowers, and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you 'gon hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me, whore
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy

You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped who's that dude?, I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Warning, this shit's gon be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, Bitch you got a sick kid
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyl
Disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
Murder Murder Redrum
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from
Inebriated, till my stress is eleviated
How in the fuck can Eminem and shady be related?
Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin' Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Didn't Ya? Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
I'm low down and I'm shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack'em
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippits
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
Losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
Smoked out like?
Band just making my neck itch
What the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap hips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got my swinging
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with Broken English
Make your mama be like Oh! This is good! Who sing this?
Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit.
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
Living off liquid Triametic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anasin
Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for and IV
Motherfuck JOP, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is Tupac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
I'm allowed to fuck up whenever... whenever I want...
This the Outhouse...
Lemme smoke a joint first...
Here, Pace...
95% of all y'all rappers butt
And y'all ride dick so much y'all gon' make me nuts
You'll get your jaw clocked, I'll drag your ass for four blocks
Dunk your head in Clorox, use your dreads for my floor mop
Gay or straight, my Papermate'll do a date rape
Zee can't wait, I'll go Great Bank on a blank tape
Lost like Spigg Nice, stick you for your thick ice
Good to hit twice 'fore you catch me usin' trick dice
Go to parole off of two in stolen wheels
My colon holdin' pills, fuck takin' some Golden Seal
I smoke leaky and black like BET
And fuck hoes raw dog till my balls catch VD
Mess with us, straight up, y'all better bust
I'm the one you'll never dust, it's still the same as it ever was
I'll leave the crowd in a Coupe with white walls
And scream, If y'all ain't Outz then y'all could ride my balls
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
I fuck with them drugs 'cause it gets me high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Yo, all the boys in the lobby get needles filled with poison ivy
Put 'em in the hospital and give 'em a poison IV
My crew get high much off brew and Thai skunk
It makes my style off the wall like suicide jumps
We sip lots of liq' shots
It makes my hip-hop fat as your lip got when I
Kickboxed with flip-flops
And give a disk jockey six copies of this floppy
Shit I be dyin' for is your piece of shit hobby?
You borin' like Oran Dice, I'm more than hype
Bungee jumpin' with cordless mics, for tourists sites
Ton Slanga, I'm dopin', pills and cokin'
Lung cancer in my throat and still smokin'
Now, when your partner die, who got the right
To do the homicide and you shot the guy?
And when you's 'bout to cry who got you high?
Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
I'll blast the guy that don't pass the lye
Leave him paralized and agonized
Fellas, grab the thighs that's by your side
Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Wanna live this Outsida business
Blunt splitters, all that
Multiple musical contracts to fallback...
On... set like I was Liu Kang for Kombat...
Armed like Emmit when I rush crews
More hardcore than DMC and Krush Groove
Don't need hands to touch you
Mr. Perfect, the one you want to rap like
The name rap fiends have in their mouth like a crack pipe
Slap the fuck out you, remember us
I'm the man your father never was, or could've been
Maybe if they passed out weed in high school, I would've went
Got it down, yo
Even if you sing like Brownstone you couldn't Take The Crown Home
Try to call me out and get the dial tone
Pace Woner, dickin' 5-0 in a stolen gray Hummer
Me and Pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased
For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place
I get drunk and hang-glide off of St. Ides'
And spray-paint the plain sides of all the subway train rides
I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool
And chews on human body tissue till its stomach gets full
Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool
Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool
I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold
And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold
I'm from the city where the weather's always real cold
And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed
We be hangin' on the block till dawn
Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon
Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Pace Won, Slang Ton, and Yah
Young Zee, Az-Izz, D.U., and muah
Bizarre Kid, Loon One and Rah
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
We fuck with them drugs 'cause it gets us high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Macosa
Mama-mama-mama-mama-macosa
You see I'm just Marshall Mathers 
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me 
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me 
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me 
Yo, you might see me jogging, you might see me walking
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollering at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
Or leaning out a window with a cocked shotgun
Driving up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Looking for B.I.G.'s killers
Dressing ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double-barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watching all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Rémy Martin
Starting shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman 
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
These fuckin' brats can't sing, and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded?  Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whooping
And getting your shoes, coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids On The Block suck a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it 
Vanilla Ice don't like me 
Said some shit in 
 to spite me 
Then went and dyed his hair just like me 
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' I don't care, just bite me 
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear
In faggots who spray Faygo root beer
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer
Faggy2Dope and Silent Gay
Claiming Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away 
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fucking faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out 
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck 
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12
To beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus? You damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots!
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers 
I'm not a wrestler guy, I'll knock you out if you talk about me 
Come and see me on the streets alone if you assholes doubt me 
And if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot at me 
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy!
Now because of this blond mop that's on top
And this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spun'd around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get Bizzy
My fucking bitch mom's suing for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealing
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, 
 faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass! 
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fighting and fussing over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got 90-some cousins 
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed
To step foot in my girlfriend's house! 
And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see?  A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uh, here - 
, 
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell!
Ah, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers 
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me 
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me 
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me 
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers 
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me 
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me 
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me 
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you step away son, she got her face done
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't trying to hear it
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
You say it's gonna stop but it... just... slows... down
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said Hey Bitch...
Haven't I seen you before?, looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
And said Oh it's like that?
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine two
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
I said Maxine check this out,
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out
Got to the crib she let me in
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
I said Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things
What the fuck are you doing?
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
Before I hit it she said
3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass
I said What is it, another nigga? It's ok
She said No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS
I got up out
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.
So he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
Oh my goodness! What have I done?
Oh no! I can't believe it
It's like... I've got the whole world in my palms
Welcome to the Slim Shady mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
It's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy, Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy well I'm
Next to the guy with nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
It's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?
Drop kick the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter than I guess I'll
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends
All my west side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end sho' enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man you seen it all before you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl don't front oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the The Pussycat Dolls, Nicole you kidding?
I'll pee on Rihanna see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room crazy gluin' Madonna
To the lazy boy sofa fold her in two and sit on her
Imagine visual for that man who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chick so old she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right in the quicksand
Here you need a hand big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands but they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
His name rhymes with so many different words geez
So one last time Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you brake it down for me and just spit the verse please
Eminem I'm coming to kill you
I always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes my Superman costume
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far
Who do you think you are?
Hang up my suit up in the armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break dance if you think you're hardcore
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
The world is mine
Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom
Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies' neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad 
Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh

Whoa!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is... what you thought it wasn't
It beez... the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin Fuck the World like Tupac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!
I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz...
Pace One...
Young Zee...
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ay yo 50
Whut I tell you
We ain't even have to say shit
They did it
Ha ha
Monkey see monkey do
They'll never make the first move
Just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon always say and do
What the other one do
So let 'em come to you
The rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see monkey do
Tweedle dee tweedle dum
If they really want it bad enough well then it gon' come
Now here they come like we expected
Now we just set 'em up
Check mate motherfucker
Game's over we won
Tweedle dee tweedle dum
Doesnt take much
For me to race up and stank up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You don't even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
Like smearin bloodstains with a paint brush
I can't explain what it is my brain does
But however it works its insane just plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that's dangerous
It's a whole combination of things
It takes nuts
And I'm not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
For anybody who gets on a track and spanks us
I'm paitently waitin for the day
I'm anxious
To see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
You're drunk you ain't tough
Whatever you drank musta just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talkin' motherfucker this ain't drugs
You wanna pop shit
Wake up
Then make up
Fuck that
It's to late chump now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calibur that nas and jay does
Opens up his jaws to say somethin' to rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fuckin' dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
Till I peel the pain off
I never been shot but I think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
'Cause I've always came off like Ja's chain
When they tried to rush him and lost
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don't stop
Only thing that I wait for is the day that I don't gotta report to probate court
Cause ima give you all the reason to hate more
'Cause I've been holdin' my tongue till I got a sprained jaw
Alot of rappers on my list
It just ain't ja
And ima read the motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft cause 8 mile
When I come back
I'll be shootin more than just paint balls
Trust me
Monkey see monkey do
They'll never make the first move
Just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon always say and do
What the other one do
So let 'em come to you
The rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see monkey do
Tweedle dee tweedle dum
If they really want it bad enough well then it gon' come
Now here they come like we expected
Now we just set 'em up
Check mate motherfucker
Game's over we won
Tweedle dee tweedle dum
Fuckin' dummies
This ain't chess
You playin' motherfuckin checkers
This shit is all day man it's too easy
We playin' chess you playin' checkers
You bout to get your motherfuckin asses jumped
Fuckin' punks
And by the way
We ain't just talkin' to one person
We talkin' to every-motherfuckin-body who wants to bring it
'Cause we bringin' it to anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Don't pick up the ball if you don't wanna play man
It's all fucked up now
What the fuck am I s'posed to do now?
Huh?
What the fuck am I s'posed to do?
Haha
Yo we out
It feels so good to be back
I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'mma whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
Slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure moving past that
Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, c'mon
All the people up top on the side and the middle
Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
To celebrate for the same 'cause don't matter the weather
If it rains let it rain, yeah the wetter the better
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, c'mon
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, c'mon
Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryina tell us something
Maybe this is God just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward that we have empowered
This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six-
Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al Queda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war
Let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight
On our own soil, no more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes its all lies
The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight you know why, 'cause I told you to fight
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, c'mon
And as we proceed to Mosh
Through this desert storm
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And Mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers!
Mr. Mathers...Mr. Mathers can you hear my voice?
OK he's not responding
I'm gonna need an 18 gauge left AC right away
Uh, BP is 90 over palp, respiration's at 8
Okay, I'm tubing him
DMC this is medic 41
Medic 41, this is DMC base, go ahead
He's cold, spike him back and grab the back board
OK, got it, on 3...1, 2...
Hu-let's move...
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!
Left the keys in the van, with a Gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
This shit is in my hands, here's your life span
And for what your life's worth this money is twice that
Grab a couple grand and lay-up in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description an' sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell an' hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the MAC
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried to escape in the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's Murder She Wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back till her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' Freeze!
But I'm already wanted for sellin' ki's
And a bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, I wasn't wearin' a vest...
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!
Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out and stuck it in her face
Shut ya yackin' mouth before I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed a tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl on Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', Johnny, go in and call the police.
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must o' been some dumb-luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must o' dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Surrendered my weapon to cops.
Wasn't me! It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnopps.
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!
All I see is murder murder, my mind state

Yeah, yeah girl
Can you hear that, it's playing our song
Are you sleepy, take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark are ya
You hear the beat, as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door, it's locked so I go to creep
Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I want to peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placin' hot smolderin' charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em, he's dancin' with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am
I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober? gross
I foam like a doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out
The Devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do it's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig till I find it, I wind it up, and the tune it starts
It's playin' a song so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park
I'm fixated, on asphyxiatin'
And breakin' this little chick's neck, like a pixie stick
The sick, Satan worshippin', bitches get horse whippins'
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry to maul when she no more stingy I've become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real? someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come, to tie her up
Gotta roll me the ladder, I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter, her brain matter and batter her
With a bat a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back like Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back cause here comes your man, Jack, so Pamela
Intro
Yeah, oh, yeah yeah... Oh
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me high
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high
Okay here we go, Do-re-mi-fa-so fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical Roscoe, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tic-toc so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick-axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe 'cross your six-pack, with X-acto
Knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home my little vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show, and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, nor what you thought so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
Your dreams are getting fulfilled, ooh I'm literally getting a chill
Spitting at will, me and 
 have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel
Like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma, I can be 
And be calm or bring drama a step beyond a 
Please don't upset me mama, you're looking sexy mama
Don't know if it's the lala, or the rum and Pepsi mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping, then next time I make a pizza
How many people you know who can name every serial killer
Who ever existed in a row, put 'em in chronological order
Beginning with 
Name the time and place from the body, the bag the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in the model, the make, the plate and which model
Which lake they found her and how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid what wife and which nun
Don't stop I like this it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryin' to light
Behind the boards sits 
, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some, get behind a 
Make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of
Capable of winning a 
 unbelievable it's a
Titanium cranium that's full of sur-
prises when the smoke rises, right before your very own eyes
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
My First Single 
Ohh! 
Yeah! 
So much for first single on this one 
Shady's the lable 
Aftermath is the stable 
That the horses come out erra 
Of course we're about to stir up 
Some shit thick as Mix water with syrup 
It's the mr. picked on Christopher Reeves 
Just for no reason other than the just to tease him
'Cause he was as big as He used to be Superman 
Now we're pourin liquor on the crib in his name for him 
Eminem you wait till' we meet up again 
Fucker I'm kickin your ass for everything you've ever said 
It's one for the money two for the fuckin show 
Ready get set, let's go 
Here comes the buckin bronco stompin and stampedin up the damn street 
Like them buffalo soldiers, I told ya I'm bout' to blow 
So look out below, geronimo, motherfuckers is dominos 
I'm on a roll, around and around I go 
When will I stop I don't know 
Tryna pick up where the Eminem Show left off 
But I know anything's possible 
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold 
I'm at the top of my game 
That shit is not gonna change 
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team 
I'll get away with murder 
I'm Michael J. he's like my cock from the day 
We keep the mark from the tapes 
In a safe, locked them away 
Better watch what you say 
Just when you thought you were safe 
Them fuckers got you on tape 
You swear to God you was playin 
Whether or not you was little Joshua 
Gosh I wish I coulda told you to not do the same 
'Cause one day it could cost you your name 
And this was supposed to be my first single 
But I just fucked that up so
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle 
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle 
That you hear on your radio

And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derick bare naked

And then just turned 16 and used a fake id 
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly 
Hehehehehe
To be so young and naive 
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free 
Paris and Nikki's parents must be so tickled to cherish 
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks 
Hickory Dickory derr digga 
Look at me work wizardry with these words 
Am I a jerk or just jerk chicken 
Or Chicka chicka chicka chicka jer jer jerkin the chain 
22 jerks and a jerk circle 
Or is it a circle jerk or wait a minute 
What am I sayin, allow me to run it back and rewind it 
rrrbb lemme ask you again 
Am I just jerkin the chain 
Am I bizerk or insane 
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs 
Workin the damn camera filmin one of them 
Paris Hilton home made pornos 
Who keeps tiltin the lens at an angle 
Chicka Chicka 
Just recently somebody just discovered 
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fuckin 
When they were just mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse club 
And dusted them and went straight to The Source with them 
'Cause they coulda sworn someone said Nuh- 
And then tried to erase and record over it 
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the 
Uh Uh and then the come-to-find-out-it-was-Justin 
Sayin i'm gonna come and this was

Any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest 
And address it about my lyrics, I'd love to hear it 
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number 
It's 1-800-I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me 
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key 
And I'll be sure to get back 
As soon as there comes a day that I fall out with Dre 
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken 
Beat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock bawka-bi-kaw 
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick 
And stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done you can fuck off, fucka-fucka-fuck off

Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do
Who's your daddy?
Daddy, what're you doing?
Haha
Ok then! everybody, listen up
I'm goin' to hell, who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him
I think my dad gone crazy
There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to
Fuckin' brains brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, then got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall with my framed autograph
Sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I been lying my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off
Suck it Marshall
Tell laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one of these russians and that's all
Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map off
We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off
My dad's lost it
There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
It's like my mother always told me
N goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Er.. Fuck that shit, bitch
Eat a motherfuckin' dick Chew on a prick, and lick
A million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring
In my nose then quit bringin' my flows
Quit giving me my ammo Can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?
Dad
There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, so what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinter
Pret it at first, cuz when I speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as Bump 'n Grind comes on
More pain inside o' my brain
Than in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
Aimed at the world trade, standin' on Ronny's grave
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
Crazy
You're funny daddy
If I would've rap about the crap that's out, that's the route
You probably want me to take 'cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Here my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall you'd probably crap in your pants
'Cause I'm white and he's white, so he's like
My competition I mean, right? Nope
Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba, so
I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite break
And sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em, full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack him with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell 'em why, look 'em dead in the eye, then waste 'em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk one-two-three
Chk-chk one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers Come nearer
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
Talk to me, sit, here, pull up a chair
No I told you leave me the fuck alone, will you?!
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
Go ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer
Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you
Prayed to God you'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you're just now seein the downside to?
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you?
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I said I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
I said, Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
Who's in the den?
Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
Yo Sue
Oh shoot, she's tripping
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out
Will you calm down, Sue? You're starting to scare me.
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook!
I'm over here Sue, you're talking to the plant look
We need to get to a hospital before it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat as many shrooms as you ate
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors before you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill baby please
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
John where's Dave at before I bash you
Dave pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, chopping her hair off
And there's only two days left of spring break,
How long does it take for these things to wear off?
I took 3, she eat the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
My god, I'm so sorry! I'm so SORRY!
Susan, please wake up!
Please! Please WAKE UP! What are you doing?
You're not dead! You're not dead!
I know you're not dead...
Wake up...
Susan, wake up...
Oh, my God...
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
OK, aight... aight, aight, aight, aight...
Yo, yo
Aight, I'mma lay the chorus first
Here we go now
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
My mom my mom, I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom oh-ho whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on valiuum
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas on my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomach aches
Now tell me, what kinda mother would wanna see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fucking-chiever
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
What the fuck you sticking gum up under the fucking seat for?
Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the motherfuckers been puffin' reefer
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a tea cup? Bitch you ain't my keeper
I'm sleepin', what the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone I ain't playing
Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner this is paint thinner
You ate it yesterday I ain't hear no complaints did I?
Now here's a plate full of pain killers, now just wait till I
Crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes ya'
Little motherfucker I'll make ya sit there and make that re-
Tarded fucking face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate you ain't wastin' it
Put your face in it, 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, your gonna just sit there in one fuckin' place
Finnickin' till next Thanksgivin' and
If you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me it K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did, it's none of your dang business kid!
My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
'Cause
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
My mom loved Valium
Now all I am is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with my Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't want to swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it
My Valium 
Man I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict naw, fuck that I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happening
A tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me
And that's probably where I got acquainted with the taste ain't it
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb ma beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
Here want a snack. You hungry you fuckin' brat?
Look at that it's a Xanax take it and take a nap
Eat it but I don't need it, well fuck it then break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
Alright ma you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble hobble tumble slip trip then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobble head
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
My mom, I'm just like her...
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom... My mama!
Me mama...
Sorry, mom
I still love you, though
Dr. Dre, 2010
Hey, this shit is hella-hole, homie
Yo, take us on outta here
Whoo!
This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
Whattup X?
I float like big spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby
If I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me
To do war, and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out
With bullets, I finally got somethin' to shoot at now
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me
And make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?
I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let belly dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now
I love it when you niggaz be talkin', sayin' my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long you'll be addicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name
Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
There'd be no West coast without me
And now you tryin' to act like my rival?
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!
I love it when you niggaz be talkin', sayin' my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long u'll be addicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up till he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
Purple, for mimickin him with two rappin' Urkels
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I Square Dance 'cause I'm sick of rappin' circles
Around these clowns, steady tryin' to call me out
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin' to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - c'mon
X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass
I love it when you niggaz be talkin', sayin' my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long u'll be addicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name
For the last time man, I'm through
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
And Dr. Dre said, Slim Shady you a basehead!
Uh-uh! Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted!
Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self, from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off, and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard, I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch, who sat down too fast
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extra-terrestrial, running over pedestrians
In a spaceship, while they're screamin' at me, Let's just be friends!
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
You know you blew up when the women rush the stands
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
All my life I was very deprived
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had
My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high, the only problem was, my English teacher was a guy
Extra-terrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians, while they screamin' Let's just be friends!

You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, motherfucker
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
Our bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out, with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Than to breathe a sigh of relieve I don't believe in
Going to bed mad, I keep on tryin'
To make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die of a should I
Leave you for good?-so never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you, what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect
'Cause I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Denaun what up man?
What up dog?
Ya all right?
Chillen, cold as hell
Yes it is, hey Bus didn't come here did it?
No, hey look, you got fifteen cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store right man quick 'cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look...
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, you know what I'm sayin' I'm sure I got a dollar know what I mean...
Just throw it in there they ain't gonna know
You know what they look, I'm sick of taking this darn bus everywhere man
You gotta make some moves or something
I know look, I'm trying to get rich,
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car,
You know what I'm saying?
I still stay with my mom, 21 and still with my mom
Look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something,
You know what I'm saying? 'Cause I'm tired of being broke
Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
Cause man I live in the D, this crap ain't given for free
Nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see
I'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me, but if you disagree
You missing the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a mission less course
When this shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh
You know what I'm saying, see what I'm talking about man?
Cause that's it
Yeah
A million dollars ain't even that far away man
Yo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life
Yeah I hear what your saying,
Look there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying?
I can't live like this for the rest of my life man,
Bumming rides everywhere I go
Yeah, what's up with Lexus' and Land cruisers'?
Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose
The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got
The 5 Elemantz for life my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time
My crews true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man planning what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh
That's what I'm talking about, I'm not trying to be the player,
I'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be President
Yo forgot that President man I'm trying to be king,
Making dead presidents, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah
Getting money anytime I want owning my own businesses and all that,
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I'm trying to be a millionare man, hahaha, but don't all you know
You only live once
Ninety six baby
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie'll
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
Cuz I say so many rhymes, it may seem
Like I'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside 
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me
Cuz I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough
My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
The spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
You shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag and then chop it
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

Still watch what you say to me punk 'cause I'm off probation in less then 6 MONTHS!
Ha ha whoo
Shady Records
Still Aftermath
And don't thik we don't hear you mutha fucka's talkin'
We see y'all
But we just gon' sit back for a minute and watch what the fuck y'all do
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's Fuck the world, get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin' bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, uh
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire, expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin', problems on the triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you nigga's skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
Yeah
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't
Huh
You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
Hah, bitch you get
Hah, bitch you get
Get 'em
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never givin' in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love
It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't
Huh
You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
Hah, bitch you get
Hah, bitch you get
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313...
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meanin'
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin' rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret
That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh!
Me and Eminem and Mike
Drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
'Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother till I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell EVERYBODY GET OUT!
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
'Cause she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece
No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
Nobody better test me, 'cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads
Flashin' bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get till that ass get red
You can get till that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' Stop it...
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick
Sick a-y'all niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggaz still don't know the top pick?
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks bitch!
We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
Ain't nobody iller than me
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313
You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees!
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast...
Everybody 
We'll walk this road together 
 through the storm
Whatever weather 
 cold or warm 
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone 
Holla if you feel like 
 you've been down the same road
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From 
 down to the last 
 album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid 
 to take a stand 
Everybody 
, come take my hand 
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid 
 to take a stand 
Everybody 
, come take my hand 
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not
I'm not afraid 
 to take a stand 
Everybody 
, come take my hand 
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road
Ashes blowing in the air
The world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin' me back down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn't scaring us, we pass nowhere we're fearless
'Cause we're just
Ashes blowing in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
We're goin' nowhere fast
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast
Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place
It's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin', we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'mma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch-war machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
Till the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
Till the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
We're goin' nowhere fast
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast
You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh oh
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is-
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black
We're goin' nowhere fast
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothin' to chew
I am bored!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm rippin your wallet off
Smash his glasses and turn 'em to contacts
Nurse look at this straightjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head
When the rest of his body's still alive RUNNIN'?
Comin' with five gunmen, waitin to do a drive-by
For every hundred MC's rhymin about birds
Only about two-thirds'd really set it without words
Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin blood and spittin' phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible
And by the time you all catch on, I'ma end your career
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin' to fall back on!
I'm indoors, waitin for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, It oughta happen.
You swallow cum bitch? No, but I brought a napkin
Gettin' skullie while I'm autographin
Got my daughter laughin' 'cause I sent her mother whitewater raftin
I'm not a fact, I'ma proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-haul screamin,
Wait, wait, wait... you ain't movin here!
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souveneir?
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference -- I need some 'caine
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
I won't stay the same 'cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'
Walkin' in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin my fame, blowin' your hand off
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinkin' I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for
The Bad... the Evil...
The Bad... the Evil.
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothin' to chew

Yo
Look!
Eminem-
No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep rapping this way
No matter what you may think
I'm gon' keep doing my thing
One of the worst things
Is fat, bald men decided to write songs
And teach Mouseketeers to sing
I'll stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck
Causing terror to Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara
You aware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled up his pants
Got a habit of holding Tylenol in his hands
Till it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands
Fool who visits the playground
With two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pissed with a whip with a Marseburg
With a pistol grip and fed pit bull shit
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits
If I get too rich I just get sued
Redman-
Yo I leave with no injure
After I blow four one in ya
One handstand on top of your ninja
Crashin' Doc stir the madness
We all out of work like Tony Atlas
Walking with cans in a laundry basket
America's most with the army after us
Fuck flossin' we take what's yours
Unload fifteen like an ace and four
I'm out of work but Doc laid them off
The tape is off
Yo who target it from arsonists?
Paper make pens filled with arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
Doc can shave up, cut your barber miss
?
I turn out camps in to crystal lakes
And fuck bitches face is what I'mma do
Cause that's what white boy Tyno do
Eminem-
So how's everybody doing tonight?
Hope you in the mood to get drunk
To screw and to fight
Cause uh we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this
Redman-
So how's everybody feeling tonight?
Hope you in the mood to get rude
And illin' to fight
Cause uh we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump
Redman-
Yo when my gat spit it hospital son admitted
Rip your lips off kiss my ass with it
Slap bitches, Doc, Marshall Math's...
Weed, ex, and the acid tabs did it
I'm what's happening with no rerun
Doc rob Dinero when the heat come
My barrel hangs out the Camero
Aimed at the nose when them hoes is hard to breathe from
Flash the gat your town bow guarded
Your wallet, your chain the main target
Beef is like cold engine, don't start it
Bust in the air and hit an airplane pilot
We pound you, rap surround sounds around you
From ten speed and brown shoe
Doc and Eminem, cock the M&M
Blood flows with 2Paclypse and them
It's like Funk Doctor
Eminem-
Mr. Punk Rocker
Got the drug stock inside the lunch box
Pop junk like I just got jumped
Pop the trunk and pull out the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good
Thank God for vodka
But with my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker
Probably got a Fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
With an automatic calling me up there
My man Stan with a gat in his hand
Staking my house out in a damn tinted Sedan
Pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn
Ham sandwich or your canned spinach or Spam
You gotta sip through a straw
Shop lift through the mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey ma maybe I'll give you a call
Sike! you fucking bitch!
Suck a dick and two balls
I'm giving you all my shocking script
Which is to piss a priest off with this
Pop more pills than police officers
Arrive at the scene to pull me off of Kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all
'Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall
I might as well be a painting smashed on the floor
Eminem-
No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep doing my thing
No matter, OH!
You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club
Like, Oh my God, he's trippin'!
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still copping a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but till I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald-shit's on, bruh
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handys with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
From a daddy longleg
And Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice your age and I'm actin' half it
Grow up? Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
Bitch, I'm amateur, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me
'Cause I don't own a mirror
But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives'll butcher them gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into caput'cha
When I pull 'em like
Sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times to make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds
Eight year old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape, 'cause you're in a slurrin' state
I'm a ten, you're an eight
Like what I do before, after and during rape
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like lodi partner that blow me
Told you I'm so dirty, homie, you can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on and get the soap
And try to get the Pope to hold me while you hose me off
And nope, I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone
Uh huh, I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
Is what I tell myself when times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
Well, I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when life's a drag
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
'Fore the pen, I stood up for the kid
You ain't have to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
It's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head
I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever
'Cause I'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds
Good evening. This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please undo your seat belt for take off
You are now free to smoke about the cabin
I'm Dre from back in the day from
 from black and the grey from
Chokin' a bitch to smacking her face from
Stackin' up bodies to racking AKs up from
Racking up hits to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happening in rap entertainment
Me and Shady far as competition faggot there ain't none
Speak of the devil, it's the attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blades vrun vrun they run away from
Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, the great one
Wait it ain't funny man, It's urgent I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun
And a emergency squirtgun to spray A1
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go 
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go 
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless, a nice environment
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound
I surround the hydrants taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and vicodin
Before I begin to get so high pussy boy I could spin
Vin vin, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat and no clothes again
Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple I pinch both and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse if it's forced it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
That when you wake in the morning next to the porcelain
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go 
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go 
Now where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games
Nah-ah he ain't playing
He's gonna get the AK and aim it at your brain
I'm slightly insane, Vodka and creatine
Hypnotic and red bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's giving me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on the girl you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie and as simple as cake
Dre get on the mic and make them tremble and shake
Now put your smoke up in the air
Raise your Henny and coke
And if you really want to get fucked up just let me know
We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you smoking with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up
You muthafuckers ain't smoking you just holding shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off puffing them trees
Was luck enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up Cheech
Come on smoke me up cuz, get me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
Man we're losing him, he won't even respond back fuck
Now look at all the pretty women in here 
Dre it's hot I think we better go check on their temperatures
I get the thermometer you get the bandages
Now baby just bend over this won't hurt a damn bit
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go 
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go 
Heh, yeah, haha
You know critics man, critics never got nothing nice to say man
You know the one thing I noticed about critics, man
Is critics never asked me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em
Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blog, try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog, try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this, I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flow's tighter, hot headed as ghost rider, cold hearted
As 
 throwin' a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than 
 inside of a low-rider
With no tires in the hole
Why am I like this, why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the ho's
Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blisterin' assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt
So get lost, shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off
, wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog
You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop shop to blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire
I just put a bullshit hook
In between two long ass verses, if you mistook this for a song, look
This ain't a song, it's a warnin' to Brooke
Hogan and David Cook, that the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightnin' in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter
Like hot grease splashin' a fan, Mr. Mathers is the man
Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic, so for you to think that you could stand
A fuckin' chance is asinine, yeah ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines
Or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin'
Pull up in a van and hop out on a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam Vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there
Nobody'll fuckin' test me 'cause these ho's won't even dare
I'm wastin' punch lines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw, don't waste it, save it psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair
You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so, im so hot
My muthafuckin' fire truck's on fire, homie
You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop Shop to blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire
Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming
'Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
'Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open free, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We can...
Only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take
There's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps and that's all it takes
You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't
Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I ain't hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow,
As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me
And that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free to this day
The game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts and your minds
We will never die
We are forever alive
And we continue growing...
One day at a time
Don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and light
Searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest.
Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
And kids think beef is the only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of him die, but makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun
And no pity with guns
And when your money is up
That's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back
Would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains
I spent my whole life, fighting myself
That I can't win so I'm inviting some help
And every now and then I take rights from left
I'm still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
And that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope god
Take a like to myself
I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm trying to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
And we continue growin'...
...One day at a time. Damn!
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gun shots; this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor; music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm tryin'a run and get my muthafuckin' gun
Nigga, fuck my wife
I'm tryin'a run and save my muthafuckin' life
Oh shit, the shooters comin'
Bitches hollerin', niggas runnin'
People shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin'a make it to the Saint Andrews door
That's the sound of the Glock 
Even DJ House fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forget my TEC
I don't see nobody, but 
 and Hex
These niggas is trippin'
I'm tryin'a slip thru the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wild
Two minutes ago, we was all jokin' and smilin'
This chick is clingin' on to me sobbin' and sighin'
Says she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But its real and its on, and cats is gettin' killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she's yellin' Don't leave me!
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch belived me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38, I hope it's not too late
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gun shots; this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor; music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
I'm on seven mile...
what the fuck was that? 
Damn, somebody hit me from the back 
Wit' a gat nigga, and my tire's flat
An I just hit a pole
Them niggas some hoe's
I dont know, but I can tell you what they rolled with
It was a black Mitsubishi
Man
And I was on my way there
Belive me, I'm leavin' a carcass today
Now I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut; my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club we gon' fuck these hoes up
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gun shots; this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor; music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door, waitin in lines
Still tryin'a get in the club, to see 
 perform
The fire marshalls know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall; three thousand and some odd fans
And some cumwad from out the parking lot
Gets into an arguement over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aimin' for, six feet away's the door
Into Saint Andrew's Hall; now the strays flyin' all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar havin' a mazel tov
Bullet wizzed right by my ear, damn-near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on 'im
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Naw, I guess not; what the fuck? Oh my god, it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground beein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her
Goddamn there just went a nother bullet, I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it; it's too thin
If I get hit again, I cant do it, I scooped deep
Followed Bizzare's path, and ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps 
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who hes shootin' it out with
But Denuan's right behind him squeezin' his fourth-fifth
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gun shots; this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor; music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
This is a Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass in my left and Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight
Thats right bitches, I'm drunk on revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryin'a check when I got in
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that the fuck 
Shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot's for the money, two's to stop the show
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit' a three piece
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gun shots; this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor; music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
Hey yo, what's up man? Hey, yo you been here all day man
Y'all been here every weekend man,
I don't ever get a chance to rap first man!
That's cause you whack!
What?!? I ain't whack nigga, I got some raps for all y'all
Nigga my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first,
You can bust yours after me if you want to
No no man, I'm going first,
I'm getting tired of everybody wanted to go first man
You always rap first,
I'm rapping I don't care what none of y'all say,
I'm fresh, I'm fresh
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced when I fill your back with knives
Jacking lives of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You best just set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deteriorate, like bacteria
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be, and
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache, wither and break
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
I'll twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fishermen's sake
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
Every diss you can take, personal
We ain't friends trying to make amends
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases, you pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
So pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic man and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow?
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Ayo let me get that mic man'
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic, who the fuck passed you the mic!
I got the rhymes bitch, I'll kick that shit
Here's the story... Of a little boy
Growing up in a suburban home
Tryin' to cope with everyday life
He lives in a little house
That was built in the middle of the street
Hey mom tupac's on the juke box
So what, he shot 2 cops
And raped a little girl watchin news watch
Nuh ah they were tryna frame him
You and that Tu Pac shakur
No that ain't how you say his name mom
You're so lame... Don't you know anything?
Yeah I know you probably doin' joint in a gang
Yeah right, I'm out where's my fuckin' walkman at?
Stop Cussin at me!
Shut up bitch!
Quit Talkin' Black!
Well slammed the door and I'm out
Now what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket
I forgot it was winter
I'm Gettin' Thinner
I'm hungry, is mom cookin dinner?
Mom let me back in I forgot my coat!
Mom come on I'm not playin' its cold!
Aight sorry I need a jacket
Mom look! My TuPac tape I just cracked it!
Mom please let me back in
It is TuPac Shakur
I just asked him!
I'm breathing to much cold air
I'm Wheezing
I ain't did nothin'
I ain't say I'm leaving
I said I'm goin' on the front porch to get something!
Aight Here Take Your Damn Coat And Leave!
Fine I'll leav--Mom You Cut Off The Sleaves!
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
In the middle of the street
My teacher's two faced
He went to lower all my school grades
'Cause last Thursday I had a tooth ache from kool-aid
So mom kicked me out
Get Out!
All I had was my suitcase,
A shoelace, a tube sock
And a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool
'Cause I could go to a freinds
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather be home
In my own room, Alone
Beatin' my shit
And nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle till he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
I don't know where it is..
But as soon as mom found it
I would either get grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks
I'm still countin'!
Even when I was under age...
Mom was tellin' cops I was tryna run away...
I told her Some day bitch, you gonna pay...
Please mom please mom please I wanna stay...
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
In the middle of the street
My brothers incoharent
Moms a single parent
Who ain't caring, Staring through me like I'm transparant
Made it clear that I was just there to run her errands
Told her friends that I was the son from her last marriage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
Please sell my stepson ciggarettes so I can smoke.
One time I tried to fake a stich to get attention...
Back fired and mom sent me to school with vengeance
My life is the worst thing that could ever have happened to me
I go to class and every teachers always laughing at me
Mom says white rappers always get laughed at
Not only that, she heard me upstairs and I can't rap
But I'm stupid
I need to sit on my ass
And just sue people like she does
One time I got food poisening from a hotdog
Mom sued and got $2000 from Ballpark
Hey mom you got a doller?
I don't Think so
Now keep an eye on your brother,
I'm Going to bingo
But mom you said... you were broke
Who said?
From that damn rap music
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Thank you!
What the fuck are you doing?
Motherfucker bail on me? Fuck!
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding me
Are you fucking kidding me?
Shit!
Get off
The parking lot
Shit, ah
Fuck it
Ay EM you know my favorite white boy right
I... I owe you for this one
I've been patiently waiting
You can get stunned if you want
It feels like my flow's
I've been pacing in my head
Like a baby born dead
Destination heaven
Sittin' politic with passengers from 9-11
The Lords blessing left me lyrically incline
Shit I ain't even got to try to shine
God's a seamstress who tailorfitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain
I can spit at your dame
Straight out the good book
Look niggas is shook
50 fear no man warrior
Swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand
Write lines knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die they'll read this
And say a genius wrote it
I grew up witout my pops
Should that make me bitter
I caught cases and cocked out
Does that make me a quitter
In this white man's world
I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut
Wit a nice but to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggas ain't friends
They know how to pretend
You've been patiently waiting
To make it through all the hate
Debating whether or not
You can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table
They operating to save you
It's like an angel came to you
Sent from the heavens above
They think they crazy
But they ain't crazy lets face it
Shit basically they just playing sick
They ain't shit they ain't saying shit
A to the K get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem
You staying wit me?
Don't let me lose you
I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose wit this Uzi
And just shoot through your Izuzu
You get the message
Am I getting through to you
You know it's coming
You motherfuckers don't even know do you
Take some BIG and some Pac
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a lil BIG L on top
What the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers
Tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not it's like a fight to the top
Just to see who die for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is
Soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats
'Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was 80 seconds
Away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
Nuclear showers there's nothing spookier
Your now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50
It's the Gun Squad here
And you hear the shots go off
You see a nigga laid out
Wit his fucking top blown off
They don't holla my name
You shouldn't throw stones
If you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw
You should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face
Have you ass runnin'
Mumbling to the J
Your going against me dogg
You makin' a mistake
I split yo lip
You lookin' like them
Michael Jackson jackets
Wit all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat
You can call me Skipper
The way I turn the money over
You should call me Flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch
Your callin' her wifey
I fucked her feed her fast food
You keepin' her Icee
I'm down to sell records
But not my soul
Snoop said this in '94
We don't love them hoe's
I got pennies for my thoughts
Now I'm rich
See the 20's spinnin'
Lookin' mean on the 6
Nigga's wearin flags
'Cause the colors match they clothes
The get caught in the wrong hood
And filled up with holes
Muthafucka'

This is another public service announcement brought to you in part by Slim Shady.
There I go
Thinking of you again
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke
You must just not know-oh-oh-oh-ho
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink ta
So fuck it, I'mma start right here by just be briefer
Bout to rattle off some other reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you
On my arm, but what do I go and do
I go and get another one, now I got two
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim
Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you
Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke
You must just not know, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter
That you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta
A stupid piece a paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin' cokein' slut, I hope you fuckin' die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut, I hope you die
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna yak
Aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ack
What else can I do, I haven't got a clue?
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now, I'll I wanna do
Is pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke
You must just not know, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you, I puke
Fuckin' bitch
Yeah.
Definitely, definitely, definitely dope.
Definitely, definitely K-Mart.
Yeah, yeah.
You find me offensive, I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw out a line any fences, if so to what extents if
Any should I go, 'cause it's gettin' expensive
Being on the other side of the court room, on the defensive
They say I cause extensive, psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this
And 
 won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those twenty-five cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to 
 and Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
I stuck him off in between him and 
I killed Superman I killed Super-man and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy 
, the green chronic
'Cause I ain't got no legs or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi my name is, I forgot my name
My aim was not to become, what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is, Rain Man
Now in the bible it says, thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before during or after, performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today kids, in a more derogatory way
But who's to say, what's fair to say and what not to say, let's ask Dr. Dre
But but, I ain't done yet
In football a quarterback yells out hut hut, while he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts, but just what if, it was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped fell slipped, and his penis went in, his teeny-tiny little round hiney
And he didn't mean it but his little weenie flinched, just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay, I just need to clear things up
Till then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because
'Cause I ain't got no legs, or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi my name is, I forgot my name
My aim was not to become, what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is, Rain Man
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses
Probably the day 
 comes to my defenses
My spider sense is tellin' me 
 is nearby
And my plan is to get him next, and open up a whoop ass canister
Anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high-fived 
Stuck a pin in 
 head, and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can, and zoom I
Headed straight back to the 
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
'Cause I ain't got no legs, or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi my name is, I forgot my name
My aim was not to become, what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is, Rain Man
'Cause I-ahh ahh-ahh-ahh
Yo, Rain Man.
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre, super-dope beat maker, two thousand and...
Two thousand, four hundred and eighty seven million, nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three...
'The Rap Game'
Hip-hop 1-0-1
The hardest 9 to 5 you will ever have
You can't learn this shit in no history-book
You ready to rap motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul?
'The Rap Game' Motherfucker
I'm a disruptive nigger
You made me crazy
You should a slayed me as a baby
Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me drunk of sober, you'll faint fast
I'm never fucked up to where I can't whoop your ass
Your neck will get snapped wit bear hands, fuck music
Is he rappin' is cool but fool don't confuse it
What happens these dudes get rude and then I lose it?
I'm scandals, I blow your two kids off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga
You are not real and in fact 
Your fruity effect of a crack dealer
Y'all president sends me smack
Den got a mack 10 with it
So I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that
Don't mistaken me black
Or you be stankin' in back of a fuckin' Cadillac
I'ma get snuffed
'Cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down when the White House is whiped out
When I see that 'lil Cheany dike get sniped out
Lights out, bitch, adios, goodnight
Now put that in your 'lil pipe and bite down
Think for a minute 'cause the hype has died down
That I won't go up in the oval office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that C. Doloris Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker, duck, what the fuck, son of a bitch
Take away my gun and I'm a tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switch blade with a li'l switch to switch blades
Switch from a 6 to a 16 inch blade
Shits like a samurai sword, a sensei
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way still till I utslay itchbay
Ucksay my ickday
'Scuse my igpay atinlay
But uckfay a igpay
This Rap Game
This Rap Game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' a hole for this rap game
This Rap Game

I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' a hole for this rap game
Man I'm tellin' ya, no it ain't happenin'

I ain't sellin' my soul for this Rap Game
I ain't diggin' a hole for this Rap Game
This Rap Game
This Rap Game
I bet you rather me
Drink and drown in my own iniquity
But fuck that, I'ma rap 'til you all get sick of me
And clutch my nut sack and spit on who pick on me
I'm hittin' a rock next, fuck a dogg who sickin' me
I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know and quit playin'
If I'm broke then I'm brakin' open the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I lived it, that's why I speak on what I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I, bleed, take a piss and he stand
Ok, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no source never mean we ain't buyin' on what they say is wack
I walk in the party and just start bustin'
Right after I hear the last verse, I'm self-destruction
This liquor make me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Day and Jerome
I'm low down and shifty, quickly, called Swifty
To do a drive by on a 10-speed with 50
You feelin' lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chucky Cheese
Well, just see, who be an unlucky G
My life style is unstable, a partyin' addict
They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a matic
Coughin' ecstatic, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Popin' a tablet and guns that saw you in half
Believe me
We run this rap shit fo shizzie
Make makin' millions look easy
Every where ya turn you see me, you hear me
Believe me
For ya see my pistol in 3-D
No time to call a peace treaty
Dial 911 cause you need de
Police to help you, believe me
I snatch the tongue from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twistin' my words
We finally could say goodbye to Hollywood
Cause Proof and Shaun share nuttin' in common
The nastiest band with gats in each hand
We never bomb down to be a flash and a pan
No remorse, fuck you stature, dogg
Nuttin' to do with hands when I clap at y'all
Put your jaw on the ground with the 4 and a pound
I'm goin' out of town for the long come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter fact, we can battle with plaques
This Rap Game
I'm too fuckin' retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick
That's why I'm datin' Loraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument
Who was the largest
Now they all is dead
And I'm rollin' as a solo artist
Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well, I really didn't, but I did accordin' to this contract
I was stoned in the snow with no where to go
Freezin' 20 below forced to join Bell Biv Devoe
My little girl, she shouldn't be listenin' to these lyrics
That's why I glued the headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
50, sing the hook
This Rap Game
This Rap Game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this Rap Game
I ain't diggin' a hole for this Rap Game
Man I'm tellin' ya, no it ain't happenin'
This Rap Game
This Rap Game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this Rap Game
I ain't diggin' a hole for this Rap Game
This Rap Game
This Rap Game
Look, I was gonna go easy on you, not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic 
This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack
And now at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi-pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah
'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I get a hell yeah from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit, get out my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy
'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on I'm Back from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too
School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. & The Boyz, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?
Remember me? Seven executions
Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I'm high powered
Remember me? I drop bombs like Hiroshima
For this one it's the X, you retarded?
'Cause I grab the mic and get down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries which qualifies me for the term Universal
Without no rehearsal, I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
'Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch that got banned from TV
Heavyweight hitter
Hit you watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin' through
Hollow tips is the lead, the forty-five threw
Remember me? Throw ya guns in the air
Remember me? Slam, slam
Remember me? Nigga, back the fuck up
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx
Niggas that take no for an answer, get told, No
Yeah, I been told no but it was more like, No, no, no
Life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit is all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred-of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My mom's got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef? Nigga, pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin' he ain't a killer but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I'mma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we glock busters
Till the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm getting wires, niggas wanting me dead, wanting my head
You think it could be something I said?
Remember me? I just don't give a fuck
Remember me? Yeah, fuck you too
Remember me? I'm low down and I'm shifty
Remember me? I'm Shady
When I go out, I'mma go out shooting
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
I'm tryna clean up my fuckin' image so I promised the fuckin' critics
I wouldn't say fuckin' for six minutes
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her, and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinking these crazy thoughts
In my cranium but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Came home, and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick, sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen with M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?
Fuck that, pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in Hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
Don't you remember me?
Remember me?
Remember me?
Remember me?
Yo
I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
Calling all party animals
Get on the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who stacked them so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go wit'
I spot you at first glance and go Shit!
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow
You just laugh and go, heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too, yo
With me on it
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon as trampolines so we should bounce
But you're out of your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
Said can I take you home, where we can be alone?
Shorty, you the shit
Girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Crystal and slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
Like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda, why
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
Damn girl
You drive me crazy
You may be crazy too
You make me do things
I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things
That I never felt
You gotta be the real thing
'Cause you remind me of myself
Yo, yo. It's several different levels to pickin' up shovels
And dumpin' you in ditches under sea-level, front and you can witness
Let me refreshen you niggas; tell you my position in this
Beef! - Leave you under Venice, opposition finished!
Here it is, we invaded, created a pyramid
Of a haven of names, so blame Dre and that ear o' his
So 
 breathe, I rather 
 for your neck
And I never 
 you for respect, unless you 
 me wit' less
I got a skunk in my trunk
I'm lyin' - I got a pump in my trunk
You dyin'. How many lumps niggas want?
Who's ready for y'all? We ready for y'all.
We too incredibly raw, for any artist that said he would draw
I stand firm, and it hurts to live it
You open up that can of worms, I hope you ready for the dirt that's wit' it
Slap a ho, snatch a mic.
Bein' brought to y'all in black and in white
We renegades!
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it wit' 'em a minute
'Cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference - they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict - like you didn't experiment?
N-now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't
Think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass, he's just a-
Renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to talk
What's on my mind at any given time of day
I determine what time it's on, I call my nigga Proof
Hand him a pint of Limón and turn him loose
I'm tired of you new jacks
'Less you a bitch, we don't care if you 'bout to do that
Move back, youngster, the glock gon' speak
Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco-meat
The street, continuous to pit, quick to smash ya
Click-clock, six shots blows through another door
Who did you niggas beats, you bitches, who made it work?
That shit was 
 - I got harder two-way alerts.
Just when I thought my dog couldn't get any meaner
You talk about his daughter, he probably go get you the nina;
You talk about his momma, he won't even give you the finger
See I'm a poet to some - a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate, Satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter - a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin' Dixie
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube - motherfuckers 
 to 
 you
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a mo'fuckin'
Renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to talk
What's on my mind at any given time of day
Renegade! Never been afraid to say

Motherfuckers -
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news - with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade; you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
Pop toasters, and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
Mommy's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it - not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics

You fuckin' do-gooders - too bad you couldn't do good at marriage!
Think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass it's just the
What's on my mind at, any given time of day
'Cause I'm a RENEGADE! Never been afraid to talk
What's on my mind at, any given time of day
'Cause I'm a {RENEGADE} Never been afraid to holler
About anything {anything?} Anything {ANYTHING!}
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Doo-rag wrappin my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me - I'm awkward, I box leftier often
My pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown; 'specially on nights
I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor - thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics; raisin' my head to the sky
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter - a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie
While I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin spiteful, DELIGHTFUL eyeful
The new Ice Cube - motherfuckers HATE to like you
Makin' this butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a muh'fuckin'
I've drowned in high from the ashes
Now I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything go grasp
At ends of what's left over
And the lights in every broken
Blown-out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival
 Marshall
 I don't have one
My mother reproduced like a Komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap, I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
About to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
It's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to die hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip hop ain't dying on my watch
But sometimes, when I’m sleeping
She comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine?
Don’t got, don’t care, don’t have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promise land
And threaten everyone
'Cause there’s no rhyme or no reason for nothing, nah
No
If he had, he wouldn’t have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn’t be so mad, my attitude wouldn’t be so bad, yeah, dad
I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start dancing
Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens to be rapping
Blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank
Lamping in my K-Mart mansion, I’m in the style department
With a pile in my car, ripping the aisle apart
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content
Completely, despondent, and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat killing spree, your honor, I must, plead
Guilty, cause I sparked a, revolution
Rebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap
To take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
'Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch
'Cause it's the
Time of the season
When hate runs high
And this time, won't give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine with pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done
'Cause there’s no rhyme or no reason for nothing, so
So yeah, dad let's walk
Let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off
This is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas
I appeal to all those walks of life
Whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of Young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again
It's hysterical, I chuckle
'Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckleheads
The sound of my hustle says don't knock
The doors broken it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold cocked
You critics come pay to me a visit
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, and you wonder why I lash out
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
Spread the word 'cause I'm promoting my passion till I'm passed out
A completely brain dead Rain Man
Doing a bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than
All eight of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef
'Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look
For a fucking reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a criminal
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method the pad and pen
Dad, I'm back at it again
Bitch
Once you call my name out things will never be the same
They should have never let us get off foot in this game
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode
And have another episode where I let it go as far as
The one with Benzino did
I'm waitin for that next beef
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it
To fuckin' pole vault with
Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated 
Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game
Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probaly just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me 
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery
And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we rhyme like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other 
In time we discovered that we had more in common 
Then we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
Cause we started thinkin God doesn't love us
Two hard motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up in chunking cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin
Even if I'm under the gun 
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit 
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual
Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all 
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats
Stompin, I been rompin since Tim Dogg was hollerin
'Fuck Compton'
I was whilin', freestylin'
Back when they was still makin Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet 
That tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky-Ticky-Toc-Ticky-Ticky-Toc
Still with the Diggy-Diggy-Doc-Diggy-Diggy-Doc
And you don't stop
Aw man, yeah
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?
You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, your pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
I'm splitting your shit wide open, no stitches could save
So die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say isn't this great
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
They're starting to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene, but it's too late It's absolute pandemonium, whisked away
In a ambulance is your fate, nothing nobody told you when you- Left your house today coulda made you anticipate
Such an ass whooping, okay, till the anger dissipates
You get punched in the face, reciprocate
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a-mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said...
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace 'cause shady said so You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fucking rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat outta you, chill
'Cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here and I'm bound to refill
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, Oh HELL no He must be tryna kill my buzz, I will not budge
And what the deal ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat
That's probably a record yeah, you wasn't expecting that
'Cause they want in on the act, there's a cognac- Bottle, we snuck it in 'cause the beer that they were serving here was only tap
I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like this guy might hurt me You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start a rumble you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out of, go powder your nose- Pussy the harder you yell, the harder I slap the shit out of you hoes
You set it off faggot, so now how do you spose- We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes
It's shear hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us
And adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe for nothing, my signatures, ligature marks
Look at you all big with your remarks, and I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at you and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you, it's so sick, it's bizarre
Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As having me wanna rip out your frickin ligaments ARGH!
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails, for that- You catch an open-hand slap, like a female, like BAP!
In fact, I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves Where's D12, I don't feel like doing this by myself
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
He's coming home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breath's Jack is a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan
To stab him in the back, knife in hand
Says the relationship's hanging by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, despite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, hi Susanne, but I shoulda said Bye Susanne
After the first night, but tonight I am
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
One-night stand, turned into night staying
He was calling so might scram, now we hug tight and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
What I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie to tell an unborn child?
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
Hey yo!
This song is dedicated to all the happy people.
All the happy people, who have real nice lives, and have no idea whats it like, to be broke as fuck.
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect, but I work a sweat for this worthless check
'Bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in their Pathfinders
These overnight stars, becoming autograph signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small-fry's and average half-pinters
But player haters turnin' bitch like they have vagina's
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Snakes slither in the grass spineless
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
My life is full of empty promises, and broken dreams
I'm hoping things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
'Cause when we die, we know we all going the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man
Plus a luxury sedan, comfortable and roomy in a six
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
If it means I end up burning in hell, scorching in flames
If it means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems, now everybody on my blocks got 'em
I'm screaming like them two cops, when 
 shot 'em
Holding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em, I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch, you want 'em
'Cause I never went gold off one song
I'm running up on someone's lawn with guns drawn
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom

Ok, I'm going to attempt to drown myself.
You can try this at home.
You can be just like me.
Mic check 1 2, we recordin'?
I'm cancerous,
so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for 
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
Take you on 
 and beat your ass legally!
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than 
So if I said I never did drugs,
That would mean I lie 
 get fucked more that the president does!
 tried to slap me and call me a pervert
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed 
Every girl I ever went out with is goin' les'
Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
Jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask a for date with 
Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with an orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist!
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave,
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then O.D.
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
Me and 
 went over to see 
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
My mind won't work
If my spine don't jerk
I slapped 
 out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just an ill rhyme-sayer
My rap style's warped
I'm runnin' out the morgue
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up 
With an acorn
I'm about as normal as 
with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you!
Will someone please explain
To my brain
That I just severed a main vein
With a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high
Or I'm nuts, 'cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer
Shoved in her ass, then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
I bought 
 tape, opened it and dubbed over it
I came to the club drunk and with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with 10 women who got 
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got 
 and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up the just like me!

Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outz in a fear of family presents
Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose
Stay skeed off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies
Call a go-go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock, twice for my block,
I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck
Throw up your hands, what?
Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna
And if you ever wanna get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills
Or steal my reel-to-reel
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsidaz, we hot as Hell's flames is
And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges
Right off the top, then go back to the top
Write it down on the paper
I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out
I been down with the Outz for ten thou-sand years
Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear
Lauryn, huh? Hill?
What? You want me to stop? Here?
Yeah
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
Till she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head
Puff a tray bag, Outz never pay cabs
Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave
Yeah, we all of the a volumes
What be the outcome?
We selling twenty million albums
Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five mic
And push a white Ac, with a bike rack
It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?
F' with we, what you expect to see
Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace
Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee
Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me
C'mon yo
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up

Yo
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight
Yo, I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl, your kind of tookin' back by
The whole rapper thing aren't ya?
Probably thinkin' you'll get slapped so dang hard ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly buggin' ya non-stop
I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya
I think ya got your 
 button inside your car stuck
You outta gas, do you gotta flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat, I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry basket in the back
And sit up front, not asking it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a wrap
In broad day with no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get ya back
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't ever gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?
Same song and dance
The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab, every 4 to 6 months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
And 
 flashed her little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in it the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her back stage now here's where I come in son
Look here she comes I better pull out the big guns
Hello 
, you're looking a little thin hun
How bout a ride to rehab, get in cunt
We're starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl I'm just kidding let me start over again hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to 
, let me relieve your tension
You little wench ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you it would of already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With sixty-six inches of extension... cord
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't ever gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?
Same song and dance
My second victim was even bigger then the first
Pop star icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first burst
Upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me and made me mad at first
I lashed out through my songs but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons
of, footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must
Creep up, to her mansion in stilettos and just
Climb the gate and ring the bell like hello my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up.
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you cause I'm feelin you 
!
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you
Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
Come-on toots, give me the Valium alleyoop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth til you puke
And just as soon you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit I'll make a suit out of you
Shoot! Now show me how you move baby do how well ya do
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't ever gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?
Same song and dance
Same kickin' and screamin', same cryin' and sobbin'
Same song and dance
Same diggin' and pleadin', same yellin' and bleedin'
Same song and dance
Yeah
Same song and dance
I know
Same song and dance
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself laying on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't see this shit myself? It's just me
Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me, the minute she was heated she just bailed
I'm standin' and swingin' on like 30 people by myself
I couldnt even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' a heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground
So for now I'm...
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Bury my face in comic books 'cause I dont wanna look
At nothing, this world's too much, I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol, I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I pro'lly should, these problems are pilin' at once
'Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank god I got a little girl
Now I'm a responsible father and not alotta good
I'd be to my daughter layin in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood, 'cause I dunno how I do it
All I know is I dont want to follow in the footsteps
 of my dad
Cuz I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had was growing up to be like his fuckin ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em
I'm sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
I dont wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much I feel like this is sick
This is not a game this fame in real life this is sick
Publicity stunt my ass, consume my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never wooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood, or mask
What about math? How come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never would've rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from bein' a no one to seein' everything blow up
And all you did was grow up MCin'
It's fuckin crazy, 'cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had
Instead I forced us to live alienated
So I'm sayin'
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Goodbye
So, goodbye
So I'm out the game huh?
Yo Dre, we riding?
Whatever
Well I'm with ya, homie
OK
Let's handle the small shit
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much
Knew too much shit, corrupt
And I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick n'rich, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
But what about Jermaine?
Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what you're saying
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me, with a bunch of little mini-yous
Running round your backyard swimming pools
Over eighty million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten- or eleven-year-olds
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss from a Dixie cup
If you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in
We'll have you blackballed and make sure you never rap a-fuckin-gain
Dre ain't having it, long as I'm here to play Devil's advocate 
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on
I would
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the 'hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
'Cause I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck; white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up
And sell a mil' or grow up to be Atilla
Go nuts and be a killer
And I'm something of a phenom'
One puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us
C'mon!
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alizé, partying all day
But I handle my business 'cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sending it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space; you invade it?
Live to regret it then you die trying to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Like my old lady?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood, if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone
And now I'm back
I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad 
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest, and invest in something
To protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth all day like 
 and 
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in The Source?
Ain't holding my fucking breath
But I suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breath to collect a fucking check
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
Watch your fuckin' mouth
Yo this 
Tell him I said suck my dick
What's your favorite scary movie?
What?
Yeah I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really hafta, I really slap ya
Scandalous partners, whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with, content, yo who wanna start with
Experts, Bad and Evil is comin' soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
Leavin' all of you cats shittin kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggaz be cockin pistols
Six percent, of y'all niggaz is just pretend
Niggaz act bully, and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggaz packin semi
Speak darts; yo you get paid? Rhymin about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
Fuck rap, a lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that - you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
Niggaz is finished before they gimmicks, one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
Split y'all, holla, It's on! Then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggaz get pissed on claimin you pissed off
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin, directin and starrin' in it
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin
Any man plannin to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Came home in a frenzy, pushin a ten speed
With three spokes stickin out of my pant leg
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine
And you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowin' you wack
You act up and I'm throwin' you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwin' you back up em
If they don't like the track, fuck em
The rap struck 'em harder then gettin' hit by a Mack truck
And then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
I'm sicker than a Tupac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-fallin' feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest till you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step
And still have half left
What's your favorite scary movie?
What?
Yeah I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really hafta, I really slap ya
Scandalous partners, whose grammar hammers the hard shit

To stampede your chest till you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step
And still have half left
Ain't no one special, special like you
I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing
It's even tougher when sleeping
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving, you're all I'm thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speaking
I got some game that I'm preparing to run
The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a
Touch
I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
I'm not asking to rush and answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
'Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found
Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right 'cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable, nothing compares
I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie
I don't know, man. Just feels like, we're a lot different.
Kinda feels like, I'm on a hole different page, right now.
Feels strange, but um, I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...
I feel like I'm morphin'
Into somethin' that's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors, better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect, comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, so much passion you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her yet
You strong arm, you're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop The Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like 
, come on son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like she's fuckin' with dude, she wants son
Homeboy you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do, how you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
She's sittin' here gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot and your not, aww
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhymin' one syllable, naw
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough but I'm not givin' up, till I get my respect
And I won't stop till I get enough 'cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations
Aww, that hater alarm is soundin' off, man, Obama took the bomb from my name, aww
So quit cryin' that I took your dame homie, she's my dame, aww
You sadly mistaken if you're thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
It's like we're playin' lyrical tug-of-war with your ear, you hear it, girl come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducin' her, loosen up with a little freestyle, that'll wait, am I losin' ya
Am I makin' you look bad, well I got news for ya, homie you're losin' her
Oh wait, you don't like when I spit it fast, am I tryin' to show out, let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow out, you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it punk but none of it's fuckin' with me
Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit, you think you killin' them syllables
Quit playin', these beats ain't nuttin to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall, I shut this shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe struck, she's love stricken
She's got her jaw struck from suckin' my dick, aww fuck
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Ladies and gentlemen make some noise.
Aww shit, yeah.
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what?
Aiight, well I brought some friends with me too.
Now I ain't back just for the sake of saying I'm back
I could relax, but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black-out and
Burp bubbles, attitudes immature and double shot of Bacardi, party vision is blurrin'
Whoa-oh! I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'
Uh oh! You can call me R. Kelly, now urine/you're in
Trouble!
What's accurin' before, after, and durin' the show
There's no bearin' on the bad news I'm bearin', whoa
What is it wordplay? No, I'm pushin' you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fuckin' feet till you get to squishin' a ho
Damn, baby you look good, you givin' me wood
You should, pull over like a sweatshirt with a hood
Let's network, get our poly on, you and me both break bread
While I'm coppin' over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie, who's your favorite pain in the ass
Who claims to be spittin' the same flames as me
I'm 
 when he crashed
In other words, I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn air bags on the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident and bit a God-damn Jawbreaker in half
So stop fakin' the funk and start shakin' ya ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track
What the fucks more amazin' then that, slut? Answer me that
 where you at
I'm right here fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers
To pry apart you, lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon, before I need to be hired
Jimmy Io' fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the linin'
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69in'
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga
You screaming 'fuck the world' with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch, know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel the OJ, the Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns, blow your brains on your opposite ear
Then ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, evil, we go Alfred E. Newman, mad cerebral, you on your last burrito
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, Ortiz, yo where the fuck you at
I'm right here; my Nike Airs buzz light years ahead of my mic peers
Quite scary to look at, a nightmare, where my book at I write fear
In the heart of you tight squares, I harbor the art of You Nice wear
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishin' off his ninth beer...
Homie chill, listen, I swear, I'm God, I give tracks a holy feel/Holyfield
And they bite ears...
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be? Just waiting to be hooked to IV's
It's Mumm-Ra's well when you look at my pee
This isn't just an infection; this won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection
What I exhibit, seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aww, shit it I did it again when I lit up this pen, I emitted this phlegm
This time it's along side it Em-in-em
So tell a friend to tell a friend, bite a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is 
I'm right here letting the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped like a lollipop
Colored Maserati drop, in a body shop
I take your life to the 9th innin'
A knife in a gunfight... I love it, me and my knife winnin'
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla
They wanna drop my britches than jaw my dick to swallow
Leave drawers in this Impala, I ball like Iguodala
Bi-linguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Attila the Hun, I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, a sound flyin', we do what you try to do without trying
Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shakin' that ass on the flow
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Showin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit
2 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
3 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get ya ass off the wall with your 2 left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fly girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie
We about to have a party
Let's get it started
Go ahead shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day she be givin' it up
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about 4 or 5 minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow, and I'll finish
Yeah me and Nate D-O-double G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party
Have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut. Would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now imma hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
'
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
We about to have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day she be givin' it up
There she goes, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control
Come on, I ain't leavin' without you, bitch, come on with me
And my boy and this boy and this boy and his girl... Nate Dogg
Slim Shady

So yo

I'll Shit On You
Da da, da da, da da
I'll Shit On You
I will Shit On You
I'll Shit On You
Girl you know its true
I'll Shit On You
Bitch or man
I'll Shit On You
I will Shit On You
I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin bombs to the back of record companies
Blow them up if they ain't want me
The national guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef; I got you hoes duckin me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggaz in hundred degree saunas
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes endin up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screamin
I'll Shit On You!
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I have an eleven inch penis round
Stick it in your mouth piss 'n' hope you drowned
I'm a alcoholic with the fuckin' toilet
Bitch shut your fuckin' mouth
I'ma keep eatin till Richard Simmons comes to my house
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fuckin' the 12 year old babysitter
And all women ain't shit
Only good for cookin, cleanin
I was responsible for killin' John Candy
I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my Ninety Eight Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody
Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre
My adolescent years weren't shit till what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignorin the shit how borin it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who hate me and say they can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
Start pissin and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants down and...
Is Richard Pryor still alive?
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggaz that I hang with
Will hang you up naked by your ankles danglin
My meat I stay stranglin
I don't need your help
If you won't give me the pussy
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda caught
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest
It's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
So what you hollerin and yellin' about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin' skeleton out
Niggaz get hit wit a two piece, Bling Bling
Wit a poisonous sting
I'm such a violent thing
Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zainy actin' maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimmin pools
A lot of people say misoginistic which is true
I can't deny it- matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by and prepare to start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child...
I will Shit On You I don't care who you are
I'll Shit On You
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll Shit On You
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
 Sing with me, 
 for the year 
For the laughter, sing for the tear 
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it
And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can
Sing with me, 
 for the year 
For the laughter, sing for the tears 
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me,

Yeah, haha, you feel that baby?
Yeah I feel it too, damn.
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together.
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?
I'm the American dream, I'm the definition of white trash ballin'
I can't call it, same shit different toilet
Oh ya, got a nice ass darlin'
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend
Lemme tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry, if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I musta got my pimpin' genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rollin' stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage wit me, baby I make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me, I'm calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs and his arms
I'm a superstar girl, I'm ready for you mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo, first I kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
But you may want to find something more stable
I told you I ain't foolin from the gate, this ain't the first day of April
But thank you for staying April, I'ma make you
Learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggie bear and all the kissy face please
Initiate phase three, missy now service me
Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady
I told you I'm shady, you didn't listen now did ya
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally startin' to get the picture, I'm just
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
Call me dynamite, ohh ohh
Dynamite, ohh ohh
Dynamite, ohh ohh
So
Call me dynamite, ohh ohh
Dynamite, ohh ohh
Dynamite, ohh ohh
So
I can hold you in the mornin'
But in the evenin' I gotta go
'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kinda like, oh oh oh
I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad you're sweatin'
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya
Girl don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feelin' of something that's so organic
You can't ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get the cam 'cordin', damn shortie
I told you this is bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back and throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded, you couldn't pick 
 out of a lineup
So stop at the store and pick a pint up
Let's get the Pineapple Schnapps goin', no one will knock 'cause I'ma hang a sign up
Sayin' don't disturb, shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
Call me dynamite, ohh ohh
Dynamite, ohh ohh
Dynamite, ohh ohh
So
Call me dynamite, ohh ohh
Dynamite, ohh ohh
Dynamite, ohh ohh
So
I can hold you in the mornin'
But in the evenin' I gotta go
'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kinda like, oh oh oh
So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again
Ha
Dr. Dre
2010
Lightyears ahead o' you
Haha
Woo!
I own a mansion, but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew
This always happens, thirty minutes from home
Gotta lay a log cabin and only option I have is McDonald's bathroom
In a public stall dropping a football
So every time someone walks in the john I get Madden
- What? Come on, man, I'm crapping
And you're asking me for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him 
 when does all of this crap end?
Can't park my ass without causing an accident
Puff my gas, cut my grass, can't take out the fucking trash
Without someone passing through my sub harassing
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow then bass suffering from succotash
But the antacid is my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fucking mash
Potato, so what, ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass
Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd doing if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd-sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sag
Teenagers act more fucking mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me?
I leave on my own terms, asshole, I'm going berserk
My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her, dag
Her nylons ran, her skirt snag
Fucking my Hanes shirt tag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an encyclopedia Britannica, hell with a Playstation
I'm still on my first manual from Zelda
Nintendo, bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread
Make a sandwich with Welch's and belch
They say this spray butter is bad for my health, but
I think there's more white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Redd Sanford welfare mentality helps to
Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still cramming the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt to
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves, god dammit to hell
I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I can yell, the
Other day someone got little elaborate and stuck a fucking dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catching up with me
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me
Got friends on Facebook, all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked
I'm trying to be low key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce hunched over, giant nosebleed
Over stop as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
Show's over, I'm hiding in Kroger buying groceries
He just had front row seats, told me to sign this poster
Then insults me wow, up close didn't know you had crow's feet
I'm at a crossroad lost till shopping at Costco
Sloppy Joe's, buck waffles
Got caught picking my nose, ah
Look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still up in one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em stuck at the light
This fucking shit's taking forever to change
I'm stuck, these bitches are loving it rubbing it in
Chuckling, couldn't do nothing, play it off
, fucking bitch
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with another one after Recovery
Was so highly coveted, but what good is a fucking recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hopping on shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivison to fuck with, bitch
Quit snapping fucking pictures of my kids
I love my titty, but you push me to my limit, what a pity
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out
Kool Aid stain on the couch, I'd never get it out
Bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouse, I'm living the dream
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me
Bitch where the fuck were you Tuesday?
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio
Bitch what'd you do, screw Dre?
You went there looking for me?
Ooh, that excuse is too lame
Keep playing me you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lying slut you never told me you knew Drake
Que Lupe? You want to lose two legs
You try to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
Ok yeeah, I’m coo-coo, hey? Well, screw you
And I’d be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, four? Dre, Drake, Lupe? Ooh touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one
True BlueAce but you ain't
And I can see you and you make that little boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fucking Bluetooth ache
You feeling blue too late
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurfin' puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate
My life will be so much better if you just dropped dead
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead 
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brim
Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think
Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go 'cause I told 'em
I'm only driving drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes but a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias I hate all bitches the same, baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch you're such a broad statement
And I'm channeling my anger through every single station it's on
'Cause a woman broke my hea-art, I say hea-art
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you a-are?
Bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I la-la-la-la lesbian, aah
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life's be so much better if you just
My life will be so much better if you just dropped dead 
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead 
'Cause you told me you love me, forever
Bitch, that was a lie
I never wanted someone to die
So bad in my fucking life
But fuck it, there's other fish in the sea
And I'mma have a whale of a time
Being a single sailor for the night
Bitch on a scale of 1 to 10, shit
I must be the holy grailer
Catch this ho I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name 
I might hit the club on a chica's tail, uh
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back and hammer the nailer
These bitches tryna get atached with the failer
And latch him to the tail of my bumper to scratch them with the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched
Yeah, I'm rich as a bitch but bitches ain't shit
I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me
That's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls, it's foul
But my dick's on strike so all that love shit is null and void
Bitch I'm a droid, I void cupid stupid wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed
Oi oi oi man oh man you boy boy boys
Getting sick at these girls girls girls
Oink oink oink, you fucking pigs
All you good boys doink doink doink
I got 99 problems and the bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of them I need a machine gun
I take em all out I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack
And just drop dead and I'mma throw a fucking party after this 'cause
My life will be so much better if you dropped dead 
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead 
I'm just playing bitch, you know I love you
Skylar Montgomery?
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica
Love? What do you know of love?
Are you out to destroy me?
Never
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Da da da da da 
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, yo 
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangster, till I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug kept shit appealing
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
Never lived to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if its true
If it's you, what you say in your raps is what you do
So they feel, it's part of ya obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets face to face are you for real?
The confrontation ain't no conversation if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it, if you can conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it
Till its empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I love pissing you off, it get's me off
Like my lawyers, when the fucking judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'm violating, all the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitch is news
Pistol whipping mother fucker bouncer 6'2
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it you sweat bullets 
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better, 'cause instead of you murdering
You can hurt 'em then come back again and kick dirt in them
It's like pouring salt in your wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits as soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody's hearts just stop, they call the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking at the Hot Rock's parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not
'Cause I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence
I spew it and look how I got you bitches rocking to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I can do it
Don't even try, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spill the illest shit ever could drive me to it
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at 30
And Lord have mercy on anymore of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards I'll show ya
Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' hoes
Blood sucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over
I got a hole in my heart, like some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions ho it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled on to you, must have been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me, if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake, 'cause I'm a
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading, I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezing
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason I could think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this
And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you
If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say 
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way 
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one 
Tryna pick myself up where I started from 
I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control 
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole 
You should know between us we was like mates to soul 
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more or so the chalant type, I chose 
To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose 
That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows 
In the beginning, friends we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode 
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold 
But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate 
We established this way before we became mates 
So whats required is that you chill with all that fire 
Get your desire when I retire 
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine 
Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line 
I used to say I never met a girl like you before 
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for 
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore 
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours 
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad 
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off 
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off 
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue 
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me 
And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly 
Cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart 
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are 
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see 
Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat 
Before you make a decision that's life altering 
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave 
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine 
Lord knows I was right, 'cause you just crossed the line 
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
People
It feels so good to be back
Ladies and gentleman
Introducing the new and
Improved you know who
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a maltese, I'm a pitbull off his leash
All this peace-talk can cease
All these people i had to leave in limbo
I'm back now I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Cannabitch, don't want no beef with slim, no

So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From seance to seance

Let your hair down to the track, Yeh, kick on back 
The boogie-monster of rap, yeh, the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the senates face in and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'
You might not like This white hot light

Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no, I won't leave won't go nowhere
Doh-si-doh oh! yo! ho! hello there

Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeh you laugh till your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted
When you're at band camp thinkin' the crap cant happen
Till you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' amtracks crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army, or what you'll do for their navy
You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
You're on a plane now eatin' their food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me

Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me, shoot me
Physcotic hypnotic product I got the antibotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God I talk alot of cum-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta
Keep movin' there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break

Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry like a fucking younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not'a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her? I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry.
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat!
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, No
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twenty-four/seven
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no-one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together, too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass!
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air Tonight?
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim; shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now - Oh, shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other!
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think of it, his name was... it was you!
Damn...
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not'a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her? I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry.
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat!
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, No
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twenty-four/seven
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no-one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up

Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy bit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove this car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was... it was you
Damn!
Yo, follow me, come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of 
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world, so cold and so dark
 A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
 But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark it's winter in December
I see my target put my car in park and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend ta befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl you mighta'
Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda' girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian yeah now let's see her have triplets then I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde-
-hyde and cyanide girl, you can try and hide you can try to scream louder
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin', I'd rather go vin-vin and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh
Shit wait a minute I mean skull, my knife seems dull pull another one out uh
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
 A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
 But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide and seek like 
, I'm so hungry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me
Pull the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front see
So blatantly but silently cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
Who's wakin' me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin' me she tries to scream somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me he's bitin' me he's laughing like it's funny
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escaping me no dice you see I might just be 
Or Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but its alright with me, man life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
 A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
 But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
Better try ta stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep it's your soul I'mma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today
I must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now are you in the shower
Scour you for six hours till outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya
Must have just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Prowler there's no one fouler, bound ya that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess look how ya cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, beddy bye-bye beddy bye-bye it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream it don't even matta'
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt, there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun ta act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1 someone's comin' in from the back
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
 A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
 But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
A lot of people ask me 
Am I afraid of death? 
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't wanna die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck
I'm zonin' offa one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hop in the window 
shoppin' the demo at gun point. 
A lyricist without a clue 
what year is this? 
Fuck a needle, here's a sword 
body pierce with this. 
Livin amuck 
Never givin' a fuck 
Gimme the keys I'm drunk 
and I've never drivin' the truck. 
But I smoke dope in the cab 
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab 
Come back the next week and re-open the scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood 
Empty your four clips and bury your guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone. 
my soul's worn, my spirit is torn 
The rest of my body is still being operated on 
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme 
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time
To all the weed that I've smoked, 
Yo this blunt's for you. 
To all the people I've offended, 
Yeah fuck you too. 
To all the friends I use to have, 
I miss my past 
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've offended, ya fuck you too
Every time I reminisce, yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you 
Cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue 
I'll hang you 'til you dangle and chain you at both ankles 
And pull you apart from both angles 
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins 
And bust open like broken water mains. 
So tell Sadam not to bother with making another bomb 
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm 
I got your girl in my arm and I'm armed with a fire arm 
so big my entire arm's a giant fire bomb 
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on 
and the pants that match, here mama try 'em on 
I get amastertive with a mouth full of adjectives 
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxitives 
Proof of all school accidents 
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again 
To all the weed that I've smoked, yo this blunt's for you. 
To all the people I've offended, yeah fuck you too. 
To all the friends I use to have, I miss my past 
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, 
Yo I'm still gonna do. 
To all the people I've offended, 
Ya fuck you too. 
Every time I reminisce, 
Yo I miss my past. 
But I still don't give a fuck, 
Y'all can kiss my ass! 
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it 
I spent a million a track and went over my budget 
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt 
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bug twitches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches 
Gimme a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse, kamikaze 
Strappin' the mother fuckin' bomb accross me 
From the second I was born my mama lost me 
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham, and Ozzy 
I don't even know why the fuck I'm here in the first place. 
The worst day on this earth was my first birthday. 
Retarded, what did that nurse say? 
Brain damage? Fuck I was born during an earthquake
To all the weed that I've smoked, yo this blunt's for you. 
To all the people I've offended, yeah fuck you too. 
To all the friends I use to have, I miss my past 
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo I'm still gonna do. 
To all the people I've offended, ya fuck you too. 
Every time I reminisce, yo I miss my past. 
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass!
Psst, hey, listen
I love my job
It makes me feel like, superman
Can you fly, I can, wanna see
I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with congress
Has, been a problem for the longest I guess
But, maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray
There's a light
There's a hope
There's a spark
But when planets collide
They'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide
To set their differences aside
And this is why
Only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead
And feel the vibe because
I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you
My, music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it, I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde
'Cause I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like 
I'll be here when y'all are gone rebuilding
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will copy, probably millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then cause
I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you
My, lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids at an
Alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see that's why I dominate
I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, Slim you're great
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced, and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts, but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but
I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you
Psst, hey, listen
I love my job
It makes me feel like, superman
Can you fly, I can, wanna see
I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with congress
Has, been a problem for the longest I guess
But, maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray
There's a light
There's a hope
There's a spark
But when planets collide
They'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide
To set their differences aside
And this is why
Only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead
And feel the vibe because
I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you
My, music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it, I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde
'Cause I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like 
I'll be here when y'all are gone rebuilding
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will copy, probably millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then cause
I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you
My, lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids at an
Alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see that's why I dominate
I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, Slim you're great
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced, and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts, but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but
I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you
When I'm not at home, beating my shit to death
I'm listening to the Madd Rapper's album
I'm crazy with this razor with this razor I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed I'm crazy!
Ran in the ladies room naked in a blanket
Came in the bank with a tank, fired a blank
At the clerk and handcuffed her ankles to the safe and thanked her
Every bullet came from the same gun
Just from different angles, 'cause I was pickin' strange places to aim from
Psych, no way fucked up in the head
I'm a crazy mothafucka might shoot me a fed
Or I just might start a fist fight instead
See as far as the dough go
I go loco, see me pumpin gas at your local Sunoco
Stuck off the hydro mixed with cocoa
Jump turnstyles, then run from po po
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Yo yo, I wish I'd been aborted
My pockets got a shortage
Everything I wanna floss I can't afford it
I'm tryin' to sell a O', my pops tryin' to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad 'cause I still stand in line for clubs
Feeling kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim Shady gave me shrooms and I might trip out, like...
Fuck that Slim keep that for yourself
You a crazy Withe dude and you need some help, word
I got a beautiful wife, kids and a gorgeous home
What would make jump in the tub with a cordless phone?
I'm straight viscious I hit you with plates and dishes
Leave you eight stitches, what I'm gay 'cause I hate bitches?
Slut don't be nice to me, I've had it with girls
You're hearing the last thoughts of a man about to blow his fuckin' brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse
Spread out on a blood stained couch
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George picturin' Michael Jackson
Shady said it, Shady meant it, I stay demented
I'll throw a stroller at u, with a baby in it
Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fuckin' pill mom, don't vacuum!
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
You used to say, that I'd never be
Nothing without you and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby please don't leave
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze and you'd laugh
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me, why do you date me
If you say I make you sick
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
But you won't break me, you'll just make me
Stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just
Fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
But I'mma still be humble, when I scream fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was
A beautiful face is all that you had
'Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby hold, me please
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby please don't leave
'Cause you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
But you won't break me, you'll just make me
Stronger than I was
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just
Fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream Fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused 'cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh
We were Bonnie and Clyde
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die
'Cause if you could've, took my life you would've
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, should've
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
No one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that, bite me bitch chew on a 19 footer
'Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And a life we coulda
Had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'mma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends
I'm done being your punching bag
It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on the calendar, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you, 'cause you made me
A better person than I was
But I hate you, 'cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all that's said and done
I'm still angry, yeah I may be
I may never trust someone
But you won't break me, you'll just make me
Stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just
Fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'ma still be humble when I scream, Fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was
I know what you wanna hear
'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you, too
I think I love you, too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you, too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Bitch, you make me hurl
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask
Kiss my dick, get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, copin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice to buy you ice?
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be my new wife?
What you 
, fly through twice?
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe
'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

Bitch, you make me hurl
First thing you say
Ooh yeah girl run that game
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good Lordy-wody you must be
Gone off that quarter bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
In the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over till I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivated it
Raise your hands up like it's twelve noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em till you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I will light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
into the side of a pump, zero to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out, I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight till I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some toolboxes
Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to believe
Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me then fuck you
Self esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure 'cause every time I come close to it, I just sneeze
But I just go atchoo then achieve
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
So take it all
It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But it's all right, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance.
I'm that guy man, shove a dime up in my hind end,
And crush it with my butt muscles as I cut vocals,
Slut poke holes in your shirt jump in mud puddles,
While I stomp mud holes in your ass girl lets cuddle,
Blood curdling on your girdle whatll,
I do for my next trick I'm feeling wonderful,
I think I might just do something a little less subtle,
Shove a fucking Tonka truck up a little kids butt hole,
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash Ambassador,
Of the Valentines Day massacre slash assassin,
I slash her in ass with an icicle and leave her in a blood bath while I,
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her,
In my Spider-Man mask just imagine,
The fun I can have with a strap on,
Stick up a Kim Kardashians ass,
And make the bitch run a triathlon,
Are those pistachios? Damn id like to have some,
Laying on the patio man rolling a fat one,
Shady drop the magic marker put the cap on,
Goddamn man are you that much of an asshole.
It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But it's all right, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance.
I'm like Houdini,
Tuck my teeny, eenie, weenie between each,
One of my thighs and make it disappear like Houdini.
Make this shit disappear like Tara Ried in a bikini,
Believe me homie you don't know the meaning of a meanie.
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter,
I'm tryna maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot, don't move or ya,
Might get it stuck up so fuckin' far up in your uvula,
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to your gloutius.
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio,
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Weenier's smothered in peanut butter,
Pudding on the tube of your eye shadow,
And that'd look nice, you shoulda seen it mother.
I think I put a piece of art on my Visa card,
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a cuisinart,
And mosy on over to Rosie O'Donnell's, with McDonald's,
Jump in her lap and watch the Sopranos.
It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But it's all right, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance.
Shady what're ya doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat and hide a clue in the back room,
And assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room,
Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon,
Skewin' a rat, a cat, screwin' a baboon.
You shouldn't ask, What is he doin' with that broom?.
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds,
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh.
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin,
By the hair and make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'.
Shady why do you gotta pick on the lady for,
Why you make her read 84 bed time stories to you and baby-tard?
'Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed,
Kelly Pickler hid my juicebox under my bassinet,
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed,
Do you like graffiti dike? Well I can pee-pee and write your name.
It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But it's all right, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance.
Fine... Nobody wants to play with me? Fuck you then... Bitch... Guys are always mean to me anyways... All they do is rub gum in my hair and stuff... You guys are going to make me sad... I'm crying... I'm gunna tell my mom... MOMMMMMMMM...
Hey yo
Before I start this song, man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
Snd bearing with me over these last couple of years
Ehile I figure this shit out
Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy
Woah, woah, woah, woah
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' 
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then could have got it
Almost went at 
 too, God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
Thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth poppin' another pill tryin' to talk myself into it
Are you stupid, you gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punch line even
You're lyin' to yourself, your slowly dyin', you're denyin', your health
Is declining with your self-esteem, your crying out for help
Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin', self-loathin' and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the break, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of 
But instead of feelin' sorry for yourself, do somethin' bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby
Quit worryin' about what they do and do Shady, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy
Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that im not the only one
So I picked myself off the ground and fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard, I bounced twice, suffice this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushin' em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowin' up, oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie, Weezy keep your head up
 keep your head up, Kanye keep your head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' em, rest in peace to 
'Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um
Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one
So there it is, damn
It feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Hey yo, and to anybody that I thought about going at
It was never nothin' personal; it was jus' some shit I was going through
And to everybody else... I'm back, heh
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous Wake-Up Show!
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke with alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his true-a fancy a shag wee burners
When I woke up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin'
Look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin' MC's lipless
On the Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling, Tech N9NE's filled!
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white-out
Climbed out of a nice house,
Through the front window and heard this guy shout,
Hey that's my couch, bitch!
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hos worse than flippin' a convertible
Nose first with the top off landin' upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg with my nuts shaved
And Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked, loaded, and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
'Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can wake up
The X-man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high noon to the full moon
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled off, sawed off shotgun blast,
He asked why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution
I sway the tech with the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas meet the tray, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street with bloody decora'
Until the head of jake investigate
What? Sway can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do with it
Tech can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do with it
I can give it to you, wha wha wha what what!
Yo, yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy with this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
With style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're whack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin' murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin' with Sway and Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in
De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin' with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget, the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin' to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!
Fresh, for 99 you suckas
Okay, it's about that time again
Green Lantern
That's right
Haha
We back! Invasion, Part 2
The conspiracy
'Cause we ain't gunna never stop, you just keep wastin' you energy on us
And quit fuckin' with us 'cause we ain't fuckin' with you
They say I'm a damn way from my entire empire crumbilin'
Speak up your mumbillin'
Your magazine is so mutha fuckin' thin you usin' staples to hold it together
It's turnin' back into a news paper
And y'all got someting for my ass every issue
Thank you 'cause I keep runin outta fuckin' tissue
And not to diss you but god I was sick of lookin' at you
Atleast I can know when nikes' got a new tennis shoe
But I guess no g'news is always good g'news
50's blowin' up
Missy keeps on throwin' up
What the fuck is goin' on?
Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady wait a minute baby leave the world alone just go up there and be humble and take them another time
Bush has just declared the World a fuckin' war zone
Meanwhile we got a war goin' on of our own at home
My fuckin' minds blown, tryin' to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhine stones are so nice, they shine so bright especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy ain't that right whoa
Wait a minute I'm ramblin', back to the matter at hand it's Green Lantern
With Elvis Presly the selfish MC back to ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we yeah me an 50, obie me and Twizzy, and Nelly, and Missy, and Jigga god damn it's all a plan devised by the man
It's a conspiracy again fake shit and anybody who can't make hits or dope shit lyrically
So fuck what ya hurd or what you read about
We ain't ruinin' rap baby we just tryna' weed it out
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to Roc The Mic right
Still keep talking shit to me punk
Cause your magazine is over in less than six months
Hahah, Shady records, still aftermath
And don't think we can hear you muthafuckas talking, 'cause we can't, we don't hear y'all, so we're just gunna sit back for the rest of our lives while you ride our dicks
And everyone should get along
Okay children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Good luck Mr. Shady
Today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels
He don't got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping block
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
Till one night Mrs. Stacy went off the job
When she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk
But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazy good as Slim Shady is off the block, uh
You couldn't even take him to 
 to give Bob a doctor
Grabbed Stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacy went off to wander they never found her
And Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you
Drugs are just bad, m'kay
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it
Speaking of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, 21 years old
After hanging out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse, and his pulse
Goes into hyperdrive, and his eyes roll back in his skull
His back arches up, looks like the McDonalds arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him.
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicing yoga
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you
Drugs are just bad, m'kay
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today, is fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out wipe if off bag it up
And then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair
Mr. Shady, what's a g-string?, it's yarn Clair
Women stick them up their behinds, go out and wear 'em
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops did I say magic mushrooms, I meant fungus
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't drugs and do exactly as I don't, because I'm bad for you
Drugs are just bad, m'kay
Mushrooms killed Kenny!...Ewww, ah!
So, fucked up, right now.
And everyone should get along
Okay children, quiet down, quiet down

Yo, man

Dogg, she just fuckin' kissed him 
No she didn't 
She's kissin' him, dawg
No, she's not 
Oh, shit! 
Come on-- MOTHERFUCKER!!!
MARSH!
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone, public excuse me
Been wanting my cake and eat it too, wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh, hit the lottery, oh wee
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cuckier as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it could all be over
Tomorrow so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think you've been wandering off
Down yonder and stumbled upon Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I needed an intervention in this
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very things that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice of my head saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Call me crazy but I had this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed
I'm coming straight at MCs, blood get spilled
And I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
Pumped the feelin' and shit that say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children, but if one kid
Out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw in the gold chump I will spend Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack
Maybe I need a straitjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
It's the return of the... Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who. Yeah, but he's so cute though
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't
But it's cool for 
 to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals... well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a 
?
Half o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to 
?
Yo shit, 
 better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on 
Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe
I should download her audio on MP3
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all
I just get on the mic and spit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'
In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' I don't give a fuck
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

Please stand up, please stand up?
Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before

It's all bad now man, it's all bad
It's all fucked up now
Yeah ha ha, new shit, hey yo
That I did not start this, but I will finish it
Comin' up it never mattered was color you was
If you could spit then you could spit, that's it, that's what it was
Back when, motherfuckers was straight back packin
Cypherin, fightin for life in this rap
For the mic to get past and you psyched and you gasped
And you hyped 'cause you last and you might whoop some ass
If you lost then you lost shake hands like a man
And you swallowed it, when the unsigned hype column
At The Source was like, the only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin', a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you a piece of shit
Four and a half or five, means you Biggie, Jigga, Nas,
Or Benzino shit I don't eben think you realize
You playin' with motherfuckers lives, I done watched Dre
Get fucked on The Chronic, probably 'cause I was on it
Now you fucked me outta my mics twice I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin' breath to get a five
Shit I was right, I'da fuckin' died already tryin'
I swear to God I never lie I bet that's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit we knew
You'd probly try to fuck us with Obie and 50 too
Fuck a relationship we through
No more Source with street credit, them days is dead
Ray's got A-Ks to Dave May's head
Every issue there's an eight page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid, hes just a fuckin' waste of lead
On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old Gs bout to get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfuckin mother you motherfuckin punk
Put me on your fuckin' cover just sell your little sell out mag
I ain't mad I feel bad, heres an ad, heres a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit that you don't know about? ya
Lets talk about how your puttin' you own son out there
And to try to eat off him, 'cause you missed your boat
Your never gonna float bitch you're just too old
No wonder you're sore now, lordy ya board now
I'm pushin thirty you kickin forty's door down
Bitch this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of quotables but you know
That you'll always see me on your TV
'Cause you gotta stay up till three in the mornin
To see your video played once on BET
So he-he-he who has the last laugh?
Aftermath ya so on behalf on our whole staff
Kiss our ass-hole cracks we'll never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzinos wack
No matter how many times I say he's stan, hell never blow jack
Your better off tryin' to bring R-S-O back
Look at your track record that's how far it goes back
Its extortion and Ray owns a prportion
So half of the staff up there is fresh outta jail from boston
Bullyin and bossin, caged like a slave they've completely brainwashed him
And forced him to stay locked in his own office afraid of the softest
Fakest, wannabe gangster in New York
And its pitiful, 'cause I never woulda said shit to you if you'd kept your mouth shut
Bitch now what? hit it clue, spit it slay
New shit, exclusive yo lantern, yo whoo kid
I'm through, this is stupid, I can't believe I stooped to this
Bullshit to do this...
And who you callin a bitch? Bitch. You owe me.
The Wild... Gotham
Ha ha, riiiiide...
All you see is the sun, reflectin off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin gold, waitin for this drama to unfold
I got a {blunt} rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
But I know you - the name's Slim - you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin' the truth, I got a price on my head too, 'cause when you...
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
He was Shady, I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
The Chronic!
Who?
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin' around sayin' he took the game from us
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin' - it sounded like a G Thang,
And a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringin
I said It's Dre's Day, and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin every which way
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled
Always die...
The Wild... Gotham
Ha ha, riiiiide...
, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. 
, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song 
 has gotten such rotten responses.
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on 
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on 

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
To deal with these cocky caucasians
Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Yo I'm tryin' to be the man of the day
Three six five a year
Bustin' lyrics in the air
Keepin' some up in the chamber
Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin'?
Man, I'm releasin anger
I'm tryin' to be the illest of the day
Three six five a year
See that bullshit you sayin', Shady ain't tryin' to hear
Spittin' lyrics in your ear
Keepin' some up in the chamber
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doin'?
I'm releasin anger
Man I'm tired of bein tired, every time I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin, and endin up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit without make-up, wake up
Gold diggin bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin, girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin' like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now
At every industry party, gettin' so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin up Withe rappers like I'm throwin' gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposin the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin' shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last ode that I snifed the cane
Yo know your spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your pukus, turnin' to yellow with orange mukus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genuis, too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished
'Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin
You gettin' spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin' your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specimen from a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternly eternally
I'll take it back before we do each others name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to lovers lane, to the night you were started
Cock block your fathers game
I'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left, then to hope out
I'ma throw a head-but so hard, I'll knock us both out
Yo I keep m luv snug bruv
But I'm white, so I don't know no thug luv
But what you do find is thugs luv then 2time
It's a truecrime but most do it
Like should I or should'nt I arrr screw it
Then when she finds out your cheating
She gives you a raw beating for leaving
And not luvin
Then shit gets heated hotter than a hot oven
'Cause you've broken bonds
Kissed others with open tongs
Being disloyal
Like what's been planted in this soil
But this is all I've herd
How they cheat and end up dead from their bird
So if you blare a word of cheating
You havent put one foot in
You've stook both feet in
Then you start watching your back from day one
Like you got your clothes the wrong way on
But as I say
So were did I get this shit from?
A little birbie told me
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
The tall shit that will end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carried the fat chick
Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it
Baby all I wanna do is swallow one and two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience
They honor the
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right
Ayo, spiders are like tarantulas, vandealous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think a living never meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back
Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly said it
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right
Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored
And treat you like a piece
Of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire
I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting, with the romantic
Freaking the vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right
Hey! Hey, stop, hey. Please stop, fuck stop!
Thank God you stopped.
Fuck, my fucking OnStar isn't working,
I left my fucking phone at home!
God, I've been standing out here for like, an hour
I'm soaking wet, freezing
Thank you so much. Really, you're a life-saver, uh
What are you doing?
Fucking! Get away from me! What the FUCK! Fucking ASSHOLE!
GET AWAY FROM ME YOU MOTHERFUCKER! GET AWAY!
GET AWAY YOU FUCKIN FREAK! GET AWAY FROM ME!
GODDAMIT FUCK! HELP ME!
I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again
Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for
All my life I was told I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves me
My friends, what do they know?
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings
In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets going she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings
Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get this straight, then say screw her!
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings
I don't do black music
I don't do Withe music
I make fight music
For High School kids
I pull side full grips
When I drive like this {screech}
With a slipped disk
From a Limp Bizkit diss
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs
Don't attempt this shit
Just step back
While I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I said to the girl, I'm like
What up girl?
Shut up girl!
And showed her a cut-up squirrel
She screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her
Slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes
And kissed 'em on a futon
{Ay yo baby!}
{What do you want?!}
I looked at 'em both and I was like
Look, check this out toots, I'm lookin' for cookie pus
I need to speak to 'em immediately
They played my video on MTV last week
And just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some
In comes Fred Durst
Yo Shady let me get some
Who knows what galaxy I came from
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare
You stay right there
I got the diva
Hold the flavor of a single
See me and Shady?
I think we got a lock down
Shocked by the sound
I got you cruisin' with your top down
These two blondes
I offered 'em both a drink
And this you would think
Could get the party started
But instead them girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouths
Smelt like somebody farted
So if it's time for me to move on
Shady said the livin' room was a dance floor
So turn me loose
I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was drunk
And a prick
Ramblin' on about how
He was gonna kill me
Wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no- He insisted we should go
Before I could drop 'em
Shady had to clock 'em
The music stopped
The party stood in shock
So I looked around
Grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all
But don't you
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all
Turn me loose
You better tell 'em to come re-shingle the roof
Just keep feedin' me free drinks till I puke
And Fred'll ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sick at the barn
I'm not bein' approached
'Cause Fred's over there stealin' all of my hoes
{Yo Fred save me some}
I walked up to these saimese twins
And asked to have a threesome
Told 'em two heads are better that one
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up like Ay wait, where you goin {bye!}
Oh well
Three strikes and I'm out
I struck out and stood tied to the road {ouch}
I ain't tryin' no more
Fuck it- I'm chillin'
Get a shot of yable {ah}
Fell asleep on the ceiling
Who knows what galaxy I came from
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare
You stay right there
I got the diva
Hold the flavor of a single
See me and Shady?
I think we got a lock down
Shocked by the sound
I got you cruisin' with your top down
These two blondes
I offered 'em both a drink
And this you would think
Could get the party started
But instead them girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouths
Smelt like somebody farted
So if it's time for me to move on
Shady said the livin' room was a dance floor
So turn me loose
I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was drunk
And a prick
Ramblin' on about how
He was gonna kill me
Wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all
But don't you
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all
Slim mother fuckin' shady... all right
Missy elliot, Timbo, c'mon, yo
I'm homicidal, and suicidal, with no friends
Holdin' a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin techs at you
Until you see the fuckin' legs full of bullets holes and the exit wounds layin next to you.
Fuckin' mad dog, foamin out the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin out the couch
Jumped outta a 93 floor of a buildin
Woke up to a hospital staff
Got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half
And sufficated your oxygen mask
If I get any higher ima get the east and west beefin again
Fly back to detroit and stand in the cross-fire
I got the hotel room ready
What time are you gettin' off... work
Or shall I say
What time are you comin' over
Yo, yo, I'm only smilin' when I'm violent,
Got on the plane wylin,
Told the piolet to fly me to tylenol Island
Stewardess like you restless?
No bitch, I'm rest-Full, so hold this fuckin' jet still so I can eat this pretzels
Forget school,
The other kids are disrespectfull,
They hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles
I can't take it
I'm tryin' to gain weight,
So I eat steak
And swallow the whole plate
And weigh myself, naked
Without albulms
To teach kids family values
'Cause every mom and dad should allo you to pop vaiulums
And never hit sum 1 unless you got a reason
And if there ain't a reason
Make 1 up and just start swingin'
Chem-le-le-le-le-le-le-le, le-le, le-le
Chem-ne-le-eh-ne-nuf-nu-nef, ne-nish, le-le, translation
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Two pills I pop till my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
Frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fucking handle
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degrading, creating murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for having blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in your face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say forgive me
I'm snatchin every penny, it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the president get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chilling in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
I'm a compulsive liar, setting my preacher on fire
Slashing your tires, flying down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jacking my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
Fucking your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for letting the record skip
I'm fucking anything when I'm snorting
It's gonna cost three hundred dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with something, nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a Stop the Violence rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishing, get your ASCAP-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain bitch, I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag
We strangling rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatching up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva, yo, yo
I leave ya face leaking, run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preaching, take a swing at the deacon
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught selling em shape
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for having sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not giving me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggas running they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was folding some ones
Till I met your fat mama, now I'm rolling in dough
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Ha ha, suck my motherfuckin' dick
D-12, Dirty-motherfuckin'-Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim Shady
A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know, I'm back now
Haha!
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain, and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground
Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up
Broken tibia's, fibula's, yeah fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of 'em dying from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeve Sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy Pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Whack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask and a boxing match
Yes he can, I just did faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next o' kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy, especially when I flex again
And throw a fucking lesbian in wet cement
So faggoty, faggoty, faggoty, Raggedy Ann an' Andy
No, Raggedy Andy an' Andy. No, it can't be, it can't be
Yes, it can be! The fucking Antichrist is back, Danny
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville, calamity, goddammit, insanity
Pills, fanny-pack filled with Xanies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilt on my silk negligée, looky
Razor b-lades with me to make you b-leed
Cases of Maybelline make-up lay on a table of weed
Slim Shady, shit sounds like a fable to me
Till he jumps out the fucking toilet when you're takin' a pee
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground
Six semen samples, seventeen strands o' hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
 prepare to elope with a can-opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fucking doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fucking Vicodin like I'm a viking
Oh, lightnin' is strikin' it might be a fucking sign I need a psychic-
Evaluation. Fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fucking lesbian, shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missing both legs and begging to stay
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground
Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions then split a bag of Funions
Mad at me, understandable, cannibal shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have him catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a Trick or Treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar
Swipe his powers replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers
Hit Jason Voorhees with a forty
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine
And sat him in the fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fucking Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Looking like I got into a fucking pillow fight with a Triple Fat Goose
Insanity, can it be vanity, where's the humanity
In havin' a twisted fantasy with an arm-and-leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred an eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back, then they latch it
Cut your fuckin' head off and ask, Where you headed off to?
Get it? Headed off to? Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic, so's this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco!
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground
I had to get sober.
It wasn't a choice, it was, I had to do this.
And now I got 90 days clean.
And uh, that's all I have to share. 
Thanks.
Well thanks for sharing Brian.
There anyone else who'd like to share this evening.
Yeah, I got something to share...
You're gayer, than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So homie...
Lay down, down down
Lay down, lay down
Uhh, where's everybody going?
This always went over real big in Gay.A.
Ok wait, I got another one...
I just love condoms and lots of cum
No?
Oh, shit.
Girl I think you just mighta tried to pull a mo'fuckin' fast one I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade, tryin' to play games, see this saw blade
See the silhouette of a stalker in your walkway, better cooperate
Or get sauteed and rotisseried, while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet, you can hear a mo'fuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids women and men
Vnnn-vnnn motor's so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin', not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend spend even ten cents on you since when
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny
Shit, if I think a penny's pretty, just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, catch an Eskimo by his toe, while he's trying to roll a snowball
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers better let him go ya'll
'Cause...
Now here we go, go, go
Get up baby get a move on, like a U-Haul, you can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit, yeah honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it, evil I see hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every mo'fuckin' chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause, you can bet your ass that we gon' get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
So bad you gon' have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line run it up the flag pole with 
See if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid at
Me bitch, I ain't in the mood for this shit, get my dick, Google it
Till it pops up, ya'll are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you've stopped up
Girl you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette, Chik-Chigarette
But you won't get a hot fudge Sundae from me, so do not strut my way slut
Because...
Now here we go, go, go
And now that I got your panties in a bunch, and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut cunt whore, I know you want more
Bitch it's time to put the math back in the Mathers, 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem, run boy
Every flow got it mastered, so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fishes ass, yeah in other words I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank yeah still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous, fuck an animal
I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now, can ya ho?
Shady I don't understand your flow, understand my flow, bitch I flow like Troy
Polamalu's hair boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare, stay the fuck outta my hair boy
You can look, you can stare point, but you can't touch, I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it man is there a void, all this weak shit, what am I steroids
Well bitch I'm back, with some shit for that ass, and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids
And remember boys...
Now here we go, go, go
Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say Die N-word than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops into black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty 'cause we're black
But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be capped in America like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', till we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the Land of the Free that made people slaves to build
Here is Soul Intent checkin' in at number 1 baby this week,
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is MC Proof
And DJ Heeaad!
Checkin' in on W.E.G.O.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayo we got the number one requested song,
Of the day, coming up next
It's a local 313 talent
He goes by the name of Eminem
And it's called 

Check it out
Yeah! Oh, get up! I said, get up! Let's go!
Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the mornin' sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain't come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone
Man first of all I'm a boss, I just wanna get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors
With the flames on 'em, Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him
'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man, now get amped, dance
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party 
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party 
Pull a 5th of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow probably still be too high to get out of bed
Till I feel like I've been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like im hollerin', 
Missed the tree and hit Rudolf and 2 innocent bystanders
So quit tryin' to play the Wall like you're Paul and
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the Mini's
But im not throwin' ones, five, tens or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at Skinny's
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north, east and west but when it comes to them trailers in them Southparks
Muffle it 'cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So ladies, if your belly button's not an innie then im outtie
Now hop in my mini-van, let's get rowdy, come on
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party 
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party 
Now whether your black, white or purple, if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know your up to evil and your no damn good
Get on the floor, man and rep yo hood
Now, honey, don't let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot 'cause, girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window out of my Gremlin, put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift and make a five seater
I'll be damned if I feed a chick, it ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y and I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell ya now, I'm so raw, I still need to un-thaw
You feel me y'all, I'll shut the club down like 
 in the mall
But, baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car, now get up
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party 
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party 
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes 
Why are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set? My arms I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp
But as soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter-flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these as pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water 
But only when it freezes
It's the curse of the standard that the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
Till I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, This shit is garbage!
And God's given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water 
But only when it freezes
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-
Pectations and meet 'em, but first the Speedom verse
Now Big Sean he's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though, especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote Stan
It's 50 a.k.a Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got tyme to waste
Let's make it
You said you a gansta but you never pop nuttin'
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, yeah
You ain't no kin of mine, nah
What makes you think that I wont run up on you with the nine
We do this all tha time, right now we on tha grind
So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em everytime, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin with they mind
I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three to nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes
You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'
You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'
Damn Homie, in high school you was tha man, homie
What tha fuck happened to you?
I got tha sickest vendetta when it come to tha chedda
And if you play wit my paper, you gotta meet my berretta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin on amoretta
I'm livin once than deada, I know I can do better
She look good but I know she after my chedda
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her
Be easy, stop tha bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in tha club doin' the same ol' two step
Guerilla unit 'cause, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out
You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'
You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'
Me I'm no mobsta, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm jus me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV
'Cause I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin they goin murder 50, how?
We ridin 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR 15's?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and dem things, huh
You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'
You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'
Haha, damn homie
I hit harder than four men,
Landing both gloves to a low blow with no cup
Leave you Speech-less like when Arrested Development broke up
Carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
Crack skulls, through helmets,
With the penetration of a screw, nailed in,
Return like I was sending self addressed postage
Throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
Before battles we pour blood and toast death to wicked infants
Found on the sorceress, doorsteps,
Slaughter lamb, and boar's head
Every MC's cause of boredness and mind bondage
Bronchitis, lung failure
Language unfam-i-liar
Art through a flooded air brush
Road leave craft
Sentences joined with words holding hands
It's a tight squeeze
From where your head will be landing in exact time flight leaves.
Watch deez
Watch deez
Watch deez
Don't watch that, watch deez
Who's arm is this?
I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
And never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life
That's why I degrade my wife
Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich, and just ate the knife,
My mother's screaming 'please heal and take him straight to Christ'
Meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'
I was probably just tryin' to shake the lice
Bugs fallin' out of my head
I'm wishin' I was dead
While I'm fallin' out of my bed
Found it red and my rash is returning
I feel the sensation of burning
Occurring usually during pain for release in my urine
Screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'
Took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me.
Watch deez
Watch deez
Watch deez
Don't watch that, watch deez!
There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phoneline, can't dial out
I scream for police, but I doubt
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail but this time
When I get pulled over, there's a Doberman Pincher
And a Pitbull in the seat, these pigs will get bit foolin' wit' me
Quit foolin' wit' me, bitch you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat, why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
And which you're gonna see in the long run, imma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo tinted glass flashin' that flashlight
On my ass, where was you that last night when them assholes
Ran up on my grass, rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bare arms, what, I'm sposed to fight with bare palms?
Yeah right, they comin' with bombs, I'm comin' with flare guns
We as Americans
We as Americans, us as a citizen, gotta protect ourselves
Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets through worse and through better health
Survivin by any means; We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what did we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans
I'ma make a few bucks, wear a cool vest
Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cookoo's nest
But you know who, with a S tattooed to my chest
But I finessed it, now I got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it 50/50 on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin quicker
Then mankin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money, I don't rap with dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead
It's never been said but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been bastard, the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
Fuck that shit! I dun seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap pap shit that quick
Snap click, but this time I got the fuckin' au-to-ma-tic
And no one gon' test this mind, clack click
We as Americans, us as a citizen, gotta protect ourselves
Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets through worse and through better health
Survivin by any means; We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what did we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans
I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two Nina's under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years, no less then that, no questions asked
What might be a good idea, that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send the task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi but I got my ... mack
We as Americans, us as a citizen, gotta protect ourselves
Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets through worse and through better health
Survivin by any means; We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what did we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans
Guess who?
Did you miss me?
, sing the chorus
We're the ones who made you
Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zan-tac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man, no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think 
 a man
She stomped him just 'cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back, as nasty as he can
Yes he can-can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But 
, please come back to seein' men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see you grin
Now come in girl
We're the ones who made you
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley horse her
Sorry Portia, but whats Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenedrine
And I'll invite 
 out to dinner then
Nail her, baby say hello to my little friend
 forget 
, let's cut out the middlemen
Forget him or you're gonna end up in hospital again
And this time it wont be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention, that 
 in
Love with me 
, so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style but it isn't Slim
We're the ones who made you
And that's why my love, you'll never live without
I know you want me girl 'cause I can see you checkin' me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you
Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, 
, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Wowzers, I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressin' like 
Lord help us, he's back in his pink 
 shirt
Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about ta flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can ya blame me, you're my 
 I'm your Blake
Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it, to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
Now break it down, girl
We're the ones who made you
So baby

Oh, Amy

I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha-ha, wooo
, two-thousand and twenty
Yeah
Guess who?
Did you miss me?
, sing the chorus
We're the ones who made you
Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zan-tac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man, no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think 
 a man
She stomped him just 'cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back, as nasty as he can
Yes he can-can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But 
, please come back to seein' men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see you grin
Now come in girl
We're the ones who made you
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley horse her
Sorry Portia, but whats Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenedrine
And I'll invite 
 out to dinner then
Nail her, baby say hello to my little friend
 forget 
, let's cut out the middlemen
Forget him or you're gonna end up in hospital again
And this time it wont be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention, that 
 in
Love with me 
, so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style but it isn't Slim
We're the ones who made you
And that's why my love, you'll never live without
I know you want me girl 'cause I can see you checkin' me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you
Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, 
, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Wowzers, I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressin' like 
Lord help us, he's back in his pink 
 shirt
Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about ta flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can ya blame me, you're my 
 I'm your Blake
Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it, to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
Now break it down, girl
We're the ones who made you
So baby
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down
Oh, Amy

I'm rockin' shit, packin shit, while stackin shit
If anyone steps up askin shit, I'm blastin shit
You gone phase me, but swingin' like Peter Parker
Motherfuck the shop, I'll wreck the Goddamn barber
Forget your dreams about being with fans hugged up
You couldn't be a dope MC if you said his rhymes drugged up
I told you once, but you forget so here's a flashback
You couldn't be shit, if you came out my asscrack
Stop frontin kid, you know you ain't paid
And the only mic/Mike you wrecked was that kid you fought in first grade
Ain't nothin' lyrical about you but your lies
So cut the shit, cause its startin to draw flies
You're played like my five-year old's newborn toys
Don't know shit about Chicago, but I could still make Illa Noyz
Like Robin Leech I display stylish ways
That's rough like my face when I haven't shaved in days
Listen up, all these words take heed
I'm sick of this, here's my final dis
Fuck you dumb niggaz you ain't shit like this

My Smith and Wessy got you layin in some alley messy
Got your family lookin' for your ass on Sally Jesse
We squash beef in the mo', when you ain't breathin no more
Leavin' your skull split like Steven Seagal
Let the cat out, flat out, Detroit's a mad house
So I don't get offended when I hear my city badmouthed
We quick to pull the gat out and set it
And leave you with more shit missin' than a Lil' Kim radio edit
Stick up kids be tryin' to live paid
You get your grill sprayed with twenty-seven bullets in your ribcage
Get the gauge, cock it back, empty your pockets, Jack
Or I'ma send you flyin like a rocketpack
Murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack
Break into your crib still your shit and lock it back
Ten-year old kids be standin on the block with gats
Just for livin' nowadays'll get you flocked with bats
Where I'm from... yaknow what'm sayin'?, that's some old Detroit shit
Y'all wouldn't know about that shit, though. Less you come
To my city, ya know what'm sayin'? See where we live,
'Cause we shine

MC's put Detroit up in they rap songs
Cause without us there careers wouldn't last long
So like a generation we've been passed on
Now it's our time to shine, put your glasses on
Got these A & R's and labels with binoculars
Lookin' in, jockin us and not jockin yours
Too many groups follow trends, unoriginal
Usin' loops that transcend every bitch in you
Don't ever try to say this is a ghost town
One million rappers in this bitch, they need to slow down
Evualute the situation, all the rest are killers
Fly hoes out on Jefferson with the drug dealers
Two years in the joint, nobody's touchin Hush
Try to say you'll put us down, but your under us
Now who the fuck are you? its just coincidental
When your rhyme your even worse than the instrumental
Your just a phone-tapper with no backbone
Talkin' shit, I got a clique that only pack chrome
Have your ass gone, nowhere to run, when we hit
Next time you'll think twice of who you fuckin' wit

There's an intruder, in my house
He cut my phone-line, can't dial out
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout
A couple o' cocktails, will send me to jail
There's a couple of cops, hot on my trail
But this time when I get pulled over, there's a Doberman Pincher
And a Pit Bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit, foolin' with me
Quit foolin' with me, bitch you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat, why it always gotta be
An issue when you're me and which you're gonna see
In the long run, I'mma be the wrong one
You wanna harass, with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass
Where was you at, last night when them assholes
Ran up on my grass, rapper slash actor
Kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bare arms
What I'm 'posed to fight wit' bare palms
Yeah right, they comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns, we as Americans
We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America and we are Americans
I make bookoo bucks, wear bookoo vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I could've been next, to fly over the cuckoo's nest
But you know who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it 50/50 on 
, it's funny
We got a buzz spreadin' quicker than making paper airplanes out of a 20
Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said, but I said precedents
In the standards, and they can't stand it
My name should've been bastard
The shit should've been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, one bastard
I'm too old to go an' cruise Gratiot, fuck that shit
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time they got the fuckin Au-to-ma-tic
Ain't no one Gon' test this Mon', clack click
We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans
Shh, I got a secret, if you can keep it between us
I tuck 2 Nina's under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my Long Johns, under my Sean Johns
When runnin' with the long arm or the long long gone
I'mma do five years no less than that, o questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gone even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' gimme my semi but I got my weed back
We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans
Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
Daddy, look what I made., dad's gotta go catch a plane
Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine.
She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya.
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying You've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone.
But baby wait, It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream Die Shady! and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
Music... Reality... Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.
But we as entertainers have a responsibility, to these kids... Psyche.
If I, were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow,
Would you feel sorrow, or show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake,
There's too much on my plate, I done came way
Too far in this game, to turn and walk away,
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground,
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryin' to smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark,
Y'all steady tryin' to drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off, lid to the can of whip ass,
Just twist me off see me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin', I'm just tryin' to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man, I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy the way we act,
When we confuse hip hop with real life when the music stops
Ain't no getting' rid of McVeigh, if so you woulda tried,
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemies'
Crib with Hennessey, got drunk then I finish he
I'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy,
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a dillinger in the dark, dilligently,
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I'll murder you, I gauge to have me turn into
A mad man, son of sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin', you think not
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops
I was happy havin' a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy, but it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dog
And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with their hands out, checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't that's the end, no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink, till your car spin
You think DAMN! When you slam into the wall, and you fall out the car
And try to crawl with one arm
I'm bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder would they even call when the music stops
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol, sippin' a can of penzoil
I'm revved up, who said what, when lead bust
Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddywagon, braggin' about how you shouted,
Like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can hurt me
Just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk, be smart
And stop tryin' to walk how G's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war with your life,
Fuck a tour and a mike, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroner's like, you hype,
Poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga you're a goner at night, when the music stops
Instigators turn pits in cages,
Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk,
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof!
Proof nigga I'ma wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hooves
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breath, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checkin' all our dues
Nigga, or make the news, betcha all y'all move
When the uzi pop you better drop, when the music stop
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused been fucked since the fifth grade
LL told me to rock the bells,
NWA said fuck the police, now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B,
Fucked up haircut, listenin' to Jodeci
Michael Jackson who gonna tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset smokin' crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
MOP had me grimy and gritty,
Marilyn Manson, I died my hair blue and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin' in shock
I'm reachin' for the glock, but the music stops...
America
We love you 
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours?
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech 
the United States Government has sworn to uphold
Or so we are told
I never would have dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I've touched, so much anger aimed
at no particular direction just sprays and sprays
Straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
Till it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought standin' in this mirror bleachin' my hair
With some Peroxide reachin' for a T shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keeps tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they sayin' I'm in trouble wit the government, I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumping it on
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 
Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
If they were brown Shady lose Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Lets do the math, if I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so fuck school I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up, I was like
Fuck it until I met Dre the only one who looked past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?
It's white America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 
See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
Till I created so much mutherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb its like this rope
Waitin' to choke tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like I don't like yes no
'Round the clock to try to stop my concerts early surely
Hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say faggot
Shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal, the poster child
The mutherfuckin' spokesman now
For white America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 
So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney!
Fuck you Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freedom of speech this divided state
Of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck You
Ha Ha Ha 
I'm just playin' America, you know I love you
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
I'm sorry there must be a mix-up
Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents
'Cause I never knew, I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun, through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screamin', Go, with their seventeen year-old uncle
I'm like, Guidance?
Ain't they got the same moms and dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make-up you allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear, hmm?
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every three months
Fucked up, after I beat her fuckin' ass every night, Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?
'Cause I never knew, I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
A couple years ago, I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Skippity-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeve
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a teach?
Er, her, him, is it you, is it them?
Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not
'Cause I never knew, I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
How the fuck was I supposed to know?
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see the bitch's hair is frizzing
Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism
The devil ain't on the level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving him an adjective an ass whooping
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs like they did something to me personally
Used to get bullied so I cut class and ditched it
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can't tell 'em apart
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-Mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin' I don't give a fuck I don't play!
Bitch you think you saw this basket first?
Your ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?
Ripped a gaping hole in it
Flipped out, ripped down the drapes
Tied them around my neck, went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face gibberish
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scale of being gay ya
Little faggot. By the way, thoughts are getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay
It's a fucking miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, sons you, like an ultra violet ray
I'm selling hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm shittin' on the competition
In the meantime it's always mean time
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I've been a career asshole
I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
And I'm coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
That cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'mma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed would have caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
It's 'cause I am don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by my wicked ways
Lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase
Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't, I need my meds I peed my bed
I'm going blind I don't see my legs I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me I need my cane
Someone help me I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind you can see my pain
Then you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut the P-I-E holes, now peep my game
Echo... Psycho on a cyclone cycle
Spiraling, here I go, I'm outta control like no
Other mic go, stab you till the knife goes dull
I'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'mma sock it to you
Dyke ho, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night so
Strike up the fucking maestro, I'm nitro
And hi ho, hand me my shovel, I'm liable to dig my hole
Deeper in, and it's off to H.E double hockey sticks I go
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Oh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God
Shit
It's a girl
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M
And lay with 18 guys naked and let myself show, let myself show...
Why do I know that voice?
Butt-fuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
- Are you fucking serious?
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then
Blow it our your ass
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Guess who's back, back, back?
Back again, gain, gain
Shady's back, back, back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, la, la, la
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, Fuck you Debbie
Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it
Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?
Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me
Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
Kids
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside

Remind yourself of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic, girl, you're the kind of girl that I can take a likin' to
Psych, I'm spikin' you like a football, been this way since I stood a foot tall

And they say that it never stikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times in three different locations on four separate occasions

What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough
If you will, to be saved not in a religious sense, 
but not to constitute what this country, at times, calls we throw away children
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station
And each generation should do a little bit better
Alright come on let's cut this bullshittin' and dub
Let's get it started let's start addressin' this issue
And open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
And this whole origin of
The music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy
The music that you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was boy on the East side of Detroit
Crossin' 8 Mile and a war and they hit territory
I'd like to share a story this is my story
And can't nobody tell it for me
I am well aware that I don't belong here
You made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked, damn they're everywhere
From Bel Air shoppin' centre just for stoppin' in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side
A day that I might slide
You may call it a pass I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious, so well known tracks
So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up they'd give me a lift up
8 Mile and Van Dyke I'd steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her momma's and charmer's
After dark to sneak me in the house
When I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof, we'd goof
He'd carry on the steps said I was bored handin' out some flyers
He was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check this out some time
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And they both had the same rhymes that soundalike
We was on that same shit, that 
 shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
My first year in 9th grade 
Can't forget that day in school 
It was cool til' your man MC Sham came through
And said that Puma's the brand 'cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors but man, goddamn they flew
Must'a been true because man we done banned they shoes,
I had the new ones, the cool J, Ice-lambs, suede too.
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they was yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X-clan debuted
With a key sissies now with this being a new trend
We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butter, would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showing 'em off
Not knowing at all we was being laughed at you ain't even half black
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flave clock we gonna have to snatch that
All I remember is meeting back at
Manix's basement, saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the x clan's tape is...
Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two time me
And there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her
But she dumped me for this black guy
And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to
The oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize, I was wrong
'Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a hoe
So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's somethin' in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors, on Dre's phantom, believe me clowns
That means suicide homie
You'll never throw me off of this course, blow me
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin' awards homie
And the balls in my court and it's lonely on top of the world
When you're the only one with the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
Remember that when they get to doggin' your boy, homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
I'm moppin' the floors with em, I keep tryin' to pass it
But they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won't be long till this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors
And no we ain't pumpkins on Halloween
But we'll show up on your porch
So be careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like im 
, let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasn't travelin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh
And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh
And I miss you, ohhh
I just miss you, ohhh
I just miss you, ohhh
And homie I'll never forget you, nooo
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit hisself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that's the best thing I can do right now, Doody for you is to rep
So im gonna fuck till I die, yeah I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mic's
'Cause the way I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothin' that I could do wrong, I'm too strong and im just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and bust it
Excuse the corny metaphor but they'll never ketchup to all this energy that I've mustard
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryin' to process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game
Pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show em, blow em out the water, slaughter 'em homes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie I know im never gonna be the same without you
I never would have came in this game, I'm goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me naw Doody you're not, layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie, I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, im so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you, I love you Doody
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh
And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh
And I miss you, ohhh
I just miss you, ohhh
I just miss you, ohhh
And homie I'll never forget you, nooo
1970 Somethin' nigga I don't sweat the date my moms was late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world the fly girls, tangeray and hennesey
Until I call earl, 10 months in this gut, wut the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild
Juvenile with the mics 'n' shit, New York New York, ready for the likes of this
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilicle cords wrapped around my neck
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out I'm bringin' mad joy
The docter looked and said he's gonna be BAD BOY
I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere
Would pac be alive, if you let pac drive
Swear to god to reverse it I give my left eye
With the right I visualized, the king of bed-stuy
Checkin' his daughter tianna into junior high
If I was in brooklyn, and B.I. was still alive, in 2006 it might sound like this
N.Y. 7-1-8 2-1-2, with sues rendevouz
It's like moulin rouge
High fashion, up town air force ones
And vasquez, puerto ricans with fat asses
Blaze dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S classes
For you bastards, catch a cab to manhattan
With that broadway actin', u hype that belly shit
Would you get you capped, and wrapped in plastic
Tell the captain, S Roge was happennin'
Out here nor speak no evil, inside the magnum
I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time
Now I'm 13 smokin' blunts, makin' green
On the drug scene, fuck the football team
Risk it, rupt ur spleens, by the age of 16
Hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my doe up
So school I didn't show up, and fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! I couldn't see it
Scarface king of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got encarcerated, kinda scary
See 74' march 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn were did I fail
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail
I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere
What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue?
You cut that hooker off and find someone new
Uh-huh, uh, uh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin', took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you would do the right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boom coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin' in My Room
Pissy drunk listenin to the Stylistic tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin' 'bout the old days
My nigga's like, Fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, did she beep you? Don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
You'll be all fuckin' tonight
What do ya do when your man is untrue?
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?
I need another man, in my life
Mmm, uh, uh!
Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the hoe
Nigga pack ya shit, you out the do', oh
What about the fight in the Mirage?
I seen ya Benz, parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was ya friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures
Scalin fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin ya heat in the passenger seat
Of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary-eyed, damn a bitch schemin
Girls steady screamin, Kim you need to leave him!
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin' 'bout the bitches I fought
Over you, you can have the shit you bought
And fuck you, using is my last resort
You see nine outta ten niggaz, ain't shit
One outta five niggaz suck a dick
Ya mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canapé
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked ya dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uh, why go from first class to coach?
Yo
C-Gutta where you at?
D Rockafella
Caesar Leo Degenero
Bled C
Money SL
Uh...
B.I.G. is making this cream
Bitches always say what the hell does that mean?
B is for the bitches, who can't understand
How one fly nigga became a man
I is for the way it goes in and out
One by one I knocks 'em out
G is for the way the game goes in the gutter
Other MC's man they ain't sayin' nothin'
Rockin' on, to the break of dawn
Make the bitch give the pussy get the mouth I'm gone
What?
It ain't no more to it
Ladies and Gentlemen
We're gonna ask you for some fanfare... the band fanfare because... ladies and gentlemen... sting has always gone ahead of itself.
They have done it again and again and again.
I remember the year they brought in the fat boys they were hotter then ten thousand fire sides.
And if you know... and if you enjoy hip-hop... if you want one of the coldest brothaz out of North America... a brotha that gave you a song like
Juicy...
You hear a crew in Jamaica with something that goes like this

Beef is when I see you guaranteed to be a ICU, check it

Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow they shot 'em in their cars

In the flames I burn for my niggaz that's gone
And the niggaz that took the hits on my niggaz you been warned
P's not the one, Hav not the one
You try to run up on us
We already bustin' the guns
All I got is heat and tough talk for you
Tie you up, cut your balls off just for you
Think good thoughts, die while your skin start to glisten
It's bad 'cause I just begun
Attention MCs... Attention MCs
Beef doesn't happen on records
Beef does not happen on records
You don't want no beef you fuckin' fake studio ass gangsta
Beef is every so-called ghetto superstar that rose

But it's gettin' kinda late, and I cain't wait
Bitch fuck a first date

Then she noticed the limp and the whip

Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies?
The back of the club sipping Moët is where you'll find me
The back of the club, macking hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question asking, blunt passing, music blasting, but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep wit'
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fucking players
Jump in the Rover and come over, tell your friends jump in the GS3
I got the chronic by the tree
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
To the honies getting money playing niggas like dummies
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby, baby
Straight up honey really I'm asking
Most of these niggas think they be macking, but they be acting
Who they attracting with that line, What's your name, what's your sign?
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few we gon' do
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the Jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
To the honies getting money playing niggas like dummies
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby, baby
Givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream, fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote Gats strapped with infrared beams
Chopping O's, smoking la in Optimos
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend
Honey, check it
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?
Is that aight with you?

Coward niggaz, most are buried down south
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies
Niggaz bearly speak when we discuss money

The realest niggaz never took nothin' from me
Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggaz that got drunk, and hate kids
Got niggaz on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix

You love him, yell his name...

Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for...
Mafia
Representin Bucktown
Mack 11's cocked back, niggaz better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earings, you know the drama Biggie bring
For BIG I learn to grip aim and cock it
Once I got it, I lock it
Banger, big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antartic
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hit
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spread things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga ill's holdin' it down for the beam
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name
For BIG I grip the cig, put six in your wig
Not cause of what he said, cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and that's the way it is for...
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jokes with police scanners, niggaz mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggaz that wear bandanas and rep...
We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel
B.K. style, see BIG howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world
Niggaz nothin' but squirels, they know we rep...
Niggaz tryin' to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut
Wood style roll'em up, get plucked, nigga what
Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths
Know my gat and bust for my nigga...
Now when I cock back and squeeze, my Desert E'z
Make you drop to your knees, barly able to breathe
My bullets move in threes, one for Brook-lyn
One for Mafia so take that, Uh, and this one's for...

Mink dragon, seven figures in my bank account

It was just comin' out like a motherfucker
The nigga amped be like COME ON, COME ON MOTHERFUCKER!
Come on motherfuckers, come on
Man what you fuck doin' over here?
Are you awake now?
Hell yah I'm awake man;
Now tell me what the fuck is goin' on here
Looks like the competition stopped by
To pay us a little visit, and check us out
Let's go deep into the phrase, beautiful sunrays
Off the baldhead, everything is real
Biggie me put on this joint so I'ma be the big wheel
Watch it Slim, hey Dad, place yo' bet on seven
Peace to one-oh-six, one-oh-eight, one-to-the-hundred-eleventh
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With 22's in your shoes, yo keep the shank ready
Uh well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat
Release the BRAINSTORM, to make your motherfuckin BRAIN WARM
A strange form, somethin' kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well In God We Trust, guns I bust
Got that disgustin, sewer style dumpin
Do you like the things that I bring?
Take the beatdown we fuckin' givin', c'mon motherfucker
What? Niggaz want drama, puttin' work on my block
When I told y'all last week, that shit was too hot
Sellin pieces and treys, cuts my dimes
Somebody gon' get paid, somebody block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as y'all run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo Biggie tell these niggaz I'ma hit 'em where it hurts
The big city it don't spare no bodies
Call me papichulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or fo' stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey yo money that's yo' stock, yo Bigs pass the glock
I'ma tell him it can happen, don't play me with that rap shit
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel
Uh
I got seven Mac-11's, about eight, .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's, the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot glocks
HAH, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the landspread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give emcees the runs drippin;
When I throw my clip in the A.K., I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable
Peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the llello
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jailcells
Oh my God I'm droppin' shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
'Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fuckin' shit spill
And I'm talkin' bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
'Cause I got mo' shots to pop-ya
Big Pop-pa, breakin you off somethin' proper
Signin off is the hardcore rap singer
A.k.a. crack slinger, bring it anytime nigga
Yeah, ninety-six, for my Nordstrom Ave niggaz
Dangerous MC's...
Diamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Ooh-wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness
Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is...
Y'all niggaz know the rules
I blast on niggaz so --
-- My fist never bruise
Land-still-cruise, Frank White paid his dues
Ask who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie
Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted
Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your shit it, just ain't got that LOUD
Gold tooth shine like TA-DOW!
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, frays raise your eyebrow
By now you figure, he talkin' bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead led to dumpin
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jokes turn to flinches
C'mon, yo, throw your hands c'mon
Bitch grab your tits c'mon
Let me know you in the spot
Bump your fists, c'mon
Thugs tote yo' shit
We bout to get mo' rich, c'mon
Let's blow the club, c'mon
Fuck the place up, c'mon
Shake yo' nasty ass
And make it swing all around, c'mon
Yo, make this money
Throw yo' loot on the ground, c'mon
Bounce in your whips, c'mon
Bitch lick yo' lips, c'mon
Dangerous MC's
My nigga this be the shit, c'mon
Dangerous MC's
My nigga this be the shit, c'mon
Uh-huh, make money hand over fist
The bo-vines roam where chickenhearts don't exist
Settin up shop, it's hands on in the hustle
Fakes don't kill nuttin but time and don't tussle
The process of elimination, fresh rotation
Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory
The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand
Everything you can imagine is real man
And revenge be the dish I serve to cats cold
Stay up on about ten folds, you know how it goes
You know the streets and it's real as shit, c'mon
Niggaz grab your dicks, c'mon
Bitches rub your tits, c'mon
Awww nah, big Snoop Dogg
Slap you with my paw, all across your jaw
Break fool on these bitches while I'm breakin the law
You come up in my room look bitch you takin' it off
Follow me, I slip 'em slide 'em rip 'em ride 'em provide em
With that West coast G shit, L.B.C. shit
We dips to this, make chips to this
My, Eastside lifestyle is way foul, move the crowd
Point a pistol at you bitch niggas, BLA-DOW
You got stuck and fucked, Doggystyle
100 spokes Day-tonas, bendin the corner
All up in Crooklyn, bad bitches are lookin'
So you lovin' us so much this shit is bleedin through you
If I worked in a restaurant
I'd shit in the food and feed it to you
Most of my niggaz cuckoo, easy to gas to shoot you
Even all of them Haitian niggaz
Won't believe this voodoo
Can yo' pussy be chaka, don't let me speak in pat-ois
And kick you in your face like we playin' a game of soc-cer
I love to cock the glock-a, stack up on loot and vod-ka
And fuck your crew because all of y'all niggaz full of ca-ca
The way we doin' damage tell me how the FUCK you manage
With my niggaz who marinate on foul thoughts and think savage
Them niggaz'll throw you in a manhole
And push they hand in yo' ass
And pull yo' head right out yo' asshole!
Parkay nigga we rugged all day nigga
You ready to fuck bitch? Fuck the foreplay nigga
This me for all consumers, my nigga FUCK the rumors
Three in the worst way of pure coke for all you DRUG ABUSERS
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah...
B.I.G. 2000 Born Again... c'mon...
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace... smack the bitch in the face;
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins till amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was Humpin Around and Jump-in Around
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, B-I-G
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya till you're gushy, so please don't push... me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?
Human sacrifices, cannibalism; candles and exorcism
Animals having sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fucking, meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lying, I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dying to cock him
Who's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, red on the third;
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin' so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble;
In the everyday struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge I'ma mold 'er now
Trick a little dough buyin young girls fringes
Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein syringes
In the veins; hard to explain, how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin line
I had the first and the third; rehearse that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no! Even though they had me scared
Yo they got a eight, I gotta teck with air holes...
And that's just how the shit go in the struggle motherfucker
Hah... c'mon... what you say?
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
Uh, uh
Now when I'm fucking off gin, I'm invincible
Don't love no hoe, that's my principle
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen, I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One hoe said, Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?
Thug nigga until the end, tell a friend bitch
'Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend bitch
And you know that ain't right
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-Tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit
Look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
Uh, now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
Woman moaning, uh, yeah, uh, ooh, oh yeah, mmm, yeah

To ya back, then ya shiverin,' tongue deliverin'
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin' in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to your mother's bed
Not the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian

A Big Pun and B.I.G. collabo
That shit would've been incredible
Aye yaknahmsayin, it was just happen
We have our day, you know?
I seen him, I seen him, I seen him at the pearly gates, yaknahmean?
We keep it, keep it, keep it going from there
Uh, I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set up
Shoulda pushed 'em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Uh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin BASTARD
Cryin, know my friends is lyin'
Y'all know who killed 'em filled 'em with the lugars from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin' ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Apoligies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still
Nigga still gotta get his grind on
Come get introduced to my home
I grew up in the crime zone
Soon as you grown, you on your own, you keep your strap
You keep your chrome cause the streets is chilly
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my home
A nigga grew up in the pro-jects, end up gettin' mo' stressed
Mo' money, mo' drama you know a nigga keep his armor
Cause the streets are killin'
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my home
Yo, yo
The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me till I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
And rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggaz talk but they babble 'cause they ain't sayin' nuttin
If ain't blazin' somethin' with the mac I'm in the shack bakin muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin; my Squad been waitin
For the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin
An orgi-nation of veterans built
With genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills
Invest in the real, don't get left in the hills
My tech and my steel turn your whole crew into vega-ta-bills
We blessed with the will to never surrender
Cause my every agenda's in and out, unseen like I entered the ninja
It's my world
I got that new F-N, call it that faggot nigga gun
Couple of hollow tips make you faggot niggaz run
Crack pull up, everybody clear out
Anybody pumpin that rock is gettin' aired out
I'm in that caddy with my bitch in the pack
Your mommy got a body but she itchin to clap
And I know you pitchin purple but we switchin the packs
Listen, don't make me hurt you I'm just givin' the facts
On that I 9-5 swirvin to a town near you
My niggaz watch out for that Black Surburbans
And no it's not the Feds, man papi's home
And papi got it good, he could put you on
Listen, I done made abandoned blocks look hot
Nine to ten Benzes, a couple of drops
Couple of rubber bands from the corrupt cops
Just to see my niggaz eat and shit and huggin the blocks
Crack a chestize 'em, right besides 'em
In front of a hundred million viewers, shouldn't surprise 'em
We from the Bronx where the may-ors lift up
And niggaz get shot in broad day 'cause we don't give a...
Fuck little niggaz on bike and just shoot you
All for a pair of some Nikes, the shits brutal
I done seen fiends O.D., shot the wrong pack
Then they call the shit the bomb smack
Word to Crack, the god body, the hard body, the realest ever
The John Gotti, this rap shit, will it kill me? Never
This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team-and
Be Mor-gan than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces
Fuck the screwfaces, 'cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggaz can't bang with us, try to do me
To old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
In killin' wives and grandmothers, who ya trustin, shit
When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin' ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin' broads home
On the phone with the chip, with these Cristal chicks
Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit
Yeah
Motherfuckers better know
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls
Huh, yeah
My man Inf left a Tec and a nine at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a bid
A one to three, he be home the end of '93
Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed, yo, Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat, the Tec is to his back
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same .45
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing, it's so hard
Yes love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 mom pendant
I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
'Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at?
When he's sticking you and taking all of your money
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
'Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug
.357 slug and my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckas better strip, yeah nigga, peel
Before you find out how blue steel feel
From the Beretta, putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckas can't stop it
Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her doorknockers
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
When he's sticking you and taking all your money
Man listen, all this walking is hurting my feet
Ooh money looks sweet
Man, I'll throw him in the beam, you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar
Yo chill shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot
Be cool, fool, they ain't gonna roll up
All they want is fucking doughnuts
So why the fuck he keep looking?
I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass 'cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots 'cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot
Take that motherfuckers
When the lala hits ya lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that ya hat can't fit ya
Either I'm witcha or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
Talkin' to the rap inventor
Nigga wit the game tight, Bic that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, Double-G, I-E
Iced out lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Gettin' head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women, and the weed -- sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the Hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad 'cause I got my dick sucked
And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
It's the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Recognize a real Don when you see Juan/one
Sippin on booze in the House of Blues
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali
If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breasts in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggaz is a mess
Thinkin' I'm gon stop, givin' L.A. props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
People start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G.
Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's
If I wanna squirt her, take her to Fatburger
Spend about a week on Venice Beach
Sippin Crist-o, with some freaks from Frisco
Cali got gunplay, models on the runway
Scream Biggie Biggie gimme One More Chance
I be whippin on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light, I'm set tonight
Paid a visit to Versace stores
Bet she suck until I ain't got no more, only in L.A.
Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck yo' man
Fuck your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State?
Almost gold, 5 G's at show gate
Or do you wanna see about seven digits
Fuck hoes exquisite, Cali, great place to visit
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
I reach my peak, I can't speak,
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts
Yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits
No time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes I thought you know I'm smooth as a babies ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn born Teflon don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah y'all a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in they drawers
For the burner, catch a body
I got styles like karate
Jujitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe
Hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self, from Brooklyn, where else
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I'll rip your troop
Not even Lois Lnae could get the scoop
What you think I'm stupid
My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep
I throw a bomb through you window
Burn you up and your hoe
I catch your mama going to therapy
And cut her throat
You lil' sister walking home from school
I abduct her, then I fuck her
I hit ya park close up with the Louisville Slugger
BGeezy is the hustla, ignorant motherfucker
I was taught how to bust heads by the best head busters
Cluckers, you know I got'em 2 for 1 my nigga
I'm on V.L. if you want me, get some my nigga, come on
Thuggin' is my thing, if I'm beefing I'm banginhg
Slanging, it's in my nature, gotta be about my paper
Haters, I don't like'em, bitches, I don't trust'em
Niggas, I can't stand'em, I creep down and pluck'em
Strap say in my hand, I gotta protect mine
Niggas trying to pull it off, pop goes the nine
That's how it gotta be in these uptown streets
And a nigga like me, I play the game for keep
I remember when niggaz slang heroin up in balloons
I paid attention to everything, from killings to cartoons
Got a picture of Malcolm X on the wall in my room Bitch
On some ol' nigga fuck wit me I'ma do 'em shit
Nigga give me dope, I accept it, but don't respect him
Put my foot in they rectum right after I dome check 'em
I be popping D, smoking weed, and full of that Hennesey
Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gone mention me
I been out doing it for years, since elementary
Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consist of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit 'cause I don't fuck with scrubs
I don't need you harassing me when I'm up in the club
Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub
Quarter, ki's, and halfs is what I sling, cause that's what I love
I know you bitches know that I ain't to be played with
Don't have no picks and chooses who get they head split
They die quick, fuckin' with Turk, wodie get whacked
Spend a bin with Kevin and Randy leave ya flat on you back
And trust that, ain't bout to let no nigga steal me
Fuck that, I bust back with 223
Big and full of that raw with no cut and be ready to creep
Innocent people move 'cause somebody fix'n to get split
Na, Na, it's iceberg shorty, Lordy have mercy
Come from under my shirts and flip'em and reverse'em
I'm coming so alert them
You haven't seen the worst and
I'm right near you and my gun blast quick, dog
Could kill you so run, dash, get gone
Wodies movin slow around this time they got bricks dog

Model bitchs wonderin if I'ma fuck wit her, she noe I treat my bitches like gavana
Dolce and gabana drippin, big poppa neva slippin
H class diamonds shining, dinner with wifey whining, dining
Smokin' cigars and bolbatar with columbian niggas named panama and engrigay and shit
Games we play life envy, bitches need 2 ova with ease 4 a pam of skinote jeans
I got my carrot tank top I got your banked stopped, sofa's on top
Benjamins under the rest of them
Advancing from duplex 2 mansion
Staching keys, hiding g's ova seas, vcr's in my beat
Game on my, money I make into stocks and real estate bitch
Trip skiing in the Caribbean, white sand discusing plans with my man
Dark blue land, smoke tint, crome rims
And a system that leave my rear views trembling
Whatchu gone do wen poppa catch your attitude
Drop 2 your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my ring it's a fred white thing

Akon all sunshine, in this elevated world of mine

Then I heard her moan, honey I'm home!
Yep, tote chrome for situations like this

Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will doe, I probably chill doe
Even though situation lookin' kinda ill yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga comin' off some love potion shit
Flash the heat on em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, Don't blast here's the stash,
A hundred cash just don't shoot my ass, please!
Nigga pullin mad G's out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggaz on the cell
Bring some weed I got a story to tell, uh...
Yo man, y'all niggaz ain't gonna believe what the fuck happened to me.
Remember that bitch I left the club with man? Yo, freaky yo. I'm up in
This bitch playa this bitch fuckin' run them ol mink ass niggaz and shit,

Spot. Had me scared, had me scared, I was shook Daddy - but I forget I
Had my Roscoe on me. Always. You know how we do. So anyway the nigga
Comes up the stairs, he creepin' up the steps, the bitch all shook she
Sends the nigga back downstairs to get some drinks and shit. She gettin'
Mad nervous, I said fuck that man! I'm the nigga, you know how we do it
Nigga, ransom note style put the scarf around my motherfuckin face,
Gagged that bitch up, played the kizzack. Soon this nigga comes up in
The spot, flash the Desert in his face he drops the glass. Looked like
The nigga pissed on his-self or somethin', word to mother! Ah fuckit

We push the hottest v's, peel fast
Through the city, play monopoly with real cash
Me and biggie and the models be shaking they sadiddy ass
And prada be, somethin' you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Bein broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and paisan
Scope the spot out, see somethin' nice and I'm gone
You cats is home, screamin the fights on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin ty-son
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playin' right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
At any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it? now make dollars
Cats pop bottles bone chicks that favor Idalis
And rack up frequent flight mileage
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I'm poppin' magnums while jigga bag somethin'
Watch is platinum, got jet lag from
Flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes
Make the best c.d.'s and the best tapes
Don't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals
Biggie be richie like lionel, shit
You seen the Jesus, dipped to h classes
Ice project off lights, chick flashes
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in big mustaches
Rock top fashions
Ain't shit changed, except the number after the dot
On the range, way niggaz look at me now, kinda strange
I hate y'all too
Rather be in Caribbean sounds with rachel
It's unreal, out the blue frank white got sex appeal
Bitches used to go, ewww!
Still tote steel, tryin' to see five mil
Off the sin-gle, for real
You ain't fazin the amazin
While your guns raisin, mine is blazin'
See you on see me all talkin' to sweetness
Take it for weakness and leave quick
Blocka, roc-a-fella, bad boy collabo
I love the dough, more than you know'
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
Miracu-lous, pockets stay full
Niggas skip the bull 'cause we matadors
Snatch the p-89's that we pack in the drawers
And we, clap doors in your acuras
Snap like, cameras on amateurs
Make you all dance, hold the hammer to yours
Jig and big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
Play the charts like the beatles, y'all adapt you lost
And toast cristal on behalf y'all
Too bad for y'all, ain't too many as bad as yours
Truly, do we, we laugh at y'all
Little bastards y'all
Uh, uh
We hit makers with acres
Roll shakers in vegas, you can't break us
Lost chips on lakers, gassed off shaq
Country house, tennis courts and horseback
Ridin' decidin crack crab or lobster?
Who say mobsters don't prosper
Niggaz is actors, niggaz deserve oscars
Me I'm, critically acclaimed, slug past your brain
Reminisce on dames who, coochie used to stink
When we rocked house pieces and puffy gucci links
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
Tito smile every time he see our faces
Cases catch more than outfield-ers
Half these rappin' cats, ain't seen war
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame
Speak my name, I make 'em dash like dame
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
Woo! There's gonna be a lot of punchin in this motherfucker
Y'all better be swift with that punch button Jack
Biggie... Biggie...
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin' so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
Come and run with me ... I really wanna show you
How I run the streets ... I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin G's ... I really wanna show you
Come and run with me ... I really wanna show you
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble;
In the everyday struggle
I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
Guns and diamonds
Bitches put they tongues where the sun ain't shinin
Take ki's till they spot us, snakes flee with consignment
This kid he got his krib rated, police found grams
They locked up, his whole fam; moms sister his old man
Nigga bailed his moms out, then he told on his man
Now they home, actin' like nuttin wrong, hustlin again
He tried to be the next Frank White, and Escobar
Pickin' up coke a fiend holds it in a separate car
Cooks it up till it's bright white, cut it tight right
Then he slings it to the fiends, lookin' like Fright Night
Coppin the motorbikes, the scooters, countin' dough on computers
High technology dealers, to the users and losers
Half-leg DiDi, try to swap drug for TV's
Stores run out of baking soda from BK to QB
My niggaz die for the cause, .45 on the drawer
City laws made by Big Nas and Biggie Smalls
Bitches, holdin' my weight in they titties and drawers
My bitches out of state get bust while they pushin my cars
Callin me up, callin me baller, call for they cut
Pretty hoes bring me my cash, swallow all of this nut
Seats on the Bent' stay nasty, push the dash
For the stash box is where the cash be; watchin for task force
'Cause I know they comin' but I'm reachin' my goal
Fuck bummin, I'm makin' sure I leave this whole game wit somethin'
Crib in West Palms for my dime, crib for my moms
Ridiculous, you lookin' at the next Nicholas Barnes, baby
R.I.P Big
We some niggaz that's gonna make you proud of this game
Let's Ride
Mad trees and bitches in dungarees
The city under seas, kitchen 100 degrees
I love that summer breeze, I'll stand in it until it freeze
I'm from another breed, them sss, southern g's
I sip phemetrazine, I lean, I stand tall
I'm mean, I'm mad raw, I'm coming like fastball
Steee-rike, Yup, so get it right
Nigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife
In a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat schwork
So be smart and play your own part
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell
Hey, I'ma shoot it out if I'm facing the ail
Yeah, so tell your girl to come and make me rich
Weezy Baby nigga, 9 to 5, 10 to 6
All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, It'd be your life before my life
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
It's showdown time, throwdown time
Same d-off, four pound time
Clack Clack, go get yours, I'll go get mine
Check it man, I'm wit whatever
Goodness gracious the paper
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
I'll blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me
You got nothing on a nigga like me, you'll see
I'm on the grind from sun up to sun down
If I'm lying, may lightning come down and strike me right now
I'll turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred
Keep it coming till I'm full on my stomach
I'm stuck in my ways, I'm stuck puffing my hase
Hand on my pistol, front of it sprays
I'm stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga
Trying to get rid of the life, all right?
Uh... UHH
Yeah...
Uh... uh...
Uh! Yeah... yeah...
Uh...
I'm on...
Fuck em... yeah, uh...
With my hands gripped... praise the Lord shit
Fuck her, never knew her
Our father... uh-huh...
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
Uh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake
With my hands gripped... praise the Lord shit
Our father... if I should die before I wake
Fluck that
Snap a nigga shit, smash him with the fifth, watch his body lift
Shut his hottie's lips, bitch screamin, hit her body quick
Got me like the trifest not knowin' how my life is
My life is, rap sheet long as the Turnpike
The sheistest, hey fella, who bidded with the lifers
Did it with the glocks, spit it witcha pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher; mad you can't be like us
Some murderers who turn bikers -- see Biggie Smalls
Recruited these snipers -- alumni do it just like us
Some pied pipers, squeezin life out y'all
It's all out war, be all wild as all outdoor
If a coward got beef, y'all be checkin' his palm
Paralyzin my niggaz thorough kid, how bout yours?
Real quick to screw a nigga then, hop out four
Clean the wipers, hit the party up and, hop out yours
Bitch nigga... whoa...
Yo when you fuckin' wit Mac, you fuckin' wit the best
Still wall to wall with them dusty Tecs
Man you know how I handle my shit, S.K. can on my shit
Jump out of vans like Hannibal Smith
Man I spit a thousand rounds, your squad don't need it
Shredders in a riot pump leave you quadriplegic
When I squeeze don't breathe keep it lined and even
So when niggaz get hit, they be cryin screamin
Lyin' bleedin -- from that iron steamin
And I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit, I ain't mean it
Niggaz start bitchin, when that pistol in they face
Or I sick two puts to come and get you in your place
If I catch you in my shit, I'm wakin' my bitch
Hear take this shit, crackin' the brick, facin that shit
Takin' two sniffs, grabbin my shit
Best believe if I get hit, y'all niggaz takin' some shit
Picture niggaz takin' my shit
Niggaz never thought they'd see Cube and Biggie
In the year 2000, all drunk and pissy
Off whiskey, you can miss me, actin' gay
He's the King of New York, I'm the King of L.A.
Doin' it the O.G. way; it's sorta like
The Brooklyn Way, it's just the crook in me
So this is dedicated to the memory of
The Notorious One, the glorious one
And if you go for your gun, I got to go for mine
Cock my nine, and separate yo' head from yo' spine
So, Grab yo' dicks if you love hip-hop and
Fuck you niggaz that shot Big Pop'
The conspiracy, of this nation, for assassination
Of the young black male in this black hell
And I can tell, no matter the weather
That you and Tupac got yo' shit together
California Love
Push
C'mon Shorty, stay push, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, push, it's almost there
One more time, c'mon
C'mon push baby, one more time
Harder, harder, push harder
Push, push, c'mon
One more time, here it goes
I see the head
C'mon
Yeah, yeah
You did it baby, yeah
A hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Goddamnit Voletta, what the fuck are you doin'?
I just saw Ms. Jersey, he told me he caught the motherfuckin' boy and chopped him
You can't control that guy, I don't know what the fuck to do with that boy
Bitch, what I say, I'mma send his motherfuckin' ass to a group home goddamnit, what?
Gizmo's cuttin', up for thee
Suckers that's, down with me
Yes, yes, motherfucker, motherfuckin' right, nigga yes
Nigga it's '87 nigga, is you dead broke?
Motherfucker is you broke motherfucker?
We need to get some motherfuckin' paper nigga
My moms don't give me shit nigga, it's time to get paid nigga
Is you with me? Motherfuck, is you with me?
All right then nigga lets make it happen then
All you motherfuckers get on the fuckin' floor
Chill, give me all your motherfuckin' money
Give me all your motherfuckin' money, I want the jewelry
Give me every fuckin' thing
Nigga, give me your jewelry, give me your wallet
Fuck you bitch, get up off that shit
What the fuck you holdin' on to that shit for bitch?
Let me walk you to the door
Heh, c'mon man, what kind of fuckin' question is that man?
Tryin' to get the fuck up out this joint dog
Go head man, what the fuck is you hollerin' about?
You won't see me up in this motherfucker no more
I got big plans nigga, big plans, hahahahaha
It has been, it has been, it has been
It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead {what?}
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money power respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself goin' out as a hero {uh}
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many Biggie backed off of {ha ha ha}
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
To see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest {uh-huh}
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it
Since B.I.B. taught us niggaz to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious {what?}
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencin the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin', goin' through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life {yeah}
Palmin that forty-five, plottin to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh? {uh-huh}
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I.
I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passin {what?}
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace...
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother...
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back {yeah}
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin' God bless
Regardless to critics yellin' that East/West
I seen the game losin, I'm just pressin the reset {uh}
And when the resurrection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally!
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga!
Fuck all y'all, hoes
Get a grip motherfucker
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothing
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustling in front of
That called the police on me
When I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm saying
It's all good baby baby
It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock till my tape popped
Smoking weed and Bambu, sipping on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alizé keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Putting 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh... and if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more public housing
Thinking back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all
...And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
As I sit back relax
Puff a blunt/sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail
For fuckin' Patti Labelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly
Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a miniute what about my honey Mary
The jeans they fittin like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses
Ima show ya who the boss of intercourse is
Sex I'm takin' no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. wit telepathy
The recipe of picture hardcore wit a gun
Pimpin' ain't easy but it's always fun
When I bust my nut
I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun
Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch
I'm jus playin/know what I'm sayin'
I'll put Chante Moore pussy in stitches
I'll fuck Rupaul...
Before I fuck them ugly ass X-scape bitches
You can 76 the 69... try 68
Did Raven Simone called date rape
Only 'cause I'm paid/I'm fuckin' all of Jade
And my DJ Zhane she likes it when they say
Everybody... move your body
Got Whitney Houson boostin from Bobby
As I bus your cherry yo face lookin' scarry
Backshots to Chaka... I know that pussy hairry
Sade... ooh I know that pussy tight
Spiked Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
Smoke the bones/me gettin' them red
I'm doin' all of dem
Jimmy hats for Patra
I'm usin' all of them
If that bitch give me action...
Guaranteed Satisfaction
...Outro of Biggie talkin'
Its Bad Boy bitch
Scram Jones... the Clipse... B.I.G.
Let's go
Niggaz in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all
Do you know where your going too
Just a memory... everybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK
May you rest in peace
Your nobody till somebody kills you
Do you know where your goin' too
Just a memory... so you better pack a pistol
Everybody dying, death controls y'all
Your nobody till somebody kills you
Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows
My back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk
Spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggaz, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamour that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
On the flipside, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing
Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was laudering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She damn near sent me to my room
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uh
Biggie Duets...
Born Again...
Life After Death...
Legacy lives on... and on, and on
These motherfuckers still can't see you BIG
Shit you ain't even here...
Motherfuckers better step their game up...
Greatest of all time, Greatest of all time!
Motherfuckers...
We're here on Bad Boy television, and I'm Trevin Jones
And I've been conversing with the Mad Rapper.
And quite frankly -- he's very mad.
We're gonna TRY to find out why; so we'll take some questions
At this point from our studio audience.
Yes ma'am, please stand and state your name, and where you're from.
Hi, my name is Shay, and I'm from New Rochelle
You wanna know why, yo first of all, yo first of all you can't
Be askin me no question knowhatI'msayin who the fuck is you?

Hot cars, yunusayin? They got bitches, they got all that shit.

That's my word. Yunusayin? I'm makin' records I ain't made no money

More John Blaze than that! I got John Blaze shit. And they not
Recognizing, they not sayin' I recognize. And fuck is that, who
Is you to be askin me questions, youknowhatI'msayin? Who is you?
This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you, and you
Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon Don-Dadda, fuck Poppa
You got ta, call me, Francis M.H. White
In tank-light totes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low, and keep firin
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip, on that cat with that grip on rap
The mo shady, Tell em!, Frankie baby
Ain't no tellin' where I may be
May see me in D.C. at Howard Homecomin
With my man Capone, dumbin, fuckin' somethin'
You should know my steelo
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen befo'
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious
Penis, before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better get, who sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than Great Adventure
Biggie, How are you gonna do it?
Kick in the door, wavin the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
On ya mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get, when ya marked with death
Should I start your breath should I let you die
In fear you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically, I'm worser, don't front the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I punish em, I'm done with them
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got cum in them, 'cause they, nothin' but dicks
Tryin' to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro rock diamonds, that's sick
Got pay off my flow, rhyme with my own click
Take trips to Cairo, layin with yo bitch
I know you prayin' you was rich, fuckin' prick
When I see ya I'ma
This goes out for those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on the King of NY
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
Now ya Braille in it, stash that light shit, or scalin it
Conscience of ya nonsense in eighty-eight
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson
Tote steel like Bronson, vigilante
You wanna get on son, you need to ask me
Ain't no other king in this rap thing
They siblings, nothing but my chil'ren
One shot, they disappearin
Its ill when, MC's used to be on cruddy shit
Took home, Ready to Die, listened, studied shit
Now they on some money shit, successful out the blue
They light weight, fragilly, my nine milly
Make the white shake, that's why my money never funny
Can I live till my last day
Hittin honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Yo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The Lox get
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit
Lox and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, see Luciano put the burners
To all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'all
You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a French kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kicked the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam the flow is forbidd-en
Either you ridin' or you dyin' 'cause we swingin' iron
Lox and Poppa, turning niggaz into Jim Hoffa
Who gon stop us, it's your last joint double copper
You gettin' money or your runnin' from the Feds
Ain't nothin' over here but sixteen and one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggaz out there got a problem this year
Before you think of keepin' me down, heatin me down
The flow like water get deepe and you drown
With no soul, many niggaz roll with no dough
Even the small Dunn got a little black hole
Your destiny is somethin' you can never figure out
Niggaz is never happy till there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to play in this?
A lot are dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it got money you better get with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes divides, when dreams collide
Teams provide, war for the street to absorb
Stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind dove'll fall in love with a whore
Uh, uh, uh
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert Ease make MC's freeze
You wakin' up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
Realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
I be the mob fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
My first LP, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
Collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin' promos
Break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shined to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need for mo'
To my motherfuckin man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man
Inject a tall can in his bloodstream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
MC provoker, chocolate thai smoker HEAR??
I like to max in Maximas and Acuras
Your girl buttcheeks I'm smackin HER
The raw rapper, spine snapper
With the little hookers on my lap-ah
You know the flavor Mack-ah
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin' comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin' her
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her
If she tried to front, then I drop the Chucky Booker on her
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggaz on that real bloodspill shit
My rap-pin tac-tics are drastic
Stretchin motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my pedigreeeee
You better be, filled with energy, niggaz never gettin' me
So let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Hah, Ah HAH
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Yeah, yo
Asked me the reason, and I said loot
Man that's all I'm here for, therefore
When death declares war, you know what to prepare for
Shit, one for shelter, book flights on Delta
Live on your station, the radiation'll melt ya
Cool - I guess your momma raised a fool
You didn't wanna blaze your tool shoulda stayed in school
Rap terror, shots through your new era
Get it together, y'all niggaz shoulda knew better
I'm on point like acupuncture
I might, track and hunt ya, smack and punch ya
Left side, right side, witcha hoe I might slide
Runnin' wit this big guy, y'all niggaz is pranksters
Don't make a nigga have to show you the pound
And show you the sound, that'll put you low in the ground
Just let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
I be like WHAAAAT? Let me clear my throat
Break the smoke, Missy gotta hit some high notes
HEYYYYYY! Yo from coast to coast I burn like toast
So dope that I floats through snow nig-guh
Oh, you don't wanna bow to me
The agony be like, Somebody help me please!
Feel my pressure, never could a bitch flow better
In any weather, I'm Biggie bangin' ya nigga
Ah-huh, I used to be the chick to lick the lollipop
Now I pop through your body parts
BLAOW, BLAOW, you like the way I interact
Proceed to smack, any MC that's wack

Give it to me, Oh, send it to me, Oh
But before I get down, where's my money?

Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Bringin' it live to you bitch ass niggaz
Previously, on Ready to Die
... Me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Cheek, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin
Damn... we was spose to rule the world baby
We was unstoppable!
The shit can't be over, no
The shit can't be over man
I know you hear me nigga
I know you hear me
You got too much livin' to do
Too much unfinished business
It ain't over
Live your life
Welcome to the house of pain, Just Blaze niggaz
There's no way out, it seems I can't get free
Sombody tell me what's happenin' to me
The country bud got me chokin
I'm on a mission to the point motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yeah that sick nigga Biggie wit the H-shot fifth
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that killin' is thrillin
All the blood spillin, is all a part of drug dealin'
A broad gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug
So when he lit shots
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the Mac .11's swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain
I'm livin' in a house of pain
Is anybody listenin and tell me can you can see this God be surroundin me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin' hard to breathe
And it's gettin' blury, I'm gettin' worried 'cause it's gettin' hard to see
When your living in the house of paaaiiinnn
When the motherfucker dust kicker, who can you trust?
Who gave you the heart to see a nigga?
Before you bust, my name is spoken on the tongue so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the blocks and I ain't even go
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame
From doin' fix to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock niggaz on my block
Jealous ass suckers got it duckin for my fuckin' glock
And bustin' niggaz ass is to stay alive
Skinny ass playa watchin victim motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin' how I'm a hustler?
Buckin busters till they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggaz got they AK's headin for the bird
Aimin at free ass bitches let 'em rain
Givin' 'em, wettin 'em, welcome to the house of pain
MJB, be worried niggaz, yeah, Nas...
Wendy Williams say I stayed dust maybe I should
'Cause these rappers'll have your phone tap like Savion Glover
And on the West the police corrupt, some are bloods
But these Teflon I loaded explodin some mugs
I'm like Furious in Boyz In the Hood
But at the drive through I'm ain't runnin' I'm dumpin
Crazy like a paru and load up, know how Nas do
I'm callin Henchmen to save shit, to organize a black truth
And we party hard party wit Nas
Since they ain't no more - Mardi Gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize
Y'all yellin' my name but y'all soon die in
Tryin' to portray real but they be ly-in
'Cause they want the real niggaz to die so they can game
But neva that, this ain't neva lastin this is the house of pain
To my motherfuckin' man, fifty grand, the alcoholic man
Inject a tall can to his blood stream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
I like to mack in Maximas and Acuras
The raw rapper, spot smacker
Wit the lil hooker on my lap-ah, you know your favorite macker
A shy nigga, but I ain't ya fuckin' comforter
And If I ever fall in love, I better fuck it up
Ask the hooker, If I didn't jug her
She try to front, then I put the Chucky Booker on her
Bitch, you crazy? Commitments, I'm Swayze
No time for the ill shit
Mess with the niggaz on that real blood spill shit
My rappin' tactics, are drastic
Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my Pedigree, you better be
Filled with energy, niggaz never gettin' me
Big cities and bright lights
Short days and long nights
No stress and no strife
I'm high off living the life
It's clear to see that I'm the motherfuckin' man, I done learned from the
Best of em; Took the first slot, niggaz still second guessin' em
Hoes, I'm undressin' em', foes, I'm not stresin' em'
Outlastin' a bunch of 'em, outflowed the rest of em'
'Cause everyday, I stay preachin' on the pulpit
So tell them haters they could miss me with that bullshit
But I won't miss, I'm Luda, the heat holder
I'm rich, bitch! I've done more shows than Hova
And I'm a soldier, ready for whatever
Roll with a bunch of niggaz that don't know no better
King like Coreddar, countin' mo' cheddar
Just hired two dykes to be my ho getters
When it comes to these women, dog, ain't no one fuckin' wit me
They runnin' back, you think I had TJ Duckett wit me
That's 'cause I throw it like Vick, from the yard line
Menage a trois, it's safe to say I'm havin' hard times
To my nigga Chopper dot, with the whoopty-whop on the block
Got the heaters cocked, 'cause I know the suckers on the block
Hennesey and Belve-D, brings a lot of jealousy
Nigga stop snitchin', nephew, why you tellin' me?
Used to be a G, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, and it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Y'all fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, what's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me Snoopy Trump
I keep my heater close, 'cause I love to bust
Now hat's a stain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga; I'm livin' the life!
Mmmmmmmmm-HMM
Yo, yo yo yo, yo...
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss... yo'.. ass... goodnight
I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you loose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods yo' Dungarees
And that's just the half on my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, Yo he nice, but that's on the low doe
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggaz, snort-caine niggaz
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
Till Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girls nipples be
The game sour like like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin' bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggaz envious
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out frontin, smokin' somethin'
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin
I laced it wit the basic, six TV's a system
Knockin' Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, mixed shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, LONG KISS
{Puff Daddy - speaking over chorus}
Now... we don't give a fuck...
We just absolutely... don't give a fuck...
Because... there ain't no motherfuckin love here...
There ain't no love here...
You know, we... we just gon' keep doin' what we do
We gon' keep FUCKIN' YOU UP...
And I'ma keep stompin your MOTHERFUCKIN HEAD IN
You FUCKIN' BITCH, c'mon!
{Last line overlaps Biggie's next verse}
Uh... I'm flamin gats, aimin at, these fuckin'
Maniacs, put my name in raps, what part the
Game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Blackwoods and Dutchies, ya can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleedin lovely, wit'chyo, spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin tryin' to break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue, six Coupe
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin out -- the block
For distances, givin' long kisses BITCH
{Puff Daddy - speaking over chorus}
All we have to do now... is say a prayer for you... y'know?
That's all we have to do, just to pray for your mind... cause...
Eheh, see your mind got control of your heart...
When it's supposed to be the other way around
Your heart's supposed to got control of your mind...
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cold...
{Last line overlaps Biggie's next verse}
Frank White the menacin, Chron Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new, Hummer in the summer when I was a new comer
Then, drugs and mac-10's
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke -- girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke yo' ass out till your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
Like his weed green'd out, like his brick solid
Distribute to, kids who, take heart like Valentine
Drink Ballentine, all the time
Slugs hit your chest tap you spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real doe
Sling steal slow, as for remorse, we feel no
{Puff Daddy - speaking over chorus}
See the fucked up thing is that I love you...
Yaknahmsayin?
It's just in my nature to love you...
I can't hate you... 'cause it's not in my nature to hate you...
You know, I don't know...
Maybe... I'm a different type of individual...
But... you have me on the line...
And there's a thin line between love and hate
And God forbid I cross that line...
Cause y'all not gonna give a fuck
I'm tellin' you right, MOTHERFUCKIN, NOW!
The shit, y'all done started, is never gonna stop!
We are never gonna stop!
And we not talkin' bout... no other rappers...
We talkin' bout YOU motherfucker
YOU KNOW, who I'm talkin' to...
We comin' for you...
We comin' for you... ehehehehheh
The shit's gon' feel so good...
Thoghts batored shattered I dream dreams cherish memory's house friendships and promise that mattered in the end time is trausured like love for my son
Love Is Everlasting
So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back, talkin' 'bout the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal
That you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin'
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggaz know... that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggaz sayin', Biggie off the street, it's a miracle
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggaz actin' shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin' funk by the boxes, packin glocks is
Natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates
The funk baby
All I want is bitches, big booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats, to stop all the snitches
From stayin in my business, what is this? Relentless
Approach, to know if I'm broke or not
Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the glock
Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen
Until we motherfuckin meet again
Huh, I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold ya head, 'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick
The funk baby
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin helicopter
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
When I'm rippin all through your whole crew
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons
Niggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
Machine Gun Funk baby!
Yo let, let, let me ask you a question yo
Yo would you kill for me?
Hmmm... yeah
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you bitch?
When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
I never felt that way in my life
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right
But you know you love that a$$, don't you?
Yeah, no question
No question
Yo, let me ask you another question
What?
You ever fuck around on me?
Why would I do that?
Yo don't lie to me motherfucker
Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play celo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
With a glock just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together
Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch you're a$$ fuckin' around
I'ma cut your mother-fuckin' dick off
Hah, heheh stop playin', hah
I ain't playin', ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes
Yo, don't don't play with my dick
She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
One day, she put nine one one on the page
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
And when I find 'em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch
Uh, yeah, yeah
Uh...
Uh, motherfucker yeah

I've been missin' you lately
Tell me why you're gone and through
O yeah
I remember sellin three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, ain't no competition that could sour
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead heaven
In eighty-eight, when Kane ruled, with Half Steppin
A thirty-eight, a lot of mouth, was our only weapon
We was king till the G's crept in
And now I'm missin' em
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Nah nah nah nah nah, oh tell me why why why why
We work all week, we dancin, play the movies
We rock flatops, our girls rocked doobies
Made a killin', even though the D's knew me
Eventually, you know they try to do me
Fuck it
Fed up, my nigga want to take it down south
Sick of cops comin', sick of throwin' jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper, told 'em go that route
Few months, he got his brain blown out
Now I'm stressed
His baby's mother, she trippin', blamin me
And his older brothers, understand, the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy
You win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother
They mother lost a son
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in NY?
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried
I look in the sky and ask God why
Can't look his baby girls in the eye
There was this girl around the way that make cats drool
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin' but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my drugs after school
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin with some major players
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheatin', now Drew she gotta slay her
One night, across from the corner store
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
The dude lived, what my baby had to die for
We missin' her
I'm comin' out, I'm comin'
I'm comin' out, I'm comin'
Now, who's hot, who not
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores

As a child Christopher was outspoken when it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are as a young man he likes
To do everything he liked to read he likes to be with his friends as young kids
R young boys he enjoyed life everything that would make him happy r comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family his early
Inspirations toward rap music were the LLs of the world the sugar hills the Mr.
Magic抯 and the fat boys of the rap channel those were all the things I heard in
The house even though I called it noise and banging I know now that it is a
Accepted musical art form I was a single parent I raised my son on my own his
Father had no influence on his decision towards the musical outlet r career he
Chose my son had a mind of his own even if his father was around he would have
Turned to rap he loved music he loved rap at a point in my sons life he
Developed paranoia about death and about the dying we are living in a world of
I'm
Perfect human beings we are greed jealousy and envy or manifested by what
Others have accomplished in life my son was very very much aware of that he
Appreciated his station in life on the directions in which he was going are
Traveling on the other hand there were others who I should uh use the hip hop
Phrase player hating and I think that is what resulted in his paranoia if I had
To change anything in my sons life that would have allowed him to be here
Today I would have deterred him from a career in music I'm aware that millions
Appreciated his music millions loved his music be that it may if he hadn't
Chosen that life style that career my son would be alive today if I could sum
Up Christopher in one word the word would be generous th thing that my son
Loved most about life was the fact that he was in a position to help position
To share position to give to others who needed to others who wanted to others
Apreciat4d the gifts that he gave that's what he loved most

Fifty shots'll tear your club apart
Eatin shrimp A la Carte, with some bitches from Brussels

I just want the bush, so I can mack you
Give her a package to push, 'cause I work dem hoes
Pendejo's, I show you how to play them hoes

To pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall

Nigga, nigga, nigga..
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggaz get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin' weed, flippin ki's, makin' crazy G's
Hittin buckshots at niggaz that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin' hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
That's a real nigga for ya
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop for the town
Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hah, yo G, pass the ruler
Money hoes and clothes
Blunt smoke comin' out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flippin on foes, puttin' tags on toes
Watchin the stash grow, clockin the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigga
Gettin' paid so much, all the bitches wanna see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I wanna get laid
Or since I got loot I wanna knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex at the two or three Benzes
I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, puttin' the swellin on your eye
And your nose even, when I choke ya you stop breathin
And when Jake come, I'm leavin'!
Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in ranges, believe them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like True Lies, Kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' wit put bombs in yo moms gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with thirty-three-eighties
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch, I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin' real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five a piece
Enough to cop a six buy the house on the beach
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream no one considered a leech
Think about it now, that's damn near one point five
I kill 'em all, I'll be set for life Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed
Niggaz bleed just like us
Picture me bein scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Niggaz bleed just like us
Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfuckin beef cook
Niggaz bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin
My life in that man hands, while he just decidin'
Niggaz bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocol
Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tucson, pushed the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rocked the Isley
Stupid as a young'un, chose not the moves wisely
Sharper with game, him and his crooks, called The Jooks
Heard it was sweet, bout three-fifty a piece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back, speakin' Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
Here's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated, he mean it
Nothing to lose, tattooed around his gun wounds
Everything to gain, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money ya dyin'
Specially if my daughter cryin, I ain't lyin'
Y'all know the science
We agreed to go in shootin is silly
Because niggaz could be hidin in showers with Mac Billy's
So I freaked em, the telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Astoria, I went to war with her
Peeps in ninety-one, stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place, long story, Glo seen my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was comin' for the safe
Now she breakin, shut up, 112, what's shakin
A Jamaican, some bitches I swear, they look gay
And a black Range Rover, been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way
Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggaz bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't need
Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we bout to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice
Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline, the nigga pass me kerosene
Fuck it, its flame-able, my hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two, opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blastin
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughin', I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spinned around, shot the chink in the breast
She cryin, headshots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothin' but Franklin faces
The spot's hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dippin
I know them niggaz in the Range is on they way up
Flippin, pistol grippin, I know they clippin
The hallway, got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant
Stupid motherfuckers
Yo, check it
Call Lil' Cease
Tell that muh'fucker to bring me some muh'fuckin' weed for this hospital
Man fuck that
Tell that reporter to go pick up ten thousand from Dez
And go take about like twenty G's from Gino
Tell that muh'fucker get this nigga next door up out of here
Call that big butt nurse with the long hair to come suck my dick
The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
But the nurses is lovin' me
Sayin' the best part of the day is my half
Feedin me breakfast, and givin' me a sponge bath
Niggaz say I died dead in the streets
Nigga I'm gettin' high, gettin' head on the beach
Chillin', sittin' on about half a million
With all my niggaz, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin'
All the time, Big Poppa kick the war rhymes
Raw flows, and that's how it goes
It's Bone and Biggie Biggie We gonna rock the party
Yes Bone and Biggie Biggie Betta run and tell everybody
Get high, get high, get high, c'mon
Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Get high, get high, get high
Rock the party, party
Everybody, everybody
No-to-rious, Thugs Nothin' but them thugsters
Nothin' but them thugster thugsters
No-to-rious, Thugs Nothin' but them thugsters
Nothin' but them thugster thugsters
Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us Notorious
Thug ass niggaz that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggaz be scramblin, gamblin
Up in restaurants with mandolins, and violins
We just sittin' here tryin' to win, tryin' not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga you'd should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Been in this shit since ninety-two
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you know who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I bluelight niggaz knew like Mike, shit
Not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick, cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo' game, talk yo' shit
Grab yo' gat, call yo' clique
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggaz I got to fight one
All them hoes I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do, fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take b
Bone and Big, nigga die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Shit, lyrically, niggaz can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke
Cook the coke, cut it,
Know the bitch before you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you
BIG come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down with the Mo Thugs crew
Who's the killa, me or you?
Its seven A.M. woke in the mornin
With Henney, Caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough so pop a couple of those
Lil Ripstas, nigga Mista Clean
Make it gleam deep in my temple and I'll go get
Sentimentally esteamed, wit my
Instrumelodies, and heated
Especially for your team
And the forty-five indeed will beam
In between the seams, destroyin your dreams
You willin' to die, we'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene
We mean mug, Mo Thugs
Trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival tongue by the double-edged sword
Triple, six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch
Breakin out for lies
My Messiahs better be ready for Armageddeon six-six-five
It's wild, bless the child
The one that became a man
Put in positions already there
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contend never no surrender no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand
One of my trusted fine friends, hey
Open 'n' let 'em see if we real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin
Baby we ain't marchin, we shootin'
And daily recruitin there's a thug born
Everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little we give 'em a bottle
And a pen and a pad to hit the lead now kick it
Nigga roll wit Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome wit a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck son gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this twelve gauge sawed off
Get 'em all off, nigga yo' loss, take it all off
Got a nigga car door
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinkin' they Thugs
They need the most help to pull it in doves
And bitch if you stickin we buckin them guns, tha's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But Willie be servin' 'em dummies, see
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talkin'
Like gimme back me money
Thuggin' with me killers, need us a liter
Of liquor but niggaz ain't got shit
Wit a sawed off pump chrome thirty-eight pistol
Now who ready to get bent
Nigga like me feenin for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money so
I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke
Yeah, Little Lay hey comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya wit magic
Droppin' down licks betta call on my gadgets
With a automatic status we spray time to load the glocks
But I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me do what I gotta do
So I up ma force, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie booms on my a$$ now provide the cellular phone
To call Bone, what's happenin'
Grab artillery niggaz start packin
Cause a motherfucker try to get me in the jackin, and I did him
Hit him right between the eyes, the spot was wise
Wanna test a nigga size, and it cost him
Nigga fuck around wit the wrong shit
Y'all get mo murdered all day all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
That red red rum rum rum rum rum rum
That red red rum rum rum rum rum rum
That red red rum...
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me, Bigga the Condom Filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick, Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit
Now check this shit, I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd
Smith, I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I'll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter, skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming, Ay papi
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a .44
For niggas getting mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G
You see, all I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-Town in ya, you want that old thing back
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick?
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past, let's dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with benjamins
Another honey's in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below, peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressing 'em I'm undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who's the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo, I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I nut I got to split, shit
Backshots is my position, I got you wishing
For an intermission, fuck the kissin'
Lick you down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me big for nothin', all of a sudden
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Good evening
And for my last hit
I'd like to take you back to the classic
A-hem, B.I.G. style of course
Uh
Playaah, turn your head round
Lay on the ground, you've been robbed
Wake up, open the door
Lay on the floor, you've been robbed
Uh
You know, we need this money
And you, yes baby, you, should just roll with me
Let's go off, together
On this robbin spree, we'll make money
Uh
Playaah, turn your head round
Take off that crown, you've been robbed
Wake up, open the door
Don't cry no more, you've been robbed
You see, there are two kind of people in the world today
We have, the playaz, and we have, the playa haters
Please don't hate me because I'm beautiful baby
Hear what they talk, about me
But my crew so deep, you can't do, a damn thing, to me
Playah, open the door
Lay on the floor, you've been robbed
Thank you thank you far too kind, far too kind
Thank you, thank you very much
Good night everybody, good night!
I love all of you, thank you thank you
Thank you, thank you very much
Good night!
Well it's the Funk Docta Spock..
Meth-Tical..
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
The prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
Is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
Or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
But they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high
Yo... yo yo
I don't brownnose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trustin niggaz since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high
This rule is so underrated.. - B.I.G.
Actin' as if it can't happen, you're frontin - Meth
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing.. - B.I.G.
Biggie, a motherfuckin rap phenomenon - B.I.G.
Uh, uh
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due South with keys
Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cee's advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
From Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off Get Money, Player's Anthem
Don't forget, One More Chance and, my other hits, other shit
Niggaz spit be counterfeit, robbery come actually
In and out like fuckin' rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin' blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often
Frank Wizzard, fuck you soft or fragilla
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
Slash Gorilla, slash illest turned killer
Now now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
That's infinity -- too many sick niggaz, nickel nines;
Bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty
Unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot 'em with a dart like Cupid
Until they got love for my music
Star Wars I'm Han Solo, with three egoes
And three charges, I got to See-three-P.O.'s
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
Eyeball blower with no equal, niggaz swingin' swords in the WAR
That's my people, sho' nuff, befo' I roll up
This is a hold up, hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie? The Notorious
Jeee-zus, Unbelievable rhyme that reaches
And touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin
Hot -- forcin my way up in the door
To kill the bullshit like a matador
Yeah
Yeah
As I grab the Glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off, release
Straight at your dome, homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doing your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The Q-45, Glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to die
As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doing whatever it took from snatching chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sold
I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus
Getting paid is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I've got a Glock making motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kicking niggas down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggas getting wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns 'cause I'm ready, ready
Nah we ain't gon' kill your ass yet
We gonna make you suffer
In a sec, I throw the tec to your fucking neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some rec
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talking
You better act like CeCe and keep on walking
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, with stompin'
I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggas say I'm strange deranged because I put the twelve gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
Down your backbone to where your motherfucking cheek drip
The shit I kick, ripping through the vest
Biggie Smalls passing any test, I'm ready to die
I'm ready
Niggas definitely know what time it is
The Notorious one in full effect
For '93
Suicidal, I'm ready
Yeah
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
Biggie Smalls the biggest man
Rockin' on and on in '93, Easy Mo Bee
Third Eye, and the rest of the Bad Boy fam
I don't wanna see no cryin' at my funeral
Nineteen-seventy somethin', nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms'd hurry up so I could get buck
Wild, juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York New York, ready for the likes of this, uh
Then came the worst date, May 21st
No spouse in the house so she rolled herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seein' my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said, He's gonna be a Bad Boy
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream, I mean
I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail
Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'
Honeys is tantalizin', they freak all night
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas livin' street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slippin'
If I'm pimpin' on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the Tec
Respect to the Mac's and the Ac's
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps
Good evenin ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight?
I'd like to welcome to the stage, the lyrically acclaimed, ha
I like this young man, because, when he came out
He came out wit the phrase, he went from ashy to classy
Ha, I like that
So everybody in the house, give a warm, round of applause for
The Notorious B.I.G. ladies and gentlemen give it up for him y'all
Uh
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
And alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga wit the fake- blaow!
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin
And hoes clockin, here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, BIG man they never try
So we roll wid em, stole wid em
I mean loyalty, niggaz bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch
In gear - Oshkosh with blue and white dunks
Pass the blunt
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, pressin what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want, have what you want, be what you want
Uh-huh, I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of em
Long as I got stuff from most of em
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin', bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin, dabbled in crack, gun packin
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class, to Englass, pass off a global
The only nigga wit a mobile, Can't You See like Total
Gettin' larger in waist and taste
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin, just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of ya melon, clear da space
Ya brain was a terrible thing ta waste
Eighty-eight long gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs wit niggaz, real life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, pressin what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want, have what you want, be what you want
After realizin, to master enterprisin
I ain't have ta be in school by ten, I was in
Began to encounter, wit my counter-parts
On how ta burn the block apart, break it down into sections
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes, others use in-jec-tions
Syringe sold separately, Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith-n-Wessun, like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my layer
While we out here, say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when ya heart's in it
And live the phrase Sky's The Limit
Motherfucker... see you chumps on top
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, pressin what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want...
I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Leer jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop
Oops!
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
Is this?
I gets up quick
Cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin
Then proceed to walkin'
It's a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the sixteenth floor
Check it
I look deeper
I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin' or speakin'?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful
Is he in critical?
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
'Cause I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit
Bust a gat shit
Puff won't even know what happened
If it's done smoothly
Silencers on the Uzi
Stashed in the hooptie
My alibi, any cutie
With a booty that done fucked big Pop
Head spinnin, reminiscin bout my man C-Rock
Somebody's gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody's gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's gotta die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo ass in the mix, bitch
Fillin clips he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin
Some kid named Jason In a Honda station wagon
Was braggin
About how much loot and crack he stackin
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
Small crew
Round the time I was locked up with you
True indeed
But yo nigga let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn where was I?
Yeah
One night in town
Blew the fuck up
D-Rock went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit 'em twice
Got 'em right on the Persian white
Pistol whipped his kids
And taped up his wife
He said Yo Rock, set 'em up, no question
Wet 'em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction
How many shots?
Man nigga, I seen mad holes
What kinda gats?
Hitch links, Cops, and Calicoles
But fuck that
I know where all them niggaz rest at
In the buildin hustlin
And they don't be strapped
Supreme in black
Is downstairs, the engine runnin'
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if yo comin'
Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How it's gonna go down
Lay these niggas low-down
Slow down
Fuck all that plannin shit
Run up in they cribs
And make them cats abandon ship
See niggas like you do ten year bids
Miss the niggas they want
And murder innocent kids
Not I
One niggas in my eye
That's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to feel my clip in his hips
Pass the chocolate
Thai
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talkin' to his faculty
I start to get a funny feelins
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealin
Scream his name out
Squeeze six nothing shorter
Nigga turned around holdin' his daughter

In the middle of an Hour
Bring niggas more drama than they baby mama
Nigga wanna battle ima bomb ya
One man but I attack like a pack of pirahnas
Like taracotta, niggas always ready for war
But they don't really wanna see a nigga tho
We can hit 'em in a minute, then we finish wit him
Hit 'em with the venom of a nigga wit a Sick-ol' Slow
Doin' it wit Swizz, oh no!
Niggas in trouble, somebody better call po-po
And niggas y'all heard of me, brick city killa, nigga word to me
And I'm Classic like Bird 'n' Magic
With a tactic to stack snatch his rep back and stack some Platinum
Double on 'em at random
With the bullets I brand him
Fin' to hold the game Ransom
Runnin' up in ya mansion, cash demandin', flashing cannons
Niggas ain't ready for this 1, 'cause I'm on a mission to get even
Better believe it, I'm heavily heated
It's easy to see it, if you wanna see me let that be the reason

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My babies' mothers 8 months, her little sister's 2
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I want to leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
I reached my peak, I can't speak
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
Uh, it's the ten crack commandments
What, uh, uh
Nigga can't tell me nothin' 'bout this coke, uh, huh
Can't tell me nothin' 'bout this crack, this weed
To my hustlin' niggaz
Niggaz on the corner, I ain't forget you niggaz
My triple beam niggaz, word up
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten
I been in this game for years, it made me a animal
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step by step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule numbre uno, never let no one know
How much, dough you hold, 'cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get your ass stuck up
Number two, never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence or violence
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats
For they bricks and chips
Number three, never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodie to mask up, shit, for that fast buck
She be layin' in the bushes to light that ass up
Number four, know you heard this before
Never get high on your own supply
Number five, never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce
Number six, that goddamn credit, dead it
You think a crackhead payin' you back, shit forget it
Seven, this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number eight, never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too
Number nine shoulda been number one to me
If you ain't gettin' bags stay the fuck from police
If niggaz think you snitchin', ain't tryin' listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waitin' to start hittin'
Number ten, a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele say hell no
'Cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules, you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you pass
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks
She sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick and can hook a steak up
Gotta go, gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up, uh
Crack king, Frank Blizzard
Uh
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten
My name is Christopher C.J. Wallace
And my dad was the greatest rapper ever
And his legacy lives on
I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick, to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playin' the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold wondered, What you talkin' 'bout Willis?
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches, I like 'em brainless, guns, I like 'em stainless steel
I want the fuckin' Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me
You don't want to fuck with Biggie
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over harmony grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin' where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Lookin' cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga, stop bitchin', button up ya lip and
From Method all you gettin' is a can of ass-whippin'
Hey, I'll be kickin', you son, you doin' all the yappin'
Actin' as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo I'm from Shaolin Island, and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga, ya punk nigga
I got a six-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honey, shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on
Verse two, comin' with that Olde E brew
Meth-ical, puttin' niggas back in ICU
I'm lifted troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue, huh
No question, I be comin' down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin' carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentleman, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
 Stop, look, and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens, bitch
Welcome to my center, honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the Pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads, I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of makin' hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up, 'cause hoes is irritatin' like the 
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin' rap phenomenon, plus
I make it hot 
Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honey, shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honey, shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on

We'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see
I'm just trying to be all I can be
Ohhahhoah, yeah
Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore she be game for sure
Pimp so hard, a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin' with me, believe me that's a privilege
I won't be satisfied, till all my niggaz get it
See you hit it then I hit it, we get it back to split it
And Big be that nigga we be flyin through your hood
And hoodrats scopin with they eyes on my goods
See we date 'em like we hate em, see 'em like we don't need em
Treat 'em like we meet em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you, never knew, what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
And if she's flexible fuck the nigga next to you
The world is filled, with pimps and hoes
But we'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see
I'm just trying to be all I can be
Ohhahhoah, yeah
When the Remi's in the system, ain't no tellin'

Y'all still chase on, I'll replace on, punks
Drunk of Dom, silk and gators
Spittin' words makin' birds till they flock see you later
Whether, drunk or high, skunk or thai
Nigga play against some playa shit, slugs gon fly
Ain't no lie, pimped out, the SSI
Nigga don't ask why, just respect it
She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o, she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew, in each state
Now I got two in each state
Used to drink brew and eat steak
Now I pop bottles with models, larger steaks on large estates
The world is filled, with pimps and hoes
But we'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see
I'm just trying to be all I can be
Ohhahhoah, yeah
I had a whole lotta bitches in my lifetime
I been blessed with the game always say the right lines
Had a few prostitues and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let 'em do it to you
She ain't no sucker, I know that bitch man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman lovin' a rich man
Now here you come, drop top ridin'
You ain't no pimp fake nigga stop lyin'
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that live it
Street life, pimp shit, make the hoe respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figured
She left you cause you couldn't be, like them real niggaz
She was a hustler by nature, and you was just faker
Than the average symps, found a badder pimp
Too $hort
Crazy ass man
I never woulda bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that hoe man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe!
Man I'm thirty years old nigga
And that bitch was hoein when I was in 9th grades and shit
Think about that, she been around then right?
Shit... you just a rest haven for hoes man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fuckin' witchu cause you had a good ass job, nigga nerd
Treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga
She ain't nuttin but a hoe!
Bet you fell in love with her man!
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife fool
Everytime you turn your back that bitch is fuckin' with dem gangstas
Eastside Westside these are my potnahs
Do that shit, you know what I'm talkin' bout nigga
I tell you about some real pimps and hoes
Tell you about these pimps and these hoes man, yeah I know a few
Shit, beyotch!
Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin' brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin' on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin' smoked G, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin' that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin' blunts in the project
Hallways, shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though
No more cocoa leave-io, one two three
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a Mac-10 he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
And we comin' to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed
If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin five cent gums not knowin' where your meals comin' from
And now the shit's gettin' crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky grand Pagers
Goin' outta town, blowin' up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin' took out
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed
Yo...
Yo... check this out
Yeah! MotherFUCKERS, C'MON!
MotherFUCKERS, c'mon B.I.G. motherFUCKERS
B.I.G., motherFUCKERS
Two thou', B.I.G. motherFUCKERS
??, Two thou', motherFUCKERS
??, B.I.G. motherFUCKERS
B.I.G. at war, motherFUCKERS
B.I.G... we proceed...
To give you, what you need
I am... as we proceed...
To give you all what you need motherFUCKERS
B.I.G., motherFUCKERS
Oh shit!
Yo... too much smoke in here man
Crack the fuckin' window man
That's how the fuck you went to jail last time nigga
The fuck wrong with you nigga... the fuck man?
Ah eh... stupid nigga man
Nigga fuck that
Yo... yo! Yo-yo-yo, yo, yo, yo... yo
Yo-yo-yo, yo... yo
Yo...
I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you loose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods yo' Dungarees
And that's just the half on my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, Yo he nice, but that's on the low doe
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggaz, snort-caine niggaz
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
Till Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girls nipples be
The game sour like like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin' bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggaz envious
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out frontin, smokin' somethin'
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin
I laced it wit the basic, six TV's a system
Knockin' Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, mixed shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, LONG KISS
Y'all can't see this...
That this might be the night...
This might be the night that's right, that's right
Niggaz playin' they hands wrong, that's why they won't last long
Finessed, what I was dealt with from the day I was born
While you bent up on that corner, niggaz plottin and scheamin
Up in them little holes, be creepin' wit mad demons
Niggaz knows, not to fuck with my dough
Niggaz know not to fuck with this little bro I'm ten seconds hit'n'go
Black mask black truck chrome rims Chuck Timbs
Enough to confuse, any witness
Strongest of calibers, is what we only travel wit
You gotta get hit, your man did, so you got a hand in it
Extort y'all, once friends, now we gotta cross y'all
You know the niggaz with the biggest balls set the new laws
And flip fours, have 'em washin drawers while you up North
Gat to your jugular, getting your salad tossed
Overhearin niggaz situation, sayin', Like we thought
Sittin' on the stand with no remorse
Yo, yo how we do niggaz, I don't beef I shoot niggaz
If I can't get the main character, a few niggaz then
I don't need no gin to boost me
I got enough steam to blow, somebody gotta go
I got fire in my heart, guns in my car
Cash in my Carharts, it ain't hard to get em
Like blaow when I hit em, the nigga shit his drawers
When the 40-pound hit him, the fuck these niggaz thought?
Could it be the fame, maybe it's the 2 Benz or
Would it be the same if I couldn't claim those?
Fuckin' with, hoes ?
Cock sucker beat it while you bleed it on the dashboard
Niggaz get, what they hand call for, again bricks
You get deaded, I get erections, over revenge
Can you get a quiet spot in the shade, for a breeze
I lay a nigga down and steam roll away ?
I never thought it would be like this
I never thought it would be like this
Always thought you would be here
Always thought you would be by my side
I never thought it'd be like this
Oh god I miss you! c'mon! yeah!
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, Cintamelia,
Can I feel ya?
All I wannah do is touch ya
The Ultimate Rush
The drugs baby
Don't you know I'm the ultimate?
To get this milk, you be fortunate
Just like tasting pussy with pork in it
People stop when I'm walking in
I'm twisting twisting, I'm back on ten
And I'm talking bout like Mase, come back again
My steez is immaculate
My paper stacking, keep tracking, I'm macing, Y'all slacking, Reaction, Make Y'all dicks scream
I'm more gutter then golddiggers with figures, more bigger then jiggas, and even Paris Hiltons
Damn sir, Sniff me like a Coke
Thrillons, Me won't give you none
Cintamelia, All you wannah do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, Get high baby
Damn sir, Sniff me like a coke
Thrillons, Me won't give you none

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, Cintamelia,
Can I feel ya?
All I wannah do is touch ya
The Ultimate Rush
The drugs baby
Now BiggieSmalls is not the type to fall in love!
When I just hit em' and forget em' and go handle my business
I like the kind who wine and dine
Who grinding all the time
Your x girl was a 5, but you not let up on a dime
What is this with you? All you wannah do is lay around, and stay around
And get mad when I play around
I like to lay, never work
Put your money in my purse
To the mall, I'll go search
Matching shoes for my skirt
Tuesday I saw you in a Z
But you still wannah get with me
Wednesday is the Benz day
That's what your friends say
Me and my friends, got your benz,
Attracting mens, and spending dividence
Blowing like the wind
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, Cintamelia,
Can I feel ya?
All I wannah do is touch ya
The Ultimate Rush
The drugs baby
So I guess you think I'm slipping
'Cause I ain't flipping
Baby I'm big Poppa, Ain't no need to be tripping
I ain't tripping or flipping
I'm just niggah sipping
At the bar tipping,
With your money, can you pay the difference?
It seems like it's a waste of time
That's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jumping in every car except for mine
Niggah, I don't jump in cars
I'm a superstar
Face way too flaw, You should hang me on your wall
All I do all day is drink Tanguray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face
Make me smile, see them teeth
Milo cute down to them feets
Chubby waste, My Physique
Me don't want a freak-a-leek
Should I wine and dine and put rings on your fingers?
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers?
Sex will never linger
Hold up, Put on your blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers
Give your ass the middle finger
You'd better slow your role baby,
You ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pennumber, Just page me
When your real baby
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, Cintamelia,
Can I feel ya?
All I wannah do is touch ya
The Ultimate Rush
The drugs baby
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, Cintamelia,
Can I feel ya?
All I wannah do is touch ya
The Ultimate Rush
The drugs baby
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats, I pull it, bastards duckin' when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom, fucking
It ain't nothing, they know Big be handling
With the Mac in the Ac door paneling
Bandaging MC's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve, wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q-45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast you but I have to, you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwamé
And them fucking polka dots, who rock the spot? Biggie
You know how the weed go, unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
B-i-g-g-i-e, aka
B.I.G, get it? Biggie
Also known as the bon appetit, rappers can't sleep
Need sleeping, Big keep creeping
Bullets heat-seeking, casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching, lesson A
Don't fuck with B-I, that's that, oh I
Thought he was wack, oh come come now
Why y'all so dumb now, hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer saute, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
He sounds demented, car weed scented
If I said it, I meant it, bite my tongue for no one
Call me evil or unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear
MC's fear me, they too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play guerilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice for the nicest MC
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
The lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake
My dead face I see, my dead face I SEE!
On your mark, get set, when I spark you're wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked wit death
Should I, start your breath or should I let you die
If he start to cry, ask why?
Lyrically, I'm worshipped, don't front, the word's sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stomped quickly for raw T's and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I'm punishin
I'm done wit them, son I'm surprised you run wit them
I think they got cumin, 'cause they nothin' but bitch
Tryna blow up like nitro wit dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke, but yo I rock diamonds that's sick
Got paper off my flow, ride wit my own click
Take chicks to Cairo, layin wit yo' bitch
I know you playin' you was rich
Fuck you prick, when I see you I'ma...
When I see you I'ma... when I see you I'ma...
See who's this pagin me - and why
It's my nigga Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gamblin spot, and heard the intricate plot
Of niggaz wanna stick me like flypaper neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggaz from the hill up in Brownsville?
That you rolled dice wit, smoked blunts, and got nice wit
Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah they're my niggaz nah love wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say dem, they schooled me to some niggaz
That you knew from back when, when you was clockin minor figures
Now they heard you blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So - thank Fame for warnin me cause now I'm warnin you
I got the mac nigga tell me what you gonna do
Damn! Niggaz wanna stick me for my paper
Damn! Niggaz wanna stick me for my paper
Damn! Niggaz wanna stick me for my paper
Damn! Niggaz wanna stick me for my paper
They heard about the Rolex's and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates outta state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida
The fifth corridor --
-- Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin', and flower bringin'
If my burgular alarm starts ringin'
Whatcha think all the guns is for?
All purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder, so they can devour
The criminals, tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn! Niggaz wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts witcha, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and getcha
Betcha Biggie won't slip
I got the calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckaz in a bad predicament, where all the foul niggaz went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'm a hit you with you motherfuckers betta duck
I bring pain, blood stains on what remains
Of his jacket - he had a gun he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and EXPLODE on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to ya door no beef no more nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga I bust my gun in
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'...
Are we gettin' close, huh?
Are you sure this Biggie Smalls crib man?
Ah fuck - it better be his motherfuckin house
Fuck right here...

What red dot? ... Oh shit! You got a red dot on your head too!

Venue after venue, I've been through
Coming to the telly, so I can bend you
Send you to the store, condoms and more
Jealous females, call you sluts and whores
Could it be my hardcore metaphor
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor
Open up the Lex door
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired
I'm a roll blunts while you spin
You got your license, right? All right, no swerving
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se
Much foreplay, that's my forte
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death
She looking for a man, honey he just left
Violate me, he get beat to death
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left
Grand Marnier increase the don strength
Two four-fifths within my arms length
With a calm breath I say we gots to float
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen
And you mean too, eyes greenish blue
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu
Beautiful, that's how the night goes
Get out them tight clothes
Get in some night clothes
I invite those girls that smoke lye
Keep it real with you
You keep it real with I
We be tight like frog's ass
Have you screaming Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance
These hoes don't treat you like I treat you
Like my contacts, I can see right through
Don't they know me and you is stuck like glue?
Queen Bitch means number one and two
Wifey, y'all ain't got to like me
Go head and act dumb, you'll just catch a hot one
Y'all know where I'm from
Bucktown, lay your ass down
Probably just mad because Frank chose me
A fly cu-tie, you just a grou-pie
Girls call my telephone just to hang up
While me and you is in the crib, laying up
Oh he ain't tell you that we live together
And that we gonna have a kid together
Whatever, me intimidated, never
Anything you give to him, he give it right to Kim
Anyway, I fuck better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
If I fuck another nigga, don't mean nothing
B.I.G. is in my heart from the start
Whether broke or rich, I'm a stay his bitch
Chicks who used to be around, where they at now?
B.I.G. kept it real with me, and that's that
Yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil -- for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever
Niggaz in my faction don't like askin questions
Strictly gun testin, coke measurin
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
MWA, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer, yes my dear
Shit's official, only, the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot cryin
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all -- death
Controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody till somebody kills you
You're nobody, till somebody, kills you
You're nobody, till somebody, kills you
Uh, uh
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily, ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nuttin left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave 'em in bloodshed
Incidents like this I take trips
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore
Told me meet 'em in the future later, they'll take me shoppin'
Buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinkin' Cristal
Till they piss the shit, uh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminesce on dead friends too
You're nobody till somebody kills you
Uh, uh
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Silly cat, all suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in Game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine
A fuckin' shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?
Darkskin Jermaine, see what I mean?
'Cause when I flow the for the street.. - .. who else could it be
Nas..
Yo
Explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, easywider paper
Pops puffin his sess, punchin his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon and Chungo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin
Livin' carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks y'all don't hear me
Yo I'm in my second childhood
'Cause when I flow the for the street.. - .. who else could it be
N-A-S - Nas..
Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.. - Queensbridge
Make everything right.. - Get yours, nigga
Yo, dude is 31, livin' in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin, got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since, eighty-five well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood
Baby girl she's always talkin' name droppin' hangin' late
Drinkin' smokin' hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin'
E poppin' Ecstasy takin', won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin, stuck with limitations
Lustin men, many hotels, Fendi Chanel
With nothin' in her bank account frontin she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin, mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin she the same person, never matures
All her friends married doin' well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life, guess she's in her second childhood
Who else could it be.. - N-A-S - Nas..
I walk the block like whatever god, my message to y'all feds
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads
Abrochrombie and Finch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Viewmount
Otisville, Newasberg, Fort Dicks, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain till the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though
Stayin' on my hus-tle
A message to those who trapped us up, from federal guys who backed them up
We never will die, we black and tough, lead in your eye, we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast, look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens, even the Congo needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies pullin' on innocent women and children
It wasn't no ghetto killers who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But I'm not gon' cry, and I'm not gon' just stand and watch you die
I'ma pass you a .9, I'ma grab your hand -- come on let's ride
A message to those who killed the king, who murdered the Christ
The same regime, what God has built you never can break
What God has loved you never can hate, man makes rules and laws
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from
Whenever that day comes, forty-acres, plantations, see every race won
Sincerely yours, Street's Disciple, revelations
Rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica, Queens in his black truck
Timbs was 40 below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you, it's foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money, too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could've died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November thirtieth, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y'all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, 8th Street, twin buildings
Vernon, can't even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap, though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey's ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home, Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for D.U, say what up to Snatch, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through
Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team
On 118, my nigga Ben fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock & Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
Any other real niggas in the world besides us, I ask?
Probably is, but odds are we'll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you D.U
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy, and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real O.G cause back in nine-three
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie's gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now, but you know I'm still mental, but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers
Hold it down, I told ya
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling
Watch the con realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not, it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me, probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went?
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit?
Bo cooking blow, fucking slay that, where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers
Hold it down, I told ya
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rollinExplaing
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you comin', he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through, but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aiight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standin' next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, cause of a
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of them, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just a accident murderer
We grew up doin' graffiti
Now hollows is gettin' heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly gettin' weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck 'em all, we ballin' till they come lock us up
Twenty to life, I'm clubbin' blowin' twenty tonight
We the Marlboro, Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a tec off the shelf, live forever that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodgin' my clique
Hundred check, I use your bitch for some bargainin' chips
In a hole, sell your home nigga don't sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't
Accident murderer, accident murderer
You just an accident murderer
Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sista?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessin'
Tell me who you impressin'?
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make 'em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playin' wrestlin'
Watch 'em grow to a man, I see them now they reppin'
But they cold-blooded, homie, wonderin' where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they killin', they reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Fake till my nigga draws, what you want a name? Tell me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary
This is what... this what they want huh?
This is what it's all about...
What? Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, youknowImean?
Niggaz comin' sideways thinkin' stuff is sweet man
Yknahmean?
Lust... Envy... Hate... Jealousy
Wicked niggaz man
Yo, sit back relax catchin contacts, sip your cog-nac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack, a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines, and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who pull the late, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break, undress 'em tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettucini Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politicking daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die - he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin, they found his head on
The couch with his dick in his mouth, I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me

Yo my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up on your heater all your cream go between us

U-Conn's and ninja black Lexus, 'Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it
Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewellery sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding up-state
And now the projects, is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke, know how to expand coke, and Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a Bitch, but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at Demars
Movin cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

The Gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Papa Chula spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture, the bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper, he had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait it's half and half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half, get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen, now add the other two that 'Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred, cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three, we got three quarters of another key
The Firm baby, volume one uh...

Of my penetentary, fake thugs couldn't even take gloves to burry me
To all theroughbreds takin' the corners, y'all need to join us

Morning to you man

Hey, I say I say
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
The black oasis
Ancient Africa the sacred
Awaken the sleeping giant
Science, Art is your creation
I dreamt that we could visit Old Kemet
Your history is too complex and ridig
For some western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions
We praised bridges that carried us over
The battle front of Sudanic soldiers
The task put before us
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Who are we today?
The slums, deceases, AIDS
We need all that to fade
We cannot be afraid
So who are we today?
We are the morning after
The make shift youth
The slave ship captured
Our Diaspora, is the final chapter
The ancetral lineage built pyramids
Americas first immigrant
The Kings sons and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect, the first philosophers, astronomers
The first prophets and doctors was
Now can we all pray
Each in his own way
Teaching and Learning
And we can work it out
We'll have a warm bed
We'll have some warm bread
And shelter from the storm dread
And we can work it out
Mother Nature feeds all
In famine and drought
Tell those selfish in ways
Not to share us out
What's a tree without root
Lion without tooth
A lie without truth
You hear me out
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Ye lord
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May some more love come
Yesterday we were Kings
I'll tell you young blood
This world is yours today

And when one attempts to tell the truth, aren't you the one's to cut him down?
Who are we today?

Fired
Just stop with the lables and stop the the fragles I'm tired yes I'm so tired
Of hearing my name oh my name wherever I go I just can't sit or relax when I'm
Eating with my daughter so peacefully
Iam whatever you say I am if I wasn't then why wuold I say I am in the paper
The news everyday I am I don't know that's just the way I am
And they ask the same f... question what school do I go to
What hood I grew up in and the why and the where and it's freeking me out
I'm grabing my hair when I'm spitting it out and I'm losing my patience I can't
Take it I'm covering my ears and I'm thankful for everyfan that I get, but i
Can't take a s... in the bathroom without someone standing by it
If all I saw was gangsters comin' up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung to
Cling to, I rolled myself up to become one
Ain't you happy I chose rap? I'm a monster
Streets they see me, they can't believe my achievements
Cultural-strata, persona is that of a non-needer
'Cause I don't need nada except for Prada beaver
From cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
Tell my G's don't flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies don't freeze at funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix
Caked up trying to take what I'm eatin'
Came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy mouth, while hardly a man's man
Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebels and Stella McCartneys
For years, all that how can I not be dead?
This old German said I was a thug with a knotty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wondered where I got my bread
Probably all the stones he see, from my shows overseas
America
Pay attention
Wake up
America
This is not what you think it is
America
Pay attention
This is not what you think it is
Blessed, the Lord is a G, he gotta be
Whose the god of suckers and snitches? The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew a death kiss to Fidel
Castro
He want me to spit this only the strong survive
Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I could see
White cop acquitted for murder
Black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make stop you and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers, athletes and actors
But not enough niggas at NASA
Who gave you the latest dances, trends and fashions?
But when it come to residuals they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even the white tees, blue jeans and red bandanas
America
Pay attention
Wake up
America
This is not what you think it is
America
Pay attention
This is not what you think it is
America
This is not what you think it is
Assassinations, diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people, built a new nation
Involuntary labor took a nice little women
Even took a premature baby, let a man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700s
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Let her sit on the Senate and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair 
She read about herself in the Bible believin' she the reason sin is here
You played her with an apron like bring me my dinner dear
She the nigga here, ain't we in the free world?
Death penalty in Texas killed young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in a double R casualty
Buggin' how I made it out the hood, dazzle me
How far we really from third world savagery?
When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be
America
America
This is not what you think it is
America
This is not what you think it is
America
Conscious and political rappers. It seems to be
A new trend in the Hip-Hop world.
Yeah, check it, uh
Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard lil' longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough, wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin' is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin' to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice - I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MC's, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MC's on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody as the hood as my councilman, uh
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way
Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
It's rarely men conversatin' on ends, probably businessmen
I sense good taste, and they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm try'na keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Says, Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a Black hoe
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most woman who love Jeevanji of Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve to earn man's purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
I don't care about the runaways
I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS
But I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think they're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane
As long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates
They burnt this country to bits
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way
As we enter
Come now we take you on the biggest adventure
Must be dementia, that you ever thought
You could touch our credentials, what's the initials?
You be Jamrock the lyrical official
Send out the order, laws and the rituals
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth we big news, we hood heroes
Break past the anchor, we come to conquer
Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka
And I got the guns
I got the ganja
And we could blaze it up on your block if you want to
Or haze it up stash box in a Hummer
Or you could run up and get done up
Or get something that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us
Direct from us, street intellectuals
And I'm shrewd about decimals
And my man'll speak Patois
And I can speak rap star
Y'all feel me even if it's in Swahili
Habari gani
Nzuri sana
Switch up the language and move to Ghana
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers
Rhythm piranhas
Like true Obamas, unfold the drama
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream murder out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
Queens to Kingston
Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom
Rise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes
Realize you can die any instant
And I can hear the sound of a voice
When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen
Snitching, I can see him pissing on hisself
And he's wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it
Switching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly
Come around and be persistent
That's how you end up in a hitlist
Ain't no bad man business
No evidence
Crime scene, fingerprint-less
Flow effortless
Casual like the weekends
No pressure when
We're comfy and decent
We set this off beasting
Hunting season
And, frankly speaking...
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream murder out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream murder out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
The ill reminisce and think about the fly days
Nothing like them eighties summer NY days
Hop on the NB5 days
Mopeds, pro keds, city split five ways
How it all started, fifth floor apartment
A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects
A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners
Now chillin' with ? enjoying massages
Check out the oracle, bred from city housing
Nas, higher risin' dead?
I remember seeing Shan chillin' in his Audi
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba
I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it in your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today
I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
'Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the law
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
'Cause you're a big girl now
Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking 'bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say Oh God
Every hoe that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, Ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl see the world is yours
Get yours nigga
'Cause Imma get mine
In due time
Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines
I say this one time
The last time, I swear to y'all
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killas crawl
And snitches call police
All these niggas and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas in cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Betta slow up
Before you get your ass on up
Nigga never gonna grow up
Drinkin' the Henney
But he know he gonna throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? The future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted and ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace chasin' the papas
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things
I ain't fuck with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gonna rhyme wit you
'Cause now I'm into big things
You know I can't do that shit no more
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gonna stand on the corner
I'm into big things
Now the talk is small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style Imma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I'm glad y'all stopped and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga nod
Rocks are glistenin'
Can't stop my mission
Make anotha LP drop
I'm hittin'
With the new shit exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!
I go past y'all
Y'all got the glass jar
And when I hit it, admit it
Y'all on y'all ass y'all
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gun up the dough
You want to score
But you really don't want to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me
Is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out
Where ya clique now
Where you sit now
In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles
And I pack heat
Make you run laps
Like a pro athlete
An' I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
Imma tell you what's real
An' what could stop you from makin' a mil
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high wit you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'
Not for forever
At least to 140
Pray for me
I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown on Berry Gordy
Good God
Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Now the talk is small talk
'Cause now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Talking that old off the wall back to Africa shit again
I'm trying to get up OUTTA here
Not that white stuff!
Listen... to reason
Pretty baby baby listen...
A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take him shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel looking real, airbrushed nails
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishing I could be the one man; but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - following week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up mah, fronting like you naive
Pusherman's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs
And there goes... a black girl... lost
Like Isis, she got you heart broke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who's ever getting down and trifeless
To get his mind all you do is give him something priceless
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice tricking on you, you never listen
To this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home wanting more from a college degree
Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop them off, letting some nigga knock you off
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you being lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost
You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong
They said this day would never come.
They said our sights were set too high.
They said this country was too divided;
Too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose.
They Said, They Said ...
And though it seems heaven sent,
We ain't ready to have a black President
And though it seems heaven sent,
We ain't ready to have a black President
They forgot us on the block
Got us in the box
Solitary confinement
How violent are these cops?
They need an early retirement
How many rallies will I watch?
I ain't got it in me to march
I got a semi to spark
The game's in a drought
Public housing, projects
Cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique
Either getting money
Or running from homicide trial
That's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich
Still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius
To whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge
Now living with my feet up
Never defeated
So a president's needed
Y'know these colored folks and Negroes
Hate to see one of their own succeeding
America, surprised us
And let a black man guide us
And though it seems heaven sent,
We ain't ready to have a black President
And though it seems heaven sent,
We ain't ready to have a black President
What's the black pres. thinkin' on election night
Is it how can I protect my life?
Protect my wife?
Protect my rights?
Every other president was nothin' less than white
'Cept Thomas Jefferson and mixed Indian blood
And Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like 'what the fuck', loadin' they guns up
Loadin' up mines too, Ready to ride
'Cause I'm ridin' with my crew
He dies - we die too
But on a positive side,
I think Obama provides Hope - and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try and love one another, so many political snakes
We in need of a break
I'm thinkin' I can trust this brotha
But will he keep it way real?
Every innocent n!gga in jail - gets out on appeal
When he wins - will he really care still?
I feel ...
And though it seems heaven sent,
We ain't ready to have a black President
And though it seems heaven sent,
We ain't ready to have a black President
Say a prayer for do we have to?
You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor
In love with a slave master
USA most brave rapper
Jesse car-jacker
Uncle Tom-kidnapper
Ask around
Bentley Coupe off the Richter
B!tch-called-life, I pimped her
What?
Politics, politricks
Klan-shooter
Deacon for defense
Progress-producer
Nothing on the stove
A survival-booster
Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through - to help
Anything we need done, we gotta do for self
New-improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60's again
N!ggas ain't hippies again
We ain't falling for the same traps
Standing on the balconies
Where they shot the King at
McCain got apologies
Ain't nobody hearing that
People need honesty
And though it seems heaven sent,
We ain't ready to have a black President
And though it seems heaven sent,
We ain't ready to have a black President
Barack Obama.
I know you can feel the magic baby
Turn the muthafuckin' lights down
Esco watup?
What up homie
I mean
This is what you expected ain't it?
Let's Go
Turn the music up in the headphones
Yah, that's perfect
You gotta take your time by making a nigga wait on this muthafucka
Make a nigga mad and shit like
Niggaz usually start rapping after 4 bars nigga go in
I could start dancin on this muthafucka, yeah
We just come out of nowhere
I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for dem
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly end up back in the hood, like fuck it then
Huddling over the oven, we was like brothers then
Though you was nothing another then the son of my mother's friend
We had governin', who would have thought the love would end
Like ice cold albums, all good things
Never thought we'd sing the same song that all hoods sing
Thought it was all wood grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all of the disaster that one could bring
Could bring? Should blame the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain
Forever be in debt and that's never a good thing
The pressure of success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out of the worst in every person, even the good saint
But though we rehearsed it, it just ain't tha same
When ya put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things like cars, jewelry, and this thing
Jealously, ego and pride and this brings
It all to a head, like a coin, chit ching
The root of all evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the post and the point
I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for em
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, I'm like fuck it then
I feel like black militant, taking over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love em
Can't clean up my act up for good, too much thug in em
Probly end up back in the hood, I'm like fuck it then
I'm back in the hood, they're like Hey Nas
Blowin' on purp, reflecting on they lives
Couple of fat cats, couple of A I's
Dreamin' of fly shit, instead of the grey skies
Gray 5's, hate eyes, wishin our reign dies
Pitch sling pies, and niggaz they sing why?
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jailtime
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building,
I'm feeling the whirlwind of beef I inhale in,
Just like an acrobat, ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire
Sippin 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness, against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for em
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, I fuck it then
I feel like black militant, taking over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love em
Can't clean up my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, I'm like fuck it then
Uh
Yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be tellin' you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out strugglin, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killin' shorty future, I wonder how do we last it
Underground in they casket? Ancestors turnin'
I'm learnin somethin' every day, there is no Lazareth
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggaz is chillin', gettin' high, relaxin
Envisionin, ownin shit, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give a brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
For reperations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop bein controlled, we black zombies
Aiyyo we trapped in our own brain, fuck behind bars
We've already gone insane
They've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfillin reality; too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of dem
Can't have one or two guns without squeezin 'em
On our own people and, fuck black leaders
Cause whites ain't got none leadin them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophetless
All get down and get up
Victims walkin' 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Faintin, shoutin, catchin Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doin' it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demostrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies
You scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggaz with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is unGodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie
Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggaz won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggaz...

Blunts, fallin', ashtray
Alchemist you know me man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes right on the spot in the studio
Soon as I hear the track; you know what I'm sayin'?
Word but I wanted to bring a couple of books to the studio today
Man I found these shits up in the crib man in boxes man
I don't even remember when I was writing these shits
Or what's in these shits man probably a bunch of bullshit man
Fuck it check it
How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liers all day
Soul on ice death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed cursed worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal 'cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is I'ma prince I'ma get slain
Some do minor shit swear they on the top of they game
Ya rhymin' is called Vagina Monologue
It kinda supports theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes
Oh shit Tina - I been lookin' for this bitch number damn.
No this rhyme is weak...
This is week I remember this bullshit right here
Gandhi was a... what the fu..?
Gandhi was a fool, nigga fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach ya plights of conquest
The money's ya religion sky the limit live life
Numbers is big business makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks thiefs murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbin my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and liers and squares...
My people be projects or jail never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my 2way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci god poverty's real
I can't fight you cause you would sue me niggas be groupies
I see imitators tryin' to make albums spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealing Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Swoop it's crap this can't be
My book of rhymes
This can't be my book of rhymes writing this bullshit!
Nah neva that fuck that, aw why you laughin' Alchemist?
Huh you a funny nigga... naw yeah
I'm tellin' you I'ma come up with some new shit now
Fuck that I'ma write again now fuck that
I musta been high on some shit mmm what the fuck is this?
Look how we treat pregnancy women in the 'hood
Our values so low our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we shoulda heeded
Cause now we need it
We older almost able t...
I'm jealous of you how come you so beautiful?
Smelling fresh youthful intelligent while I'm stressin' and shit
Aiyo I envy you 'cause all you do is smile and things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset 'cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute we both need ya mother's attention
I must be crazy jealous of my own baby infant
Yeah... ay yo Jungle... ay yo Wiz...
Come on man... Let's do this
It's a Braveheart party y'all
C'mon
Throw your hands up 'cause we wanna dance
Don't be afraid just take a chance
'Cause this beat will rock your body
Get up on the floor and party
Now y'all tell me what y'all wanna do
Thinkin' while I have a drink or two
Throw your hands up everybody
Get up on the floor and party
I move at night, respect my gangsta
Ready for whatever you bring, the mood is right
The club is righteous, tight with family
Squeezin on big old bubbles with no panties
Ladies who's sexually free
And once in a while live on the wild side, kinky and nasty
Middle fingers up and say Fuck the world
Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl
And my fellas, two time felons, two nine tote and lethal
Quick to leave you wide open, if you gettin' tore down
Blowin' a blunt cloud, and the DJ's makin' you feel thugged out
Put yo hands up
I pull in a V12 drop all red
Look at ma with that cat paw tat on'er leg
Come here girl can I kiss you, let me lick you
Show you what your body made for, you're official
You could be my baby mama lookin' like that
What you drink, champagne or Cognac
What you like dancin diamonds, Dolce Gabbana
Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada
A nigga like Jungle to always come through
Shine in yo hood whenever the fuck you want to
'Cause I'ma B.R.A.V., E.H.E.A.R.T. from QB
Put'em up...
I'm blaze, haze for days
Blackout thinkin' of ways to get paid
Mac out corner I got it's all laid
Shorty, with a nice round ass in my face
Now do she want me to touch her?
Or do she want me to see?
Fuck is she comin' wit me
A true BHG Wiz, not complex
Chin checks if it get hectic
Nigga Braveheart respected
Get bent at the bar, talk shit, walk it
And if I can't talk it, the false big cop a case
I'm here to blaze, roll up a dutch and take it to the face
Throw yo hands up
Nas
Breathe
In America you'll never be free
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Damn, can a nigga just breathe?
Braveheart still QB's finest
Grindin', enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shinin' you can see a nigga breathe
Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis
Crews with a hammer, jealous heart I can't stand 'em
Haters are scandalous, damn can't a nigga just breathe?
To all my niggas gettin' money in the streets
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Light up my trees and I just breathe
I twist 'em baby mama be victim
Chronic leaf hittin' all kinds of heat wit' 'em
Wisdom, from pot to piss in to higher position
Intense hustle it's pain like a pinched muscle
Till it rains and my Timbs stain my socks
Till I dodge enough shots and the presiding judge slams the mallet and says life I'm a guap
Then I cop, then I yacht, then I dot
Island hoppin' away from nightmare holders
Cowboy slingers who shoot up any club to see they names ring loud on some FBI poster
Must be on X or he coked up
Suggestin' I post a bail I'm like yes 'cause we soldiers
We just gettin' older and time we still in our prime
I can't afford a new arrest on my folder
Nigga breathe
In America you'll never be free
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Damn can a nigga just breathe?
Braveheart still QB's finest
Grindin' enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shinin' you can see a nigga breathe
Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis
Crews with a hammer, jealous heart I can't stand 'em
Haters are scandalous, can't a nigga just breathe?
To all my niggas gettin' money in the streets
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Light up my trees and I just breathe
I'm fresh out of city housin'
Ain't have too many options
Pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded
Plenty Henny in me envy with simply ???
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me
The high life, the fly life, Pierre Hardy
Imitation of Christ
Ice wear Gaudis since '94 floor seats
The Lex was an excellent choice not fast
The pestilence of the ghetto would form me
As a shorty to push nothin' less than a 740
With fresh linens sip Pellegrino's with Airs on
They sick mix in their water with airborne
Oh they so sick
Look how I got 'em all crazy look at that
You gotta let it out
Stress ain't good man, you gotta breathe
The light is there.
See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
Let's go!... Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --
Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
'Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
'Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
'Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, Mr. Jones please come get your child
'Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild
Greatest man - The great-greatest man alive
Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge
Nas, Nas you don't stop
Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop
Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop
Tell 'em Pop
I told him as a youngster
Rest In Peace Ray Charles
Badge, we burnin' cash, now baby do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted your ass since before I saw you screamin'
Hate you so much right now
Should've saw the man in angry black women
Ashes of a demon - I'm leaving
There comes a day in your life
When you want to kick back
Straw hat on the porch
When you old perhaps
Want to gather your thoughts
Have a cold one, Brag
To your grand kids on how life is golden
So I'ma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's
Of the whole rap pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that could've made you career stop
All that, and your man is still here, and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all, See I almost felt a tear drop
When was the last time you heard real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time.
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Oh, I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my lifelong anthem
Can't forget about the old school
Bam, Cas, Mel lie Mel flash,
Rocks steady spinning on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy when to Jazzy
Fresh Prince, Fat Boys broke up,
Rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it mess you up when Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love
When was the last time you heard real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time.
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Oh, I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my lifelong anthem
Unforgettable, UnSubmittable I go by N now, just one syllable
It's the N 'cause the game tied is the same vibe
Good times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help records sells more than creative lines
And I don't want to keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past, enough of it aight then
Nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown's 25
When was the last time you heard real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time.
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I'm unforgettable too
Niggas wanna talk about this rap shit... Niggas wanna talk
About this money... 'Bout these cars... these homes... these
Labels, clothes, sneakers... Big money shit... Now e'erybody
Tryna get rich... Then get rich nigga fuck it
Some rap pioneers be them crack heads, when they speak
You see missin' teeth, silver chain wit' a silver piece
Niggas ya grandfather age
They pants still hangin' down they leg talkin' 'bout they ain't paid
And they hate you 'cause they say you ain't paid dues
And - was stealin' and robbin' 'em
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or 'cause MC's skills are loss
It's 'cause we can't see ourselves as a boss
Deep rooted through slavery, self hatred
The Jewish stick toegther, friends in high places
We on some low level shit
We don't want niggas to ever win, see everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper but few flow fatal
It's fucked up it all started from two turntables
When they crown you, and you rise up
To ya position, carry on tradition
When they knight you, and you go to fight, go to war
Don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry, c-carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, when you rep what we rep
You carry on tradition
Now some of these new rappers got they caps flipped backwards
Wit' the fingers intertwined in some gang sign madness
I got an exam to see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers I don't understand ya code
You have ya man shoot you like in that Soprano episode
Do anything to get in the game, mixtapes
You spit hate against bosses, hungry fucks are marvelous
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate
Vocalists, niggas I could have wrote ya shit
I had off time, was bored wit' this, I could have made my double LP
Just by samplin' different parts of the Nautilus
Still came five on the charts wit' zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for ya bricks, it got good to ya
You started tellin' the bigger dogs to call it quits? What?!
Now niggas got the studio poppin' it's mad clearer
Engineers got us ear plugs and still hear us
The live in the park sound
Versus the state of the art sound we on the charts now
From British walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, wit' our black cards now
Fortune 500 listed, brunch at Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, wit' rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
'Cause I'm what, every dime lust
We use to be a ghetto secret, can't make my mind up
If I want that, or the whole world of people
Now I carry on tradition
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead ones gone
We miss 'em, I promise I'mma carry on tradition
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
I want someone who like the champagne I like
My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain't afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She love or she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herbs, natural medicine, she cooking good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there's no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you're heaven sent
Your smile put me at ease
You're the woman I need, but where is she
I hate when people write me hostile texts on account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question, what are they expecting
I be trying to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever I'm rolling in dough, swimming in a pool of cash
God, wouldn't they know, or am I a fool or ass
I'm well known, got people coming at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don't keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond, I gallivant around the equator
And that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pino Grigio Cris with some lime what is this?
An immaculate version of Me and My Bitch by Biggie
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me
Yeah, yeah, let's pour some cherry wine
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, yeah we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, Hey yo Salaam, yeah, I think they know the time
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah
Life is good, life is good, yeah
Life is good, no matter what
Life is good, life is good
Life if good, yeah
No matter what
Life is good
And as a special treat this evening
I have asked America's foremost young poet
To read his latest poem for us
Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus
Everybody watch him
Ladies and gentlemen..
Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus
We-we-we came a long way
Ladies and gentlemen..
Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus
Everybody watch him
Ladies and gentlemen..
Yo...
Yo... yo...
Power and crime, the thugs slingin powder and dimes
Twenties of D, is yo' niggaz wilder than mine?
My niggaz bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards
For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Lou Cabrasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's Godfather shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings
Plaques awards applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way
Niggaz with names, livin' off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothin' changin
Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus
Everybody watch him}
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't runnin'
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunnin
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war
1 - and I'm well prepared
2 - we can take it there
You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shinin - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggaz know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggaz to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard
You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nuttin
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop frontin
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of 'em dyin'
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flyin, high in the aircraft winin
- And dinin, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
?? To gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm gettin' head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
The Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block
Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus
Everybody watch him
Ladies and gentlemen..
Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus
We-we-we came a long way
Ladies and gentlemen..
Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus
Everybody watch him
Ladies and gentlemen..
{Hydro Drops weed skit follows}
And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings
That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
But by force I'm suggesting
Ya count your blessings
I've got love and assurance
I've got new health insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings
And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
Better count your blessings
Cause yo this year, can't wait till it gets here
7-21-09 my first song will shine
And it's amazing I'm about to be raisin'
Another main man and like his dad they'll praise him
And some will hate him, just 'cause we buildin' a nation
Like Bob did with Damian
The world will embrace him, girls'll chase him
Foresee, they will not break him
And when I'm not around, you look for God and thank him
And I've got somewhere to dress for
And I've got no need to stress for
And so I'll always put my best forth
And count my blessings
And they'll be no need for tissues
'Cause there will be no further issues
If you got someone who miss you
Man, count your blessings
I've got love and assurance
And I've got new health insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings
And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
Better count your blessings
You wishin' you were sittin' in the top position
Picture perfect, nothing less 'cause you deserve it
Without the Hermes, you'd have a hurtin'
You knew that you was destined for greatness, for certain
You see the over-zealous, they be thirstin', caught up in emotion
You keepin' your composure like Gershwin
Songs by Earth Wind keep you in the zone, writing verses
So when your pocket's light, know that you have a heavy purpose
We've got preschool and daycare
We've got pension and welfare
And though not all will play the game fair
Still I count my blessings
I've joy in abundance
I've got life full of substance
I've got meetings and functions
So I count my blessings
I've got something to live for
I've got surplus to give more
And we're all welcome through His door
So I count my blessings
And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
So I count my blessings
I think you lookin' too hard for it
With the double R under your garage door
Appreciate the things you work hard for
Hey, count your blessings
Count your blessings
So don't be mad if you ain't fly y'all
You got the means to reach the level I'm on
You should know there's only one Nas y'all
But count your blessings, count your blessings
And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings
That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
Not by force I'm suggesting
Ya count your blessings
I've got love and assurance
I've got new health insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings
And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
Better count your blessings
I dream of the day I can go back to when I was born
Laying in your arms wishing you was here today mom
Wish you'd appear just for a second from heaven
My tears would be gone I wouldn't be rapping this song
I'd be happy driving up to your eight bedroom mansion
Up late laughing 'bout the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchanted beyond...
Galileo's understanding pass the milky way and all the planets
There's something out there greater but only god knows
Scientists claim we came from apes but they lies tho
That was part of our conversation
A spark when up and start blazing thinking of how amazing she was
An angel gave me love
I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
I pray when I'm married my wife
I have one of your skills but mom you could never be replaced
I give my life up just to see you one more day and to have
One more dance with you Mama
I wish you were here I miss you more each second I breath
You resting in peace forever I accepted you free
A blessing to me
I see you dressed in all white smiling at me
Happy knowing everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter just one more time
My chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th '02 that when the gates of heaven opened up for you
To stroll through
Beautiful Ann Jones
Job is done raisin ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on and now I'm good
Job well done you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride mommy dance with him
And you been my guide through all the trouble I face
They playing our song the light be
My hand on your waist
I grab your other hand trying not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed dreaming I could have
One more dance with you Mama I love you forever ma
You have always lived through me
Always
Check it out
I call it
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
I call it shit for niggas with daughters
I call this shit for niggas with daughters
I call this shit for niggas with daughters
I call this shit for niggas with daughters
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it then caught my rage, like
How could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised like
A princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switching women, pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster can't be mad, I love her
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail- dead that
Wait till he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You 17, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure but she rocking with it
This for niggas wit' daughters
I call this, shit for niggas wit' daughters
Yo, not sayin' that our sons are less important
Shit for niggas wit' daughters
I call this, shit for niggas wit' daughters
I call it, not sayin' that our sons are less important
This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said nas go and get ya kid
She's on twitter, I know she ain't gon post no pic
Of herself underdressed, no inappropriate shit, right
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser then she instagrammed it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Shoulda drove on time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they too nurture teen talents
They grow fast
One day she's ya little princess, next day she talking boy business
What is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God get's us back, he makes us have precious little girls
I call it shit for niggas with daughters
I call this shit for niggas with daughters
I call this shit for niggas with daughters
I call this shit for niggas with daughters
And I ain't tryna mess ya thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons, how fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with the sawed off
'Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love
This is a journey into the world's most largest And notorious projects, Queensbridge. Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers.
He held a mass appeal and a little boy smile
Depressed, has a complex, his mouth was foul
You need to stay around, I feel like telling some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory
Hung around my man's Like and Big Trevor
Trevor's still locked up, Like's getting his cheddar
Corn chip? Buckwheat? Look alive, it's Mega!
But it's so hard to put a coward's name in my rap
Always acting tough, a jokester be fronting
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothing
'Cause when brethren don't return love it don't stress him
'Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughing to the bank and shit
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid,
Mega, for the record, you can suck my dick!
Bitch, you from around the way; it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
So they say the Bridge is over, the Bridge is over
Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the Bridge is over, the Bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies,
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
It's like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're button ain't gotten back to me!
Asking a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B.
Nature moved to Marcy
Man dick riding Nature, nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy
Backward ass niggas...
Man, fuck them niggas, go head with the progam, man, proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood; anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, it's just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
I put the name on the map after Marly and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleaning up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was busting his gun to get your weak chain back?
They don't respect you; a check's due for me for your fame
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be king
I'm representing Queensbridge, U.S.A.
Where two SK's go off every day
New flesh lay
Besides my man Ricky, Nas, the true ruler, is back
So haters say
The Bridge is over, my dick!
The Bridge'll never be over, as long as I'm alive and breathing!
Braveheart to the graveyard!
I'm the William Wallace of this shit.
Ayo P, Prodigy, I got love for you man, I love you man,
You know what I'm saying?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle!
You can't save everybody!
Niggas invited you to the hood, rep it right my nigga!
Be untouchable my nigga, so we can be Mobb for life for real, and that's real!
Aiyo, Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit, man!
I'm not your father, man!
Be your own man, stand on your own two!
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga, or don't even rep this!
Aiyo Mega, you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets, man!
Young niggas is in the grind! Where you be at, man?
Niggas be bucking! Why you never bucking? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfucking Neo Brown of the fucking hood?
It's disgusting, man!
Stay out the magazines! Keep my name out your motherfucking mouth!
There's no more room for jealousy!
That means the cowards get out, and the real niggas stay!
Niggas been hating me since I been nine,
Shining with suede motherfucking Balis on in silks!
I'ma always be the young don!
Y'all niggas come up and get this money and move on, baby!
Q.B.
Nas Two-thousand-four, yeah. L, whattup?
L.E.S. Prophesy!
Nas Yeah.
L.E.S. Prophesy baby!
Word to mama, any lineup of rhymers
Could bring any drama, anytime, the city's mine
Nas Is Like, Love Undying, Money's My Bitch
In Thugz Mansion, thugs dancin' around the fly shit
Pharaoh garment's Prada, Egyptian camelback-riders
Pyramid architects, Perignon bottles, money, jewelry want me to come
Get me, hit me but don't miss me, you history
Lead flowin' around like a Frisbee, Italian dons from Sicily kiss me
This ain't 50, this ain't Jigga, this ain't Diddy, this ain't Pretty
Pain, power, pussy and pistols, lyrically no one, hold none near me, hear me
Kids cheer me like The Count of Monte-Cristo
Steady poundin' soundin' like G without the lisp though
My big bro told me plain and simple, Nas do not look back
Watch where you took rap, no bookbags and trucker hats
Just army jacks and diamonds that's flashin'
What the fuck is that, freestyle
Like Paul, Michael and Matthew, Peter, James and Andrew
Phillip, Simon and Judas -- I'm disciple of music
Street beats is the main thing minus the traitor
And I'm not a dictator, I'm the righteous invitin' you haters
Inside the life of the greatest, it'll take you through something real
Get a smack in your face, 'cause I hurt up, trauma-tize, llama
Bust shells, destroy yet try'ta prevent violence
If I present iron somebody dyin', don't even worry 'bout it
Then dress warm for the cemetery climate
When I speak I need cemetery silence, terror
See me, gold Hummers, Lamborghinis, man who stole the summer
Hand straight gleamin', if I don't know you toe-tag you
Drag you through the cement, fo-fo maggie
Body parts in my man's Maserati car, then party hard in Madagascar
While rigor mortis'll grab ya, him retarded, I'm pass that
Gloves on, where the mask at? Too many love songs
All the thugs gone, what happened? Where's the passion?
Rappers battlin' non-rappers, carryin' on backwards
Laughin' sayin' Nas thinks he's Farrakhan preachin' blackness
Hell yeah, awareness is my alias
Word to the 'Braveheart' written on my bare chest
The realest, HERE IT IS!
Lord, this spear, huh
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Nyabinghi
Man a Mau Mau Warrior, despair, eh
Fear and desperation, no depression can't tarry ya
This spear, hey
Ayatollah, Idi Amin, Mennelek
Man a Masai Warrior, despair, eh
Fear and desperation, no depression can't tarry ya
This spear
Like burning spear and such and such before me
Who all fought for the cause and this spear, eh
Enforcing all the laws
The master of the masses
One has power, the other one lacks it
Guns are power, controlled by assets
Owned by financial forecasters
Who are the masters? They are the gangsters
They are the bankers, the ones who tax us
The masses, they are us
The sheep, the people, divided in classes
I go off like a Shite bomb and all y'all see I'm on my
War paint on my face, shit, my nine mm on my waist, shit
I'm a problem, shoot up your place, shit
Let a few go then I get low, blazing Haze again
The masters, The Wall Street War Chiefs, the elitists groups
The masses, they pray to Jesus, saying he will see us through
The masters are the aristocratic
The masses ask if the Most High is on his way here
I'm trying to stay clear, my mind is my modern day Spear
Hey, I say, this spear, huh
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Nyabinghi
Man a Mau Mau Warrior, despair, eh
Fear and desperation, no depression can't tarry ya
This spear, hey
Ayatollah, Idi Amin, Mennelek
Man a Masai Warrior, despair, eh
Fear and desperation, no depression can't tarry ya
This spear
Like burning spear and such and such before me
Who all fought for the cause and this spear, eh
Enforcing all the laws
This lead into Swiss cheese when the 5th squeeze
Mislead, the media misleads
Scares you to the point where you miss sleep
With that said
This lead with this Ruger and that shooter
Sub-machine gun ratta-tat through you
Copper tops, hollow points will do ya something bad
Our future is
Mislead, three strikes
There's no school when a teacher strikes
This economy, this monopoly
Get no job, just own your property
Now it's back to what comes natural
Must survive any how you have to
Despair, desperation
But I have no fear when I hold this spear
Make some bwoy know mi nah smile
'Cause this spear nah beg friends
Man a run racket, man a run scheme
Man a run race, man a rundown Benz
Can't trust a she nor we nor
Eye in a contact lens
Man a run from police and a rundown wealth
And dollars and nah make sense
So, rise up to my defense
Hollow pointed is my preference
Should have been deterred, don't know what you heard
Get referred by the wrong reference
When this spear start dispense
It a fly and a tear through fence
Dismember your members and all of your limbs
Body bust inna 'nuff segments
Well, man a run drugs, man a run risk
Man all a run out a time and ends
Man a run up and down and a run fi dem life
And a run down this month rent
Nutin' nah gwan a yard and food deh a road
Then man hafi go touch pavement
Despair was a tool that was used to enslave man
And make manservant
Escape from Despair and Desperation
Becomes more urgent
Mankind needs to cleanse and wash out dem soul
With spiritual detergent
A distant army, a distant relative
Controlling the circumference
And any man move with no permission
They're feeling the circumstance of
This spear, hey
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, man a, eh
Man a Mau Mau Warrior, despair, eh
Fear of your recession and depression can't tarry ya
This spear, hey
Inner city youth dem rise it up disguised as AK-47
This spear, eh
And anytime them clap it up the whole city level
This spear
Like Burning spear and such and such before I
Who all fought for the cause and this spear, eh
They can't ignore me, no
Uh
Pushin drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants
Yeah X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicide and feds on the blocks where I played, b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause, or be-cause
Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the Devil
Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin niggaz swing razors in the front row, then out in the streets
The car show, 560's, chemical afros
Acuras pumpin Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be, asses bustin' out of they clothes
Wearin lip gloss, big door knockers pealin they earlobes
So where them years go? Where the old gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here doe, so
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; right?
Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
In army boots, yellin' Join the armed forces!
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of naked crawlin in the carpet offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be servin' the beast too long
The murderers wearin police uniforms, confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin to the music I chose
And Peachtree Atlantic crackheads was tootin they nose
In frozen corners of Chicago, loaded up Llama's children
With fo'-fo's, and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates, headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin' us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; right?
Niggaz used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buyin hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin
Till awareness started penetratin
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin' liquor
Just to prove we some creative niggaz
Turnin' nothin' into somethin', is God work
And you get nothin' without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggaz in chains
From Greene to Sing-Sing, I'm wantin y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, he takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got God sun on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected from Henny's and gettin' blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo because of that
I'm still blazin', goin' out for the cause
Still rockin' stockin caps, not for the waves, obeyin no laws
And it's like that
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; right?
When it comes to sex advice I'm the one you call

The do's and don'ts that should happen in the bed first
For sure fuckin' with the typical whore, because
Your local bodega is your supplier and
Cause you saw what happened to Tupac and Mike Tyson
Especially if you're large some hos are trife

Or who you hang with fronted on who borrowed your watch yo
Then you can fuck shorty the same night yo

Pop-up the questions, I can answer them best
Signing off Dr. Knockboot at your request
Peace
Uh, Uh, Where am I going?
Where am I? Yo, it's ill
Yo my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
Mack in my right arm, Tequila bottle in
My left arm like Cristian
Watching my life go, keeping myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hells men
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed
I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My deckited lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways, put out the hayes blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in televison
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swigg
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, lost again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all, things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...
What's up niggas, ay yo, I know you ain't talkin' 'bout me dog
You, what?
You been on my dick nigga, you love my style, nigga
Brace yourself for the main event
Y'all impatiently waitin
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best? Pac, Nas and Big
Ain't no best, East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts, left chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage?
Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come outta my throne
I got this, locked since '9-1
I am the truest, name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiin Sophie fame, kept my name in his music
Check it
Ay, y'all faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the fuckin' ring
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and fogotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face
Y'all some well wishers, friendly actin', envy hidin snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin, heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef
Started cockin up my weapon, slowly loadin up this ammo
To explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle
This for dolo and it's manuscript, just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint
First, Biggie's ya man, then you got the nerve to say that you better than Big
Dick suckin lips, whyn't you let the late, great veteran live
God's son across the belly, I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad, watchin his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin women
Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well life is hard, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatent or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your buildin
Callin my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was gave you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the god
Wearin Jaz chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class
You Tae-bo hoe, tryna' work it out, you tryna' get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna' kick knowledge
Nah, I'm tryna' kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rockafeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas?
Philly's hot rock fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks?
Ne-gro please
You no mustache havin', with whiskers like a rat
Compared to Beans you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Caine, to Herb, to Big
And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons
Ha, R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick
Sean Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss
Uh... yeah... uh...
Blessings in life to the children
They say life is like 5 days
Words of a old man with silver hair in his wheel chair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
'Cause animals and sweetness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job, moved a divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, coppin' the five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war we life stealers
Hollow tip, lead busters there's no heaven or hell
Dead is dead, fuckers
And your soul is with God
Your mind keeps lurkin' to earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga toned in the pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born
And every nigga gone
And for every brotha breathin'
Live to see another mornin'
It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality loaded with vast stories
Of lust, greed, and contempt no street is exempt
Extended clip shots hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin' 'em hustlers pitch rocks
All you paintin' pictures of my pain
Illustrate the city in vain
Fallin' deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind
In these fatal times, vesh crimes
Nickel play the nine and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them baby's cry
Still I'm sayin' why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin' high to relieve the pain
Breathin' in the game, exhalin'
Guilts and the shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring
Look at anthrax, I stand back through
Hopin' I make it tomorrow
My skin is a art gallery, right
With paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benz's and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely...
Hold me, it's gettin' darker
Nasir bin Olu Dara bis do Allah
Fisk full of dollars in a dice game god
D & D glass cloth Kangols guided by angel with white wings
Nas the Viking fresh from my ankles thankful
Gangster see gangster do I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up gut 'em like fish swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors pellets spraying your familia
You screaming like you love war
Everybody's crazy
Somebody's gonna get shot get rob get done get stomp get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thug love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
Peace fuck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqo fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
Cause now Instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggaz get flashier houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but
I know where niggaz sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War plus money man I got too many spots
Hungry niggaz get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me your not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggaz back on the block what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggaz that go t prices on their head so high
Their own my will take the contract surprise
So we play a mental game intimidation
Got pussy niggaz get pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggaz would step up wait for the day an
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault for the safe
I got some niggaz with acid get it thrown in your face
Play dirty catch your moms in J-30
Yo...
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin' green that's keepin' us goin'
Allah Havoc gettin' right, on them 747
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin' green that's keepin' us goin'
Unconditional love showin
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Forty decide, on the First side right
Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearin the same shit for days
Not carin, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggaz, y'all too pretty
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggaz, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, puttin' out them songs
Knowin' that my niggaz come strong, so let's get it on
We just gettin' warm, Operation Quiet Storm
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Half P and I's got it in the smash for sure
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at
Aiyyo I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You ballet? They read your obituary, in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait till I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coathangers, got loot with dopeslangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rosters, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck bein trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
Theives on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yellin', Freeze black kids!
Got my niggaz in the pen, eatin octopus
Wishin they was on the blocks with us
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest?
Yo...
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin' green that's keepin' us goin'
Allah Havoc gettin' right, on them 747
Dunn you fam to me, and only family

Blowin' green that's keepin' us goin'
Unconditional love showin
Yo you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin' green that's keepin' us goin'
Unconditional love showin
Are you fam to me, and only fam to me
That can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Dirty fingernails, reachin' in my pocket pullin knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
Out this lifestyle we live, iced out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason bein we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggaz out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus kid
Rap niggaz shit they drawers
Yo they probably did
I aircondition y'all niggaz, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listenin hard
To my thugs in the prisonyard, bench-pressin 200 pounds and up
Feelin' like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, bein looked at, as uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggaz get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggaz move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggaz get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest we hit you
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin' green that's keepin' us goin'
Unconditional love showin
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Forty decide, Forty-First side right
Yeah youknahmsayin? Not for nuttin baby
Knahmsayin wanna give a shout out to my peoples
YouknowhatImean? Gamble, Ill Will
Killa Black, my brother
It's never gonna be another
Word up...
Yeah, you know how we do things
Yo Nas...
I don't think they wanna FUCK with this
Gangsta shit... fo' sho'
Check it out
It's on, and once again I bring niggaz the rough
Fuckin' with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the super sports Rally
Beatin' up the block, leavin' these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici
I flip this shit like I'm Kamaneze
Now dey a motherfuckin see me
They try to breeze me, but I got niggaz in New York
Comin' kama-kize, sparkin this shit that keep me off the heezee
Jay-Hovah, he with my man came over
To scoop me, blowin' dukey, in the black Range Rover
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for
Tell these niggaz why we here
Nuttin but the New York to Texas connection
Nuttin but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin', think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggaz, come through for niggaz
Scarface get a call and we shootin niggaz
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Tryin' to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it
You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at
So I can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin cap
Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information
Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
'Cause when it come down to the come down;
I'ma pull the motherfuckin plug on him
Walk up to his face and then gone
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin mind
Him and whoever standin by, I'll tell these niggaz, Let's go
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwin' up his own blood
With a slug in his motherfuckin mug
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor
A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five machetes
Attack 'em like Freddie, then we toastin over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin' two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin
'Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa
Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
'Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they don't
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down 'cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved 'cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
See how the government will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said At least that nigga ain't ugly!
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me, and I plan to over through the devil
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...
Uh, lawd lawd Jah
Uh, shhh, lawd lawd Jah
Ehahaha
Shit is all true
Mmm, Fried chicken
Fly vixen
Give me
Heart Disease
But need
You in my kitchen
You a bird, but you ain't a key
Got wings but you can't fly away from me
Driving in your bucket seats
All the way from Kentucky
To fuck with me
Look what you done to me
Was number one to me!
After you shower
You and your gold medal flour
Then you rub on with hot oil for half an hour
You in your hot tub, I'm looking at you salivating
Dry you off, I got your paper towel waiting
Lay you down 'cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot
Then I flock
To the bed then, Plop
When we done, I need rest
Don't know a part of you that I love best
Your legs or your breast
Misses Fried Chicken, you gon' be a nigga death
Created by southern black women
To serve massa, guest
You gon' be a nigga death
Misses Fried Chicken
You was my addiction
Dripping with high cholest'
Like Greeks with his falafel
Or Italians with his to-mato
Pasta
Or roti is to a Rasta
Trapping me
You and your friend mac and cheese
Candy yams, collard greens
But you knocking me to my knees
It's killing me when I miss, ah
Nothing I need more than a fish fry
Shit, It taste good, I can't lie
It's like you're walking out a tanning saloon
When I pull you out the oven, from baking I got you on my mind
Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing, how you sparkle when I glaze you swine
Hey, my pretty hand hot, it's so feminine
The way you submitted
And how you gave me power
To massaging me to shower
You with lemon water
Marinate you with season you dipping you in chowder
Baby
It's like you at the spa
The way you gently
Lay in the pan
While you enjoying you butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling
On your skin
Despite the funny fragrance
Still I lick my finger frequent
In any event
I'm reflecting on all the signs saying that I got I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you taste made it hard to resist when I put my mouth on you
But that's another issue
Butterflies up in my stomach when I laid EYES on you
Was it infection manifesting?
Confused over the feeling impatiently eating you
Intestinal worm chewing on the walls of my intestine
I'ma eat you until there's nothing left
Till my very last breath
You gon be a nigga death
Despite your good appearance
Cooking swine as a chef
You gon be a nigga death
Who cares if the swine
Is mixed with rat, cat, and dog combined?
Yes, I eat the shit to death
Ain't that some shit?
I'ma eat some shit
Until what I'm eating KILLS ME!
And I choose to do that
Why?
Cause that's just what niggas do
These later days in Babylon
As I watch your children grow
And the years them carry on
And I miss you even more
Still I send them go to school
And tell them
What dem fi know
All of mi friend dem mi salute
Daddi gon and Lenny Screw
Another year has come and past
Man a drop like morning dew
Uncle Warrick sick and gone
When him couldn't catch a flew
Picka T you a mi don
Respect long and overdue
When nothing never did a gwan
You still have on somethin' new
Our friendship ever last
All when one minus from few

Acquaintances will fade
Your real friends wont do you wrong

Who's our 'bout my run
I barely made it out the slums
My value high 'Cause I do more than
Rap about a gun
I made money for niggaz
Y'all never looking out for none
I helped millionaires get to that very position
Some real millionaires see that's ill
Cause look at statistics
Real millionaires
And I ain't talking ghetto riches
Thorough business

Heard your folks bleed in prison
You ain't a G
And if you was

Who's dough is small
Look what's it come to
Our rapport's good no more
We was good before
Till I saw what type a dude you took me for

Because of hatred
Opportunity wasted

No counting your homey pocket
Spare no expense for legal defense
If your homey locked up

Selfishness

No holding out
Yo what happened to the honor?
You're dealing with
Sensitive Pre-Madonna drama
Teflon love

New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin
Pushin cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me
Whatchu up to, the cops gon' bust you
I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered
If God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls
Showin they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's livin' proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother durin the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is bein replaced
Pre-trial hearin is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out - nobody leavin' everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Some niggaz fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggaz are dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this' a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggaz, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them
Southern niggaz ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangstas, we loungin, out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay
The letter say, Nas I got your back - the fools don't play
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and things
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin the hotel room do', to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do, with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' witchu
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you ain't look at it
My folk is yo' folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody gotta make a change
Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigolo
It was difficult for me to find a chick I want
This ain't no sucka for love shit
This ain't no Huxtable kisses and hug shit, first night we fuck shit
And don't call the next day, this a thug's wedding day
In love? will we make it? Let us pray...
In a limo, my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard Bottasmov costumes, this ain't no act, though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes, I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenuptial agreement 'cause Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping but then I deaded the thought
'Cause she deserves Cinderella's Ball and the whole shit
But know this, you fuckin' wit a slit ya throat quick
Vehicular explosions, cigar smokin'
Dark-minded, chart climbin, well-spoken
Safer world of broke men to rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away 'cause this is it, hun
Headed to the Chapel, my niggas laughin'
And it's bafflin 'cause just a year ago
It's weird, though, I knew I'd get married
To who? I knew not, thought of snatchin Halle up from the dreadlock
Pumpin' Sade, my head knot
Finally, I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French, rephrase that
Someone who made my heart stop, couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey
HIV spreadin', everybody bump the same bunnies
The game'll put niggas in they graves right before they part ways with the street
I want a son to greet every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin', tellin' me it's time to eat
I'm gettin' married
It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on the ride
Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative ones say
Knew my wedding would be one day but quickly is this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at old photos, sayin', Damn, he used to twist me
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor Party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, knudged me with his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to City Hall, dressed norm'
Said she would love me Oswald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suit up kings
Gov', you got the ring, Jung', you behave
Maxwell, he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky', Mississippi
Family packed in, my nigga, L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cufflinks, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, just all big to thug it out
My girl walked in glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody can touch
I gotta be cool wit' ya crazy aunts and uncles
'Cause I love you much... 'cause you put up wit my shit
Court cases, baby mommas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter, standin'
Heart poundin' out my chest like a cannon
I'm happy, one of my Groom's men
Under the music says, Don't do it
But they just joke, some crew shit
They playin', I'm gleeful, I'm stayin'
I'm stayin' vows that are all true
Will you take music as your wedded wife?
I do.
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin' to
Gettin' married
Uh... regulate nigga
Bravehearts nigga
Live for this
Some of y'all don't live at all
Get yours nigga
Get yours baby
Uh, yo... yo...
As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
For Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S.
About to shoot us for revolution, that's how you gotta move
A lotta rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar, or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil, help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
Behold before you, one of those, prophetic MC's
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools, they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners...
Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildin's
Rats crawlin', filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, prayers answered
Dreams turned real, what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men, not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments some real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tried to weaken my spirit, it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learn
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily, I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in us, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners... get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners...
You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I so lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A.
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
In a newborn's, first time to be here at last
It shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Read the history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter
Ghetto prisoners... ghetto prisoners...
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners... get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners...
Uh...
Uh... speak without thinkin'...
Speak without speakin'... huh...
Feel without reachin', uh
That's what it's about
It's about that, inner, inner love, yaknawmean?
Cause on the streets is the hood niggaz, uh
And I know he feel us, uh
'Cause he be wit us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uh
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggaz, uh
But he forgive us
He who has ears, let him hear
And he who has sight, let him see
He who has life, let him be
See everything goes through change
Those who know don't talk
And those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggaz
Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today
So long my crimies now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin clips up, countin' bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin me
Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs wit guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood
Little girls have seeds by O.G.'s in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees
Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood
But it's good in the hood
I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood
I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood
Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God, love us the most
Got yo'self a gun
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So...
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
My, first album had no famous guest appearances
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoos real with God's Son across the belly
The boss of rap, you saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and Tupac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames should huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads apparel
But the Q.B. don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast, 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody, uh
Yo, I'm the N the A to the S-I-R
And If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a barber's preciseness; Bravehearted for life
It's the return of the Golden Child, son of a blue's player
So who are you playa? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that Vodka too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judists thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me God's Son, with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is Nasdaq dough, in my Nascar with this Nas flow
Flip the beat back, now it's all reppin'
Hit the record sto', never let me go, get my whole collection, yo
It's, the, return of the Prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit's soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist gliss, I floss
Stick shift, look sick up in that Boxter Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go? Where he rest at?
Where he shop at and dress at?
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back-twister, lingerie-ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta wit' ya, uh
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria
Before I blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front; matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't braver, I'll pull a number like a pager
'Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'mma performer strange, so the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
'Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle; now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise 'cause I'm wise
This is exercise till the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps 'cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch CHiPs, now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
'Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime
Word life, check it
I got it going on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
'Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' them fast, doing this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
'Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is living fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
Halftime
Escobar season has returned...
It's been a long time
Been a long time comin'
Its life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turning back now.
This is what makes me.
This is what I am.
Hear me, lets go
But I won't stop now You gonna hate me I'ma hate you too
'Cause I can't stop now Simple as that
You can hate me now Die motherfucker die motherfucker die
You can hate me nooow You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
About anything that's about to go down
Do it now, Do It now, weak, jealous motherfuckers,
Do it now Fuck y'all
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I dry
Close your eyes, picture me rollin',
Sixes, money foldin
Bitches honeys that swollen
The riches, nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed pulitzer prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators bring aside try watchin my paper
Almost a decade quite impressive
Most of the best N' the sss's
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expanding more to the big screen
Bill gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail
With state dreams
Want me off the scene fast
But good things last
Like your favorite m.c. still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque
Back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest
I suggest
Money is power motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch
Do it now
Chorus I won't stop
Can't stop
You gon'hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
Do it now, I told you do it now lets go
You wanna hate me then hate me
What can I do?
But keep gettin' money
Funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up
Until I made it
Now y'all sayin' that's a clever nigga
Nothing to play with
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood
But can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes
Give 'em to you?
Here's my car and my house
You can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets
Hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that
What you expect hoe
Nickname esco
Took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest
But who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that
Cause niggas feel this right
You think I'm gonna come this far and let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too
Do it now
I like this, I like the way this feels
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates
I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jammin up the border to this game stop
And I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause
While driving, niggas shot out my doors
Plottin, I'm sure to catch me
With they glocks to my jaw
Try stickin me up but I
But I flipped on these ducks You tried
Instead of me
Ambulances were picking them up That's what you get
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer
Guess its just inferior man
Became a monster, atop of the world
Never fallin'
I'm as real as they come
From day one, forever ballin
C'mon
Hey y'all can't see a nigga like me, never in your life
And that's what you can't understand
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
Or save it all for you?
Would I, fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a FLASH
Before reconsidering, this Hell with you
It's tearing my heart in two
I would of fell with you
To Hell with you
If Heaven was a mile away
And you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder finally believing His power?
Even if you couldn't see, but you could feel would you still doubt him?
How would you start acting?
Would you try to put the ki's down?
Thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets He can see now
Would a fiend even want to get high, would he stop smoking?
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for an atheist
It's hard taking this
Racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff
Even if he innocent nigga get on the car put your motherfucking hands up
Thinking I'm a lose it
My mom's in chemo
Three times a week, yo keep trying but people
Is hard and God, your young soldier's not so bold
But need you
This world's my home but world I would leave
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
Or save it all for you?
Would I, fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a FLASH
Before reconsidering, this Hell with you
It's tearing my heart in two
I would of fell with you
To Hell with you
Nigga what you think I'ma stop building
I'ma stop feeling like I'm Amistad's great great grandchildren
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days in the hallways making fake coke
Pass with the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while that same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time to them cats never looked back Cristal blowing dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me
You see the broads and Bentleys is nothing less my nigga spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all I'd buy some new kicks free of any autographs so
Not to be recognized forgive me
It's becoming unbearable
Making hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on the hook there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise
Preachers touching on altar boys
Sodomizing not realizing God is watching before the Lord
How can they do the devil's work?
A man giving another man head in church
Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that I fled the Earth.
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
Or save it all for you?
Would I, fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a FLASH
Before reconsidering, this Hell with you
It's tearing my heart in two
I would of fell with you
To Hell with you
QB
Where the fuck y'all at?
Ha, ha, ha
Yeah, let's go 
Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two seatin'
Can't leave it, the game needs him
So in God's Son we trust, 'cause they know
I'ma give 'em what they want
Another chapter of the cleanest rapper
Distinguished gentlemen
Crooks and Castles on his back, Maybach-er
Exotic lady eye catcher, holla at ya
Call me the chiropractor
Working like Muay Thai class
Can prespire out ya
And of course I've been the boss since back when
Rockin' D-boy Fila, velour and a 190 black Benz
Now they shut down the stores that I'm shoppin'
Used to be train robbin', face covered in stockin'
I'm him
Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two seatin'
Can't leave it, the game needs him
So in God's Son we trust, 'cause they know
I'ma give 'em what they want
Rubber grip hold the reloader
Come at me, I'ma rip your soldiers in half
Silverback ape, nickel-plated mag
Young, rich and flashy
Young bitch, I'm nasty
All black clothes, the ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids
I can still see the borough, I can still see the bridge
I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see
Tell 'em angels open the door for me
From nine Berettas and movin' raw
To chillin' in wine cellars, sticks and humidors
That's what I call mature
That's what I call a G
That's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta to the fullest, shit
I'm trying to make more C.R.E.A.M. by every September 14
That's my dream, so I can be more clean
As I grow yearly
I can see things more clearly
That's why they fear me
Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two seatin'
Can't leave it, the game needs him
So in God's Son we trust, 'cause they know
I'ma give 'em what they want
It's Universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied
The corporate side blockin' y'all from goin' to stores and buyin' it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was ridin' with it
But Newsweek articles startle big wigs
They said, Nas, why is he tryin' it?
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts is winnin', forgettin'
Nas the only true rebel since the beginning
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel they can't sing what's in they soul
So Untitled it is, I never changed nothin'
Think about these talented kids with new ideas
Bein' told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'ma drop it
Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it
I'm a hustla in the studio, cups of Don Julio
No matter what the CD called, I'm unbeatable, y'all
Let's go!
Yeah, yeah
Nas, Polow da Don
The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in Set It Off
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', Hi Nas
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, Sorry. I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room
Nine push-ups... Strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Platron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Fila's
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tails
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know... When will they learn
Nas need a queen not a hoe to...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick- someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?
Take my name... And my number
Meanwhile... We'll be groovin'
But let's take... it... slow
One for the honeys who roll blunts up but don't smoke
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife- play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue... A woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbeque I call Professor and Ock
'Cause u... point out my enemies, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?
Take my name... And my number
Meanwhile... We'll be cruisin'
But let's take... it... slow
Slow is the way
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we... suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billy Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick- someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?
Take my name... And my number
Meanwhile... We'll be cruisin'
But let's take... it... slow
I can be... What you said
That you need... I can be... All that
I can be... I can have your back... baby
I can be... What you said
That you need... I can be... All that
I can be... I can have your back... baby
Hip hop hip hop is dead
Hip... hip hop hip hop is dead
Hip... hip hop hip... hip hop is dead
Hip... hip hop hip hop hip hop
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead
Yeah, niggas smoke, chill, party, and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Rich ass niggas is ridin' with 3 llamas
Revenge in their eyes, Hennesy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin' hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin' hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin' hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell you Nas helped grow us up
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million in billin', I helped build 'em up
Gave my nigga my right, I could have gave left
So like my girl Foxy, a nigga went Def
So nigga, who's your top ten?
Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead
The bigger the cat, the bigger the pillin'
Come through, something ill, missin' the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick up's and killin's
Kidnappin's, project buildin's, drug dealin's
Criticize that, why is that?
'Cause now rap is compared to legitimized crack
'Cause we love to talk on ass we gettin'
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh I think they like me... in my white teeth
You can't ice me, we here for life B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that we not takin' it lightly
If hip hop should die we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together
All together now
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Hip hop just died this mornin'
Hip hop just died this mornin'
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead
Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscin' when it wasn't all business
If it got where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man then a mobster
If the guys let me get my last swig of Vodka
R.I.P., we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to mp3s
From Beat Street to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm lookin' over my shoulder
It's about 80 peoples from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
Yeah, Feds feast on street dons, look at their teeth showin'
Salivatin' at the mouth, South to East Orange
Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it
You'll be givin' up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it
For legal fees in the penal dorm
Screamin' on the horn with 'bout thirty years on your conscience
I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'
Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'
Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates
Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in
I got families I'm feeding 'cause my man's is bleeding
Every five seconds look in all directions
I come through prepared; I give 'em a call
I'm close, bring them guns downstairs
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
Uh, uh, it's beef week, Monday, murder
Two niggaz dead, Tuesday
Wednesday and Thursday is hearse-day
Friday, somebody-gotta-die-day
Saturday, put the gat away
Chillin' wit your chick and a bag of haze
Wonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way
'Cause Sunday back to gunplay
Mo' shit start over nothin'
And get finished quick 'cause the art of repercussion
Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret
My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die
But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die
You thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty
But he old school, holdin' a .38, he in his forties
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
Cops steady askin' your man what happened
First he tell then he stop, like he not really rattin'
Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star
The rain hurt niggaz bones who been shot
Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop
Your man'll fry you plus, everybody talkin'
A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in
Make your own path, be a legend in your skin
Make your own cash, don't stress what I'm forcin'
Don't expect more when you put in less work than all them
Queensbridge projects has taught him, and that's for life
When the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
Hip-Hop - it will never die
Hip-Hop - Hip-Hop will never, never die
Ghetto niggaz struttin' with nothin' but dreams and Queens broke
Mack-10's, you can smell the PCP smoke
Mele Mel told it real in the music he wrote
Those were the days I remember
We used to be close, then I was nine, coldest winter I remember
Was slippin' in December, two feet of snow
Yeah, that's the East Coast, that black ice
Symbolized the rap life
It was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doin' the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowin', didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter Jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she wants shellfish
Red Lobster was poppin', standin' on that line forever
I wish somebody would step on my Bally leather's
Now it's whatever... hip-hop's forever
Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift but niggaz never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn 'em, I was a tornado comin'
He knew from inside, like the eye of a storm
And told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble, retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweepin' leaves, socks to my knees
Homemade shorts cutoff, Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wipin' away eraser of the paper man
I'm just tryin' to say it right
Big radio, tape slowin' down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I gotta freeze 'em till they ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm starin' at the speaker
Sunk in them 808's deeper, cleanin' my sneakers
Wit the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoe strings soak in water...
Live hip-hop live, live hip-hop live
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give
Stay hip-hop stay, stay hip-hop stay
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays
Ain't got nothin' to do wit old school, new school
Dirty South, West Coast, East Coast
This about us, this our thing, 'knaw'sayin'?
This came from the gut, from the blood, from the soul
Right here man, this is our thing man
You know, so I say what I say
And I say what I say, and I mean it
Y'all take it how you wanna take it
'Cause if you're askin' - Why is hip-hop dead?
It's a pretty good chance you're the reason it died, man
It's a pretty good chance your lame ass, corny ass, is the reason it died, man
You don't give a fuck about, you don't know nothin' about it
You want this paper, be a hustler
You a hustler, you ain't a rapper
Get your paper man
YouknowwhatI'msayin, but this rap shit is real
Bitch, this shit is real, bitch, ha-ha
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give
Stay hip-hop stay, stay hip-hop stay
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays
Yeah...
Dre, he a Compton, Compton O.G.
Nas, he a QB, QB true G, do the history.
Way before The Firm, like back in the day,
Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre,
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face,
The one kid that would have been Aftermath but got away,
But we still get together like, every several years,
To sprinkle, a little bit of heaven for your ears,
Relax, sippin' cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers,
Low key know G's but it's still Gucci luggage,
I love Cape Cod, and watching fly bitches with gray eyes,
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by,
I like to celebrate, why? 'cause I can vision,
Collages of images of my lives with no regrets or hate,
So every breath I take, Is all about the rules,
It's hard for you to breath like you at high altitude,
So crack the Patrone, it's own heavens,
The God's back, hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'!
Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders,

What ya got's a
Eastcoast gunshots
What ya got's a
1995, eleven years from the day,
I'm in the record shop with choices to make,
Illmatic on the top shelf, The Chronic on the left, homie,
Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me,
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub-sack,
Ripped the package of Illmatic and bumped that,
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhyme,
I was the only Compton nigga with a New York state of mind,
Inside the dope house, bottlin' up sherm,
Banging The Firm, Dre was king then so I waited my turn,
Fast-forward now I'm makin' 'em burn,
Endin' my peers careers, holla'd at Nas, a hard lesson was learned,
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga,
I stopped beefin' with niggas, 'cause I'm Ether to niggas,
Comb the Earth till there's no one left,
If I ruled the world I'd summons all you weak rap niggas to death,
What ya got's a
Eastcoast gunshots
What ya got's a
Yo, the Jordan's sportin',
Come off the dice game with a fortune walkin', you a walkin' coffin,
The musket, I tucked it, you bluff it, I bus' it,
You're sideways talkin', so why lay off him,
I wait patient, to duct-tape hatin',
Fuck ass niggas get bucked, ass niggas,
Pluck ashes, of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas,
That's our name, and I came, with groupies this time,
Word to my Mom's name tattooed on my arm,
You can't revolve me, embalm me, call me, or harm me,
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm bustin',
See that's malarkey, you yappin',
I open up the tripod, to put the Gatlin on, and I start clappin',
Nasty man from baggin' grams and runnin' from cops,
To a mil in the hand, a mil on the watch, I'm fuckin' with Doc!
Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders

Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
B, b boys and girls listen up,
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust,
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothin' comes easy it takes much practice,
Like I met a woman who was becoming a star,
She was very beautiful leaving people in awe.
Singin' songs, later on, but the younger version,
Hung wit' the wrong person, got her stunger than heroine,
Cocaine, sniffin' up drugs all in her nose,
Could've died so young, now looks ugly and old,
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold their breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death,
Watch the company you keep, and the crowd you bring,
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing,
So if you gonna be the best I'm'a tell you how,
Put your hands in the air and take the vow
B, b, boys and girls listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten.
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the clubs with fake ID.
Careful 'fore you meet a man with HIV.
You can host a TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow,
You're thinking he can give you wealth but so
Young boy, you could use a lot of help you know
Ya thinkin' life's all about smokin' weed and ice.
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write,
Beggin' different women for a place to sleep at night.
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish.
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
B, be'fore we came to this country,
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys.
There was empires in Africa called Kush,
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans,
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold; When
Gold was converted to money it all changed,
Money then became empowerment for Europeans.
The Persian military invaded,
They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked,
Slavery was money, so they began making slaveships.
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was in shock that in the mountains were black faces.
Shot off their nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today you see.
If the truth is told the youth can grow.
They'll learn to survive, until they gain control.
Nobody says you have to be gangsters, hoes.
Read more, learn more, change the globe.
Ghetto children do your thing.
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king.
Young princess when you get your wedding ring,
Your man is saying, She's my queen!
Save the music y'all
Save the music y'all
Save the music y'all
Save the music y'all
Save the music
Damn! Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggaz just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me right?
Like I'm a f... I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfuckin gun
I can't believe this shit...
I seen some cold nights and bloody days, they grab me, bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song till this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered, they pull me out
I watch as niggaz scattered, making me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves
Under beds, so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keep me full up with hollow heads
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child, scarred your life, crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck wild
Always I'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip
The barrel is my dick, uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me, I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggaz shock me
I see niggaz bleeding running from me in fear, stunningly tears
Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, giving niggaz heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up teck with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day, police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a .9
There's a grenade in a box, and that Teck that kept crying
'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear
He's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody coming in, open the shelf
His eyes bubbling, he said, It was on
I felt his palm troubled him shaking
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for blacks to kill blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally, go off, making niggaz memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat, cocked me back, said, Remember me?
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggaz running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!
I wanna talk to the mayor, the governor, the motherfuckin president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin congressman
Step up to the White House let me in
What's my reason for being I'm ya next to kin
And we built this motherfucker
You wanna kill me because my hunger?
Mr. America young black niggaz want ya
I wanna talk to the man understand
Understand this motherfuckin G-pack in my hand
Look what happened to San Fran young girl hit by policeman
Twelve shots up in her dome, damn
Niggaz thought we slept but the architect sent
The Pentagon's from Egypt, government secret
The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now
Extension on Earth, human cutdown
Niggaz play with PlayStations, they build a spacestations
On Mars plottin civilizations
Dissin us discriminatin different racisis
Tax payers pay for more jail for black latin faces
I'm just a black man why y'all made it so hard damn
Niggaz gotta go create their own job
Mr. Mayor imagine if this was your backyard
Mr. Governor imagine if it was your kids that starved
Imagine your kids gotta sling crack to survive
Swing a mack to be live cart ack to get high
It's the ghetto life yeah I celebrate it I live it
And all I got is what you left me with I'ma get it
Now y'all combinin all the countries we goin' do the same
Combine all the cliques to make one gang
It ain't all about a black and white thing
It's to make the change, citizens of a higher plane
What y'all waitin for the world to blow up
Before you hear this rewind this 4 minutes before we timeless
Let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
The Nastradamus tell us what time it is
They try to buy us with doe
Fake black leaders of puppets always talking 'bout the city budget
The news got it all confused lyin' to the public
They eyes watchin stay wise move above it
Water floods predicted hurricanes twisters
It's all signs of the Armageddon three sixes
People reverse the system politics verse religion
Holy war muslim verse christians
Niggaz in high places they don't have the balls for this
People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us
Mr. President I assume it was negligence
The streets upside down, I'm here to represent this
Can I talk to you Mr. President
Niggaz tryin' to get with the computers
We ain't John Henry
Banging down machines and shit
Part of establishment
That's what we are steppin up for
This shit is real
Total Package in this nigga
LES in this nigga
Ill Will nigga
Mr. President wanna keep us from establishment
Niggaz are American baby
American Made
Life
I wonder
Will it take me under
I don't know
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing, fashion
Designer clothes, lacing your clique up with diamond Role's
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Going raw imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time, watch the blimp read The World is Mine
If I ruled the world
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still living for today, in these last days and times
Yo, it'll be, paradise life relaxing, black, Latino and Anglo-saxon
Armani exchange the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa houses for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Opening eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse fiends to Willie's
It sounds foul but every girl I meet will go down town
I'd open every cell in Attica send 'em to Africa
If I ruled the world
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin' for today, in these last days and times
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infiniti
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?
If I ruled the world
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin' for today, in these last days and times
If I ruled the world
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin' for today, in these last days and times
If I ruled the world
I'd free all my sons
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
Two steps away from death, a vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession, they was checking the Rover
Inspecting the tattoos on my neck and my shoulder
How many times I'm one of six coffin-holders
Or I'm sitting with goons in a visiting room?
Flip it, I could've been you behind state walls bidding
These are the things that a G pray for, acquit us
A little stash in the safe or a little shorty to wait for
Or a shorty to take the weight from
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw God's face on the design on my vintage Claiborne
Swear I see 'em every day in the bus or the train
Or the billboards out there that hang tall
I still give thanks for him, have faith for him
No matter what his name's called
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
Hey, can you think of a color that you've never seen?
Can you reminisce on places you've never been?
Well, is many are called but them never deemed
Worthy for the cause 'cause them never clean
Help who help themselves, Jah nuh raffle dream
That's why me chummy with Jah, Jah like a cherubim
Keep us strong through the winter like an evergreen
And all of us are more connected than it ever seems
All things are related and creation is a package
Generate together and we increase the wattage
A how them a go manage? Tell Babylon them can't do Rasta damage
Nor stop we through the passage
Jah did make a promise, God is always honest
Always keep His word, don't care what the plan is
Don't be astonished, stumbling blocks vanish
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace, woah
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
Some people ask me if I feel the Zionists are real
And in my songs do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb that's under these chrome wheels
My homies is only ones I'm taking care of
But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers have become more weird
As if they were superior and fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of
Collegiate literature, I hold mirrors up
Give combination of pain, joy, fear and love
Through my perspective I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition getting high with my brethren
Could've asked us why Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons, suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom
It's like it's been exchanged for this penicillin
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
Peace, how you?
I ain't mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl.
It's chilly out here.
What happened, you cryin?
Y'all got into it again, huh?
See you gotta let 'em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with.
Yeah, I know they know we talking.
Why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other.
Come on, stop cryin' now.
Oh, there's somethin' I gotta tell you, I heard they watchin you, yeah they watching you.
They watchin me too.
But there ain't no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here.
You know, Imma stand up for you, no matter what; and I know you'll stand up for me.
I don't have no doub about you bein true to me.
The world is ours, but right now I feel like the whole world is against us.
So study, be strong, don't cry no more.
It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
'Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm ill plus matic
I freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik
Jam like a Tec with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell
This rhythmatic explosion is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, giving mics menstrual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packing like a Rasta in the weed spot, vocals'll squeeze Glocks
MC's eavesdrop though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fail
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell, it ain't hard to tell
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Nas, stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el
Inhale from the L, school a fool well, you feel it like braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick the skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill
Plus Matic, I freak beats slam it like Iron Shiek
Jam like a tech with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin while you're plannin ways to sabatoge me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell
Verse II needed
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's death
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin
Cause in my physical, I can express throuh song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Nas, stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el
Inhale from the L, school a fool well, you feel it like braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick the skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill
Plus Matic, I freak beats slam it like Iron Shiek
Jam like a tech with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin while you're plannin ways to sabatoge me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell
Verse II needed
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's death

I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell
Can we please have a moment of silence?
That's for my niggaz doin' years in confinement
And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor?
Symobolizin', let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep till slugs kill us here
This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle tryin' to gain
Smokin' trauma, sniffin' Ra while sellin' cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowin' how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace?
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Bloodin' and thuggin', folkin' and lokin'
Crypin' and creepin', Latin and kingin'
Or just for poor righteous teachin'
As days goes and nights fall
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishin' y'all were home
Yeah, and can we have another moment of silence?
For brothers who died from black-on-black violence
From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dyin'
And can we please pour some more liquors?
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggaz
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth?
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you
Let's take 'em home
And can we please have a moment to mourn?
For Pac, Biggie and Pun 'cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Ty and Alliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we wish to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children?
Who got raped or murdered, or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Bustin' her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggaz in the pen hopin' rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For very mother that held a son in the street bleedin'
Cryin' a song of sorow to dark and deep for speakin'
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em
Picture us married, you and me
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl you and me
F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Girl, picture us married, you and me
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl you and me
F-U-C-K-I-N-G
She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how excitin' life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met must have been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that. I dropped you off home
I call, you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids at
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious, more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hopin' we can stay together
I see you dressed up in white, face covered in vail
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwin' rice
And it's today that your father give you away
To a real man, I gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do
Drivin' off in the Rolls Royce, Just Married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the states
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Somethin' in the back of my head say
For us two, maybe 'cause I love you
Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop till I tell you me to beautiful
Deeper and harder love layin' nude with you
Runnin' my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by
While I'm wit you and I won't even care, word
She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pa's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby, shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
Till one day she decided to flip
It was nuttin' I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talkin' this divorcin' shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With her fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too
You my queen, God bless you
Imagine Ghana like California with Sunset Boulevard
Johannesburg would be Miami
Somalia like New York
With the most pretty light
The nuffest pretty car
Ever New Year the African Times Square lock-off
Imagine Lagos like Las Vegas
The Ballers dem a Ball
Angola like Atlanta
A pure plane take off
Bush Gardens inna Mali
Chicago inna Chad
Magic Kingdom inna Egypt
Philadelphia like Sudan
The Congo like Colorado
Fort Knox inna Gabon
People living in Morocco like the state of Oregon
Algeria warmer than Arizona bring your sun lotion
Early morning class of Yoga on the beach in Senegal
Ethiopia the capitol of fi di Congression
A deh so I belong
A deh di The King come from
I can see us all in limos
Jaguars and B'mos
Riding on the King's Highway
Promised Land I picture Porsches
Basquiat Portraits
Pinky Rings realistic princesses
Heiresses bunch a Kings and Queens
Plus I picture fortunes for kids out in Port-Au-Prince
Powerless they not allowed to fit
But not about to slip
Vision Promised Land with fashion like
Madison Ave Manhattan
Saks 5th Ave and
Rodeo
Relaxing popping labels
Promise Land no fables
This where the truth's told
Use them two holes
Above your nose
To see the proof yo!
Imagine a contraption that could take us back when
The world was run by black men
Back to the future
Anything can happen
If these are the last days
And 100-food waves come crashing down
I get some hash and pounds
Pass around the bud then watch the flood
Can't stop apocalypse
My synopsis is catastrophic
If satellites is causing earthquakes
Will we survive it
Honestly man it's the sign of the times
And the times at hand
There's alot of work to be done, O gosh
In the Promised Land
Jejeberg and jbstar represent... booyah!
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought 'Kick In The Door' was for?
But that's my heart, y'all still trippin' of this Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'mma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin' at the Fever, streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues, droppin' our schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin new rules
So I, got in 'em shoes, tried 'em wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit, so I couldn't sport em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warring
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island
And Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changing
I had a baby, I was making my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticing my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in with more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thang
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit
BIG and I hit blunts performing at the Arc
Next thing you knew, BIG blew and all the balling starts
He had Kim and his crew, I found Fox, only niggas in New York with number
One charts
BIG was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon my niggas
But dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on the Purple tape
BIG told me Rae was stealing my slang
And Rae told me out in Shaolin BIG would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with 'Ain't No Niggas'
Had much Versace swagger
BIG admired the Brooklyn knight and it took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today don't know nothing, about this bullshit
There's more shit than wanting to be this King of New York shit
Rap became a version of Malcolm and Martin
Rest In Peace Will, Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
I had lot trust for Steve Stoute
At some point till I got to know him
We old friends, but what's loyal?
Puff soaked Interscope offices
With champagne bottles on Steve, and Steve thought the drama is on me
Cause previously it would have been, against whoever
Friends forever
However, I learn, with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
To diss niggas with Jigga too much, he used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone planning
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets, later on she hittin the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinking he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars that might follow
Tauht her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But that's her, I ain't mad baby, it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss
It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LPs ever to hit stores
In the Firm I learned I am Nastradamus
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with mama
She was getting old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not till I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assasinate my character, degrade my hood
Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What you want, see, I already had
The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first shall be last
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
G-O-D S-O-N, they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
Uh, Uh, Uh
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful mind we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'
These are last words of a hanging slave
How can I forget this
I rob you put you on my hit list
Under my nails is dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds we brave men
I'ma blow smoke and keep sayin'
I wanna be more than that bullet that go through ya zone
Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones
Wanna be the heat you feel makin' ya moan
Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on
It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper-con
I'm gonna kill something
Rap cats be real frontin
Fuck shootin legs
Cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how bout that
Close range with the gadge get paid
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn quarters when you turn quarters know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimmy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful mind we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you put you on my hit list
Under my nails is dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds we brave men
I blow smoke and keep sayin'
I'ma prison cell six by nine
Livin' hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you wit me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin' apart
Call for the gods and let them out when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I make it hotter in the summer colder in the winter
If the court paroal ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen 'em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunning when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is coming
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal
This one's for all the leaders, leader
Let's all change the world, change the world
This one's for all the leaders, leader
Let's all change the world, change the world
Yeah, got out the 600, blunted chicks hunt him
Neighborhood know he comin'
Jake hate him, snakes could not violate him
Pimps memorize his lines verbatim
He reps N.Y., yo, gives C notes to winos
Not church, it's how he tithe though
He walks the tenement sleeps at his super fly condo
My kind a nigga, my icon, my idol
No certificate for this misfit who handle business
The odds stacked against him, he fights back mack'n Benzes
Never puts cash or ass before friendship
He laughs last as some die young he is still existing
Somehow he got around the pitfalls of the system
When he walks, we watch
When he talks, we listen, leaders
This one's for all the leaders, leader
Let's all change the world, change the world
This one's for all the leaders, leader
Let's all change the world, change the world
Who do I follow? Who do I copy?
Look in to the mirror and it's you I see look at me
Everything new like it fresh from the factory
Everything you do, it impact me
Your lifestyle attract me, parents try distract me
When I grow up I want to be like you exactly
And as soon as I get over this acne
There's no way anybody coulda stop me
Me gravitate toward the aura and all the mannerism
The sending out of orders and man start moving busy
The locking of the corners, the streets and all the buildings
Mi love you like a father, mi ready and mi willing
Anything what you a talk is law in my dominion
And mi have similar thoughts, I share the same opinions
Mi have it say you smart with mi best interest at heart
I'm following your path, yow mine, when you a walk
This one's for all the leaders, leader
Let's all change the world, change the world
This one's for all the leaders, leader
Let's all change the world, change the world
They appeal to the conscious, the paramount
The Cesar, the monsters, the grandiose
The matters, the hell on earth pompous
Ellsworth Bumpy Johnsons, the Harlemites, the Garveyites
Black as the credit card we swipe, poppin' Dom tonight
For all of mine, I can see myself back at the Autobahn
Malcolm on the podium, shells drop to linoleum
Swipe those, place 'em on display at the Smithsonian
Next to only gems that were left behind by holy men
Infectious charisma of those who gave us direction
The anti-sexes, resistance against oppression
Progressive thinking, ghetto speakers
Protestors against the colored only section to the Jena 6 and
The Frost Nixon, the contradiction, the cross, the crucifixion
The loss we took for sinning on Esau's back inscription
That it was written that nothing is coincidence and
They took our leaders and they lynched them
This one's for all the leaders, leader
Let's all change the world, change the world
This one's for all the leaders, leader
Let's all change the world, change the world
Change the world, change the world
Change the world
Change the world, change the world
Yeah, change the world
...Let there be light
No gangbanging in New York tonight
Just murals of Biggie Smalls bigger than life
Turn up the kid mic because y'all ain't listening right
What's all this talk that Nas got brought?
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Ain't nobody been where I been they at standstill
This is all overseen by my man Will!
As I walk through the valley of shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
?? And all my business all my sin is straight ??
And thank the hood for all the love they gave
?? Forgive 'em all for all they did their best to hate ??
Oh let their be light
This ain't to glorify just painting a street picture
There's no goddess or bibles just blunts and swishers
Gillette's cut caine in the kitchen
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth Supreme Griffin
It's like the same difference except when nigga's get arranged
They don't want the same sentence, nigga's get to snitching
If I could reverse the minds and turn falls to rises and bring back nigga's who livest
Old hustlers reminiscing on better days they home
Doing nothing might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers one foot in the grave
They used to love us until we found our own way through the maze
New York set trippin' and flagging west coast laughing
Now Esco's asking, what happened?
My home girl from Upper Manhattan she remembers the quarters that's Latin
A lot of rat-a-tat-tatting
The son of the audio cassette era, tech wearer
Bullets and burgettes Benz Bo speak a terror
Demand I get mine till I'm dead so I can drop something red
Like that horse standing on its hind legs
Since Arnold and Willis in there bunk beds
I went and bread like wonder
Not Ned the wineo like the parents of Lionel
Nas is the ghetto American idol
No matter what you do your never getting my title
I can't sound smart because you'll run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about yay
Like there's no other way for an ex hustler, cake getter,
Ex rich splitter to touch ya
I beg to differ
When your fours years in the game we can have a conversation
Eight years in the game I'll invite you on vacation
Ten years in the game
After I've enjoyed my fame,
Only then I'll let you pick my brain
Niggas
Yo... Ill Will, Ruff Ryders
What, what, sraight like that
You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my man's trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be Bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, strapped, prepared for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life I can say I did the right thing
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gonna take it
I got no time for games 'cause I'm all grown up
See how funny it is when your kids ain't got no father
Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit
Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bum shit
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
So just peep the flow yo, cause you already in this
Make history before you go
Fuck the misery of livin' po' we gettin' dough
Time is valuable
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughters feet grow
You wack and cheap with the dough, my heat could blow
Payin' doctors when I'm born, a preacher when I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life deminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
Prepare for the worst, no fears or nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last nigga, let's get this cash nigga
To my niggaz... huh...
We all we got...
Let's hold it down though, y'know?
However it's gon' go down
This what we gotta deal with, y'know?
Yo...
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or goin' broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggaz in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo...
Uh, uh, uh
Gold bathtubs, makin' love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rollin' up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and submachines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Child both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dyin'
'Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealin' with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Till they kid's on the phone sayin', Please daddy pay it
Till they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggaz want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, comin' out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard fuckin' with niggaz you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wantin you stuck
Uh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rollin' wit you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the air?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a hoe
And you don't even let him know, cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they separate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claimin he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggaz don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with 'em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggaz get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Till you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret bein grimy
What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs, till he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop tickin, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You gettin' older player, look at those who gave up
Ayo what's up, what's up, let's keep it real son
'Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
Clothes, bankrolls and hoes you know what I'm sayin'?
Visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But something must've got in us 'cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some rest in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thievin', we'll be leavin' with some kind of dough, so
Until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes three sixty-five days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull 'cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels, and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto, 'stead of saying, Fuck tomorrow
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a four-matic to crack your whole cabbage
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
Visualizin the realism of life and actuality
Fuck who's the baddest a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is, money orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
But somethin' must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some, restin in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others such as myself are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' the schwepervesence street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin we'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, and to that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers-ll be somewhere stackin plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin steel, gettin' high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye...
Time's is Illmatic 4x
Destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it 1x
You gotta get the ground beneath your feet, partner
Get the wind behind your back
Go out in a blaze of glory if you've got to
Otherwise you ain't shit
You might as well be dead your damn self, y'all
I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty years of blessing
The essence of adolescent leaves my body now I'm fresh in
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life some God-ly like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull 'cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain
Don't go against the grain simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass smokin' blunts with hash
Now I think about cash in abundance, niggaz I used to run with
Is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto -- instead of sayin' fuck tomorrow
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time's is Illmatic keep static like wool fabric
Pack a four-matic that crack your whole cabbage
Yeah, you know the flavor
Nas and AZ on the remix joint
This is another explosion from the Arsenal
Ayo what's up, what's up, let's keep it real son
'Cause we spendin' these Jacksons

Ah yeah, what's happening, Mami
How ya doin' Baby. Oh you lookin' kinda good and everything, I see you with those stilhettos baby. Ah, check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me? Ay, let me put this bug in your ear, baby. Won't you turn those flow shoes into your ho shoes, ya dig. yeah check this out. This universe fine as your royal highness. You know what, I can do a whole lotta things for you. Guess Why? 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' pimp.
Like Me
Hustlin' and gridning baby
I be
Stayin' on that paper chase
In this life, there's pimp's and ho's
Tell me which one are you, you little
Like Me
Hustlin' and gridning baby
I be
Stayin' on that paper chase
The good man in me say get money and stay on the path.
But the pimp shit in me say, yo, keep looking for ass
But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow.
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait till you're grown, when they love you, you'll know.
Everybody's got a dream, I hope and wish to own a six times two
Chill in the whip a fantasy a bone to pick to get against who I don't know
To one who said you won't blow
You won't eat, you want cake, they mistake.
Blamin me for they failures I'm fresh.
Getting tailored, single breasted.
A lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit.
A woman hates a man and stay with him for many years. Tell him she loves then be jealous of him. Now lame is how the ghetto judge him. 'Cause he still with her. She take his cash and give it to some other real nigger.
Like me
Yo NYC, U-N-I-verse, se-riously
Havoc and P, Queens niggaz so it seem to be
Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise, mega
Got word back from Noreaga
The D.A. got video cassette taper
The God with the God-U-Now, pulling a caper
Running up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig tied they motherfuckin wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas in-to
Peep the issue situation like this, we sticking him too
JFK on our way to L.A.
My crew do it the Mobb way, everyday
Crime pay, who wanted gunplay? Drill me
Niggaz kill me, thrilling me, you wanna look?
Peep the nine milli, now undress, you know the drill-y
Niggaz suspect, weak links pose threats, I have yet
To met challenger who go against my set
Gem stars razor sharp like Gillette, shaving closely on
Any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burglars trying to sneak peep the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5,000 a plate
No doubt kid, I hit them niggas like a bid
The prosecutor, running up in your crib
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely
It's only me, and the gat that's holding me
We got it locked beyond measure, the click's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure smack you with the undresser
Represent your click, go ahead, get that ass whipped
Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talking
QB represent fuck that, it can happen
While you rapping, I'm busy tryna sneak the gat in
Could tear men, cut the party while you jamming
We think smarter, reach harder, got the 44
Bodyguard of something you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me
Niggaz thinking shit sweet, I carry big heat
Wavy hair chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep
Queens murder clicks meet, yellow tapes on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones, that's irregular
Why debate on a phone, I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600, you just a crumb inside a world
Where the rich run it, curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists
I preserve in my dome, niggas' mics is full of silicone
Spot's blown, guerilla ice on this killer's life
I put my word on it
Now you can sleep on or rock a swerve on it
Nas is ménage à trois' on Mount Aire lodges
We like a smooth fam', but rougher than how DeBarge is
Catching charges, of marksmen, living heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit
We mobbing, putting niggas in mausoleums
Put Queens across the Throggs Neck, heads bop, I see 'em
For niggaz don't know how to act
To all my niggaz on the block slinging crack
Rest in peace to my niggaz laying on they back
Live now niggaz, there's no promise of a second time around, put it down
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, we spending
Not under the ground yet, we enjoying every second yo
Live now, don't forget to bro, yeah
'Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro
Picture my last days will be so grim
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it
Sex, I dropped pearl necklaces on necks and tits
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it
From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with
So live now nigga
It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis
Gotta respect you 'cause you never tied to smash
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack
Now I see that you a man after all you been through
A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, Me a victim?, could never be my character
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him
Just happy it didn't get in our kid
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless
Remember days of diamond cuts
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggaz I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggaz, rich niggaz, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Critics and fans, they need to get a life
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now
I grew with you so you know you make me proud
And most of all you gotta live now
Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending
Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo
Gotta live it up to the limit yo
'Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro
Son, come close, lemme talk to you
I got music, put it out to the world, let 'em hear it
Look out for little me, one
42nd street terminal
Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it
My religion is reefer
Big moneyin' to most, an uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic, nothin' is figurative
I can wish it into existence, God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this
Pointin' to they scars like, Right here, baby, really Nas did this
Like a badge of honor, not braggin' I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothin's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Dempsey, matte black Bentley, pimply
Shatterin' your silence, passin' 'round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife 'cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous
Yo, what we talkin' 'bout niggas?
What we talkin' 'bout niggas?
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, Nasty, what, recollect, fucker
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand livin' in public housin'
Integrity intact, reppin' hard
They askin' how he disappear and reappear back on top
Sayin', Nas must have naked pictures of God or somethin'
To keep winnin' is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathin', I'll take chances
A soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smilin', I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump bein' up down up, play with cash
My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we push it, mush 'em
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem, Bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at?
At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hangin' from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felissimo, melted pot, city sweltering hot
Staggerin' drunker than those cops that 2pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed
Reachin', soon as I heard them iron wheels screechin'
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beastin'
Lookin' for the ? young, but now we older chiefin'
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Buggin' on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol again' my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I? Must be, somethin' in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all
This for my trapped in the 90's niggas
For my trapped in the 90's niggas
Ha, for y'all niggas
Bravehearts! Bravehearts! Bravehearts! Bravehearts!
Bravehearts! Bravehearts! Bravehearts! Bravehearts!
Uh, uh, uh, now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step wit'
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't five-O, y'all know it's Nas yo
Grey goose and a whole lotta hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well dressed with finesse
In a white tee lookin' for wifie
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city no doubt,
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out,
Newness here's the anthem put your hand up
That you shoot with, count your loot wit'
Push the pool stick in your new crib,
Same hand that you hoop with swing around like you stupid,
King'a the town, yeah I been that
You know I click-clack where you and your men's at
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back
They shootin'! Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?
This ain't rappin', this is Street-Hop
Now get up off your ass like your seat's hot
My live niggaz lit up the reefer
Trunk at the car we got the street sweeper
Don't start none, won't be none no reason for your man's to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music diffuse all attention
Ball or convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers'can move swift
Girls get close, you'ca feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phoney
Pull out my waist, the eagle fo-forty
They shootin'! Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?
Bravehearts! Bravehearts! Bravehearts! Bravehearts!
I see niggaz runnin', yo my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk arses
Like Pun said, You not even en mi clasa
Make backspins, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is, show me love
Lemme feel how the head is Females whose the sexiest
Is always the nastiest And I like a little sassiness,
A lotta class Mommy reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader, at last this a don you wit'
My nines I'll spit, niggaz loose consciousness!
Lace the Macy's don't have it
A hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around or I'm wastin' fabric

Cause you to suck your teeth
To mean muggin' 'em or clean thuggin' mean nothin'
Women dream I'm your husband
A malice push to the black poetry writin' Russian ??? disgustin'
I started bling how could you question my direction or my time for collection
Gangstas two-steppin', hate me, should thank me
But lately I burn so much trees I keep environmentalists angry

Y'all livin' trendy on pennies, I copy plenty Fendi
Vivian Westwood, I'm good kid, the whole truck tower top floor for the hood

Red carpet to the ???
Throwin' red dice at the Mirage

Big pimpin', top down, chrome spinnin', Top Gun, Tom Cruise
Tucked inside my Gucci linen
No homo, just Romo, you tryna shine I put the nine on your jersey for promo

Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floors
Weekends at the Venetian pull up in that black horse
Top down new fashion
Seein' me's like seein' me through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera lights flashin'
And I'm laughin' my plaques from album sales

A mastermind
Sees it coming before it comes
A mastermind
Before he go to war he count his ones
A mastermind
Everything planned out perfect-incase you niggas got to get murdered
A mastermind
Sleeps at night real easy
A mastermind
Cause everything he does is by the book
A mastermind
Never do a thing irrational-live forever these tales are classical
Velvet bowtie
Bulletproofs in the tux when I roll by
In the car similar to Osama's
In my diamonds, and my principle is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan a couple of, years ago when guns started clapping
Two of my dogs fell
Two of my niggas ran
They were amateurs in beef with a grown man
They taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak end up in the coffin
Play it cool that's the old school rule man
Keep your ears to the street you'll never loose man
Make you enemies believe there's love there
Because in war believe it's all fair
Rock 'em to sleep
Shots in your jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was for me
Its for my masterind
It ain't a game it's the life
Think it's a game you lame and I'm nice
On the Blackstone Marlowe
Tobes to me hair robe mad turn up
Weather below zero-gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her ear lobe 'drive home'
'Cause she the wife and they the freaks
They underneath my girl calliber
They smiled at her said goodbye with niggas
They thugged out they wild as us
My bodyguards in my Danali truck
Knowing I'm surrounded by Old Gs that I don't really get down with
They got a separate table for they freaks
Brought 'em drinks
So we can talk
So real niggas can relate
I knew
They kelt Hose too
Like Ray Peru
They used to spray troops
But now they managing groups
The main nigga Sonny had big money since '82
Had two of my dogs wacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew
I swithced that
Now I'm strong with niggas that feel Sonny was wrong
My moneys long, his money is weak
Hes losing sleep trying to fill me out
To see what its gone be, but I'ma MASTERMIND
I live the clean life
I don't need to steal cable
I speak for myself my niggas'll slay you
Lucky for me this rap done worked out fine
FEDs, check me out, its no dirt drop finds
This King of New York shit only last'd 15 minutes
Every nigga get burn'd but it's what you did wi it
Niggas who brilliant came in and killed it, made million
Every 3 months, new jewelry
I'm low
Smoking blueberry wit a hoe that know a few scary individuals is airy
As she get into it, spread the inner voodoo
She says a Hail Mary then she said she knew who, would come and try to kill you too
I'd like to dedicate this one here, to my star
Someone I cherish, she loves me unconditionally
No matter what, our love will always be here for you baby
Yeah
Even though we don't live in the same home
And I mightta miss your graduation
And no matter how many miles I'm away from you
You know that I love you
Hear daddy on every station
Thinking, I'm loving my occupation
I know I got you home waitin', to see
Yeah, just me and my little one
I'd give you the world
Even though you'll be grown soon
You gotta stand on your two
Please listen what daddy told you
I know you think that I'm old school
You'll see that I was right soon
One day, you will meet the right groom
And then, you will see your life bloom
Respect your mom, no one will replace her
But you don't owe her no favours
But her respect is due
It's for you
It's your world baby girl
Yeah!
I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessey holders and old school niggas, then I be dissing a
Unofficial that smoke woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the liver
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented, with formality
My duration's infinite, money wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip hop, straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Childhood lesson make me see him drop in my weed smoke 
It's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines
The hype vice, murderous night times, and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, hold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rolling mats for craps to cee-lo
Peace God, now the shit is explained
I'm taking niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis, is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
Your telephone blown, black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down popo when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustling brothers who keep the same rank
Pumping for something, some will prosper, some fail
Judges hanging niggas, incorrect bails, for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hanging cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo
Fuck Rap is real, watch the herbs stand still
Never talking to snakes cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
The most dangerous MC is
The most dangerous MC is
The most dangerous MC is
The most dangerous MC is
Me number one and you know where me from
I love you so much, don't never leave me, I won't let you leave
The ho turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love wit her
I saved that ho 'cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heart-broken she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna loose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her c.r.e.a.m. I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act
When she not around, I'm heated, bout' to lay somethin' flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Oh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Oh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Oh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Oh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Oh money, money, money,
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Oh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich
All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us 2 together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup,
'Cause when we hump we do it up, make sure we both will bust a doller sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slingin' all night long, fienin' to stroke ya
Seeing niggas wit' you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Oh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Oh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Oh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Oh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Oh money, money, money,
Yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Oh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich
I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you
Before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me 'cause I'm wit you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
Its hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat wit' government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I like'd you better when you where illegal
But you had to get professional
Musical
Now when we fuck we use profalactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxuary, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya ASSets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Oh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Oh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Oh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Oh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Oh money, money, money,
Yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Oh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich
My money, money, money
Oh money you my honey
My money, money, money
Oh money you my honey
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Oh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
My money, money, money, yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Oh money you my honey, she says without her
My niggas got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be fullies
Brrat, cars peel, the east coast cartel
Rats get they tail snapped and trapped
It's snitches in the streets and it's snitches in rap
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya
Coroner choruses, some from the Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of fallin' in a elevator passin' flows
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers
Picture ya tarot cards and bodyguards gettin' sprayed up
Sabotagin' my make-up, my watches get laced up
Even if they indited Jacob
Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off
The frivolated shock to ya chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from a iron
I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit
Got bitches high as Hell and they fuckin' like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to ya hotel or made in this shit
Put a barrel in the capo mouth, till his scalp come out
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about
Came poetic, too many haters to count
Too much paper to count, QB bitch
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money over bullshit, pistols over brawlin'
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper black carpet
Thinkin' 'bout which nigga to target
You kill a nigga today, he lives forever
So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no martyrs
Black tech on the table, mag four-four
Black negligee on my bitch, she's at the door
Black fish eggs nigga, that's the caviar
You niggas is fish made, y'all niggas is fifth grade niggas
It's fifty ways to die said the general
I give you the top five, you will not survive
Rule 1 cocksucker keep my name from ya tongue
Rule 2 thought you knew don't fuck wit' God's Son
Rule 3, see, matter fact I'll just wait
If y'all reach top five then I'mma eat y'all alive
Each one of you guys that claim hip-hop is still alive
Like y'all ain't in agreement wit' Nas
I said it's dead muthafucka, it's dead bitch
From crack pushers to 'Lac pushers, and ambushers
And morticians to fortresses, case dismisses
Laced in riches, cake ridiculous, from nickel and dimin'
To trickin' them diamonds, Vegas, places in Switzerland
From nine blast to the auto, have to blast mine
They blast mine, black nine, you flatline, my cash climb
Buy rare art, antique pieces, Mona Lisas
Own, no leases, five star restaurant eaters
Don't forget who ya peeps is, 'pose to dyin' wit' you
Sip that good wine wit' you, only if they grind wit' you
Or slang for ya, seen niggas live, laugh, party and
Die on that very same corner
Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable
Private planes landed out in ???, weed I twirl
Once even gave me a phobia, that I'll be in the spot
Trapped like a Madam Zenobias wit' this kid eyein' my Rolly, yo
There it is... QB bitch... yeah... QB bitch...
Yeah... yeah... QB bitch...
American born, American raised, American made
It was packed on the Ryker's bus
The tight cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killa
Mothers of dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shortiez gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry
It is I that step up
Me that don't give a fuck, you that bold, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Range's through the desert
Fuck a 20 inch, long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter
I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max
S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back
But yo
Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns
Clean fun shootin' dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe
Courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in this system, I'm bout to rebel
There's not a bitch in sight
All block bench, all block gates
All gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown man cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Everytime I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the news flash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
Now mi love fi see the schoolas dem a graduate
A study hard and save the party for the holidays
Diplomatic with dem Diploma
And them bound fi great
Because dem nah pick up no matic and a perpetrate
And then I love the energies whe dem a generate
My Generation it so special it will make a change
Because the elders sew the seed and it a germinate
So anytime dem see the progress dem a celebrate
Because we rising up despite of the economy
And then a we a star the show like the astronomy
And how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly
Because we keep remaining true without apology
The mission ha to carry through and finish properly
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe Paris to Napoli
Say Zambia to Honolulu back to Tripoli
And everybody want a future living happily
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
Can you blame my generation, subjected gentrification
Depicting their frustrations over ill instrumentation
Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing
Placing my life in front of your eyes for your observation
Now if you can't relate then maybe you are too complacent
Athletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements
What's up with your motto?
Will you lead? Will you follow?
Improve your values
Education is real power
I reach 'em like Bono
So get rid of your self sorrow
Add some bravado
Get wealthy likes Wells Fargo
Its truth, that I am you
And I am proof
Surviving through
We do what we gotta do
Yo we could break the cycle let nobody lie to you
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school
Cause there's a mission we gotta finish before we leave
This generation is destined to do historic deeds
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
Uh if you weather that storm
Then that rain bring sun
Been a long time comin'
I know change gone come
Man I gotta keep it movin to the beat of my drum
Last night I set the future at the feet of my son
But they thinkin' that my generation gotta die young
If we all come together then they can't divide one
Don't worry 'bout it just be about it
Got a message from god heaven too crowded
But I say hey young world you've never looked betta
And I heard change started with man in the mirror ughh
This generation
I'mma represent
A generation led by a black president
Now how's that for change
Who knew that could change
I don't even look at the flag the same hey ughhh
So when you finish readin revelations
Thank god for my generation
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
Word to Will, buried in his fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose draws
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under beds, mask and a flashlight
Living my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mama told me from weed, I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack-on
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Bopping to the supremes, smoking joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want
I did it my way, from crumbs and roaches and rats
I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps
I did it my way, from break dancing, back spins on the cardboard
I did it my way, to bullet proof bentleys, gats in the car's door
I did it my way, never gave a fuck what nobody said
I did it my way, they hope that I fail and wished I was dead
I did it my way, if I fucked op it falls on me
I did it my way, I'm lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Juzzi's, gucci soap, throwing cash in the air
Though I, still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get with I got
They think its alot, the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, coming if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder till I seen my man get popped
No blood soaking, laying there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was looking right through me, Yo staring beyond
I wonder what he saw, the limoes, movies and tours
Did he die in vain and represent for the cause
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
I did it my way, from crumbs, roaches and rats
I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps
I did it my way, I call it how I see it niggas
I did it my way, if you don't like it so be it niggas
I did it my way, I make my own rules, I do my own plans
I did it my way, gangstas do what they want
Suckers do what they can't
I did it my way, taking sacrifices kid
I did it my way, but now you only getting one life to live
Yo, hoes in my fold can slow me, roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scolding my foes who phony
From blocks where coke can feed you and cops are over evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesil
Here on and blow it rurals, its mine, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappear
Snitches and bitches, smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminiscence and remember, sitting on wood benches
Gave me splinters, just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, moving
I think the ones who said shorty go home, we about to be shooting
Yeah, uh, uh, real niggaz dawg, ya heard
Yeah, journey to the life, just journey
I'm the nigga that ain't loud
Throw C-low, never ace out
Only move out wit a particular crew, I hate crowds
The observer, money and murder the hood praise it
I was raised in it, early age
Was presented with the ultimatum
Be a boss with a army, drop the Atari games
Hard cocaine that had my neighborhood strung out
Brains numb out, guns out
I was smart high hopes in my heart
But dope cartels would emerge
Bloody shirts on niggaz while they hollerin'
Till their lungs don't work
Figures I end up with a scarred memory of my youth
With dudes in the drug loot, feelin' henny SHOOT
My nigga Will still here, man I wish it was truth
Buried in his favorite shit, FILA sneakers and FILA suit
My eyes are the window of my soul
My niggaz let the Indo roll
Thinkin' time flies we gettin' old
That's the words of my right hand man, my main dawg
We been rollin' since day one, he down for the cause
All he talk is extortion, kidnap shit, big gat shit
I'm like - yo think positive, but he act sick
He only think about lettin' his Mac spit
He like fuck who he hit
Me it bothers, 'cause he know I'm rent 'em it regardless
If he keep wildin' out he's makin' both of us targets
So I pull him, tell him on some deep shit, try to school 'em
We already lost niggaz by how we was movin'
We still livin', but our lives need much improvin'
I think I'm gonna lose 'em
I was blind in this world
All I thought about was diamonds and pearls
I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl
Nappin' his kids, ransack and run through his rib
Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live
It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror
Like all this time, it's just a fragment of my mind
Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be
Feelin' like I got the dons clout
Trigger pawn cocked glocks spray up your moms spot
I ain't playin' wit you, war, fuck pistols
Bring machines, icy bell buckles, ten guns, M-1'S with ice muzzles
Life's a struggle, get your wifey touch too, everybody involved
Homicide, doctors patchin' up your war scars
Task Force chargin' at us, news flash, thug crews blast at officers
Coroners pick you up from the grass
Livin' fast till somebody tries meltin' my chest
I'm high losin' it, could of hit my own self with the tec
Refuse to quit, but I tried tellin' me to relax
It's like I can't hear my words till I'm trapped to the max
Even then I blame everybody else except me, pops left me
I was just three, I cried for help, moms was busy
That don't mean nigga's stupid
But I got a habit wit - makin' up excuses
Was born ruthless, hated school, they ain't teach me I'm a bad seed
Planted in this ghetto, where my niggaz can't read
Multiply, subtract; only knowin' how to count cracks and count stacks
Now what y'all know about that
One side of me wanted out of this life
Glue traps on the floor for the mice
Till the nigga saw the light
I wanted money when I got it, I would spend it
I wanted jewels, but when I heard it, yo I wouldn't listen
All of the drama in my life I got my self into
All the toxins my body took in, faded my mental
I let these niggaz words get to me
But I'm tired of my ice, tired of Bentley
It's the end of the century
I recognized the world is a beautiful place
Niggaz opinions ruinin' my musical taste
'Cause every time I caught a case, could of got me in jail
If you wasn't scared of jail, you more likely to fail
I thought the whole world was cursed, from the hand I was dealt
Word to my self... word to my self... word to my self...
I was blind to the world
All I thought about was diamonds and pearls
I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl
Nappin' his kids, ransack, run through his rib
Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live
It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror
'Cause all this time, it was a fragment in my mind
Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you lookin' for? You the question and the answer
We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
Summers, coolin' off by the fire hydrant
Yeah I'm from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level - it's not unusual
To see photos of dead homie's funerals
Aluminum foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners
Girls dye their hair with Kool-Aid
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade
But this nigger's paid, ancestry of slaves
Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling
Put rims on everything, where Timbs on every scene
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you lookin' for? You the question and the answer
Do I mean it like a slave master, nigger?
No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes, take off the bracelets
Savers went broke, smokes, our diesel, need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Thought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses' lost commandments like a growth sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peepin' us, every week I must
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreamin' of
Between cuttin' hard coke with new razors slicin' my fingers up
They used to string us up, we wanted everything
But the one bringin' us cake be the snakes like the
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistake, tryna get it like Medellin
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you lookin' for? You the question and the answer
{My nig', what up my nig'? Yep!}
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I ain't just rappin' for fame
I got my old homie, half-sister's father askin' for chains
Yep, I get it cash up, this paper don't matter
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
'Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
They callin' it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'
I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me
You'll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So let's keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you lookin' for? You the question and the answer
Yeah yeah
Hey yo, black, it's time,
Word, word is timing?
It is time, man
A'ight, nigga, begin
Yeah, straight out the fuckin dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo, now
Rappers, I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin
Musician, inflictin composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin cocaine
Holdin an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peep holes
I'm suited up with street clothes
Hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner, bettin Grants with the Cee-lo champs
Laughing at baseheads trying to sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin about the last time the Task Force flipped
Niggas be runnin through the block, shootin
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers back up, the MAC spit
Lead was hittin niggas, one ran, I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, yo my shit is stuck
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now I'm jettin to the buildin lobby
And it was full of children, probably couldn't see as high as I be
Got younger niggas pullin the triggers, bringing fame to they name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight stickup kids, they run up on us
.45s and gauges, MACs in fact
Same niggas'll catch a back to back
Snatchin your cracks in black
Yo theres a snitch on the block gettin niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drops
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring ya customers and measurin pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin and they wives basin'
It drops deep, as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Be havin dreams that I'm a gangster, drinkin Moëts, holdin TECs
Makin sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock, sewin up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin gunfights with mega cops
But just a nigga, walkin with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin
Thinkin of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the P.J.'s, my blend tape plays, bullets and strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back black
I'm livin where the nights is jet black
The fiends fight to get crack I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain and be prosperous
Though we live dangerous, cops could just
Arrest me, blaming us, we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dice
I'm takin rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin is a vitamin, held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, twenties of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I could greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words in my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothin's equivalent to the New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Nasty Nas
Uh
Yo, yo-yo, y'all
Whattup? Whattup
Straight up, it's time man
Aight, set that shit off
Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors, look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma shoulda cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin
Stitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark -- NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve; they bust a U-e I jog
To my building -- come out later wearin camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain -- strangle men
Niggaz gaspin for air; till they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes -- tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sister's pregnant
Father's on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested
Had eight partners growin' up, eight turned to seven
Seven turned to six niggaz, got two in heaven
Six of us, holdin' it, now it's five rollin' thick
The sixth one's parole flipped; five niggaz, went to fo' quick
When he went O.T., college life, converted into gangbangin
Four niggaz still hangin', years passed and slang changin
Three of us now, fourth nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real -- he did the snake shit
Fake shit -- beat his ass down, yo his mouth
Could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown
All I got left in the end is two of my best friends
And we all goin' out, to the death for these ends, WHAT?
You heard about it, you see about it
You read about it, it's in your papers
New York chronicles, every day
The crime rate, the murder rate
The money rate, the paper chase, youknowhatImean?
New York state of mind baby, check it out
I'm at the, gamblin spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home, to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggaz sing along
All the ciggarette smoke's cloggin my lungs, hoodrats flashin they tongue
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggaz both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggaz got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in the lead
'Cause I ain't playin', niggaz'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggaz'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggaz, just New York niggaz
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on em, you knew 'em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggaz is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggaz that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggaz, that relocated down South
Comin' back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
Runnin' round quick to split your mug, it's ea-sy to score
But it's hard to get the shit off
Niggaz fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggaz, mad 'cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggaz scheamin, some real, some niggaz frontin
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin'
New York, New York
New York, New York
Tougher than concrete
Eh bwoy
Go labbajuice

Its Genocide
It's a Genocide
It's a Genocide
Its Genocide
5th Floor cooking raw
Had my own supply
Cause of capitalist ways
That was back in the days
So now I do rap and it pays
They mixed this shit up
I'm tired of these niggaz, niggaz stealin beats
And niggaz is stealin, your whole techniques and shit
Niggaz wanna take everything from a nigga man
Niggaz can't do it like I do it, d'yaknahmsayin?
Just like niggaz can't do what you do
You know all these niggaz out here just...
Talkin' this East coast West coast bullshit
Niggaz need to kill that shit
And make some money, y'know?
All these niggaz talkin' all this bullshit
Better sit back, and watch what happens
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court - and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable 86's, foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting, ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan, can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes, chrome kitted up
Calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts, I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot, without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you
Nas is coming, Nas is coming
Nas is coming, Nas is coming
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face, like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands too
Make examples, substantial amounts you owe, to the fam
Crew, Firm affiliation, paper chasing
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabarno
Sophisticado, Blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to L.A., Q.B. to C.P.T. for G.P.
A hundred G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars, Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout, murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's something venereal
But back in stereo
From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent, stay spliffted
Control the rap game you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way the 'Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Crist', push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all, Nas y'all
Fly gangster, wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk, links truck
Rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero, black DeNiro
Federal Bureau, tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro, diamond roll, hustling low -
Pro-file, white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile
Shot down, still alive he struggling for the phone
.44 blow him, when homicide comes, these three words are sung
Check this out
It's Nasty Nas, and Dr. Dre
Hahaha, East meets West
That's how we making it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Aiyyo Nas let's get this money
Let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfucking clowns out here
Riffing and beefing about this BULLSHIT
Yo, heh
While they doin' all that
We just gon' kick back with these honies, this Cristal
Hah, and party to the year 2G
Hehehe, that's right, that's right
Yeah, Nasty Nas, Dr. Dre
Makin' it happen
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born
Same time a man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin your life
Is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and hell, rap legend prescence is felt
And of course N - A - S are the letters that spell ...
Nas, nas
Nas is like life or death... my rep..
My poetry's deep, I never fell..
Nas is like... half man half amazing..
No doubt..
Nas is like.. Earth Wind and Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
Nas is like.. Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
Came a along way from blastin, techs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes, givin' fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my nine spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth, can't take it when you under this Earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Makin' choices, that determine my future under the sky
To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much to success to ya, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is
Nas is like.. Sex to a nympho, but nothin' sweet
I'm like beef, bustin' heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, greenleaf reaper
Like Greeks in Egypt, learnin somethin' deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for
Always got you, I'm like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
Combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam'
I'm the feelin' of a millionaire spendin a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it, and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night
Now...
Uh, 2000 G
Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back
You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
'Cause I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse
While you listenin' to the words that I wrote on the disc
I slob knobs like I was on the street
Felonious, my description is do-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, 8th Day in the street till I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playin' for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, we in a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah
1 - Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar
Naughty, it's Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar
Naughty, it's Nastrodamus
Repeat 1
I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
Let Nastrodamus tell us what time it is
I was the first one on that Don shit
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spendin' your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggaz in jail
Slingin for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sportin' Gators, gettin' thrills
Our honies wearin' Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar, sunset, and the sex is so high-tech
Uh
Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne
We gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you see over from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Tow G's, we got the type fam with Mac 11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, DRJ watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eyes, can understand that I'm...
Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Ill Will
Nastrodamus
New LP for the 2G
Uh
Bravehearts
Nation
Big Things
Lucciano
Oh, the Lord again
M-O-B-B Deep
Zaire
Crack
Cocaine
Yeah
Hoe
Jungle
Raise hope
Yeah, word
Got some Remy Martin
Some good-ass cigars
Check it out
Ayo, late night, candlelight
Fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand dollar bottles of scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cuttered
Count how many bad honeys I slutted
It's a high number, name a nigga under
The same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah I wonder
Eyes flutter as love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo
Cigars, drop robes, hoes, drop clothes
Louis XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown, and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semiautomatic weapons I brought
The world Crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince 'em, all appraise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and State Key, my jewelry in HD
Silent rage, ristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage
I am the dragon, Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high, I Neverland like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack your rib
Sacrilege, talk trash about the Nasty Kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceiling, the safe, bitch I got it
You envy but don't offend me
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me
Too godly to be a Bugatti
You honestly must design me
Somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the '90s
Drug dealer car, rush to the bar
Move niggas, we don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet, in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact
Haha
For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin'
Sayin', It was Nas I used to hustle with
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashes
Guns on my waist, pass this
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joining the blunt passin', you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in the wars, in the streets cops kickin' in doors
For my deen, nigga, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
I'm no fake rap CD listener
Sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my G's, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga
Queensbridge, 41st side
Yo yo yo
I gots no birth records, no next of kin
Know a lot of mothafuckers, got no best friends
Know the weather checkin' ten-ten winds a.m.
First and fifteenth I'm layin at the check cashing
Think I'm playin', blink and I'm sprayin
Wrong move, ask yourself what leg you wanna lose 'cause you gon' lose
I cripple niggas, from the complex to simple niggas
Keep showin y'all what difficult is
Half the world sayin' Dunn but never been to the Bridge
What type of shit is that, fraudulence, what's the cause of it
Nature came threw erasing all of it, stop the presses
Goofy niggas ask a lot of questions
I repeat this is not a question
If you don't reply quick enough I gotta press em
Keep the glock by the intestines, .38 waist
Wit a belt, regardless of your stats you can catch a shell
Yo aiyyo I rap for my niggas and rap for the hoes
Rap when I'm gettin' dressed, when I iron my clothes
Depressed, I kick raps that change your whole mood
And somehow stick to your ribs like soul food
Rap for wheelchairs, rap for canes
Ace bandages and niggas wit sprain, stay limpin in pain
I rap for math, English, even rap for science
Gotta try to laugh, keep myself from cryin
I rap for Giants, the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets
It's New York New York, from Clue to Flex
New cassettes stay poppin' up, your boo let me throw my cock in her
Rappin' got me two proper nuts
It's crazy, I even rap for high school coach
White folks fiend out like in Michael Doates
Creamed out, dope stashin
For those askin, I flow for TV, HBO and closed caption
Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo
Don't go to Texas, don't go to Watts
Don't go to Queensbridge, nigga don't go to cops
Don't snitch when you're gettin' bagged
In the penns, don't bitch when you gettin' stabbed
Just hold that, I pose for Kodak's, rose to stardom
Hoes in Harvard, sophmores get knocked off, nigga watch yours
I watch the game like it's Saint John's
It ain't wrong, take a blank piece of paper, a pen paint songs
Type colorful, writin that shit a thug'll do
In the heat of the moment, type to make a sudden move
Some'll snooze, some'll snore, they won't admit that dunn is pure
Once I quit, niggas wanted more
Cop my shit once it come in store
The first week be at the top of the charts, got it jumpin' off
Hot verses wit a hundred thoughts
One theme, gettin' caught in my zone you'll become a corpse
I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum
Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days
In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze
I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke
That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off
The infrastructure caves in, amazin'
I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men
Serve niggaz, bird niggaz speakin' reckless
When their momma love the kid's records I made
You gutless, you don't know struggle
Throw a couple slugs at you, hell grabs you
Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine
I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen
Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand
I'ma guide you like the OG, but don't talk, don't get it confused
'Cause none'a y'all can fit in my shoes
Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions
God'll forgive you bastards
Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage
I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?
Form a crew, swallow forty cal' bullets after dinner's finished
Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full'a scrilla
Can't come close to, Francis Copala, Samson -- no Delilah
You're pint-sized, I'm mic's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it
You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap
Tell you a story shorty, spicy like lories
Chickenheads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties
Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours
Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes
Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys
Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage
You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage
Son's backward flows, they say mine is very scary
Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies
And all of y'all wear that same aroma
How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya
You're wack nigga, face it
In the history of the game, you have no placement
Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity
Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth
But when the sun go south, them comes come out
My cavalry woulda been threw ten in your skin
Casualty you don't wanna be, don't want it with me
Straight savage
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world,
It's a new world, it's a new world
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world
Yo, celebrate the new life
New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin gold
Solar-energized rides, no steering wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve, computers takin' over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin
New life for man, children, and women
Yo, the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones
Bill Clinton's the new JFK, without the hole in his dome
The new Don Trump is Bill Gates
Not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake
And cake mean his stock, net gross
Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars takin' pictures
New hustlas gettin' new street figures
And US embassies overseas
Almost every foreign country's under siege
Covertly startin wars, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
Oil in the earth spills
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage
Say goodbye to the brainwashed
Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart
Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts
Yo, it's real
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal
Say hello to the one world
Say hello to the sky, somethin's out there watchin you and I
More enticin than Star Trek, StarTec phones
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones
You got CD-Rom, everythang operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks
Y2K's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrare
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothin' make me more happier than seein today
Uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
No idea's original, there's nothin' new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major
If niggaz could look inside my mind, you'll find
Where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the braincell graveyard
Where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
No Half Steppin' with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin' on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork and Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
On a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
Your part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them, treacherous rocksters in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin for paint chips, don't want no led in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin since Roxanne Shante' made Runaway; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist
I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things like
Somebody's always watchin, my life
Before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled
Headline readin Rapper Slain From a Man Shootin
P.S. 111 at free lunch, embarrassed but managed to get a plate
We was kids hungry, Mom's working I was famished, she getting home late
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full of starve, corner store like Mr. SpareAQuarter
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
15 I got a gun, 16 I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun, what's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, 'til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the mist of
Dudes who switch up and change
They want to carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them know, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow
I remember early mornings - syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth 200 million now, bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing 40, she only 21
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion black motherfuckers
To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back
1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him, I spread them, hit them and dead them
She says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven
She says, it is the greatest loving
The tales you hear is the truth, on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis - this goes to her with love
Also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha Explain
Ooh!
Maxwell go and sing
Ooh, this for the ladies
M-A-X
Doin' it
N-A-S
Again, again, I'm back again
Uh, yeah the booty is the bass
The highs, the beauty in ya eyes
First glance I became alive
She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise
Now she would decide on Nas
'Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me
In the party, it was a early day a March
When I first had ya legs arched
In the park, wasn't even dark
We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch
Baby was the wine though the trees was sparked
She said till you get enough, please don't stop
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top
My hair cut look air brushed
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks
As we sashayed across the dance floor
Just, me and you no one else but us two
No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room but you
There's nobody but you
No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room but you
There's nobody but you
No other girl in the room
In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall
A super freak as my thoughts revolved
It's like a menage Winona Gaye and Leila Hathaway
Both they fathers a tell me to play, sip Jose
On our honeymoon everyday
We dance to the same tune everyday
Beauty and the goon they would say
You promise, savage beast
You a sexy freak
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy
Number one in my book, no discrepancy
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me
I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe
No matter what's going on around us
No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room but you
There's nobody but you
No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room but you
There's nobody but you
No other girl in the room
Uh, horns!
Clap
Everybody clap
C'mon, clap
Max mellow 'em out
Oh it's just my, it's just my, it's just my girl
Oh, it's just, just my, just my baby, you
Just you, just me, no one else but you
No one, no one, just me and you, oh babe
Clap! Break it down
You know it all comes from Africa
But my version is the blues
What nigga! What bitch-ass niggas! What! Babe, babe, start the car!
Nasir, come on let's go! Get in the car now, let's go! Throw it out, let's go!
Aight, aight, aight, yeah. But I got 'em. But I got 'em, though.
This is crazy, why didn't you just throw it out of the car? This is so stupid, what are you doing? Why are we even out here? Why are we out here? What's going on? This is retarded, yo we gotta... This is crazy. Never again. You'd throw everything away, for what?
Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me son do not look back
Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax
When people act schoolin' with facts, tell 'em
At this point in my life I'm all about chillin'
Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies
And twist, homie's hermano just died I gotta let it ride
That's what I got the public thinkin' my nigga
Just 'cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit my nigga
I know who died before the body dropped
I know the guns that were used how much money the shooter got
Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all
The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time
Is all we talk when we talk of New York y'all
Who to call and who to stay away from
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe son
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up
What cars and what trucks they drive in what towns
They spend the most time in when they grindin'
I found out most of them are cowards they hidin'
Behind reputations that's sour
Not going back
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
First thing that happen when you make a little paper
You think the Marriot is livin' in a skyscraper
Till you come across some even more flyer paper
Realize that five-star 'tellies are even greater
Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit
Heated-up marble floors with ja'causezis in it
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
All those things you still ain't really doin' shit kid
Cause in reality I'll earn my salary
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
It kinda make me wanna hate bling it's a race thing
How they sell blacks to bootleg shit infact
Real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
Whores charge niggas with raping
'Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
Watch us make bets on race tracks smokin' cigars
So they counter the laws to take what's ours
Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars
Instead of goin' back I'm buying the projects
But I'm not going back the hood's in me forever y'all
But I'm not going back
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
And of course y'all know what I'm not going back to
Those no friends of mine...
Ten carat gold it shine...
Sony if they don't have dough to re-sign...
Y'all know that I'm not going back to
Those liars who would...
Not help you if they could...
Coke on the stove in the hood...
Y'all should know that I'm not going back
The hood's in me forever y'all
But I'm not going back
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
A lot of times it seems like, you ain't gon' make it where you wanna be in life
But, yo if you got a plan, believe me you gon' get there
You gon' get everything you ever wanted baby
That's my word
Trust, my niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tour in
Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
Guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood mb cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a le tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up
From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot willin'
Look at the chain I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'
Half of the crew probably on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought
Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife
For steppin' on the next man's nikes my motto look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
Be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin'
Poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin'
Gucci iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs
One for your wife, one for your freak silver spurs
Rolls Royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
Pool parties beautiful view
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin' damn wish my niggas could afford this
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments
Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried will your familia
Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum
You should live, there's only one life that's the physical
Rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you, the shit you use to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turn 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real
Everything must eventually come to an end
So try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever, ya know
I said everything eventually comes to an end
So try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Ya know, ya now, nothin' lasts forever ya know
Yeah yeah.
On the... On the... On the.
On the real, all you crab niggaz know the deal
Finally up in this nigga
Let's pay homage to Illmatic
Let's put the crown where it's at
10 years
Never been done this real by nobody
To my seed, May I lead you into no greed or evil
In the categories of stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, Monkey do
Shorty sipping sunny dew
Now it's V.S.O.P. in a Phantom, mad smoky
Murder trees, cruisin gat in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Trump Plaza, Suite 3010, don't make no noise 'cause we dirty
Tell them hoes hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom
And there's video taping bloomin ass's on the zoomin lens
Rollin' on you nondescript niggaz
You're marked for death like Colombians with bad coke that gyp niggaz
Tilt the dutch, twisted up the uwee if you're skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts
That verse is 10 years old, 9½ years old
Street's Disciple
The Rebirth comin' at you this year baby
It's on baby
Yeah
To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles
This is mandatory, what if there's not tomorrow?
You know the murder rate, jealousy, you heard 'em say
He say, she say, I'm bout cheddar, he don't deserve to make
Sippin clear liquor with niggaz, that talk sideways
Listenin close, to every word in case they violate
Up in the projects Apartment 5D
Spark a lea' it's bout da reed, countin' everything the block see
We bout to need to take the corners from them cowards
Get it on so y'all can move more coke powder, by the hour
Hold in case we gotta rip niggaz
Loaded - Teflon coated projectiles'll flip niggaz
From ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my man's with guns in hand
Police vans, they missed the summers again
Yeah, power to the people
Death to the phonies
This beast to the mic 1 2 check
Y'all fed-e-rallies on me
And they look like you
Approachin me like How you, Homie?
The F.B.I. see only one problem, they try to slump me
After the young black male 'cause he makes a lot of money
So hustlers make crack sales 'cause they deprived and hungry
My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies
While makin' cake with real golded plate rims on Hum-V's
The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga
Just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders
I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow
Motto no stress, smokin' less than I did befo'
You see the kid was broke till I spitted vivid expressions of hard livin'
Ghetto children, of a lesser god, religion was fast women, expensive cars
Y'all witnessin over 10 years - THE BEST OF NAS
Word is bond, you got six millions on that jack hero, this shit is real
Ayo ayo ayo, ayo check this shit out, man
Ayo God, give me a cigarette man
Yo, here you go, here you go, here you go, come on
Check it out man, check out what I got here, man
You know I got to check this, what is that?
Yo, this some letter I've got from my man Nas, man, word is bond
What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should have slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flipping, talking 'bout he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurting something, word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'mma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wilding on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwilding in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, till he come home he'll play it low key
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad
For the weekend hittin L's while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rolling two phillies together, in the Bridge we called 'em ooh-wops
He said, Nas, niggas could be busting off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black trey-deuce
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'm ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge, and all over
To my man Goon, one love
To my man Herb, one love
To my man Lake Luciano, one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big Bo, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love
Word is bond, you got six millions on that jack hero, this shit is real
Ayo ayo ayo, ayo check this shit out, man
Ayo God, give me a cigarette man
Yo, here you go, here you go, here you go, come on
Check it out man, check out what I got here, man
You know I got to check this, what is that?
Yo, this some letter I've got from my man Nas, man, word is bond

Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'm ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge, and all over
To my man Goon, one love
To my man Herb, one love
To my man Lake Luciano, one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big Bo, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love
Word is bond, you got six millions on that jack hero, this shit is real
Ayo ayo ayo, ayo check this shit out, man
Ayo God, give me a cigarette man
Yo, here you go, here you go, here you go, come on
Check it out man, check out what I got here, man
You know I got to check this, what is that?
Yo, this some letter I've got from my man Nas, man, word is bond
What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should have slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flipping, talking 'bout he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurting something, word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'mma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wilding on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwilding in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, till he come home he'll play it low key
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad
For the weekend hittin L's while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rolling two phillies together, in the Bridge we called 'em ooh-wops
He said, Nas, niggas could be busting off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black trey-deuce
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'm ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge, and all over
To my man Goon, one love
To my man Herb, one love
To my man Lake Luciano, one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big Bo, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love
One time... yeah... yeah...
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit
Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics
Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his heineken
Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in
Blackin out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it
Till everybody come home, little niggaz is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sip from the star sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die, with nines out
This is what nas is bout, nigga the time is now!
Yo, all I need is one mic...
All I need is one mic... that's all I need
All I need is one mic... all I need niggaz
All I need is one mic... yeah
All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one, look back
At all the hatred against me, fuck alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots
From twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my guns was holdin' 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs
My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
If y'all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust
Led flyin, feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now!
All I need is one mic... that's all I need, that's all I need
All I need is one mic... there's nuttin else in the world
All I need is one mic... that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know
All I need is one mic...
All I need is one life, one try, one breath I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you
Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns I'm blastin 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? fooled you niggaz
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my range, niggaz throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes
Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real
Heard he was, tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searchin, the time is now
All I need is one mic... yeah, yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic... that's all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash
All I need is one mic... fuck the cars, the jewelry
All I need is one mic... to spread my voice to the whole world
Turn my headphones up
Nothin' gon' stop me now
Aha
Nothin' baby
Nas, Brainpower'
I'm here now,
I'm here, it's your world'
It's yo world
Ya hear?
Dit is voor al m'n peeps en fans en hers en ders
Die verder kijken dan de pers de kudde meningsvorming de herder dit vers
Hoe heftiger de stress des te verder de levensles
Zich ontwikkelt des te verder 't besef
Wat moet je zonder liefde beginnen mis geliefden beminnend
In 't diepste van binnen met om in liefde voor zinnen
Vertaal m'n tranen in 't leven in lyrics zwevend woorden banen zich
Snel wegen in de geest met lanen en stegen
Binnenin huilt m'n hart z'n weg naar m'n vingers kan 't niet echter verzinnen
Hand om m'n pen, en m'n text kan beginnen
Sirene wenend zwaar naar m'n Brain
Van jarenlang een vreemde eend tot een maand op nummer 
n vibe, Nas and Brain op 
It's Illmatic, huh
Check it out
When I'm chilling, I grab the buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexing
Keep lubrication, lifestyle protection
Hitting up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well acappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a forty top, yeah
Right, right, what up niggas, how y'all? It's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writing rhymes, but besides that I'm chillin'
I'm trying to get this money, God, you know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold be starving make you wanna do crimes kid
But I'mma lamp, 'cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catching three to nines, Muslims yelling, Free the mind
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a nine, fine, see now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on and off 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make ya heads bop, pa
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I raided
I hold a Mac-11, and attack a reverend
I contact 11 L's and max in heaven
Yeah that shit was crazy fat Paul, know what I'm sayin'?
But check it, you gotta another verse for me
I want you to kick it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Kick that shit for the projects
Here we are
Here we are
Yeah
This one right here is for the people
Ay yo D. Let's go all the way on this one
Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a fly go a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
'Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the west
Will never move east
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord
Yeah, Sabali. That's patience. That's what the old folks told me...
Discovering the World before this World. A World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer
Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round if the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things that he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out the root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze and that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wed mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive, Against All Odds, Now?
It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react
You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant
You're scared of the truth, be patient for now
Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hue? what's man? what's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch n-ggas play the game like the lakers
In a world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day 'cause
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'pardon me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless... I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn
This goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World
Sabali, Patience, yeah
Uh, light somethin', stop frontin'...
How much money's enough? Think maybe like the trillion figures
Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton sisters
That'd kill me yo, filthy rich
My daughter pass it on to the next generation
Throwing carnations at my tombstone
In my new home
Meet moms in my Yves St. Laurent suit on
Then we do a dance like my man Luther jam
But my verse came first
I stole change out her purse
Now I wanna dig her up outta the earth
Too morbid, lean forward toward a new paragraph
Blue carats, D-Class
Strictly that cush in the weed bag
Tryna figure out what Berry Gordy had put in production
Studio smoky now, hard like David Ruffin
Hit a spliff through a séance, and I, play on playa
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta get your papes on, play on playa
Before it's all gone, sip Dom, tip waiters
Do the yacht thing, ménage swing, baby
Spendin' dubs on your buzz, gotta live crazy
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Get your papes on, play on playa
Get your papes on, play on playa
Get your papes on
Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose
Rubies in Hey-Zeus piece
Pimped out like Snoop be, but an East Coast thing
My girl stock-ing tied up in a knot, top of my bean head
Billion dollar dream hear
Went from triple beams to digital
Serving fiends, the minimal
60 G's, no criminal
No mo', Just mo' doe
Mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings on fingers
While your girl performs cunnilingus
'Cause this big money aroma lingers
Barber cleans his blade, then he give me a fade
Hot towel on the face
Hot models who vomit after they eat so they can stay lightweight
Swallowing my protein like an Ovaltine shake
Come through like Moe Green from Godfather, so clean
Where I step, I Clorox it
Keep 20 G's on both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets
Eighty thousand, browse for the nicest price
But we ain't into buying Conflict Ice
That's the shit they stole from the Congo and other black soil
True mack for you
Nappy hair, just spinnin'
Honey gave me a massage with the happy ending
Finest females I just came on, and sprayed her
Gotta get your papes on, play on playa
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta get your papes on, play on playa
Before it's all gone, sip Dom, tip waiters
Do the yacht thing, ménage swing, baby
Spendin' dubs on your buzz, gotta live crazy
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Get your papes on, play on playa
It's kinda hard for a playa like you
But let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue
What you never do
Is punk out, what you better do
Never let the game get ahead of you
Get a better view
Better yet a better crew
Praise God, I'ma marry you
Get your homie, carry you, bury you
Slowly, roll me another blunt stuff it
Lick it, puff it, tuck it - fuck it
That man, that gang, that bang it was
In D-O double G we trust
Yep yep, young loc with the two step
He creepin' with two Tecs
He's sleepin' with two chicks
End of existence, for instance
Rewind it, replay it, re-chop it, remix it
Re-twist it, god damn D-O double G, 'cause we missed it
Travel slow, I'm a Indian but not a Navajo
I smoke the big leaf in all the big deef's
My hair in two braids, I'm the big Chief
Ladahdah be dahdadah
Yeah break that down, how fresh ya are
The king from Queens, Mr. Escobar
Connect with the best from the west, yes yes ya are
Oh my God, it's Snoop Dogg and Nas
Playa play on...
To My Nigger who brought me in this world
Taught us right Nigger
My old dad imported to the family structure
Provide her God
My moms a queen at university civaliza
My pops maybe was late but always came home
My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
Soon as he walk in the door she barking
I turned out the Jonny Carson
Jumped out the bed
We grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother
Not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting yelling at each other
My papa played the street all day
Mama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone pepping out the window heeding
But still I didn't see it
Mama hid it from us
We was kids younger
Till we got bigger, on to
Bigger things that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving the crib and moms love
Papa was player, player wasn't papa
Papa loved the ladies
Never got enough of
Pretty brown round
Don't tell your mother what's going down
So many kids I knew, never knew what Pap was
That's why I show my pop love
He was still around when I fucked up
He could have left
My moms pregnant shock to death but stayed
Watch me crawl till I took my first step, to the first grade
To my first fist fight
Right behind me he would stand
No matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in your eye, swing my right scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches and weed all over my crib him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing
So then I asked him
What's this white shit on that plate and your facing?
Papa why you butt ass from the waist
And who's this lady I'm facing
Dark skin you're not my mommy
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promise things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth close and don't tell mommy
He said one day I'll understand little me
Was in you to side me
Papa was player, player wasn't papa
Papa loved the ladies
Never got enough of
Pretty brown round
Don't tell your mother what's going down
Pop's told me hold my own
Pop's told me value home
Could I help it papa was a rolling stone
Who loved the pretty brown round
Out of town bound
Jumping in his jazz Benz he touring
At home I play his latest recordings
And it's strange now how, I do my thing now
I'm in the game now
And heard of it his brain pow
To pull strings and gain power
From weed habits are same now
No white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes
And beats that be pumping
Before he left he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed till we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life next day they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together then someone will get killed
I love you still
Always will
Cause that's my nigger
Although you felt you was wrong
I still feel you kid
Life goes on
What we need to be thinkin' about is the future!
We don't know what's in store tomorrow!
All we can do is just guess! We want the best for tomorrow;
For our family, for our children, for our future
But if we don't get up andact like we want it,
We gotta pray to somebody! We ain't to tough to pray!
You walkin' around like a gangsta, gangstas pray! Thugs pray!
Tell me somethin'; if you ain't prayin', where would y'all be today?
Where would y'all momma be today? How would you be here?
Somebody prayin' for you, nigga!
I never thought bein' a man you could hang in the end
Facin' life with no parol and consecut' sentencin'
Got people witnessin', your co-defendant snitchin',
Your back against the wall, your left eye is twitchin'
Loyal ladies usual, a D-and A's the mutual
Scared to face the light of a courtroom site
Racist cops on each side 'cause the know I just might
Make a break for the door but I give it my all
If I die in this struggle, give my momma a call
Since I fell dead broke, landed in jail
Refused to face the facts, how wifey skipped to town with the bail
I'm on my own now, V8, far away from home now
Palmer wealth state, the law changes each date
Secret inditements got me knocked, there ain't no price I can pay
To get me the fuck up out this shit, so to Allah I pray
For forgiveness - Yes, I sinned and I need to be held
And jail ain't no place a black man wanna be killed
Amen
I only pray when shit is fucked up!
I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!
I only pray when I'm in mothafuckin' handcuffs!
Callin' out for someone, somewhere!
Is there anybody out there?
I look up at the sky, why do young niggas die?
Felt the stray hit me, somebody stay with me
Fallin' to the ground with the sound of a four-pound near me
Bitches screamin', wish I was dreamin'
I fought a thousand gun fights, near one bullet skipped me
On the morning run to get my little sisters Rice Krispies
Played the numbers knowin' that I got my lucky dice wit' me
See some niggas I know I can roll - Uh, uh!
Get them bitches, left all of them broke, left what they smoke
Hoes yellin', 'Watch ya back!'
But before I could turn around, before I could I react,
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Would you look at me now?
Is this blood that I feel as I fell to the ground?
Feel like a head shot but maybe just grazed my temple
Niggas diggin' in my pockets, sayin' I just rolled a pimple
Yo, my mouth was movin' but it was nothin' I was sayin'
Only if they knew deep inside my mind, I was prayin'
Amen
I only pray when shit is fucked up!
I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!
I only pray when I need his help the most, what?!
Callin' out to someone, somewhere!
Yo, is anybody out there?
Ain't nothin' stoppin' me - Untouchable - Hoes, I fucked a few
Style like The Greatest, Ali - Check what the knuckle do
Rock bubblegoose to mink, big links,
Yellow ice, live the ghetto life, 'fuck y'all think?
Bravehearted; fuck around, get graveyarded
Dearly departed - The word on the street, I'm a target
I ain't runnin', I ain't hidin', I'm ridin'
I be gunnin', y'all be duckin' and divin'
When I come through buckin' this four-fivin'
Revenge you sayin' you gettin'
But shit is gettin' too wild, this lifestyle of sprayin' weapons
So I check out the preacher - Life is off the meter
Thoughts of homicide, tryin' to dodge the reaper
Confessions in a church 'cause it hurts, behind a curtain
Nigga talkin' to me, but I ain't certain
Voice sound familiar so I pulled the shade back
It was this stupid nigga that I popped way back
He set me up, he just got to the preist
I tried to reach but he had his heat pointed my way
And said, 'Pray'
You've got to pray, huh! I mean pray, pray,
And when you pray, you got to look up to the lord, huh!
You got to look up and you got to pray for your children, huh!
You got to pray for that man in front of the liquor store, huh!
You got to pray for that man on the corner! He know he doin' wrong,
But somebody gotta pray for him, huh! You know we doin' wrong,
But we gotta pray for ourselves! You know we are headin'
To this new millennium, goddamnit! They say a comet is comin'
To this world by the year two-thousand, I say it's God! It's up to you
To pray to that higher power higher than yourself and humble yourself
And, and, and beg for forgiveness 'cause it comes back to you!
A man told me that while he was in jail, all he did was pray.
All he did was stay in his jail cell and pray to God...
This is my openin scripture - I've been preparin this album
My whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners
Satin's bombardin me with propositions, but I decline
I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in
I overcame all the opposition
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not bathe in napes
But we still filthy, Supreme Court say we still guilty
This is the Genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis
I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac
Now I'm defendin Vic, and free that nigger TIP
I'd take the grave or a bid
To let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's goin' to church
Plants packs on the man that's goin' to work
And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruitin all my brothers and cousins to fill bases
The nerve of y'all to call Escobar racist
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger hatred
It is absolutely silly and unproductive to have a funeral for the word nigger when the actions continue we need to have a movement to resurrect brothers and sisters not a funeral for niggers cause niggers don't die
Ugh yeah yo I'm creepy and crawling
In your sink and your toilet
I'll be drinking from your spit
Anything 'cause I'm more less an insect with 4 legs
People come and I fake dead
Correction I got 8 legs
Climbin on top your plate bed
Where ever I smell food
It could even be jail food
Stale food that's molded
A roach is what I am fool
The ghetto is my land fool
I'm a never be able to fly like a bumblebee
Try not to be underneath
Your sneaker
Pitiful creature
I'm not afraid of your pesticide
Or Raid
Cause in heavens my creator
I love it when the lights off
Eating from same knives forks
From any man's dinner
See my antennas
You can't win
You can't stand the crunchy sound I make if you squash me
Learn to live with me
How much your roast ? costing
You and the city
But yo we everywhere
Check your house 'cause I bet we there
Black hoods, cops 'n' projects
Sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Changin top locks with ripped off hinges
Doors kicked off, drunks stag off smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare
Vision blurry, 'cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era
Finished for the rest of his life, till he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood but no signs say out
Mental slavehouse where gats go off, I show off
Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, till they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Yo, if this piano's the cake then my words are the candles
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
Now they dismantled, think the whole world is crazy, got a 9
Watch where you walk, 2 dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hi Satan, United Nations quietly taken, to own your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation
Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, 'cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow
Perishin', brain dead from a Erickson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune
Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla
She said go and see the world for myself, and my brother Shafala
Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
Sang the rules, guitar strings he played smokin' his?
? Hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' 'cause somebody pulled a knife out
So I look at this poem, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, ?????
Reading's what I should've done, 'cause my imagination would run
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustlas and hoes, drugs and fo-fos
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows
Oh, outta my window
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, I feel uninspired
Starin' out of, of my window
Oh I, feel so tired
Oh yeah, outta my window
Oh, lookin' out, lookin' out
Lookin' out my window, oh yeah
Makes me, feel so tired
Outta my window, out my project window
Lord I feel, uninspired
Light it, uh
Light it up, uh
The whole, city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it, it's just an intro
Hate it or love it, like it bump it or dump it
Writing, across the stomach spell GOD son
Life is like a jungle black it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggaz packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, mack strong, couple of shots
May the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that, be possible
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle
I'm blowin' circles, my state of mind purple
Light it, light it, uh
Yeah... light it up, light it up, uh
Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggaz who got things, y'all ready to kill his momma
Everything you went to is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind his shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryin' to be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground but you
Still standin, still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You've got a bunch of thugs witchu even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you but behind your back they've prayed for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you've killed, and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars, holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tier in jail, makin' weapons that kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes nigga pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin' circles, my state of mind's purple
Light it up, light it up light it up, uh
Light it up... light it up, light it up, uh
Uh... uh, uh, light it, light it, uh
These hot-headed youngsters, always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin, in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggaz rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward, to blow up so what's the science?
People shoutin, police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier, with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of, suspect faces
It's usually, two or three niggaz who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide and fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
Or Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness, too much of anything'll hurt you
So, my state of mind's all purple
Ugh
Crazy
Yo pussy kill me
Ugh Ugh
Ya ya ya
Huh
Ugh Ugh Ugh
Pardon me I rephrase it departed mommy wound decayin
I look at the bright side, the fact that I got a life side
True, Virgo child
The first thing I learned is money makes the world go round
On a small planet, its 10 women to 1 man
I wonder how we managed
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage
Niggas is some nasty creatures, bitches even nastier
They throw it at your boy and it's hard for me to pass it up
Freaky ho's licken niggas ass and nuts
Stupid bitch bragen till her baby dad went nuts
And now were looking for me, 2 cars deep
Rollin' up on niggas
I can't here dat 2 4 5 nigga grad at
Pass it to me sucker for love niggas I blast at
I swear my dick is gonna get me into trouble, I pissin bubble
I thought I felt a sharp pain betta stick to rubbers
When lain, hooker after hooker down and day
Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name em
Just a thought we all fuck the same chicks
Some play like they innocent
Fucken entertainers, and basket ball players
The bitch is a ho
But still some of y'all il say ya put your dick in her dough
You're just a nigger that life to her, she thought your crazy
Now your monkey ass want to shoot the pimp that pipes her
She had your baby, now you a lifa
The suicide note you write her
Pussy kills
O what a thrill inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong and handle, it is real
Pussy killz
Mad shots keep a nigga open
Bitch have a nigga's gun smoking
Pussy killz
My nigga James got married same girl he went to school with
Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was to stuck
Studied for her masters, part time nurse
I tell you how superb the ass is, but who's looking
And I mean that's my man, maybe I just took a peek
Maybe I wondered what it would be like, syke, cause James and me like
I was with A Z like, Luke and Han Solo
Fuckin' with niggas girls, forbidden, that's a no no
It's death and we're real niggas civilized guards
And there ain't to many niggas like Nas I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheatin'
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life even
Happy for James cause real bitches hard to come by
This nigga found one, I told him he was lucky an clown something
Rollin' up duckies while watching Roy Jones in round one
He froze put his to the TV about an inch close
Move outa the way nigga what the fuck the matter with you, you blind
He pointed to the front row, thought he was losing his mind
She was supposed to be with her sick mother
Left for the weekend, stress when she was leaving, now she next to some nigga cheesin
He pictured them making noises, grindin 'em and kissin' em
Yellin', ain't no telling where her lips have bin
Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser then
Ten minutes later and they start wrestling, and screamin
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left, she wasn't at the fight you speakin'
That's Vegas this is New York you bugin
I held up my hand for dat, but he wouldn't touch it
I was like when you started actin' like that, this is dumbness
Gave me a crazy look and started swingin' punches
I ducked couldn't believe it, the niggas so wet
He got his gad and started squeezin, hit two police men
Neighbors dialed 911 they heard the thumpin
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumpin
Me and his wife hit to the floor she smelt strange
My comrade was breathing no more they killed James
O what a thrill inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong and handle, it is real
Pussy killz
Mad shots keep a nigga open
Bitch have a nigga's gun smoking
Pussy killz
Queens get the money, niggas steal screamin' paperchasin'
Presidential candidates is plannin' wars with other nations over steak with masons
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangstas they daddy's faceless
Play this by your stoamch let my words massage it and rub it
I'll be his daddy if there is nobody there to love it
Tell him his name Nasir, tell him how he got here
Mama was just havin' fun with someone above her years
Niggas is still hatin',
Talkin' that Nas done fell off of rhymin'
He rather floss with diamonds
They pray please God let him spit that uzi in the army linin'
That shorty doo-wop, rollin' ooh-wops in the park reclinin'
Take 27 emcees, put 'em in a line and they out of alignment
My assignment since he said retirement hidin' behind 8 mile and the chronic
Get rich but dies rhymin', this is high science
Now add 23 more for Queens to B-more
I'm over they heads, like a bulimic on a see-saw
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time
Nasty Nasdaq, y'all gonna bow homes, this Dow Jones
80-cal chrome, needed time alone to zone
The mac left his iPhone and his nine at home
My queen used her milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughterhouses
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses
This that nigga shit that's on the album
For them niggas inside the chalk line and forty houses
Bring back Arsenio
Hip-hop was aborted so Nas breathes life back into the embryo
Let us make men in our image, spit it I'm Huey P. and Louis V. at the eulogy throwin' Molotovs for Emmitt
You ain't as hot as I is
All of these false prophets is not messiahs
You don't know how high the sky is
The square mileage of earth or what pi is
I'm the shaky hand that touched George Foreman in Zaire
The same hand that punched down devils that brought down the towers
Where my real niggas at
There's a lot of real niggas out there
There's a lot of real niggas everywhere
That's why you don't fuck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin'
Not botherin nobody, until one motha fucka fuck with em
And then all hell break loose
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones that get killed
It's wild where we walk kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Well known gangstas, in trust
That we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motha fucka beggin for more
It's the reason
Standin here shakin, hatin' the haters
They watchin my paper
Realize, a 4 5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop
Nigga standin there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show yawl motha fucka's respect
Plans connect
The twinkle and diamonds upon my neck
More jazz than Hornecek
I blast and leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya
Spittin' like the trench coat mafia
In a school yard we make it hard
Was poppin' yawl
We made our change was stoppin' yawl
They spray your names rest in peace on the ??? wall
I wave gang signs at the youth, that's down for the cause
Cling them things in the ??? you betta get yours
Time is runnin' out
Your streets is gettin' smaller as we speak
Juliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit of days we did this
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eatin, not killin' everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is deaf, umpires keep ice grilles
There's no tomorrow it's the bottom of the 9 9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My hearts full of braveness so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen star and chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You can find us in the hood; thuggin' and regulatin
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You can find us in the hood; thuggin' and regulatin
We here to eat food, my peoples, be lethal
Shots in your body make you see through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life, big never cry niggas
Floss when they up north
Chest gettin' bigger
Celebs on the V I respect that nigga
Rege on the regular chops is up; like a editor
Come through on man gang like the predator
If yawl wake I'll wet it up
Jungle set it up
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin' at you
Air out your area, Queens Bridge forever, what
Ill will the label
Bravehearts yawl scared of us
Yo when those niggas ran these niggas stayed
With these niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick 'cause we paid
Don't even rep Q B
You ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you frontin
And its good night
Know how much force this is
Juggle horse and whiz
Notin but horses kid
We go to war for this
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime cruise
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you
I see you standing there so lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you're home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive, guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep makin' my millions
Can see myself in presidential campaign dinners
But I'm gassin' blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And out grow women you love and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mill
All you need is some skill, then it's grindtime
Imagination better than knowledge, say's Einstein
It's all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all excited, you all repeat it
So call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I force you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moet
When you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me, Olu's son
Now he Nas father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener
Beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don't understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood'll change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out of gangsta business seen in me you basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, gold any different faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbours, growing up I've seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my bread is nice, can rival your foamposites
Don't make me pull my lotto's out the closet
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggaz pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum
They judged us, thinking that we dumb 'cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?
Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Caribbean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know
I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
'Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
What's the reason?
Ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa
I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
She called the cops 'cause she hated his mother
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover
How many niggaz gon' die this summer?
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? 'Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
In her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?
Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what
Try to conquer all. So what? To all my niggaz with they
Kids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there
To all the niggaz that died tryin'a figure out what's what
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah
Ladies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what
We do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and
Shit. Just man... man.
I think I can remember some...
Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy till we played catch a screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you
Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you
Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
Are we tempted
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you
Think I can remember some...

And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
Are we tempted
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you
Smokin' that weed at nigga
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryna watch us and knock us
And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about Gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moet drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
'Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'mma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too with Swoop, Bokeem
My brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life and every projects, all over
To my man, Big Will he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S.
Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid
Can't forget Draws, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogi
And my man Primo, from Gang Starr
Come to Queensbridge motherfucker
Let's bring it back, that's just a warm up 'cause I can
On anybody anybody
The rest of my life
The rest of my life
LIFE, dead presidents, devilish meant
Overthrow kings from they thrones 'cause of their negligence
DEATH, real shit'll start comin' to light
Niggaz you ain't like dickin' your wife, WHAT?
Kind and underminding, grimy, stiff corpse shapin'
Pork bacon, double-cross Satan
HEATHENS, non-god-fearing, lace thong wearing demons
But glory go to God, y'all BENEATH HIM
If y'all don't know that, rap with a old cat
He'll show you streets where them big dealers DROVE AT
Where low-key killers let the fo' clap
Blocka-blocka-blocka -- OH
The glow, the 'dro, the dough for shows
Everything a hood brother think he needs -- YO
You'll find a goal in a ghetto superstar's roadmap
And I'ma use that for the
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Burnt-out, kicked to the curb
So I had to learn how to turn around a hundred thou' REAL FAST
In '95 that was my last, I went back to the ave thinkin' rap's a thing of the PAST
Rest in peace E Money Bags, no more cabs, got caught with the ratchet in the stash
Lawyer want CASH, my ba'y bro blast burners at cats who gell
They burnt a range with a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL
My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover
Them cops SWEAR, my little nigga told on me
I'm thinkin', Hello, where's the L-O, V-E
Pigs play games, my little man'll never say names
Word to his pops with elephant veins
They both locked-up still, word to Will
I'll make it and chill for the
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
My man gave his mommy coke
So she wouldn't hit the block all crazy for the smoke
DAMN NIGGA, could you picture you supplyin' your own moms
So she don't have to bone for DIMES?
Or give dome for nicks' in the roofs of the projects
Where dogs shit and PISS
Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed
Lexus coup-ed, brigettes from cubics
Mighta been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six BARS
To ten LP's, what can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all?
I'M NAS, on a track that's unorthodox
Like my life coulda been offed by THE COPS
Told y'all, Nas will prevail by the book when it's up for sale
About the rest
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause
I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause
I gotta take you off here
Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness, in all them
Gotta shoot only if necessary
Homey vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
Where Arian nations ain't having integration, we so blind
The beauty of life, was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right, Jesus!
What is he like? I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in, difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool
But chronic's a fool; got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out
My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's, I build
With dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill, in dix hills
For fish scale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef I'll snatch your seed, from chuckie cheese
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's
Black fatigues and r15 on the sofa
50 inch flat screen Louie Vitton holdsters
My motions don't appeal to repel at divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler, black gorilla, crip and blood in one nigga
Only killas know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton
Listen up gangstas and honeys with ya hair done
Pull up a chair hon' and put it in the air son
Dog, whatever they call you, god, just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the ending
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet hole's closin this chest of a nigga
Now he back to square one
Screamin, Shoot don't please
I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewindin a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch
My caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, Go he there
Sittin' in back of this chair, we hittin the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, Outside right we
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for ya
'Cause Jungle said, Block your on enemies the
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed thinkin' 'bout this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, No hell
She talkin' 'bout, Me kiss
Bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick
Started suckin with no hands, a whole lotta spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, Stressed really I'm
Picked up her Gucci bag and left her nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited Vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three, to two, to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, Son we found that nigga we gotta kill
Ay yo son, ay yo son, you hear me, you hear me?
Listen man, this dude right on the block, right now, man
I found him, right now, I see him right now!
Yo, this Nas, leave it. Peace
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I have no time to give you guidance
Barely have any fuck time either
Hefner minded like I think you're fine, but
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it
Who should I date --
Project chick or Cuban actress?
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that
You'll be mad forever
Never played you
I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams
Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions
They some silent killers, that stress shit
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas
I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper
I done went to hell and back
You always think you right
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song
You want to kill 'em right
You resent me every time I make a million right
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz
Your own house, everything, me I understand
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on to Martin Scorsese Mean Streets
The first movie he made, thought that was fly
I thought you was flyer, you a fucking liar
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nas, uh
Yo, yo, life, they wonder. 
Can they take me under? Nah, never that!
Yo, yo, I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
Well, survival of the fittest every day as a child
I would think I'm a part of USA and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars, but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ain't your king from Fiji, welcome Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
There was Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanistan
Yo there was Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
Cut since the beginning of time, it's been man with arms fighting
Lost lives in the towers and Pentagons
Why then must it on, we must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children
All this hate can't last forever
It's time that we stand together
Everybody wants to rule the world
All those brothers on the block posted up like they own it
That's Daytona from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, dog, you safe whenever you with me
See, this is my town
So the youngstas, pros and ghettos goes to prison
At a early age, already know it's against them
So in order for him to survive one day
He must open up his eyes to the set backs
'Cause everybody wants a shot in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the President fix all the problems when he ain't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources own its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by secret service
I guess attempts at my life are loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell, just throw in a towel, yo
All this hate can't last forever
It's time that we stand together
Everybody wants to rule the world
Y'all know that's my style and hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain to cause
You alive right now
There's so many that dead or locked up inside the beast
I'ma holler it now
It's whatever man think'll manifest to be real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gonna see you again
Hoping I'll reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In hip hop the weapons are lyrical
To be the best, you challenge the best, and the blessing is spiritual
Top of the world for the kid none less
Popping any Rappers head off his shoulders, no contest
I know the most high hear me, so far you can't hear me
You scared of a mirror
My theory is that knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner
We gotta get out of this now
All this hating lasts forever
It's time that we stand together
Everybody wants to rule the world
Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red ferari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, Nas, roll with us
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Don, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's till tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him Here keep that
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
She said
Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
'Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on this 'cain, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a hoe has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Haitian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all
They wanna shine on 'em
Yeah
They dug me out the soil in the Mines of the Motherland
Now I'm misplaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yeah, guess that's how we got here
Slave Trade then the Diamond Trade
Every child's afraid
When his Mother and Father get sprayed
Forced in the Army, young killer Brigade
Gets a new name and then he give his nose glue
Till his mind can't take what he's gon' through
Lookin' in that dirt for that ice so blue
Then The Royal Family, the ice goes to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half-ashamed
As I rap with my Platinum chain
When you shop for a gift for me
You think about the misery?
The same way we made Apartheid History
We can do the same thing to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine, right?
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna Shine on 'em
My VVS glimmers on my chest
200-thou-encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how people starve to death
When God bless the land that lacks the harvest
The stone's equality, but they homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks when she's mad at me
Tear-drop shaped, uh, perfect Clarity
It shocks, so many are killed annually
'Cause of greed, lust, and pure Vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every Holiday Season, Jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from their homes, Mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives, keep a Jesus piece to be fly
But back in the day there was a time when they called us shine
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em
One 44, two 45's
3 loaded clips, 4 niggas roll, one nigga drives
500 Benz, 6 reasons why
This kid should die
We shootin' every motherfucker outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car, guns in our hands
At the same time every body ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, 7 shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor
Then we shot some more
Niggas he was with
2 niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tryed to run, go get him son
Make sure hes done before we bail, I ain't tryin' to go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street
Load up the heat, if these niggas think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things
By all means, niggas know how we get down... it goes...
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, What...
Kill Kill Kill, Murder Murder Murder
Driving throught the roads Suburban Chevrolet
6 tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringin' the bell, where in the hell
Could they be at, I'm about to leave
Steppin' slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that?
Could it be a jack?
Now I pull my strap, it's my man
And we have the same plan
There them bitches go
Civic '94, looking funny though
Open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck 2 already, 3rd ass was heavy
Nas this is Sherri, Sherri this is Nas, and his man, Ready?
Walked in the house, snatched of they clothes
Ran through them hoes
Plenty ice that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a BLAM BLAM
Now I'm wondering, In this scam, do I even stand a chance?
He killed them hoes, took all they doe
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky
Comin' down the stairs
Now he wantin' mine, reachin' for my nine
Aiming with our guns at eachothers face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
Put your gun down, we can skip town
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain
Took his shit, emptied out close range...
Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, looking for Rambo, the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasing niggas through my project maze
That cop he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday he making ten arrests, shit
My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde Caesar
Vetacini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She do be looking weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speaking loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolving, like cotton candy in a mouth that's starving
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
'Cause she's a nympho, sucking dick and coughing up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he vest up, we blazing from the neck up
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first
We busted in the cop jerked
Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down, aiyo the bitch is saved now
She's living in a snitch grave now
Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God to save the life that the Devil sold
See 'It Was Written' but was never told
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
Trying to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot
Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man going up creek
To do his two to four, niggas show love, from all around the board
Peace Lord, Sony Handi-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, 'cause when you come home we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
And Frank tried to stop the bank loss, about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own the hill
Couldn't take losing his cash, and I could feel
Something in the air yeah, Frank returned with Pierre
A gun slinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holding - 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reaching
They had gats in each others faces, with kids
And grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waiting for that to set off
Running the static, it got me mad 'cause they a bunch of faggots
Starting shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo High, get the 40-cali stainless, Jake is still out
Let's make it real and still make them niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearing Jake retaliating, and Wiz was up the alley waiting
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleeding inside, and ain't been back since '95
Silent, silent
Murder
It's sort of like the conclusion, the colour purple
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block, shorties in school quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in the palace of Persia.
The cognac plurger plus the trees,
But whose the foul one to make his nose take a freeze,
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype.
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress
Since I got a problem with the law-writers,
I kick some more items just to explore horizons,
The palm lady dreamt of this day so I'ma play,
The crib close smoking with the big toast and lay
They say the arms of Nicki Barnes would be enough to blast,
A lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas
Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz
Fuck what they teach in class I'ma reach the mass
Strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics
Living practice, out of line niggas get smacked backwards
So wear it if the cap fits, fold it up money and mad clips
A stack right under my mattress
To smoke a nigga like a Hugh Bros. motion picture
Niggas getting open cruise, whooping older niggas
April fools they laugh the jokes on the benches
Cease outside my nigga spoke on his sentence
Silent
Silent, silent
Murder
My right handers never play too close to cameras
It's night time scanners circle the loud gamblers
Peace-making niggas pep talk
The peace-making niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew.
Time to get this loot countless, 'cause sun it ain't no youth fountains
Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and Pakistanians is took hostage
Locked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up
What's the flavour when your neighbours do jake favours?
Lock them real niggas down and letting fake players
Roam around the project this lyrical logic I dilute,
The weak can object the right composite
We're plotting all murderous schemes,
It seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of Queens
The palm lady dreamt of this day, so I'ma play
The crib close smoking with the big toast and lay
And Cain killed his brother Abel when God accepted Abel's
Offering and not his.
Abel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God,
And Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder -
Drove him to murder
The sly fox, cyclops
We locked in the idiot box, the video slots
Broadcast the Waco Davidian plots
They own YouTube, Myspace
When this ignorant shit gon' stop?
They monopolize and use your views
And the channel you choose
Propaganda, visual cancer
The eye in the sky, number five on the dial
Secret agenda, frequency antenna
Got the mind bender, remote control soul controller
Your brain holder, slave culture game's over
What's a Fox characteristic?
Slick shit sensin', misinformation
Pimp the station, over stimulation
Reception, deception
Comcast digital Satan
The Fox has a bushy tail
And Bush tells lies and Fox trots
So I don't know what's real
Watch what you watchin'
Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from The Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say Big Brother is watchin'
Watch what you watchin'
Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from The Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say Fox 5 is watchin'
The fear factor got you all riled up
O' Reilly, oh really? No rally needed, I'll tie you up
Network for child predators, settin' 'em up
Myspace pimps, hoes, and sluts
Y'all exploit rap culture, then y'all flip on us
And you own the Post, and y'all shit on us
What is they net worth?
They gon' try to censor my next verse
Throw 'em off the roof, neck first
While I'm clicking my cursor
Reading blogs about the pressure they put on Universal
It gets worse while I'm clicking my mouse
While they kickin' my house
They figured us out, why a nigga go south
It's either he caught a body, no sleep they watchin'
I watch CBS and I see BS, tryin' to track us down with GPS
Make a nigga wanna invest in PBS
Watch what you watchin'
Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from The Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say Big Brother is watchin'
Watch what you watchin'
Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from The Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say Fox 5 is watchin'
They say I'm all about murder murder and kill kill
But what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill?
What about Cheney and Halliburton?
The backdoor deals on oil fields
How's Nas the most violent person?
Y'all don't know talent if it hit you
Bringin' up my criminal possession charges with a pistol
I use Viacom as my firearm and let the lyrics split you, who do you rely upon?
They shoot shells at Leviathan, I'm dealing with the higher form
Fuck if you care how I write a poem
Only Foxx that I love was the Red one
Only black man that Fox loves is in jail or a dead one
Red rum, political bedlam
Don't let the hype into your eyes and ear drum
Murdoch on Fox, not A-Team with Baracus
And he hate Barack 'cause he march with the marchers
See no evil... fear no evil... speak no evil... hear no evil...
If you don't bring that shit around you
Know what I'm sayin'
Yo, yo yo yo
Carolyn, from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Keys of dope, lovin' cats to ski in her throat
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her iced throat, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passin' for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shoppin' when she not, coppin' bricks of that shit
She hoppin' on dicks, ridin' Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually, bumped into her shoppin' for jewerly
Her bodyguard screwin' me, I gave her my math
Ain't nuttin' new to me, blowin' backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look, with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, Shorty's a pro, she blow head
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about cats from way back, we smoke a haystack
She never cough once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably
No doubt, not since he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me, to do her dirty work
Nigga you reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you don't know
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world
Snook from Redhook was grimy, did five years, glad to be home
From Attica known for keepin' chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
Five years plannin' to blow, soon as he hit the briddicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month, and deaded his P.O.
Started robbin' niggas till he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starvin' niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, Don't knock hard
Layin' with his bitch, niggas is rich, is what he told her
Played the block, holdin' cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossin' fast
His old man had crossed his ass, for the laws of this fast cash
Nigga reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you don't know
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again nigga
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
It's a small world
I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
We let the slugs fly, enter your brain, through your skull
Another thug died, pitchin' your soul, into that infinite
Black hole, where many souls go cause of a fo'-fo' blast
Snook was one of em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore, got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her, ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dopefiend OD-ed, eighty-five
He went crazy, stuck up banks, to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried?
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He starin' at me hard
Two of his man's with him, I got to hit em
I'm reachin' for my Roscoe, cocked it back on, and get my blast on
At the gas station, bunch of Arabs racin'
Out the way, as my Torah spray, jump in the whip
Hit the highway, you know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out who's who, keep it true
Shit is cool now, put the tools down? Never
Cause everyday it's on, livin' this life, out for this cheddar
Nigga you reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you won't know
Where beef, never ends
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
It's a small world
Uh-huh... I'm going to see you again... nigga...

Some of us have angels -- the kingdom, the power
Some of us have angels -- the power, the glory
Some of us have demons -- greed, and lust
Some of us have demons -- lust, temptation
Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the jooks at?
These are your niggaz, creepin' they be leavin' niggaz sleep witchu
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin' on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin lonely homey chickens
All the homies stick em, you think you own 'em man listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin'
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled till you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices
Two sides of us, negative or positive
Now this is your mom, your good luck charm
Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin' for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin, God take me!
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops seperatin
Spittin' image of a gangster the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
Niggaz around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangster, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit
Now once again this is you, entertainin your desires
Bitches money and guns, aimin and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin your seed
Tryin' to eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin up niggaz, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggaz
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the ? motivate my spirit
And now the body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will till permanently, my eyes are closed
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah
For niggaz up in they mom's crib listenin
To this unadulterated Nas shit wishin it was then
Instead a, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package
And they would send the dope back then
Numbers, pimpin' and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin'
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin'
Trips expensive gift shoppin' whip drivin'
Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin you thinkin' naw it's just rhymin
But all this time it's like organized crimin
For instance, there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper
Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
The government watchin all of those who thuggin' it
They wanna lock us up 'cause they kids are lovin' it
Not knowin' that most rappers are straight ass
The shots ring out, whenever we clash it's Star Wars
We call it Star Wars
What happens when the shots ring out, Star Wars
We call it Star Wars
Caviar never, I rather the Cajun blacken
Catfish no snails simple nigga to please
Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks
She remembers Busy B battles when it was peace
Caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different I thought
Niggaz was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shan and Scott LaRock in the jams
Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin' mother had a motherfucker
I don't think about it niggaz talkin' there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a plant yes
Do trees grow from a forest MC's y'all are clitoris
Y'all niggaz roll with any click that's winnin' any crew
Doin' whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
Ain't enough room in this town
What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out
This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police
Not what you read in tabloid seats
These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
Because the game was supposed to be sold we livid
Came from the streets we the voice of the youth
America's nightmare was given a the mic booth
Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
Rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs
Entertainment, this is our world this is our language
Different regions speakin' east and west gang shit
You got your positive shit like, Common Sense
But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube
Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
Fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggaz who tell you your all of that
Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin' it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin the place
Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in Kay Bee Toys store
Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggaz check you
You 'gon let that nigga play you, you know we 'gon rep you
Next mornin every news channel and front page
Headlines another rapper was slayed, this is Star Wars
Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringin' home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt ya happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Beamer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm livin' dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watchin', she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind decidin' which baller to rock with
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'mma just...
Stay
Even though I don't like you, next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait, do I got love for you?
I might kill you, but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under 6 feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other, but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the heart of a slain enemy
We enemies, but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame 'cause they need validation
Some say hatin' is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushin' a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to...
Stay
Some people really are
As he wavin' his shorty hi, you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl call, feelin' she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out, she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be goin' through problems you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep, what do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull ya mink out
Or grab ya roller skates and, turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out, doin' the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make ya scream out
They are still dreaming
Some people really
Some people really
Some people really are
How you a man waitin' for the next man to get rich?
Yo' plan is to stick out yo' hand real quick
So if he feed ya family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all ya life
Dwellin' on the past when you was all right
When you was gettin' cash but wasn't too bright
Now ya luck down you feel like, bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggaz to show you, how to come up wit' green
I scheme since I'm fourteens, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, sayin' you was seen
Wit' little niggaz wit' a chain you was doin' ya thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye
We on a different echelon, coulda got bread together
Now you gets deaded on
Some people really
Still dreaming
They are still dreaming
Some people really
Some people really
Some people really are
She had several cars, she had credit cards, a castle
Large master bathroom, gettin' a pedicure
Belaney by the glassful, said she been meanin' to ask who
Would need a cash rule, who could blast tools
And I'm eatin' cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school
Grew up wit' my dudes, like one of my crews
She worked for Fox News
One of her man's that she lent her drop to
Won't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it
Sheets was recordin had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards
Still dreamin'
Yo, I still run wit that,
That blood of a slave, boiling in my veins
That blood of a slave, heart of a king
Turn my voice up
Ayo the brotha's Stillmatic
I crawled up outta my grave, wipin' the dirt
Cleanin' my shirt, they thought I'd make another Illmatic
But it's always forward I'm movin', never backwards stupid
Here's another classic, C-notes are fallin' from the sky
By now the credits rollin' starrin' Nas executive poet
Produced-directed by the kid slash Escobar
Narration descibes the lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to suvive
The feature opens wit this young black child
Fingers scratch, cigarette burns in the sofa
Turnin' the TV down while Mary Jane Girls 45's playin'
Soft in the backround, food from C-Town, mornings was hashbrowns
Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door
All of us poor/ I learned the difference between the snitches
The real ones and who's soft and the murderous
Hungriest crews, people jumpin' from roofs, shotguns pumpin'
Made it through my youth/ walk a very thin line
Ages seven to nine/ that's the age I was on my album cover
This is the rebirth, I know the streets thirst
Water like Moses, walkin' through the hot desert
Searchin' to be free, this is my ending and my new beginning
Nostalgia, alpha and omega places, it's like a glitch in the Matrix
I seen it all and did it all, most of y'all pop for a minute,
Spit a sentence then the game will get rid of y'all,
Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all
I want my style back, hate to cease ya plan, it's the rap repo man
To them double up hustlas
Bitter niggas who real, professionals stick up kids dreamin' for mils
Let my words guide you, get inside you
From Crypts to pyros this is survival
Blood of a slave, heart of a king x4
Uh, what, what, uh...
Street dreams are made of these
Niggaz push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for somethin'...
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggaz with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something...
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent till proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'ma fulfil my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God's sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
Without the FBI catching feelings
From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the Nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early '80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope rocking niggaz gave me
The street raised me up, giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out
Low profile, rap style, slick as Nu Nile
Give the crew pounds every time we cover new grounds
Still surviving but there's a few down, back in the essence
I'm asking questions on the phone, with jail adolescents
Quiet confession, the system's applying the pressure
My mind is guessing, is living and dying a lesson?
But not to be obliged with the mirage
Of cars taking you off track
From with the gods focus on hard
Laid up smoking cigars
Motioning maids to bring me toast and eggs
Kosher, ice chokers and wolves to smoke ya
My wisdom culture lives in ultra madness
Devoted coach bag bitch
Broke the average nigga's hopes to get mad rich
But what's the purpose
Only the Gods can watch the Earth twist
I'm physically trapped down on the surface
With all the crack merchants
Snakes and serpents
Foul jakes the searches
Clowns with four pounds this ain't a circus
Street dreamer
Oh mercy mercy me
Ain't nothing I got for ya
Situations gettin' heavy
Heavy, heavy
Trying to be a gangster
The black clouds over the hood, I'm on the corner with the thugs
Late night under the moon as they assume I'm slanging drugs
'Cause I'm hooded up, thought a G a night wasn't good enough
Pushed my luck, yo they had a brother put in cuffs
Luckily, made it out of court comfortably
Judge said I need a job ain't nothing coming free
Could've got a one to three
I try to school these shorties under me
But they can't see
From life to death
So know we back to where we never left the ghetto
It's a damn shame, knowing it's a man's game
Shorty thinks it's time to make ya plans change
All that running round trying to chase
What's already here - been there, it's going nowhere
Pops told me knuckle up - no fear
I wish some of these killings
They could be prevented
Whatever happens it was written
Meaning God meant it
But during ya life you put ya heart in it
Even though it seems we being targeted
Let that brother R hit it
Sort of wild, since a child, hope was all we had
Drip the bust out past
Complaning the mental straining
How many in my crew is into gaining
Subtract the weak links about the chaining
Rise it start raining
Blasphemy using Nas name in vain
Some claim supreme being yet they lied in his name
I tried to learn the game
And the only thing I found incredible
And it's embedded in my heart now
So I can sit back, count a stack
And play my part now
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes, he wore disguise
Put a gun to me hungry he went on to chastize
That's Nas ain't it, made it rich from entertainment
Fresh Wally's painted, as he told the kid he came with
My first thought was how the game flip
Yo perhaps it was somebody I smacked drunk in a party on yak
Or was I marked for a contract for some foul act
I did a while back or beyond that
You got me laying face flat
Saying my grace black, woke up in a cold sweat
Yo, I hate that
Nightmares, feeling real, word to Will
My A-Alike I lost in the battlefield
That's why I hit the mic with mad appeal
Grab ya shield and meet ya maker
Queens niggaz die for paper
These the things the street dreams will take ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes
Did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid
Crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you
Look around it might hit you
No joke, I wanna pistol fight with you
Shit comes around faster than you think
Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?
Become a creature of habitat, the average cat
Won't see where it's at, or where it's going
The hood waits for no one
I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings
Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations
From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration
Imagination is what they lack
It stops niggaz from getting stacks
Feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks
Wisdom is vital for the survival of the street's disciple
Disciple of the projects!
Moonstruck stuck, slow as molasses in my actions
That's compliments of a fast spliff in the night life
In my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin Tyson
After watchin him cut up Razor Ruddock
In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
Lookin' back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts
Older Gods wantin no static, told some lil' niggaz they can have it
Coke baggin and toe-taggin
They took Will, let me describe him, a live one
His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin'
Not to his likin, and say 'Son they bitin you
He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered
But wild with them hammers, niggaz frontin couldn't stand it
Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2
With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple
Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking
Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen
Captain Hook to these infants
It's like my folks is still on the benches
Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid
Rhyming to music all this time
Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it
Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
From the block, where the world was forever freezing
Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again
Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them
Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats
Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope
He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke
Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's, young stretch mark bellies
Babies born in a cycle, future disciples
All I do is stay focused looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go man. Let's go...
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
Hey... The victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self defeat is your own dispute
And man you put yourself in a ya own shoeses Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
Tay you starring in a ya own movie
Playing of a role you choose so
Stand up and fight if you know say you're right and no you won't ever fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail and the boat shall forever sail
Even when you're battered and bruised
Hold gun all di sprinklers and he tell him bust my gat tougher than Zeus
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death New York to Cali for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind 'cause in life you cannot press rewind
Get it right
You only have one first chance to make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputations to proceed itself do you believe in hell?
Babylon, greed for wealth Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell
And disregard those who most need your help
Thick skinned, the dark won't take my soul Survived spiritual wars, see my welts
And the evils felt but faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clenched my fist
Ready to go against whoever Tie my Timb's and rise in the end
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
No man live forever
But never say never
Every goodie want better
Just be a go getter
And always be clever
In every endeavour
'Cause drastic time call for drastic measure
Your girl try to pleasure
From ya neighbours things severe
The land and the treasure
Work for whatever
Jah say don't be a beggar
The alpha omega
Will bless every soul no matter
Which name you prefer
The immortal stepper
Believe in every skin
No matter which colour they are
Will never let you down no matter
Which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the son of Rebecca don't stop for a second
Every man reckon
It sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
As the weak shall fall to the sideline
I get my kid
I protect mine with a tech 9
Haters want me to side with em
Gangsters want me to ride with em
Ladies want me to make brides with em
I'm on a low I'm in the zone every evening
I'm in the zone every evening walk through the valley of death
I'm still breathing
Give a bit of life to your ethylene
Thief in the night like
America seen
Coming through in the zone every evening
In the zone every evening
I know the strong will survive
Ay fellas
I think you might wanna s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put your petroleum jelly on your face
Yo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets
That you knock they ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
Get 'em!
Sittin' up drunk, shufflin thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losin focus what a nigga still hustlin for
My seed is straight, the fam is settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin, my life get boring
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin, but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, leavin' behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two 9's
Next to me in the Phantom, who lyin'?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Gotta, try to stay away from creeps
With they bullshit, tryin' to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where feds be layin from a dreadful slayin
Body viewing's at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dude just Mar-salis than Branford
Thinkin' you're too rich, they wanna gun ya
Kidnap ya cause of they hunger, but you fuckin' with hunters
Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggaz die over dumb shit
Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggaz die over dumb shit
Fight, fists, dance, suckah
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch yo', big, ass, momma
To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitchin shit, all up in your body language
Mean muggin your bitch, 'cause she leans over
To look closer told you y'all sloppy gangsters sayin'
Nas is this and Nas is that
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foamin at the mouth, losin breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Cause the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, fo' to the stomach
Call more security 'cause I come off
Anywhere you at you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude that kick it to me
We possess, the recipes for death, cause jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say, That's the way you kill a man, avoid the shooting
Hey...
You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waitin on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
You wanna come cut my throat, you wanna get rid of me
But before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only, baby -- let me take pictures
Life is good, life is good
Ciroc on splash, summer on smash
Top all gone, got the on summer on smash
Tank top on, summer on smash
My neck got a whole lot of glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Look at baby girl showing that ass
She let the world know the summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Everybody get the summer on smash
We got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, eighteen karats
Little overweight, hit the gym, let's go get the abs in
Louis belt hangs on the waist, it ain't even fastened
I'm trying to get every number from every woman passing me by
She's fly; black, Asian, Boriqua
Italian, mixed chicks, Middle Eastern
Eritrean, Ethiopian, how you opening?
Just rolled four with them, bout to smoke again
Rose-gold Rollie, riding the top down
How does Pucci bathing suits on a yacht sound?
Send a massive e-mail to the females
Tell 'em where to meet us, give 'em the details
It's the summertime, women damn near naked
It's single season, they choosing who to mess with
I just smashed another belt for the record, respect it
Nas get you out your seats, play this in your Jeeps
My people in the streets, I make it feel like it's the beach
My goons close by, I'm daring one of y'all to reach
I'm protected like the President, ain't gotta give a speech
Got a compass on the wrist, Illmatic on the feets
And they ain't even out yet; she like Ciroc peach
Chain-smoke cigars, count a whole lot of cash
And y'all already know who got the summer on smash
I gotta do something kinda unexpected, huh?
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only, baby -- let me take pictures
Skin, sin; wait -- do you know whose pool you're in?
Beaches in Brazil, steaks on a grill
Your body is a weapon that you can't conceal
Real, make money when the freaks call
Summer on Mars, it's totally Total Recall
Like
Uda vida, she butterfly
Caliente
Bayame vente, vente comego, ayo?
It was a murder Jake just hit the corner people swarming
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like Fuck,
Niggaz is buck, mega bloodshed, the tapes red
I heard some bird whisper, Yo he should have ducked
I puffed the lilla, just before I hit the scene for rilla
I'm all high it's late I'm looking down at the feller
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop your life, plot
The beast in time yeah, cell to cell suspect ass nigga you fell
First time locked in crime stop my mind blocks the frail
Bursting blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch why tell
We roll with no regrets, destiny's, fifty's and equities
Queens'll be the death of me
To the suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested
Giving the jealous niggas sickness, the witness
My crew dresses, in vest-es, feel the essence
Try to test this, scientist, able and reckless
Slaughter, Nautica'd down, frames look petite
Ten millis, mix designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang low while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Rolling two Phillies together make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Ten glocks, Armani in small print, upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon, the wetting
Never freaking the beast, seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the setting
Comprehend the grammar, Manfrione -- are you the type of nigga
To shoot a leg to get your name known? I flip the brain tome
Niggaz get hit and wrap the plastic
The mic I strike in vain giving the pain of what a Mack is
What you with? Luchi or drama, no sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets are timin you
It justifies, Nas Escobar's leavin' shit mesmerized
Mega live, like the third world
Decipher my deceiver make him a believer
Spitting jim stars, words in my mic ttype receiver
Bond is my life so I live by my word
Never fraudulent Queensbridge don't make no herbs
Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin'
Rebel to America civilization caught you sleepin'
Yo; I never brag, how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest, prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watching Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A teck squeezing - executioner, winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular, center of attraction
Climaxin, my bitches they be laughin' g
They high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tachinni flipping mad pies
Low price, I blow dice and throw em
Forty-five by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan
My niggaz roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasaki's
Hip-Hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drumroll
Blanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate, watching crab niggaz marinate
I'm all about tecks and good jucks and sex
Israelite books, holding government names from Ness
Emcees are crawling out, every hole in the slum
You be all right like blood money in a pimp's cum
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that...
... For, you wack MC's
Currency is made the trusted in Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
'Earth, Wind, and Fire' singing reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill
Remi on imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around, who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, getting niggaz wigs sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tuneproof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shitting like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
In the basement - chilling on the via with Mumia
For wearing chrome - I told the judge snakes slither like Sharon Stone
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that...
... For, you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that...
... For, you wack MC's
Lyrical, ly-lyrical mission...
Lyrical...
Yo the time is wasting, I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacing, court pen pacing
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We living in, dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle where bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dopefiend, named Detroit is still dealing boy
Coke suppliers actin' gbiased
Cause rumours say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the fat Kani, it's --
-- Just the killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough holes for cracked out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses
Instead of the fake medallions
Rich niggas transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amounting to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the tecks you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug,
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that...
Yeah, Capone-N-Noreaga
Yeah, yo, official Queensbridge murderers
Mobb Deep keep it real though
Motherfucking AZ yo
'Mega, 'Mega, whatever
Scarlett O'Hara
Yo, Fox Boogie
East New York
Gambo, Brownsville
Wizard, Fort Rockaway
Big Jersey
Connecticut, D.C., Sudan
V.A. ?? N.C., L.A.
So on and so on...
Big Ha, Houston Fifth Ward
Black Ed, keep it real Moe...
Wanna dedicate this joint right here
To Johnason, Jackson, and George Jackson
Peace to those brothers
Wanna shoutout my man sherm the worm
80 years...
Come home nigga
Come home... niggas...
Uh...
I just burnt my American flag
And sent three cracker Nazis to hell and I'm sad
Uh, I'm loading tifs in my mag
To send these red neck bigots some death in a bag
Choke him out with his confederate flag; I know these devils are mad
Little rap fans that live way out in safe suburbia
Would you stand with me, a United States murderer?
Huh?
Would you testify?
You buy my songs
You buy my songs
But would you ride with me?
You understand my struggle
That's what you claim, right?
Well get your aim right
And get your game tight
Don't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it
Come into concerts, singing hoe and shit
Fuck y'all little little hoe bitches,
I don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it
Like uh, William Cooper, who told you the pale horse is the future
Would you testify with some realness like that?
I think you scared
I don't think you prepared
Yeah...
You know what I'm asking you?
Do we know what I'm asking you?
Wow...
Wow...
I pull a string on the lamp that shit darkens
I'm living in an elegant Moroccan apartment
Proletarian chicks sparking
Convo weak and I don't really care for her jargon
Balcony is windy
Looking at the stars and
I be in the Henny, woozy in the head, wobbling
Gucci pillow on the bed, while she giving noggin
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album
Thinking I should leave to a European island
Bristol and Spain, bring a book about Stalin
Dinner serenaded with a violin
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
Fine dining Olive Garden, naw bitch Nas is
In the real deal, food spots on the constant
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it
Lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches
Rolexes synonymous shit I'm copping
Ask her has she been around duffle bags full of that fuck you cash
Get off the jet with me in heels
I'll cup your ass
Looking in my eyes
Saying Nas you're one lucky bastard
Grip your clutch, you'll get finger fucked in the passenger
I hit the dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter
See us in the coupe flying past you
Esco, dress code, it changes
Harrod's in England
Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging
Counting wonder in the tundra
Can't humble the disgruntled when I come through, confront ya
Let nothing slide, sly remarks
You must wanna die but you frontin', why?
When we all know you pumpkin pie
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates
To Dubai, to the Chi
I'm a crucial conflict
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out
You are what a thug about
I'm a fuckin' juggernaut
Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up
Who don't speak, she quiet
So I can think, conspire
On my feet's a ?, and sometimes sneakers
Wear ties at the Setai Miami
Time-pieces are from Zurich
It's like I'm allergic
To Nonoxynol 9
Give it to you raw so you can feel it
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
I had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
Y'all can keep y'all weak beats, from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggaz Against Society
Noisy I aim not silently, noose all surroundin me
I hang 'em I string 'em up ain't no thing I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped and you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit it's hard to see R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
Cause, I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him but he's blinded I see
Jealousy he love me to death am I buggin I love him for life
We both still mournin on our mother's, life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas, diary, get out my path
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary woulda had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
I had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
I had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I can't keep a bitch cause none of them come up for a little less
I can't be too rich, too many hoes, lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggaz in houses with pretty maids
Water and flowers in 'em while my niggaz walk around in they trousers grinnin
Gotta keep a lot of heat;
30 cals 10 millimeters 40 cals plus the heckler,
To set y'all straight You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the tec about
Huh? I'm stressin out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks, who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast, give coats to the po'
And give hope to the broke that live low
But that ain't reality, I look happy but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women 2 out of 3
Will love you but lead you to they own, hidden evil
BITCH! You the reason niggaz be beefin, hoe get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on, it's a new day Million dollars ain't,
What it was yesterday - many problems, many niggaz,
Most involved but they fake hope y'all relate
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary woulda had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
I had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
I had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
Super Cat
Yeah... yeah
Smoking a escubano, guzzle my second bottle
Grossing our net
Simultaneous making me climb higher heinous crimes behind me
Search but can't find me
Fuck sadness
Had this been you havin' this lavish
Habitual happiness at me you wouldn't look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next
I'll hit you with two techs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli no shirt on convertible Mazy
My Columbiana mommy ridin' beside me
Every tat mean something, that's my word on my body
I'll have to lean something wit that Mossberg shotty
Just for all the days y'all was mad I was getting it
In 97 the six
98 the Bentley
Now it's the Ghost Phantom
And y'all can't stand 'em but...
Army Jacket swag Army jacket green and black
Wit the square top pocket that snaps
Where the gas at?
Pass that, not you
You hold crack where your ass at
I never did that, my sock where my stash was at
Yo I use to listen to that red alert and rap attack
I fell in love with the poetry I mastered that
Cuttin' school with Preme team at phat cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet Baccarat
Now I'm the one that's reppin Queens way beyond your wildest dreams
Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
20 years in this game lookin' 17
I just blow green pick which a bitch can bless the king
Although he's on to another chapter
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to
Blaaaah...
Yeah yeah...
New York is like an Island a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wildin, all I hear is sirens
It's all about surviving same old two step
Tryna stay alive when
They be out robbin, I been out rhyming
Since born knowledge like prophet Muhammad
Say the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr
So I'mma
Keep it on till I see billion dollar
Keep your friends close and ya enemies closer
Love model chocha mommy pop it like she suppose to
Eyes red shot like I'm never sober
Big time smoker Indonesian doja
Minis you can hold up before you get all wet up from my soldiers
Don shit
Under fire I remain on some calm shit
This for every ghetto and the hood
Nas the Don and Supercat the Don Dotta
Understood...
Niggaz better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggaz that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters
Follow, I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the player haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize, bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play wit me, I'm modest till them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances, I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggaz, 'cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance
Niggaz better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggaz that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters
I do what I can do when I can do it
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin'
Live how I live, it's only 'cause I been through it
Learn to try it like to eat it and shit, it's nuttin to it
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while drivin' outside
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin, evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for givin' himself to the lord
Wonder, does Faith think about Big anymore?
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin'
We ain't these little niggaz no more, runnin' dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be havin' they legs shakin', stab 'em, break 'em
I'm Hercules, Hercules when havin' relations, the flyest
Niggaz better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggaz that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters
Niggaz better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggaz that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters
Niggaz better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggaz that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters
The G-O-D
Aiyyo, check it out... It's God's Son
I know I always give you clowns a little lean to come out
'Cause I drop every two years... but it's over now, you know? Hah
The G-O-D S-O-N
K-I-N-G O-F N-Y-C
Is it because I got the city on smash now
Oh woe woe
Or is it because your time's up and it's a wrap now
Hey hey hey hey
In the papers you read that Nas is crazy
Lost his mind as he leavin' Sony
The INC got him signed
It's only a figment of your imagination
Went to way with New York's Hot radio station
Lost my patience, had to zone out
Rappers blown out, I have the throne now
The real shall reign, I feel your pain
You R&B, follow me, spell my name
God's Son across the belly
Pardon, I'm hardly a bully
But what y'all done to hip hop is scary
Nas'll be truly the, last soldier to roll with
Holdin' it down, my proteges are over with now
A producer like Swizz Beats, on fire
So is the control room, soon as my vocals are down
Nas - God's Son, and y'all my little children
So bounce with it, if you can pronounce the correct spellin
And you're sitting at home doing this shit
Chill chill, that's the shit God, chill
Let's count this money, nigga
Ayo Nas, put the Jacksons and the Grants over there
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause we spendin' the Jacksons
True, true
For a nigga yo, word to mother
All them crab-ass rappers
Be comin' up to me, man word to mother man
True indeed, know what I'm sayin', but when it's real you doin' this
Even without a record contract, know what I'm sayin'?
Been doin' this since back then
No doubt, we gon keep it real, true, true
Who got the Phillies, take this Hennessy
C'mon, c'mon, man stop wavin' that man
Nigga alright but take this Hennessey man
Light them Phillies up man, niggas stop fuckin' burnin' Phillies man
Light some Phillies up then
I'm saying though man
I'm saying man, ya know what I'm saying
Niggas don't listen man, representin' it's Illmatic
I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch
A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggaz in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress
I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do
My taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god
'Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath
Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem
Body from Ketoi Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms
Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words form a pimp was, Nas, it just don't exist
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug cb4 gutso
Your luck low, I didn't know till I was drunk though
You freak niggaz played out, get fucked then ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out Montana way
The Goodf-e-l-l-a verbal AK spray
Dipped attaché jumped out the range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes 32 shotguns
Regulate with my dunns 17 rocks gleam
From one ring, yo let me let y'all niggaz know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of living, Vegas style roll dice in linen
Antera's spinning on millenniums
20G bets I'm winning them, threats I'm sending them
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of demi-sec to chase the henny
Wet any clique with the semi-tech who want it
Diamonds I flaunt them, chicken heads flock I lace them
Fried broiled with basil taste them
Crack your legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have them fucking me in the Benz wagon
Can it be vanity from last dragon
Grab gun it's on though, shit is grimy, real niggaz buck in broad daylight
With the broke mac it won't spray right
Don't give a fuck what they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo overnight thugs, bug because they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit
I peeped you fronting, I was in the jeep sunk in
The seat, tinted with heat beats bumping
Across the street you was wilding
Talking bout how you ran the island in '89, laying up playing the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga gave me mine, click
What was he thinking on my corner when it pay me time
Dug 'em you owe me cousin something told me plug them
So dumb felt my leg burn then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit before the cops come
Then they came asking me my name, what the fuck
I got stitched up and went through the left hospital that same night
What I got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had to drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watching all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through blazing out his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely hear me
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours be lighting L's sipping Coors
On all floors in project halls
Contemplating war with niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together Uptown copping the raw
But a, a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up
Yo to them thug niggas getting it on in the world ya know
To them thug niggas that locked down doing their thing
Surviving know what I'm saying?
To my thorough niggas New York and world wide
Yo to the Queens Bridge militia 9-6 shit the firm clique
The 'Illmatic' nigga 'It Was Written' though
Been a long time coming
Y'all fake niggas trying to copy
Better come with the reload!
Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves
Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water
My skin layered in diamonds and sage
Left alone and confused, forces enslaved by days
Time keeps on whorin us
Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us
Flowers and flames, flutes from her fingers
Rifles pointed from her sac
Or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones
Either way, she wore a compass on her head
Rains don't stop the grass from turnin' red
Her hair was half perm, half dread
We gave up walking in a past-life and so we dance
Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life
A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice
Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run
Time travelling was late
Watching was a blind man's mistake
All his assets melted right in front of his face
His right leg drabbed with demon paste
Shoes stayed angel laced
Never count your blessings with haste
Even a prophet can catch a case
Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste
Telepathically cutting through mental gates
Words were weapons against their hate
Shepherds search for stars in her hair
Her chest grew fermented like yeast
She broke her body like aged bread
He gave her truth from all the books he'd read
She wrote her poems inside the mud
Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
Named their boys and spit truth inside his mouth
Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
Resurrected from bones and dirt
She made hard niggaz smile
Left her seeds inside the Earth
Gave hustlers and killers life's worth
This is the life we chose, remember who was here first
Find a reason why you curse
Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose
Sporting electronic nooses
Hoeing humanity love-ticks over lust
Despite the damage to destiny you can't take the best of me
In God We Still Trust
What's happenin' brothers and sisters?
Welcome to our time
Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles
Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write
In spite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight
Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right
We the assassins laughin' while the New World's collapsin
Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armored carways I'm blastin
As the Earth rebels now womb swells
The birth of Black Magic, savin' my people force of habit
You can't find if you ain't never had it
Spiritually crafted blackness and hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted
Power-shiftin comb-fistin I predict Goddesses you runnin' after witches
I kiss my fourteen stitches
Keep all my baby girl wishes
I predict all the oceans turn dry
Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert
We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers
Wash your face between our legs
While recreating humanity, we will summon yem and yaw
Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills
Ban all pink and yellow pills
I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch
Hate groups will be bombed
Childbirth becomes outlawed
Always will be branded numbered and barred
All paper money is gone
Though few scholars can interpret our scrolls
Your sky has holes
We know the young is old
Nastradamus tell us how the story gets told
Check the shit
Nine-six
Escobar 600
Check the shit
My mindset, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggaz actin' illy word to Will he bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt wit it
Them niggas sour, they put to much flour in they coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE
While we was gleaming, niggaz was scheaming
Seen the ill Beamers beaming
Triple-beam and doubling cream, had 'em fiending
To get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
Sosa, these niggaz hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the 'Bridge I'm bout to go loca
Left my 'rat begging me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
Wit two macs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn' to bend me over
My nigga Hav got a soldier
I heard he might not live, I'm holding back tears
Told these broads, to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile digging they style yo
Whattup son, these niggas done started something wild
You know the clique well, Ramel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name holding the steel, I paid attention to the females
Maintain bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel, spray shots and reload
And still handle the wheel, point 'em out smoke a Phil' then chill
I laid back Escobar status, knowing The Firm got it cornered
We on it, shit we was born wit
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business and trifeness
I finesse this, for R.D., we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit
Dangerous sons, step back let the Tec lift
Lift you up, bless you wit a shorty then we set you up
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business and trifeness
We finesse this, for R.D., we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit
Dangerous sons, step back let the Tec lift
Lift you up, bless you wit a shorty then we set you up
Hold it right there pull over, that nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told ya
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rocking boulders
He's stunting, after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, BUT I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
He never seen us, Sos' gave the mac to Venus
And Vicious, looking delicious, handle yo' bidness
And step to him, shake yo' ass try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco, with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco, of all ages, they was amused
By the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York
If they had to, heard him ask Venus, Could I have you?
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him, Don't grab Boo
They started chatting, was only 'bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughing
We followed them pollying, he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably wanted to hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches moving too slow
We both holding, what if them wild hoes started folding?
Sosa, said say no more, we started rolling
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wilding
There the girls go, hurry up we out in
The 940, me Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy
Q.B.C.
QueensBridge motherfucker
Roping niggas up
Cause our click is thick
Another day another dollar
More money, more murder
Fuck this shit, Q.B. up in the house
It's yours
Whose world is this?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
It's yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi till I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic, I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facing
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruising in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me falling asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Whose world is this?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?

It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
It's yours
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' their sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
How you living, large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?
It's yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine

It's yours
It's yours
It's yours
It's yours
I'm the young city bandit hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, one thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
'Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burning dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today
It's yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?

Break it down
To everybody in Queens, the foundation

To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours

To everybody in Brooklyn, y'all know the world is yours

Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours

The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin time like
'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Air the Nikes on my feet, keep my cypher, complete
Whether crusin in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
The world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours

To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
My insight enlights vision
Words of wisdom
Niggaz pay me a tuition to listen
The murder paragraphs of mysticism
Man plant seeds that brings forth multiple breeds so many cultures on one
Planet but one culture's free.
Son, I need Weed to proceed
Change the flow speed and I'm getting vex Giuliani you 6-6-6.
There's no days for broke days selling smoke pays
I toke the chocolate potent philles never roach-sprayed.
Shit is a hassle, the bridge is like a haunted castle
The mic my religion and the system is the Devil's lasso
And yo, the trife life is the most influential
The colors on mink skins and pens is coincidental
How ya living large you broke,
You're wasting time extortin papers from smokers
Catching court papers getting broker
The world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours
Whose world is this?
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded

Headed for Indiana stabbin bitches like the Phantom

Check the gold toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burnin dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin' Danes plus the games
People play, I check the games plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today

Yeah you, y'all know who y'all are. These are our
Heroes.
Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB
Who 'Yes Massa' on TV, what ever happened to Wheezy? The Red Fox's?
Never got Emmy's but were real to me
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels
'Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel
Whitey always tell him, Ooh, he speak so well
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?
The acceptable Negro -- hell nah
But they say, These are our heroes
Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud
But there's somethin' they don't say
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe
First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you
You turn around then you shit on Shaq
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof
But you let them use you as an example
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full
You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through
But what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black
But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque
You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked
These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks
Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout
Tavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson
Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them
Nicky Giovanni poetical black female
Jim Brown to the people who sing well from
Fela to Miriam Makeba
The mirror says you are the next American leader
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records
'Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC
But next year, who knows what we'll see?
Ha-Ha, these are our heroes
The crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard
Big up to Tiger Woods. Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up
To Cuba Gooding Jr. Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs
What up my nigga. Yeah, ha-ha. And you don't quit
And ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit.
Homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at
All that paper. Drivin' around like a playboy in
My hood. What type of shit is that?
Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here. I know, I
Got a plane to catch. And I love you back. Ha-Ha
Yeah yeah -- And I'm outta here. A-ha-ha -- PEACE.

Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggaz
Little kids scared cops, wit red dots
Philosophical gangsta, where violent priors
Goin' back like black and white TV's wit pliers
Leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires
Flash iron, or anybody tryin' on the blocks I'm supplyin on
Mighty call, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em and the penal got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Mortar, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writin, semi-automatic no hyphen
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right

Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
I take summers off, 'cause I love winter beef
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheet
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Rule which car heart, gun powder stains
Smellin like trees, set some mill on the brain
Skeemin on ya girls, bamboozled on ya chain
Got ill up on the train, twistin off a cap
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks
Death crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises
Cause you bought a drummer sooked, from one of my boys, it's
... Just another day in the hood
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them piled in, we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin'
And I had to make a song, speakin' on my old life
For the thief's who come out at night

Queensbridge to London

Yo, Yo
This is the Thief's Theme
For the underground criminal street teams
Street dream chasing young hungry thugs that seek cream
Crack fiends and hatch schemes, knife-point robbery
Broad day blindeys, night-time thuggery
Sun down shinanigins, move without shadow...
...Like ninjas, cat burglars, no fiasco
No commotion, make moves like locomotion
Crack-sport ambush, get the man bringing the coke in
Warehouse crime rate, man's throw they vans up
Bang job, Freeze, everybody put your hands up
Cash is nightmare, gun in ya faceplate
It's not even ya money, don't make me put one in ya face, mate
Thieves running this place, world trade, eight fare
Slave rift flashbacks; Bush killer, hate Blair!
Wish Mars was a mile away, 'cause I would escape there
On a Skyway railroad, to stick you from my tray fair, bitch...
Yeah, you know like when you kill somebody in Street Fighter

Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggaz
Little kids scared cops, wit red dots
Philosophical gangsta, wit violent priors
Goin' back like black and white TV's wit pliers
Leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires
Flash iron, anybody tryin' on, the blocks I'm supplyin on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Malts
Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writin, semi-automatic no hyphen
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
I take summers off, 'cause I love winter beef
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains
Smellin like trees, sensimille on the brain
Skeemin on ya girls, bambooze or ya chain
Got ill up on the train, twistin off a cap
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises
'Cause she bought a jum of soap, from one of my boys, it's
... Just another day in the hood
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile then, we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin'
And I had to make a song, speakin' on my old life
For the thief's who come out at night
One, two
One, two
Check, one, two
I want you to close ur eyes, n' invision
The most beautiful place in tha world,
If you in the hood, the ghetto street corner,
Come on this journey, the best journey, it's a mansion
Acres of land, swimmin pools and all that, check it out
I'm capable of anything, my imagination could give me wings,
To fly like doves over the streets watchin' many things,
Kids walkin' home from school, on drug blocks, missionaries
Pass out papers that read love god.
I see faces cases, judges 'n' jurors, masons lawyers 'n' cops,
I watch 'cause every thugs face is my mirror,
But this was one imparticular,
This kid he was the vintage stick 'em up pro,
16 years old did his jail since there was no where to go.
Every mornin' calls his commrad to come 'n' get em' a smoke,
He insane already gone mad, blames himself for his setbacks,
Dangerous street corners where his sets at,
Sling from dusk till dawn, detectives act like they maniacs,
Chasin him, his ass was flarin,
Smokin' like a chimney on remy of course he not carin,
He needs a place to go to keep his mind expandin,
I give 'em a helpin hand, bring 'em out to Thugz Mansion.
Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy,
Lil hennesey, lay back and cool, every hour 'cause it's all good.
Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done
Will be all right, nothin' but peace, love 'n' street passion,
Every ghetto needs a Thugs Mansion
Dear mama don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the hommies I'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
It had me shook drinking
Peppermint schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cook
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin it with Malcolm till the day game
Lil' Latasha sure grown, tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
So come home
Maybe in time you'll understand, only God can save us
Where Miles Davis cutting lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
They in heaven found peace that last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place
In Thugz Mansion.
A place where death doesn't reside, jus' thugz who collide
Not to start beef but to spark trees, no cops rollin' by,
No policemen, no homicide, No chalk on the streets,
No reason for no body's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis grey hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw to much sufferin
I'm just 20 some odd years I done lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Anne Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone, she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
Where angels soar, with golden rings, in Thugz Mansion.
Yo, my man was regulatin on niggas he used to thug with
Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars
BM, Jaguars, they cash was large
Since he was wild, they let him in
He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin
Drivin' they cars, robbin connects
Drivin' his Lex, keys was movin
Young don, now they know they weakness
They never seen it comin'
Son was on some real take over the streets hit
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?
Dudes be, comin' from bids thinkin' shit is different
Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin my years, jet black, blunt in my ear
Real relaxed, readin real loves stories like
Ceaser and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin to later hours, only
Fuckin' with kings, niggas official
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you
We converse on the state of hip hop
We share the same views and feelings
He sling cain, crib costin 2 million
He plan to leave the streets forever
But niggas that wanted him left him
Dead in the streets 'fore I can tell him
Tribal war
We nuh want no more a dat
Every man deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn, now
Tribal war
A nuh dat we a defend
Every man deserve a turn
Like a flame deserve to burn
Tribal war
We nuh want no more a dat
Each and every one deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn
Tribal war
A nuh dat we a defend
Cause every man deserve a turn
Like Babylon deserve to burn
Man what happened to us?
Geographically they moved us
From Africa
We was once happiness pursuers
Now we back stabbing, combative and abusive
The African and Arab go at it they most Muslim
Used to be moving in unison
Disputes would end
Bounty Hunters and Grape Street get cool again
Some standard housing
Got the young running rampant
Wilding, for a Phantom
He can style in
Mask on his face
Grabbing his Luger
Saying, nobody move or I'll shoot ya
Man you're expiring
Catch 25 and he does it like a man
He sides with Black
White Pride and Mexican
Survive the best he can
Strap a shank to his thigh
Why do we all collide?
Why do the young die?
Extortion, murder and burglary
Tattoos his chest
Says his Enemies Don't Deserve To Breath
Tribal war
We nuh want no more a dat
Everyone deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn, Lord
Tribal war
A nuh dat we a defend
Each and every man deserve a turn

Every man deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn, now
Tribal war
A nuh dat we a defend
Cause every man deserve a turn
Like Babylon deserve to burn
I drink poison
Then I vomit diamonds
I gave you Mandela, Black Dalai Lamas
I gave you music
You enthused in my kindness
So how dare you reduce me to Donny Imus
Timeless in case we never been acquainted
Flyness who made it
It gets duplicated
Mindless violence
Well let me try to paint it
Here's the 5 steps
In hopes to explain it
One!
It's me and my Nation against the World
Two!
Then me and my Clan against the Nation
Three!
Then me and my Fam' against the Clan
Four!
Then me and my brother we no hesitation
Uh!
Go against the Fam' until they cave in
Five!
Now who's left in this deadly equation?
That's right, it's me against my brother
Then we point a Kalashnikov
And kill one another
Tribal war
We nuh want no more a dat
Everyone deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn
Tribal war
A nuh dat we a defend
Every man deserve a turn
Like a flame deserve to burn
Tribal war
We nuh want no more a dat
Every man deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn
Tribal war
A nuh dat we a defend
Cause every man deserve a turn
Like Babylon deserve to burn
Man a war Tribal
Over Colors
Over Money, over land, and over oil, and over God
And over Idols, and even lovers
Over breakfast, over dinner, over suppers
Over Jungle, over Rema, over Buckers
Over Brooklyn, over Queens, and over Rutgers
Over Red, and over Blue, and over Chuckers
Over Red and over Blue and Under-covers
Tribal trouble
The drive by s double
Cause the youth dem nah go war
And go fight with knuckle
The two sides scuffle
Vietnam nah go a war
With no more Kung Fu Nun chuckle
Missile and shuttle
Huh
And the Queen of England and Uncle Sam
Dem a flex dem muscle
The Tribal Hustle
Blood Diamond Poodle
Survival Struggle
Tribal war
We nuh want no more a dat
Everyone deserve to earn
Every child deserve to learn
Tribal war
A nuh dat we a defend
Each and every man deserve a turn
Like a flame deserve to burn

Every man deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn
Tribal war
A nuh dat we a defend
Cause every man deserve a turn
Like Babylon deserve to burn
It's like a cold story repeated over and over
In the winters of my mind
This shit be real man
Shit's crazy out here
Yo yo, yo what up y'all
That's my niggas over there
Word
If you scared to take chances
You'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gonna cock it and pop it
His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him
Slanging just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumping, fronting
'Cause he feel a way
My niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga looking
Laying with the milli
Who that over there, creeping
Who homie by the tree
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell fore they creep on me
It's a lesson every premonition
Lotta niggas killed 'cause they wasn't paying attention
Listen
I want a bitch I can trust
Some niggas I can trust
Accountants looking over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fighting for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga trust
I can never get enough
A Ruger I can trust
Shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for
Some of you niggas' true colors becoming clear more
It's been so long
Can't remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm
Cause guns went off
I see your mom's she still speak
She don't know I ain't cool with her son no more
It's old shit, see forever we holding this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef
End it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years
Why should I worry 'bout him
Constantly watching my back
Plus niggas telling I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right
Cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt
It's quite redundant
Whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mother's cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas' names
I wonder will it change
Let's ride
It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down little man
Let me school you in hood business
Seen a lotta niggas blow
Lotta dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy
Bought it I'm loaded I guess
Lear jets
I ask myself do I need love or success
They say the artist that truly suffers
His stuff is the best
Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve
Pain pistols and sex
Remember spray painting the word Fresh and then staring at it
Older folks angry, pointing, swearing at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the Mclaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric
Trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it
Real conversation for that ass
Nastradumas, astrologic, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, got the chips to a lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now its loads of baguettes, prefer a mack-10 over a tech
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldiers, cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase Nigga light that
Hoes you fuck, ask you where your ice at, dun
It's all about playboys, when we was young
Can only get tongue, then finally we can cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake pepsi's to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme Don it
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If its ice work, I'm gonna truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it
Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Get pulsive with malice insentitives, the foulest of bitches
Hung up my riches, her childest wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip in a new fo'
So when your click roll, I let my clips go, Niggas on opposite polls
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhuman, living hostile opposed
To living on the streets, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, frantically foul niggas
See niggas in blast, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you and chill, chrome objects
Hit you in your projects, its street anomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger painting
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting
While you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment
Now back in the hood, certain cats they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it, you gotta love it
Destiny Jones. To my niece and nephews, Suree, Malik, Jabari.
Thank God. And I wanna thank everybody for helping me out
With this. Couldn't do it without you. Chapter 1.
January 28, 1968
Born into this world as William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyndanch Long Island
Scientific rhymin' invented a new sound when he met with
Eric Barrier from East Sandhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene, 1986 with Clap To This
'87 dropped a classic disc
The facts is the tracklist was like four
The vocals, the beats -- according to Marly Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative
This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
'Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock
Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearin' Curtis Blow saying
It can't get better than this
Till Run DMC blew my brains to bits
From leather coats to shell toes to the stan smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap, 18th Letter did that
From 41st and Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre
Supreme rapped and the 50 that don't rap
Forte Green, Queens, Long Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn
With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote Smack me and I smack you back
Sounded like the answer to the I Ain't No Joke track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzin' from Wyndanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot by sixteen when I met Freddy Foxx
Totin' burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How was Rakim's flow, made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one, before similar voices were King Son
A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, son was watchin' him, mesmorized
Respect, not jockin' him, was so amazin', besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now
A jazz singer. Nephew to R & B legend Ruth Brown
The Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique. That's
The end of the group. Went off to solo. Dropped the R, then the 18th Letter, and I think, somethin', The
Master. Was signed to Aftermath, scheduled to release
An album with my guy Dr. Dre. The album was
Dismantled because of creative differences. Thee end
To the new beginning. Yeah. Next book, KRS-One. Peace.
Uh...
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin cigars, couples and stars
Flashin cameras, dealers, shufflin cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the four-five
Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin, duckin, our bitches in the club cluckin
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beamin
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs peace, kept in movin, I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceilin fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower...
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughin'
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin with some nigga
Mumblin shit, he had one hand on her ass
And she was rubbin his dick, toastin wine glasses
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
Searchin for some words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin, whylin, what I'm gon do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through
{Nas singing}
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?
I said, Nah, showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' -- and probably still is
Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin' my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had junk
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out we out like kamikazes
We surrounded, red lights flashin, who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin suicide
Horse asked me for the Mac, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger cocked the glock, and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said Amen
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, Now unto God, we elope
... We elope ...
They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan
They were trying to touch on and thieve envy within the leadership
But as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline
His presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life
Louis Farrakhan
No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told
Your left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
I heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name
I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came
'Cause I stood in the face of damnation
Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em
He want my blood, why me?
Why not the fake ones who deserve death man?
Fuck it, I'll take one
'Cause stop me but can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
They believe in reparation makes it even
So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
We getting it in son, another bullet pass by, miss me
Wondering who plotting to get me?
Alphabet boys still plotting against me
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
You won't remember why they came to clip me
When time go by you'll soon forget me
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentleys
Then I use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty
Don't let' 'em kill me...
They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan.
They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan.
They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan.
They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan.
Some revolutionaries do live long
Am I one of them? Guess we'll know in due time
Everybody has rights, can I use mine?
Can I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine?
Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine?
Every time I turn around somebody new dying
Let's start living, alecart, Escargo, Escobar invest my millions
Mansion for the wife the rest for the children
Knowing that they coming anytime
But until then I'ma at large till they shoot me
Million dollar stones in my camouflage Gucci
Giving you this crack like Pookie
To question the system, be the resistance
No matter what color you are everybody niggas
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us
Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me

When I stepped up in the club even my arms was shinin
Bling! A little cute thing said, What's yo' name?
I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain
Ooh ooh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up
BLAOW! Ludacris in the ho-ooh-ouse
The needle hit the record, they was playin' this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was EH EH ON
Live forever like Fame, let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back chillin' in my b-boy stance
Could be a little pop lockin if your girl's top droppin'
But watch for cockblockin on my coochie stock options
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip swap Nasty N-A-S pass that
Honey in the black 'cause I'm feelin' her curves
He looked down at what I had and said WA WA WORD
Why only serve one when we can serve up two

They got my voice for the record and my voice for the beat
Virgo proof baby run the streets
And if you don't know, now you know - Doug E. Fresh
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' all right
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be all right
Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth is holdin' those
Briefcases, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', got no,
My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smokin' that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creepin' in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her
And I'm late to a dite with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walkin' through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire pride stop
There's a war in the streets tonight
And all this drama's got me feelin' uptight
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo
'Cause she's standin' on the corner of Linden Boulevard
Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight
Yeah, Nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's cryin'
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashin'
New come, I caught verbal assassin runnin' with
Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight
But we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib
Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment
Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, never disrespect me
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers,
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world,
Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy
I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' all right
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be all right
Uh, If I can teach somethin' so be it
And give it back
They can't break me or shake me
They too fake to come kill me
Think they faith this was Satan
They mistake me I'm filthy
Rich off the ghetto madness, so now they wanna dare me
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty
Middle Passage I made it
I'm from the land of David
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
That bunch of backward gangsters
That sign of Alpha Davis
Snitches with smile-like faces got you blowin' trial I hear this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind o' waitin' is scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I see clear to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart
I'm still alive how did I make it this far
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way
This is the song, of my warriors, A warrior song, my lord
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of our own beatin' drum
Like King Nasir fightin' the British regime
I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost and they broke
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have kid
I'm askin, what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still
I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to embody somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold
This is the song, of my warriors, A warrior song, my lord
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of our own beatin' drum
Fight till the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way
This is the song, of my warriors, A warrior song, my lord
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of our own beatin' drum
To my warriors
To all these, baby
KrucialKeys! Braveheart y'all
This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, y'know keep marchin'
Yeah yeah yeah, you never give up
To all my warriors ha ha
Braveheart, Braveheart
Definition of a warrior
They never realized, how real Nas, is so decisive
It's just the likeness, of Israelites mist, that made me write this
A slight twist, of lime rhyme, be chasing down your prime time
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan, features the freak shit, my thesis
On how we creep quick, fucking your wife that ain't so secret
It's mandatory - see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggaz never handle for me
My gator brand is Maurry, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face, hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really it's papers I'm addicted to, wasn't for rap then I'll be sticking you
The mag inside the triple goose
Face down on the floors, the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam, just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that - that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to Mona Lisa brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing ninety on the Franklin-D-Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one son, niggaz is frightened
Secret indictments, adds on to one seeking enlightenment
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo
My Fuck Tomorrow motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar the desperado - word to 'Cause D'Amato
Got to watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow
Three ki's, new V's, went to Anguilla with your hoe
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat, getting the dough
Them old timers, advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening just bobbing your head
Your Roley shining, thinking to yourself nobody's taking mine
At the same time, your hoe is getting snatched from behind
Put in the van, where's the hundred grand, script in her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know -
- You knew these niggaz all your life
What made them mark you victim, you fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen sick of yapping
Dump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffin ganja get to your crib, can't find her
Just a reminder shit and have your stash house where you crash out
Could of passed out, your coke was gone, now you assed out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Still somehow I believe, we always survive... but why?
To my dogs... wherever you are
Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid
Ain't nuttin changed -- still Party and Bullshit
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
Machine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But fuck it black, you livin' your life, though your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin' records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggaz is wrong -- usin' your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there; I feel some
But doubt they're, capable, to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake
'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin
Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die
You was like God to us in the form of Allah
Still somehow I believe, we always survive... but why?
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Thug Life never die...
Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop -- and use teeth
To bite off beer tops, and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor
You was more than just the wildest nigga
It's goin' on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin' on
The industry be talkin', offendin me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride, before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could Never Be Peace I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on the realest shit you ever wrote
We had words cause the best supposed to clash at the top
But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
In NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggaz would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?
Still somehow I believe, we always survive... but why?
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs -- put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
A plan and pursue my dream turn my life around
'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi riding through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said Baby bless
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's, and finally it's lookin' good
Hip-hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game, could lose or gain
A couple pounds tryin' to maintain -- one day you here
The next you not; when you around niggaz, check 'em out
Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots
And run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than fifty percent of us
Endin up with holes through the chest
Through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothing left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way outta this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin crack
To my deceased Gods wishin I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that
... Always survive... but why?
Always survive, always
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my niggaz just stay alive
There was life there was water
We depend on mama nature
There is a message for tomorrow
Everything connect's to you
Some says soon there will be over
You can see it in the weather
Out of tune with mama nature
What you do comes back to you
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Confucius, Confucius
Sigmund Freud
And Fard Muhammad
Is it evolution or God?
Searching for the truth is a threat
Seems the closer we get to the truth
State troopers or FEDs come out to silence you
My house in Malibu probably tapped
Cause living next door to Demi Moore
Plus, I'm black
Plus, I want vengeance for the poor
Who's attacked daily
Patriot Act never scared me
Jake in the Taurus
Sticky in the jar-s
Niggas I'm with got warrants
America's brown and
Twenty years from now
Every town will be brown and Latin
Or African, look at Manhattan
I'ma tell you what I seen with my three eyes
Word to me, not a hoax, back in 9-9
A spacecraft in the skyline
In L.A., in daytime, ask Horse if I'm lying
Every mother every father
Raise your sons and your daughters
With respect and with honor
From the seed comes a fruit
It's an unbroken circle
All of life is universal
And we are all in the struggle
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Evidence remains in debate
Documents of our own Air Force base
Additional terrestrial information
Other planets with life population
My observation
Scientists study pictures of a flying disc
Right on earth, anthropologists are finding shit
Visitors, probably live with us
They can mimic us
It's sort of what we seeing in the cinemas
Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
Its good to be alive
Its good to be alive
Nobody is an island
We are part of an environment
Only way we gonna survive is if we harmonize
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Reginald Lewis
The black billionaire
Before Oprah or Bob Johnson
How'd he disappear?
Conspiracy theories, UFO's in the air
I've seen it with my own two eyes
And I swear, like Warren Buffet
Real money I'm just trying to touch it
The diamond-encrusted shit, live illustrious
'Cause we was deprived of it, suffered
Now we pop to prove anything's possible
My pimp strut was invented when they whipped us
Now we diddy-bop just to show you that our strength's up
Just when niggas about to see they cut
Global warming about to burn us up
Niggas never really seen paper in this world
American blacks the teenager of this world
Give us twenty more years to grow up
Already geniuses; what I mean is this
I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer
Till I read the words of Ivan van Sertima
He inserted something in me
That made me feel worthier
Now I spit revolution
I'm his hood interpreter
Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
Its good to be alive
Its good to be alive
Were not alone yeah yeah
Were not alone were not alone
Were not alone yeah yeah
Were not alone
Yeah yeah not alone
Ayo I'm American born. Love America
Love my people Love all man kind
All nationalities you know. I think it just been recent,
Where everybody just started to feel like their
Was an elite group that runs everything, and
Everybody else was sheep ignorant making all
Ethnicities colors and creeds niggers blind to what
Really is going on so I say take off the wool from your
Eyes out with the Old America in with the New end all
Racism all injustice all oppression to poor people any
People anywhere in this planet lets come together a
New day is rising.
Ayo its poison, ecstacy, coke
You say its love, it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescripting us medicine which is poison
Doctors injecting our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be getting shot giving poison
In hospitals, shots rittle the block
Little children and elderly women run for their lives
Drizzling rain come out the sky every time somebody dies,
Must be out my fucking mind, what is this, the hundreth time?
Sending flowers to funerals, reading rest in peace
You know the usual, death comes in threes
Life is short is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
Its funny how these black killer companies is making money off us
Fast food, cola sodas, skull and bone crossers
Sisters up in my hood trying to do good given choices
When pregnant drop out of school or have abortions
Stop working hoping that they find a man that will support them
Up late night on they mothers cordless, thinking a perm or
Bleaching cream will make better when they gorgeous
White girls tanning, lypo suction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips that's life destruction
Lightskin women, bi-racial hateful toward themselves
Denying even they blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods but I overstand the mental poison
That's even worser than drugs
Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison
And any thoughts of taking me down is poison
Who want beef now, my heat shell annoyed them, plaow
Never to worry, all the wrong doers got it coming back to em
A thousand times over
Every dog has its day and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to em
Everybody reaps what they sew that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse but we'll get through it
Y'all be strong
The China-men built the railroad
The Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed em
They call it it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday hellday
'Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches and party everyday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles connecting and we hitting the lad
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad
It's all poison, all of my words to enemies it is poison
Rappers only talk about ki's, it's all poison
How could you call yourself emcees you ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of taking me down is all poison
Who want beef now, my heat shell annoyed them, plaow
What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga
What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga
This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey
Light skin with herpees
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C.
This is the problem 'cause he never tell 'em he got it
From letting fags suck him off Rikers Island in nine-three
Drives in Benz, hangs in all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rocking their shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
What's your name, where you from, chain blinging
Thinking girls everywheres dumb, taking pride in ruining their lives
So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives
He never used a condom, give him head he got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDs
I contemplate, believing in karma
Those on top could just break and wont be eating tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleeping on niggas dreams
They leave when they nigga blow she the first bitch on her knees
Knowing dudes that's neglecting their seeds
Instead of taking care of 'em they spending money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies
'Cause when them kids get grown it's too late for you
Now you old and you getting shitted on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush killer till George Bush kills me
Much blessings be healthy, remember
Red head kingpin, Tim Dogg? Have you seen 'em?
Kwame, King T, or King Son
Superlover C, Cassanova Run
Antwoinette, Rob Base never showin' up

Ask Ill and Al Scratch Where my Homies?
Leave it to y'all, these niggas left for dead
Last week my man swore he saw Special Ed
Rap is like a ghost town, real mystic

Play they CD or wax and get lifted
I recommend when ya kid turn ten
Let him hear Spice 1, made plenty noise
Positive K, Father MC, The Skinny Boys
Where are they now?
Where are they now?
See I remember them forever
The original Spinderella

I slow dance with the Devil
Snow setting in the bezzle
Mo' sipping, phantom bumping Aaron Neville
Polo black scented, eyes squinted
Air Force One's, with my own patent in it
Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy
Pagan holidays, are way far from my reality
Far through Evisu jeans, lethal green
Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart.
Lotta blood gonna splash in war
Task force homicide, federalies gonna arrest
But y'all ain't never seen nothing
Not a word not a hint, on the kid from the Project Bench
That went Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate
Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent
To get the best man, y'all niggaz ain't silencing shit
Ya bench been wanna police the dick
The big Benz, Imma model ya chick
Was that posing, cash froze her
Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over
Cold like ice, more chains than slaves
Dangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel
Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble
I could sell sand to a Arab, hot and my gun handle
The ill whip pusher, my spit wet ya
If you stand close to the woofer
Betcha get sprayed by my lecture
Any club with ladies or dimes, I'm a regular
Give it up smooth, I ain't beggin ya
Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac
Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that
Eat with my elbows top of the table
Street etiquette with speech impediments
And still see presidents, no matter who paid
Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it
Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate
Ask about Nashwan, could ask about Jung
Ask about Bravehearts, and ask where I'm from
Q Boro, specifically The Bridge
Don't ask no more question, ya know what it is
Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financer, skull doo wrapped up
Mob life, prizefights, plasma tvs or first floor
Diversified all my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit to wet this
That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars
Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock And Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in, in my mommy casket
Seen more green than St. Patrick-trick
At times I window watch at the Wynn hotel
Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?
Mind of a shooter, CFO also
Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful
Money is attractive, honey dress strapless
Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah
'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours
You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star
These old heads got stories, the days they was kings
I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
You 16, you could do 20, come home young
Catch 20 years when you 40? Holmes, you're done
What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars
Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies
A 360 in the streets real grizzly
Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning
Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with
Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
This ain't the Truman Show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung? It's not love
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul
Roll that up
Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game
Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name
Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim
To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank
'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think
It's crazy how many brothers come where I come from
Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung
Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up
Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us
Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like
Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous
Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble
One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle
Now we having babies, cause growing up it was just us
No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up
But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual
Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral
I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you
Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to
The G is in your genes, already you tuck
Inherit your dad's swag, his George Jefferson's strut
Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet
Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise
No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor
I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist
Corona sipper, pass it, I'mma blow it with you
It ain't the Truman show; it's the human show
As the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
Young brother go and get your paper, I got love
Look here 'Sheed 
Pretty Mike shanked Two Face Al, over some gal 
Found the body dead in the isles 
Death by strangulation, microphone cord, a dirty broad 
Tell Shaniro play it again Sham, damn, that was my jam 
Now she's on the lam, she made it out wit' two hundred grand 
What a scam! While these two compete on who's the star of the show 
Golden Legs there makes off wit' the dough 
I read the paper there wit' Joe the Butcher 
He says one glance is all it took ya she's a real looker 
They say her old man's a bootlegger, transport in any weather 
And at this rate we'll never get her 
Fellas, think it's time I call it a night 
All this talk of mystery dames gettin' me tight 
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right 
Hate to spoil the party, what are you guys havin'? 
The same? Waiter, another round for the gang 
It's strange how I always felt out of place 
Joe the Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckleface 
So I said see ya later 
Before I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers 
He met them in Louisiana wrestlin' gators 
An idiot can tell they're involved in the caper 
So I pulled the revolver out my waist up 
Between a patrol car and a gray truck 
Behind the streetlamp was a silhouette 
White gloves and a real long cigarette 
Whaddaya know? All this time she's got me in the scope 
She spoke, says the devil got you guys by the choke 
Your conspiracy theories won't work wit'out evidence 
That's the reason why Eric B. is not President 
Well whaddaya say? 
Ya see... ya see... ya see... 
Look here 'Sheed, I Know You Got Soul, you tryna hide it 
How'd you kill a man out in Cypress? 
One-Eyed Charlie, he only hangs out wit' the Criminal Minded 
Says you guys did it Doggystyle, is he lyin'? 
She says Walk This Way I'll tell you a Children's Story 
We hit the bodega, got her a few forties 
We jumped in my ride, we drove and she cried 
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide 
Swalllowed It! Whole bottle's half empty 
Drinks like a fish, now she's past tipsy 
The truth came out as we got to her Suave House 
Chopped-N-Screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch 
I said it's gettin' late c'mon, give it to me straight 
Who's your sponsor, lady? She says Bill Gates 
What are you born, '77 or '78? 
She said nah goes way to an earlier date 
Slave times, played for slave said rhymes 
But she fell in love wit' some fella named Clive 
Who? Clive Campbell from Cedrick Ave 
The Bronx, now she shows me the cash 
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt 
She said Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc 
Ah-ha! Ah-ha! 
Listen up sweetheart, now we're gettin' somewhere 
As she's talkin', she starts vanishin' in thin air 
But before she drops the money bag on the flow & died 
She said if you really love me I'll come back alive
Lies and the pain
Betrayal; life
In danger's face
Look what you're facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn't ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me
Snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that
They know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat stretched out
Letter T
It's better to dead a beef than let it breathe
Then we don't succeed
'Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood
We can thug and get out of hand
What's the options
Only conclusion is shooting
Bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous
Asking myself what's my purpose
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops can't relate to me
Death to prison, empty vacancy
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
Guess how angry this man gets
Had so many bad chicks in his bed
Strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that are sadistic
Chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he's into bestiality porn
And it's wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high so they find dough
To mainline dope, and y'all know
So many vices, habits
Mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, that's cars, cigars
A vintage bottle on ice that's priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate 'cause he's newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application 'cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation
Calling up his travel agent
Same time, premedidating murdering his ex wife
Life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining
Just hold on
Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
We gotta strip the word down rugged and raw
The rhetoric of martin king just ain't around no more
Dave bowie ain't here James Baldwin neither
They all were leaders
But they ain't help me get this porcsh two seater
A lawyer left the hood he never looked back
To be a fortune 500 ceo it took rap
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies that's hiring blacks
Fresh hip hop lingo for your campaign ads
The controversy surrounds who could say it and win
Some niggas are full time some play and pretend
So fuck that no apologies on the issue
If it offends you
It's meant to
It's that simple
Tryin' to erase me from y'all memory
Speak my name and breath life in me
Cause y'all use my name so reckless
And I love it especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject
Cause y'all my niggas
Yo I was thinking a little bit what would it take
To authenticate my nigganess
Ball ridiculous
26 inches when I call up the dealership
Yeah that's some nigga shit
We only out for our own benefit
We haven too many kids
We? welfare recipients
The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit
It makes me think what the hell they clean they're syringes with
Everybody bleedin
The cops or the demons
Courtrooms full of goons
Jailbrushers leanin
Handcuffs squeezed too tight
On you?
If you fight they just give in
People used to do sit ins
They got Nigeria and Niger two different countries
Somehow niger turned to nigger
And shit got ugly
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists
To know the?
Started droppin' that consciousness
Tryin' to erase me from y'all memory
Speak my name and breath life in me
Cause y'all use my name so reckless
And I love it especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject
Cause y'all my niggas
My father was not a banker
Neither was my neighbor when it came to getting paper
Who the hell was gonna train us
A pressure couldn't escape us through the ages
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases
And I say it's quite amazing
The use the ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
It's celebrated now people are mad it they ain't one
Tryin' to erase me from y'all memory
Speak my name and breath life in me
Cause y'all use my name so reckless
And I love it especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject
Cause y'all my niggas
Yeah yeah yeah yeah y'all... New York City... Tryna to see
Where I'mma go tonight... The most famous town in the
Whole fuckin' world... The other night, nigga was at Lotus...
I hit P and them I was Dom P'ed up in there, you know... But I
Found this new spot we went to the other night, yo, check it out
Check it out how it went
It was just cool like, smooth night wit' my jewels bright
Goons left goons right, coupe wit' blue lights
Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls
Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off
In the loft mixin' hash and 'dro
Honey spread that asshole like a wide mouth bass
Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast
When the phone ring, the house lights flash
Turned down the sound, let's get down to bidness
Shit about to go down wit' some foul niggas
What the voice said, what up pop? Who want it?
I put the guap up, get the boy popped
He say son stop, it's dudes you feedin'
Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'
Dog, why you callin' me? This our food
You, handle the mouths that it trickles down to
Niggas want beef, I want some of that cow too
But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich
Don't bother me wit' silly shit, call Rico
He said it IS Rico, of all people
Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor
To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather
Said the nigga shot up my cars
Last night he laid for me to come out my doors?
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
You can't kill me
High, fly, send a fella loaf or glass?
Fold up cash, you ain't heard the soldier's half
You speakin' hogwash, silly shit, ??? to dash
I got the live sparked, Phillies lit, smoker's jacket on
The son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don
What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah
Packed the nines, yo this nigga's asinine
Smack ya mom, relaxed and calm, then mack ya mom
In a casket, you'll get ya fashion on
You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die
You'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' wit' Nas
Remember anyone can get it at anytime
Lames'll swear by ya name, when they lie
Get hit wit' the lone star, ripped where ya bones are
So tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-O-1?
In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser
Merk you wit'cha own shooters
All you want is a name, pissed and insane
My security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen
Then it goin' off, start spittin'
Niggas try to bring it where I live in
Trustin' you, knew where all of the cribs at
So we waited wit' the cigs blat, blat, blat!
From Willie Lynch to Willie Hutch, right on!
We Supafly, made Gucci the shit, Louis too, suits and ties,
Playa trophies, pray to goldie
Picture wax museums full of black pimps and triple O.G.'s
Aunt Jemima hoes, historic horseshit, girls from long time ago
Stagecoach with the horse kid
Witchdoctors, good ol' pickpockets, sip moonshine
So called coon, shines and darkies
I love y'all
Pyramids to cotton fields to Wrigley Fields
Forgotten men who did get kill
Crispus Attucks the first blasted
Peace to the rich lady purse snatcher shot in the back
I know you're hungry kid
I know they hung your dad, burnt your mama crib
I know that hurt ya bad
Minstrel shows from gold to shackles and back to gold
We act like we home, matter fact we are home
Bad attitudes, octoroon skin tones
Slave food turn to soul food, collards and neckbones
Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag
Bet she had a nigga with her to help her old ass
As James Baldwin says, you can only be destroyed by believing that you really are what the white world considers a nigger
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
Yo on Dateline the other night they showed hate crimes
Gave a blood time 'cause he fought with his K9
Beastiality, humane society
Go to China see how they dine, see what they eat
Better yet asks PETA whoever what animal makes suede
If not for suede would you survive the Dark Ages?
Cannibal ways of the anti-caucasians
Slay ya like a steak tartar on pinot noir
David star on the chain, Sammy Davis he helped pave the way for Southern crankers and them Harlem shakers
Now we gettin' our papers
They try to censor the words that stop our money comin' but you can't escape us, haters
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
Girls I got 'em locked so similar to a prison
Hear this monster jam, I be callin' it 'GANGSTERISM'
I murder you for dope, I'm the street distributor
I'm homicidal, pointin' the pump, scope to shoot you
Street connects, Mob ties on East and West
We gouge out your eye balls if you seen too much
Hopin' out drops wit blings and stuff
Wit ball players wives, Mercedes 5
Dangerous lives and haters die rollin' with convicts
Conscience who tolerate no nonsense
Fake rappers in doo-rags, get shot-up at their concert
Your bitch bleed, bitin' her nipples with my chipped tooth
I drink her blood, like I'm Dracula, mack in the 6-Coupe
The sky becomes red, heard y'all niggaz work with the feds
Doesn't matter, blood'll splatter, everybody must dead
I got urge for self-reinvention, but I'm old-fashioned
From the corner's with the winos laughin'
Dealers and five-o blastin'
Capitalist thoughts like Presidents
I'm burnin' Bush's, Nas the realest, it's nuttin' to fuck wit
What do you know about me?
About me
You'll never know
I smoke weed like them sixties rebellions, hippies on heroin
Spliffs inhalin', what I speak strictly for felons
Dippin' in their 6-4, hittin' the switches
Or sittin' in their Bentley Azure's, feelin' the riches
Or just ridin', truck drivin' Impalas, Denali's
I fuck with those but I lust for silver Ferrari's
I fuck hoes with the ceilings, have mirrors to watch me
My bed shaped like a pyramid, feelin' the dry heat
Spillin' Courvoisi', I'm half slave-master
Half Apache, half African, much is what I call us Black men
Lead astray, drugs and cups of alcohol, 'cause back when
They let us off ships; the soul of man was lost or trapped in
But every ghetto, every hood, no matter where the town
It's all haunted, all on top slave burial grounds
Dead cooks, workers and maids, under this Earth in rage
Ancient whore houses that explain my sexual ways
The world loves a gangsta, I found my place in this thing
Royce's, diamonds and bosses, woman who're gorgeous
Traitors, killers and enemies, remorseless, we live this
Gypsies, preachers, choirs, churches, liquor stores
The world is full of liars, curses, people rich or poor
Without God to worship, see we would be more lost
Gotta believe in somethin', or their would be no laws
A ghetto child occasionally blunted in Mansions
My cup overflow with Cristal, hundred exotic dancers
Niggaz is plastic, ass gets jealous and passive
My pistol blast at; cowards, leechers, and rappers
Niggaz I fuck with is 'Bravehearts', make G's
Before rap music to me, was wind blowin' the trees
Birds chirpin', rain fallin', perfect and free
But bitches saw my video and think they know me
These niggaz bad talkin', claimin' they gon' do me
Stay out my path homey, you fuckin' wit a true G
Cup'a Hen', cup'a Goose, cup'a Cris'
White chain, colored watch on the wrist
Switch lanes in monster whips, ambience
Specially dressed, guess who? -- Nas, it's obvious
Step to bars, we just ordered dark liquors
Clear liquors, y'all niggaz are s3x
Yes we get respected, eclectic messages
Left our brains, get into a female's estrogen
She feels electric, her breasts she touchin' them
Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction
N-a-s, then they ass, over-spank it
Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas
Call fatties 'bubbles', call head 'skull'
Before I get either I need some Red Bull
She'll scream as I pushed in her freezing cold pool
When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool
That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing
Won't pluck no chicken wing, don't fuck with just anything
Gotta come up, run up and get touched up
Suicide, that's if you confront us
Don't talk, just hold your breath
Been here a while, s'only one nigga left
And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang
You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song
Uh, from a boy to a king
Love to rock diamonds and fancy rings
I'm a thoroughbred, real heavy mang
I'm fuckin' something tonight that's on everything
Fellas who beat bodies with me
Kidnappers and stick-up kids, they all poli' with me
Pop bottles with me, button-up shirts and throwbacks
Those cats only roll when I'm in the city
And the dance floor is disgustin'
Move your waistline to the basic percussion
I'm that, cool laid-back don who won't say nuttin'
And laugh when a nigga start frontin'
And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang
You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song
Rock Tims, rock Chucks, rock Bapes
I like eyes, pretty lips, fly face
First you said you would spread for me in an instant
See me with the next chick, now you act different
Power of the stick shift, now I embarrass her
Play your position, you're way outta character
Do the knowledge, graduated hood college with honors
Pay homage to Nas, Dickies and Converse
On her eyes shades in the nighttime regardless
The army's so thick you can't harm us
And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang
You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song
Uh, it's real, it's real, it's real
Uh, uh, owe me back, uh shorty
Shorty, what up, huh?
Come on
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something
Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax
Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks
Pay me back when you shake it like that girl
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I spent
Pay me back when you shake it again
The don, all the time, with all the shine
You small time, I ball with mine
Links, minks, Bentley, it's all with mine
My jams bump out to the borderline
UK hot with it, blew spots with it
Every continent love when I spit it
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothas on lockdown on their cock feel it
It's real in the field the Last Mohegan
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood
Legit' now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge
I make hits now, money I flip now
Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now
I lit up my neck, pinkie, and wrist now
So girls everywhere, this is how we get down
Repeat 1
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I lent
Pay me back when you shake it again
Play to win, girls in the club moving
I get 'em real hot, my songs seduce 'em
I flow, I'm so mysterious
Nas, and Nasty's the alias
Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping
Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something
I said shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe
You owe us something, baby
Oh, oh, oh
So make up your mind, 'cause I ain't got no time
I'm the most wanted baby fathe, save the drama
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
You thought I was a boxer -- Prince Nasim
But I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you ridin' with me
You keep askin, When do you have time for me?
I'm never free always on the move, bidness oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit tryin'
Before you find what you lookin' for and get to cryin
You always sayin' what you gon' do if you catch me lyin'
No you won't see me tomorrow
Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister
I feel no guilt when I twist ya
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha
You got your name on his lease, copy his key
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig piece
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
But I be out with my peeps in them system jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doin' his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely
But I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby
I'll be gone by daylight
And you'll be so full of sorrow
But you won't see me tonight
No you won't see me tomorrow
Thinking of me you gettin' the chills
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy
Tell your friends you in love with Nas not his money
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs
Iceberg - everything on this planet Earth a woman desires
You make a good wife to most men
I know I got you open; but -- you just my close friend
Get it baby?
No you won't see me tomorrow
C'mon, c'mon c'mon
Tomorrow, what?
Daylight, ghost
You won't see Timbaland tonight baby
Oh, or Nas Esco', check it
Let it ride
Let it ride
You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with black Jason, '89 with a bottle
Jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty no tint
Rollie on wrist, gleamin' he rock the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, louis, and hallsey
Cop chocolate tie, burnin' style and burn it down
Got hype in the federal joint, verdict out
20 years gettin' money in the dirty south
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude
So I'm yellin' free my nigga
My nephew...
Uh uh, yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flames
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas - too real, Nas - true king
It's however you feel, g'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with god
I don't kill soloists only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's Fuck Nas
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it comin'
Soon as I popped my first bottle I spotted my enemies tryna' do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changin on the world since ...Barbeque
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said...
If I, ever make a record
I take a check and put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since in the project, crack in my socks weep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna' learn the traps of the streets
But look at me now
You're the man You're the man
You're the man You're the man
You're the man You're the man
You're the man You're the man
You're the man You're the man
Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
It's suicidal, how I smoke in so much la'
I saw a dead bird flyin through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings and Ghana stay
So I could get on my flesh right away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimmin in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurtin' me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't I must've been Escobar
Forty-five in my waist, starin' at my reflection
In the mirror, sittin' still in the chair like my conception
When everything around me got cloudy, the chair became a king's throne
My destiny found me
It's clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful
Braveheart for life
Salaam Remi. Yeah, What, Yeah
Why don't y'all blast on these niggas, man
Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket
Here come the Bravehearts straight out the projects
We live the life where the blood spills
Same thing that get you cash nigga, get you killed
Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him
Sloppy, droppin' you herbs
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit
Back of your head vomit
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals
Tryin' to wild nowadays sold crack, bust guns at Bow Wow's age
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell
Fuckin' 'em hos, boilin' coke since I was 12
Way too foul walk around all the time
With a gray Mack 10 and a pocket full o' dimes
Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas
Scared straight, but FUCK them hos
Keep it, dead serious
Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin',
Now you sleep with them fishes
G-W-I-Z, so delicious
To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts
I'm movin on past you chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son
And this is the military turn it up
My uzi weighs a ton, your son let's thump nah
Heat talk feet walk you run uh
Rat ta-tat, Hear them shots come
Drop son, pull out
You better send 'em back son, or feel that casket
I'm movin on past you chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son
G-O-D S-O-N I S-O-O-T-H-E a female's estrogen
With my testosterone, male hormone
Enough for a giant's body, science S-C-I-E-N-C-E
Don't tempt me, EMS will get you, me I'm just, invincible
Like Mike Jack said, for me and Al Sharpton won't be Broke in Harlem
That's dead, who made this style, solo or X
Or UTFO's doctor or Mo Dee
Whoever, I freaked it yes, so meet ya death
I never wear Esco, I got a New Line comin' like cinemas
Remember the, original, y'all still tryina show niggas you're rich
Town house niggas
I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries
Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired
While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up
A million of us, each nigga itchin' to bust
You got a house in Virginia
The only way you sicker than us
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck
Yo, this is for them High school drop outs
Niggas in court who copped out
If you prefer shots over knockouts
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' and you ain't turnin' back
Braveheart's gettin' money ruthless till the world end
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend
I used to have the bike on a bench
Now I got the jeep on the strip
Coke in the pot, heat on my hip
Nigga don't stop blazin' 'cause ya target's movin'
Shoot till the gun's empty stupid, Queens
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is
Useless to these swift executioners
And that's Queensbridge nigga, all day
Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze
Runnin' from D's quick to knockout rookies
G Wiz you know what I'm 'bout
To all my real niggas
Get numbers, get names
Thick dames
Headhunters get brains
Big thangs

Why the fuck we goin' in when there's bitches in line?
I spend my time watchin' bitches' behinds
Thinkin' bad shit in the back of my mind

Making movie money, you still investin' in rhymes.

Get too close and bucka! Bucka! Bucka!

Club-hop, car shows, picnics
Big cars, big jewels, big dicks
Rush doors
Or gotta hop the fence
Blow this door
Gotta blow my rent
Gotta show my ass, then go repent
Gotta call in sick
And tell 'em where I went.

Nearly 2 Decades Ago
Ice Cube
Well I think that Ice Cube I think uh...
West Coast to the fools
Big ass W.
Yeah this is a story of a famous dog
Of a dog that chases it's tail, will be dizzy
Met her snake ass at a barbecue bash
She had a lot of ass and a twenty dollar stash
... Of some of that superb 'erb
She said, I got the chronic, so fuck whatcha heard
Ice Cube do you wanna hit this?
This shit is hype, sho' you right
Soon as she passed me the J and a lighter
Me and this hoodrat bitch got tighter
With her ass jacked up, beggin me to spank it
Lookin' like a host from the Barbary coast
Nigga don't wanna get burnt like toast
Whassup wit deez nuts in ya me-outh
Aight everybody... c'mon we out
Took her to the six dollar hole in the wall
And I like how she's holdin' the balls
Gobble gobble, from the incision
Stuff that bitch and it ain't Thanksgiving
Didn't even have to fuck all night long
Take me home, damn it's on
Jumped out the cover, snatched off the rubber
Met the hoe's mother - yo whassup?
Got the seven digits and I'm gone'n
That's the kinda bitch you can call at 2 n the morning
Not just knee deep, she was O.G. deep
When she did the freak with me
Not just knee deep, she was O.G. deep
When she did the freak with me
Yeah this is a story of a famous dog
Of a dog that chases it's tail, will be dizzy
I bumped this hoe on the danceflo'
Where you wanna go? She said, I don't know
I thought I had a treat in the passenger seat
Now her ass wanna get somethin' to eat
From where? She said, Denny's I figure
I said hell naw 'cause they don't like niggaz
Let's go to my house and order Domino's
And maybe I can get the bitch out her clothes
Got to the panties, her ass started fightin
And I'm thinkin' bout my dog Mike Tyson
Whoa-oh, there go the phone
Ay whatcha doin'? Nothin
Then what about screwin?
But thank God for the bitch
That'll come/cum at 2 n the morning
You the kind of girl to eat a dick up raw
And drink a 40 through a straw
And I love ya, 'cause you're down to get dug
And your man don't know you're gettin' fucked by a thug
Doin' what the fuck you wanna do
And it's cool, cause you got a purse full of rubbers
So jump your freaky ass in your Hyundai
I got a room at the Omni
Nothin' tricky, no you ain't picky
Whassup Nikki? Down for a quickie
Get your lil' dickie and your Mickey and you're straight
And gotta be at work by 8
Called you last night, you wasn't home and
Damn - it's half past 2 n the morning
Yeah this is a story of a famous dog
Of a dog that chases it's tail, will be dizzy
Everyting is real on this concrete and steel
Niggas peel your cap for a happy meal
I got to deal with this ball of confusion, world of illusions
Playin' every night when we sendin' paper chasing, grinin'
While you still chasin' women 'round tables no lieutenants
It's Ice Cube and the family stone
Breakin' bread every night in L.A.
It's 90 degrees no enemies in sight
Even the Don gotta fall to his knees every night
I don't wanna loose, all I wanna do is win
I fucked up today, can I try it again?
I'm lovin' every breath like a cold sip of soda
While I'm bankin' down these back streets, thanks for lookin' over
Damn sure nice to know ya, fuck a four leaf clover
And thanks for this range rover

Politians and parents, always havin' a fit
Everybody wanna know who you with? where you from?
Why you lookin' at me dumb?
Here's a bullet 'cause you number one
We gotta wait until tomorrow
You know I got the bar
I don't wanna loose, all I wanna do is win
I fucked up today, can I try it again?
Mister prosperity, these niggas wanna bury me
Your bitch wanna mary me
Rollin' more than a cherokee
Don't, I drive what I want, and what I ain't drivin' I don't want
Permits hit the conk in the reagal
But weez legal niggas dollars got bald eagles nigga
You can't undermine Mister Grime
You rappin' 'bout the same shit I rapped about in '89
They love you one minute and they hate you the next
Push my lex through the California sunshine
Look back on my life and say damn I done done fine

24 with a L
24 years old
And I got life in this motherfucker
24 with a L as I bail through the concrete
Shit is kinda deep, deep
Deeper than Atlantis
You got to know who the man is
L.A. better known as Pelican's Bay
The ghetto bird's got the word from the stool pigeon
A bird in the hand can't beat a chicken
There ain't no warden, shit
Just broken glass fuckin' up my Jordans
Twice upon a time in the projects
I done got jacked for my Rolex
But I keep goin', let it pass
'Cause the swap meet got a sale on ski masks
And my little homie Kevin
Been carjackin' since '87
L.A. is like a jail cell and I got 24 with a L
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
24 with a L
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Now, I made a little money, good
But I still want to live in the hood
But buying new fly shit
Is just like inviting ants to a picnic
It's just too many sets
And now I'm getting those kidnap threats
But who wanna get wet?
'Cause I'll soak ya, you think I'm fat like Oprah
All I got is a little piece of nothing
And now you wanna jack all of a sudden
Rather have me face down on the floor
Instead of that devil you work for
Motherfuckin' coward
And clowning my man 'cause he wants to go to Harvard
Now I got a strap when I bail
Through the hood, 24 with a L
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
24 with a L
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
24 years, but see I got life
Sorry Mike, it does matter if you're black or white
'Cause I'm up against the black and white
They spread my legs and grab my nuts tight
Niggas keep hitting me up
And bitches try to get a drop of nut
Askin' me to dick this so they can blow up
Throw up from the morning sickness
Keep my shoulder on the wall like the county
'Cause you buster ass niggas can't clown me
South of pee go, that's where we go
Deep in a Regal, Desert Eagle
Sittin' on my lap like a bitch with a gat
Westside's on the map
So if you want to scrap or even drop shells
It don't matter, 24 with a L
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger
24 with a L

One mo' strike and I'm through, nigga
Bottom of the ninth swingin', for my life
I'm up at the plate, goin' for the gate
They got my moms seated in section eight
Been on deck since my last felony
I'm that 0 for 2 mothafucka
With the Louisville Slugger
Shay Whitie, that left hand punk
Is on the mound and he comin' wit dat off-speed junk
It's the Westside Hustlaz, vs these LA Pigs
You can say the damned vs the nigs
My little homies in the dugout
They lookin' sad, 'cause fourteen niggas done struck-out
My first offense was possession of weed
Now I'm in the major leagues and
That mothafucka Bill Clinton-is a son of a bitch
Had the nerve to throw out the first pitch
I'm just tryin' to get rich like Trump
The Home Run king is now in a slump, pass me a hunk
How the fuck can I stay out the pen
When its one-two-three strikes you in
One-two three strikes you in
Now how the fuck a nigga supposed
To stay out the pen, I'm on a blend
Of Gin and Hen, everyday of my life
With two strikes it ain't right
He's in the wind-up
Here come the pitch
They felt the chill 'cause if I get on first
You know the deal - a niggas gots to steal
Like to steal home and I betcha
That I can run over, the LA Pig catcher
Just because I'm black, wit a bat
They wanna send a nigga back to the warning track
Fulla count they say I won't amount to shit
But fool I can hit like Kenny Grit
With a split in my mouth on tha cellular phone
And watch a pitcher get served
You from tha LA Pigs
I know you coming with a curve
Ay batter, batter is the chitter-chatter
I'm the designated hitter, a nigga
Much badder, than Babe Ruth
Will I tell the truth and nothing but the truth
Hell yeah, I'd rather be shootin' hoops
'Cause a niggas guaranteed to win
Against a bullshit loss and three strikes you in
Take me out to the ballgame
Another nigga on trial
Keep ya peanuts Jeezuh
And fuck you Cracker Jack
I hope I never come back
I gots to root for my homeboys
If they don't win it's a shame
'Cause its one-two-three strikes you in
Twenty-five years of pain you know my name
They wanna nigga to run and get hung
High strung, so this pig can win the Cy-Young
I'ma hit this mothafucka a mile
In the batters box, high as Steve Hal
You can't salary cap my gat
No strike, 'cause gangsta-rap is on the map
I'm like Satchel Paige wit a gauge
Or Jackie Robinson, when I'm robbin' one
Of you Cracker Jacks fool I'm a mothafuckin vet
And fuck yo seventh-inning stretch, so
Take me out to the ballgame,
And see my neighborhood name
In your Ghetto Hall of Fame
Take me out to the ballgame
Another nigga on trial
Keep ya peanuts Jeezuh
And fuck you Cracker Jack
I hope I never come back
I gots to root for my homeboys
If they don't win it's a shame
'Cause its one-two-three strikes you in
Twenty-five years of pain you know my name
If they smear my name, you know who did it
If they kill my game, you know who did it
Hey look at this! I've been cleaning out my nest
And I found a old book of my poetry
Fresh out of school 'cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job 'cause I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid by rappin' to the nation
But that's not likely, so here's my application
Pass it to the man at AT&T
'Cause when I was in school I got the A. E. E.
But there's no SC for this youngsta
I didn't have no money so now I have to punch the
Clock, gotta slave, and be half a man
But whitey says there's no room for the African
Always knew that I would clock G's
But welcome to McDonalds may I take your order please
Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
'Cause my son doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and similac
Do I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from Bush
Or Jesse Jackson, and operation Push
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A masengel what the hell crack will sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches,
Miss Porker, Little Joe and Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I got me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
'Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I'll never get love again
'Cause blacks are too fuckin' broke to be republican
Now I remember I used to be cool
Till I stopped fillin' out my W-2
Now senators are gettin' high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is our only room to walk
'Cause we don't want a drug push
But a bird in the hand is worth more than a bush
Only three short years after the 1965 Watts Riots and the death of Malcolm X and of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, A Boy Was Conceived, who's lyrics would change the world
Cube, please stop rapping so we can come out and get some, some more of this action mane
You know when we ain't doin' no movies I'm back out here selling half ounce and quarters of that good weed in that neighborhood
And the niggaz? Why don't you kick some shit about the kids, man? The
Fuckin' kids?!
Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-C-E
And let me tell ya a story or two
About a punk-ass nigga I knew
Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street 'cause he was piping hot
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop
Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe
At that type of shit he's a pro
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way
To make some money, why not?
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes
Drove a 500 sittin' on Lorenzoes
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out
Saw, her and her friends sellin sheepskins
Yo, my empty sheepskins
Yo baby, what's up with that?
Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin' up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin' her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence? Yo I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go
Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit!
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
With a joint, drinkin' some 8-ball
Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville
Lookin' for, the wolf to kill
They're fucked up and they want revenge
Them and Humpty used to be friends
Now they're enemies 'cause he's a traitor
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And Mister Rogers is gettin' mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin'
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next
So Mister Rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho
Cause Cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve, givin' up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em
Little Boy Blue is up front givin' orders
Little did they know Cinderella was a fink
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink
A bad influence? Yo, I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go
We outta here, seeeee-yaaaaa
Blacks who ventured across the unmarked border were often attacked
By teenage members of the new gang called The Spook Hunters,
One of a handful of white gangs active in this time.
It was only natural for L.A.'s newest residents to respond unkind.
As white attacks started to increase in the mid 1940's and late 1940's
Blacks started to organize their clubs really as a defensive mechanism.
And the boss men or the business men and the Snyder boys and all these
Clubs in south L.A. really were just sorta defending themselves against
White violence that was coming from Huntington Park and Southgate.
The demise of the black panthers in Los Angeles is said to be another
Blow to a generation of black teenagers that witnessed many of its role models
Assasinated throughout the 1960's.
What I'm sayin' in so many words, they shoulda let the panthers
Went on because there probably would never have been no crips and no bloods.
Down at the best spot
It's me and JD and they sellin more birds than a pet shop
The spot's hot and everybody nervous
That's when the blue car served us
Oh why did fools had to let loose
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce
Big Tom had to push us
13 niggaz runnin' straight to the bushes
For they gats so they could draw down
But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down
Not known why I dropped out
Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out
So now I gotta jet
Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin wet
Tryin' to see if we got him
Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom
Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out
Woke up in the back of a tray
On my way, to MLK
That the county hospital jack
Where niggaz die over a little scratch
Still sittin' in the trauma center
In my back is where the bullet entered
Yo nurse I'm gettin' kind of warm
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin' form
Coughin up blood on my hands and knees
Then I heard freeze nigger don't move
Yo, I didn't do a thing
Didn't wanna go out like my man Rodney King
Still got gaffled
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel
Now I'm handcuffed
Being asked information on my gang affiliation
I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes
And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime
I need to see a MD
And y'all mothafuckers giving me the third degree
Look at the waiting room
Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room
Nobody gettin' help
Since we poor
The hospital move slow
Now I'm laid out
People steppin over me to get closer to the TV
Just like a piece of dog shit
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet
One hour done passed
And when I'm almost through
They call my name and put me on ICU
Halfway dead
No respect and handcuffed to the bed
Now the trauma starts
Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart
So I begin the ass kissin'
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician
Got the chills, but my temperatures 103
Only got a band-aid and an IV
That's when I start cussin
Police steady askin me who did the bustin'
Why oh why can't I get help
'Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self
Too many black bodies the hospital housin
So at 10 P.M. I was Audi 5000
Gangsta, slow that shit down
Yeah, who wanna ride with this?
We can ride all day, every day
It's do or die all day, every day
It's suicide all day, every day
You'll be high all day, every day
I'm rolling down the avenue
Doing what I gotta do
Sick as the swine flu
Ain't nothing fine as you
Must I remind you
What is behind you?
Drop it down, took the ground
Like you was designed to
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
We can do it all day, every day
Get into it all day, every day
Drinking fluids all day, every day
I pursue it all day, every day
You can have it, just reach out and grab it
You can have it, just reach out and grab it
Just be careful, don't be a silly rabbit
Recreation use will turn into a habit
To the ground, take it to the ground, girl
To the ground, take it to the ground, girl
To the ground, take it to the ground, girl
To the ground, take it to the ground, girl
Fuck the feds all day, every day
And chicken heads all day, every day
Get your bread all day, every day
Use your head all day, every day
Come on
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
All day, every day
All day, every day
All day, every day
All day, every day
Roll that, I blase that
Nigga, fuck way back
I does that, I does that
Homie, what was that?
I had to keep it plain and simple
Gangsters don't dance, we boogie
Four fingers up, two twisting in the middle
What's worst, ya all?
Ice Cube with The Lench Mob, I got it goin' on
A nigga that's livin' in the city of the criminal
Zone
One-time can't keep the law in order
'Cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area
The way I'm talkin' I'm scarin ya
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
'Cause if you is or you ain't a gangbanger
Keep one in the chamber
'Cause you'll get them thangs put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin' did my hair grow?
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice
Cube?
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay
I keep my 9 anyway
For the day one of my homies wanna squab
I'm still rollin' wit The Lench Mob
Back in the day I did my share of dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got
Hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
To bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the
Fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I reap all your fat shit, jack
Back to the criminals sect
I leave crew after crew but they can't catch me yet
'Cause I'm slick and slippery
They can't get wit me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs
And sweat 'em like sweathogs
And get mad, mad 'cause I'm the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted
'Ice Cube is wanted dead'
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the
Green
Hear shots and si-reens
When I feen first they yo' rings, now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
It's the American way
'Cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Ice Cube - a motherfuckin cut-throat
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap
You know I'ma beat the rap
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
So get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight
'Cause I'm scarin ya, wanted by America
Word, but who the fuck is heard?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let 'em see a nigga invasion
Point blank for the caucasian
Cock the hammer then crack that ol' smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin' in a dig, yo it couldn't be
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Pack my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
'Cause the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbin the white folks
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope
I said it before and I'll still taunt it
Every motherfucker with a colour is most wanted

Check my blood pressure,
They think they fresher than the don
Prescription pills to keep me calm,
Nigga, I'm da bomb!
In the black testerosa,
Sippin' on mimosa,
A bleedin' ? nosa?
I'm in the westwing at the Nikko
Give me cinco kilos from puerto rico
When I okay it,
So much cheese, you got to weigh it
Never thought these niggaz was the feds
Freeze was the sound
I started lettin' off rounds,
Lay the whole fuckin' room down
I don't wanna see your honor,
Ratha eat pirhana from benny hana,
Smokin' marijuana in my sauna,
I done hade it with these attics and faggots,
They them rattic causin' static,
Bring me my a-u-t-o-matic,
Oh niggaz wanna se how we ride
Bitch, you know the muthafuckin' side,
World muthafuckin' wide.
Make yo' hustle official,
And them niggaz that's wit' you,
Gotta push tha issue,
On the fools that dis you,
Whether pump or pistol,
When it's up in yo' gristle,
Hand yo' mama a tissue,
If I decide to kiss you.
Can you dig her?
It's the bigger, seven-figure, super nigga
Wit' the triggas at yo' dome,
We like to roam,
Through yo' muthafuckin' home like a comb
And find the money that's gone
And we'll take you, shake you,
Break you, take two,
Play you on wit' the chrome,
Nigga shoot!
Execute, they try to electrocute
I got too much loot
Ya say I'm on yo' hit list,
You niggaz miss,
Tryin' to turn my muthafuckin' cheese into swiss
Rappers make bucks and I can hear it,
Hard to fear it,
'Cause I know you grew up on my lyrics
It's the boss player,
Never lost hair over assholes,
Blast holes in you muthafuckin' tadpoles
Like a bullfrog,
Nigga I'm a bullhog,
Guppies get worked like puppies by the bulldog
Where millions never gave a fuck about sicilians,
Or killas on TV can see,
We got the real ones
So check yo' muthafuckin CD-rom
And your world wide web, dot com,
It's the don mega!
Ask about me x2
I see you, Over there, Lookin' like somethin' wrong
'Cause I'm over here, Sittin' on some chrome
Shotgun to the dome
Bend a corner wit me
When shit get boring, I jump in some foreign
Explorin through my neighborhood, All to the good
Ain't the finest order riches
Still got ordinary bitches to jehovah's witness
Tryin' to get wit this
Know I got the green thumb, Hustler you never seen one
Extreme fun, Wit this mean one
But you'll never get none fuckin' wit them broke hoes
Pinnochios, Fuck around and get a broke nose
That's ya fate when we congregate
It's the great writer, Exponium big spider
Tighter than virgin cocks, At the mall like dispurge a lot
Like these niggaz servin' rocks
But I'm servin' rhymes, Two cds at a time
Like it's weight, Ice cube the great
Bend a corner wit me, We can ride to the store
Do it like friends do, What I'm into?
Everything on the menu, Wit extras on it
C'mon baby and jump up on it
This one is strictly, For niggaz rollin' 750s
And it's polished from the 60s
Bumpin that cube shit, Do shit, I bet the wheels fall off
Before the skills fall off
Throw up the dub, Got more cocks to rub
And if you don't, I done got this far without yo love
Hoes want the nigga in the t-shirt and rolex
And y'all still get the .9 up out the kotex
Got the o.z., And the x.o
Broads get fatal, And don't wanna let go
Incredible, Nigga who you rap like?
Come out the movie, Who you act like?
It's the don, Still rappin' 2000 and beyond
Tryin' to come up on another million
From the gate, Khop want the whole plate
Want my drink and eat the whole cake
And won't wait until another nigga say go
I lay low wit the tweed and the yayo
And play po, And stop niggaz knackin
Still keep the set crackin'
All about the cheese and how it's stackin
And plus, It's mo cheddar down the line
Ain't no better time for me and a gang of niggaz on the grind
Tryin' to get the income, And then some
Stash a little bit and spin some
Keep it poppin' till the end come
Can't stop it, Then shawties wanna grip
24/7, Money got a nigga whipped
Chip after chip, But if I slip
Have the homie send me o.t. and work the flip
Cause the world is payola
Silk the spot and left connect on ya wall in a black crayola
C'mon baby and jump up on it
C'mon baby and jump up on it
C'mon bitch and jump up on it
C'mon bitch and jump up on it
Was America willing to maintain order...

Twenty d energizers.

Everytime I wanna go get a fuckin' brew

Oriental one-penny countin' motherfuckers
That make a nigga made enough to cause a little ruckus
Thinkin' every brother in the world's out to take
So they watch every damn move that I make
They hope I don't pull out a gat and try to rob
They funky little store, but bitch, I got a job
I ain't tryin' to steal none of yo' shit, leave me alone!
Yo yo, check it out
So don't follow me, up and down your market
Or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
Of the nationwide boycott
Juice with the people, that's what the boy got
So pay respect to the black fist
Or we'll burn your store, right down to a crisp
And then we'll see ya!
Cause you can't turn the ghetto - into black korea

Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got Daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass

Ooh, feet don't fail me now ...

Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There ain't nothin' wrong, so hit the bong
Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride
As the buffalo bitch go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got Daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale
'Cause nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for the theme from the Black Hole
Now I'll big bang you with my black pole
Flashlight, red light, we don't like cops on the bike
Just made bail, tonight
So whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna have some fun with the bop gun
One nation and we're on the move
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move

Strong as a Coca-Cola with a chrome pistola

--Bounce it bounce it, shake it shake it
Wiggle wiggle, Make it jiggle, just a little--
Turn it up, we can clown to this
Throw your hands in the air if you down with this
I hear you bragin 'bout the money you foldin'
Same nigga that be kissin' my colon
When you picture me rollin'
Nigga picture me holdin', pure heat like Nolan
They call me Poppa Doctor
See your bitch and I knock her
I collect them like Pokemon
You can keep 'em, keep 'em from creepin' where I'm sleepin'
Same bitch and same club every weekend
Same drink, same dress, brainless
What would you do if I handed you a stainless
Can't fuck with a girl that's gameless
Would you tell the po-po's what my name is
Turn it up, we can clown to this
--Bounce it bounce it, shake it shake it
Wiggle wiggle, Make it jiggle, just a little-- {repeat}
Don't stop get it get it
I'm not the kind to get jiggy with it
I'm the kind to get niggy with it
I'm a show you what it's all about, trick!
Shake yo' ass till your curls fall out, bitch!
Don't pretend you can live without, dick!
Come with me ain't no doubt that I'm, rich!
Whatchoo goan do in the early 'morn
When the lights come on, and your drink is gone
Do you think you grown
It's a party at my house I got drinks at home
Get to undressin', pull out the lethal weapon
Look you in the eye and I aks you one question
Turn it up, we can clown to this
Throw your hands in the air if you down with this
--Bounce it bounce it, shake it shake it
Wiggle wiggle, Make it jiggle, just a little-- {repeat}
---Bounce, bitch, bounce wit me wit me... can ya---{repeat}
Who that nigga that be in the club every week
Who that cheep mutherfucker won't buy you a drink
Who that bitch dressed like a freak but she won't speak
Who that hoe think she is, like her shit don't stink
Who that player on the floor, sweatin' in all silk
Who that girl showin' tits, like she got milk
Who that hater in the corner, always on tilt
Turn it up, we can clown to this
Throw your hands in the air if you down with this

Whassup Cube dog?
I got this bitch-ass nigga right here
Y'know, fuckin' with this tramp-ass bitch
Puttin' her before the scrill' all the time, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Man I got this nigga transcripts, and every-mother-fuckin' thang
Tellin' this bitch all my mother-fuckin' business
Puttin' ass over cash everyday
Nigga fuck that, this Westside
Be gone you fuckin' peon, got the Don furious
Talkin' on the phone got the Federal curious
I'm serious! I don't give a fuck where he is
Snatch him out the factory, bring his ass back to me
How the fuck you think I got the NAME Bossalini? Punk
Mack God Rap Genie, you can't see me
Up in this game ever since you was a lame
Y'all train at my school, nigga I rule
You never make me holla, smokin' on a fifteen dollar
From across the water, watch your daughter
She might catch the Holy Ghost from this rap sermon
While you vermin smokin' Sherman, I'm rollin' somethin' German, bitch
Enemies look so funny, with they clothes bummy
Don't need no honey, that's right
'Cause I'm thinkin' with my big head, FUCK what my dick said!
We puttin' cash over ass, each and every day
We puttin' cash over ass, each and every day
Now who's that nigga got these bitches lookin' silly? Me!
I'm the Big Willie for rilly, the real dilly
You must want to die, don't get the lye
After dark up at Griffith Park, shallow grave
For the mark check his heart, the game about to start
Keep your mind off them bitches, eyes on your riches
If it twitches give it stitches
If it jiggles or switches, fuck and take pictures, now
I'm livin' in a two-point zone, and I'm still bumpin
Call me in the clutch, ain't lost my touch
Nigga what? on the microphone
If I drove it in the video, bitch, I can drive it home
Tight as a Corleone
You got to get your own, baby get on, now
Get your ass up and go to work, cause you know
On payday, nigga that shit gon' hurt
Fuckin' with a skirt instead of handlin your bizness
Rich dude, now you got to make three wishes
I'm suspicious, of any motherfucker puttin' fuck over finance
'Specially fuckin' up my plans
I'm the boss, I can be late
But you'll never see her and me, over currency
Givin' you the third degree, cause you got
Too many broke bitches and you like bankin for a penny
Stop fuckin' on them dum-dums
Find one with some ass and some income
Who wanna win? Who wanna spin?
Who wanna make, twenty-five eight? Me
Ice Cube the great... pushin rhymes like weight
Never put that hoe, in front of that dough nigga
For what? She ain't gon' love you if you ain't got no dough fool
Never ass over cash
Give me a black goddess sister I can't resist her. no stringy haired, blonde
Hair, blue eyed, pale skinned buttermilk complexion. grafted, recessive,
Depressive, ironing board backside straight up and straight down. no
Caucazoid, white cave bitch...
Ease back, white bitch, I don't play that
Just because I got on my L.A. hat
Stalkin' walking in my big black boots
Is my jingle, now you want Mandingo
Big, black and handsome
I should hold your devil ass for ransom
Sorta like Patty Hearst, but I'll burst first bitch
And you know what's worse
I'm coming from the land where the choppers roam
So fuck you bitch and your coppertone
Stringy hair - no derrier - frontin' and fakin' with your silicone pair
Do I wanna fuck? not hardly
That's kinda like barbie fuck bob marley
It ain't gonna happen, I keep rappin'
Muthafuck Tenielle, but see I'm the captain of this ship
And I'm true to the game
Y'all all look the same
Standin' by my backstage door, hopin' that'll switch
Spread out you little cave bitch
Why every time we get famous
You wanna play us like Andy and Amos?
The devil sent you to try and tame us
But you can't tame me, with no bitch named amy
Lookin' for the dark meat
But hoe, I ain't tryin' to go out like barkely
'Cause every time I turn on the TV
I see several brothers with she-devils
Smilin' 'cause you out on a date
But sooner or later, the bitch'll yell rape
Soon as daddy found out you a jigaboo
He'll kill like he did Emmitt Till
Yah, he tried to kick bass
But the bitch probably threw it in his face
Sargent bale ain't nothin' but a trick
Nasty as hell, stanky little cave bitch
Now don't think that I hate you
'Cause I won't date you, bitch I gotta stay true
You can be a fan, but don't expand
And try to get my dick in your hand
You better run to the minute man
Pale as snow, so act like y'know
'Cause if I slap it, flip it, and rub it like that
Yeah, it gotta be black
Plus yo ass too flat
I need a butt big enough that can clap
Rat-a-tat-tat
You can't get mine ho
I'd rather fuck an albino
At least I know, she's comin' from the nubian
And not the Ku Klux Klan that you be in
And I don't give a fuck if your family is rich
You're still a little cave bitch.

Ain't no other kings in this rap thing, they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot, they disappearin'
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing, they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot, they disappearin'
Bitch niggas still wanna check my urine
Still can't believe what you see and what you're hearin'
You motherfuckers thought you knew the whole story
Until your mama took a nigga on Maury
Read your test results, are you the father?
I'm the father of this gangsta shit
Never thought that I have a bunch of bastard kids
Lil' bad ass kids, I whoop they ass every night
Send the paramedics, bitch, and the black and white
I brought you in this world, I'll take you out
Do you ugly, so mama can't make you out
You know my style, a colt file a report
I'm a deadbeat daddy, no child support
You get fooled like the last trick, get it out your ass
You know my pyroclastic flow, come on
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing, they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot, they disappearin'

Get it out your ass, bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass, bitch
Y'all niggas know, y'all bitches know
Where you get it from, who's the original
You got your daddy's mouth, talk like a criminal
Keep it gangsta, son, never get pigeon holed
Rap bastards tryin' to make a classic
Keep your dumb ass out of the casket
'Cause Interscope'll spend your money, they don't give a fuck
About a dead rapper, nigga, they'll chop it up
Keep it movin', y'all, they'll come mop it up
Corrupt LAPD cover up
Everyday nigga, we know drama
They ain't lookin' for Osama, ask Biggie's mama
Thank God that the gangsta's back
We ain't got to put up with this brainless rap
May your lungs collapse, MCs are funny
All you can rap about is pussy and money, come on
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing, they siblings

You want child support
Get it out your ass, bitch
All y'all rappers should kiss and make up
Take your bullshit jewelry back to Jacob
Get your mind right, nigga, and start to wake up
'Cause the whole rap industry needs to shake up
You got million dollar niggas killin' million dollar niggas
Bustin' outta Bentleys, wearin' chinchillas
There you go again, rollin' in your limo
Comin' from the Grammy's, shootin' out the window
I know the scripture, but there's something wrong with this picture
What you mad about, diamonds all in your mouth
No car, no nigga's house paid off
I never heard of a rapper gettin' laid off
Boy, you a fool or you just act crazy
Or you a grown crack baby born in the eighties
To all you motherfuckers say I went Hollywood
I'm gangsta, I know when I got it good
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing, they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot, they disappearin'

You can die in these streets all alone
I am the wrong nigga, too fuckin' grown nigga
To go for that nigga, I ain't 'cha hoe nigga

The deep-sea sniper, you got the wrong niggaz
Retire like Jigga, here comes the Attila the Hun
Killin' niggaz for fun, these rappers is done
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
I burn like the sun, continue to ball
He's got nuts and plus the Don touch
And split the fine dutch, Starsky call Hutch
He's laid with some sluts up in some guts
Just back in the cut, he thinks he's King Tut
Can't fuck this nigga up, cause just the nigga luck
That niggaz really love him and tear the city up
Uh, even though I'm fuckin' with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low

Off my ass khakis sag like cellulite tits, bitch
Under the suede, headliner and I ain't yo momma
Play with my dollars on yo' ass they'll be layin flowers
I put a hole in your brain with these hollow hot rocks
Hittin the switch, makin' the fo' hopscotch
Rollin' up imperial in dickie material
All in your peripheral, throwin' shells at your vehicle
Clipped up, pimped up, big chipped up
Stacy Adams tips spiffed up, golf hat flipped up
I blow yo' ass off the map, fuck with Dub
I'll have yo' ass rollin' home with windshield glass on your lap
Fuck rap, I'm wearin a creased tee, eatin ribs

I got the chrome thang thang to make the dome stank
Hood life forever bitch, chrome and paint, c'mon

Street lights...
Yeah, yo, check it
Turn me up a little bit, on the mic
I flip shit for gangbang niggas
I talk shit for insane niggas
I got a clip for you strange niggas
Understand, I come from South Central
Muthafuckers don't know what I been through
I keep my muthafuckin heat in my igloo
And it's lookin' for some meat it can get through
Fuck with me, there will be agony
In these streets, it will be a tragedy
Can't you see, it ain't no fag in me
If it was I woulda joined the Academy
Get back, y'all better get the fuck back
I never take shit from rappers
I turn them, muthafuckers into cadavers
Cause youse a trick and your Ghost Rider is Casper
I heard you lost on Fear Factor
Cause you couldn't swallow deez nuts, big as a tractor
You dumb bitch, think I'm an actor
And a nigga couldn't get close enough to slap her
Ice Cube, understand it's real
I'm the nigga of steel, got you Killin' at Will
Got my nigga a deal, he tried to fuck me and steal
I love the nigga but he now feelin' the chill
Let's do it till God and the devil collide, come on!
To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis
And it seem like the world is full of cold places
Keep yo' head up, fuck what they said cause
You can do it and the man will get you through it
I believe that, homey, I believe that
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back
They say Gangster, gangster! Tell me how you do it
How you get through it and them other niggaz blew it
I keep my eye on the prize then pursue it
Chase it like a cheetah chuck it out and subdue it
So self-educate, nigga don't hate
Cause the game I got is Madden oh-eight
Fuck with Cube, I'm better than YouTube
Fuck with them dudes them niggaz is new school
The game don't change just the players
The rhymes don't change just the fuckin' rhymesayers
But I'm goin' on 25 years strong
The shit I say might get you through the day
Or change your whole life in a major way
The shit they say, might catch you a case
The shit I say, feel like your birthday
To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis
And it seem like the world is full of cold places
Keep yo' head up, fuck what they said cause
You can do it and the man will get you through it
I believe that, homey, I believe that
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back
You know what? Momma said it'd be days like this
Straight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss
She said Don't let 'em see you crawl, don't let 'em see you fall
All they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers
It's a cold world, nigga, bring a bomber jacket
If it's another hustle out there I'ma crack it
Fuck the new dance, I'ma learn how to eat
Get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin' streets
They keep callin me
They keep callin, all the lil' homies keep fallin'
In them same traps niggaz cain't figure out
In the fast lane, boy, but the bridge is out
Make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled
Get you in the system, get you in the soil
And your funeral was sponsored by Unocal
Saw you UVN, nigga digital
To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis
And it seem like the world is full of cold places
Keep yo' head up, fuck what they said cause
You can do it and the man will get you through it
I believe that, homey, I believe that
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back
I know, it's fucked up how they do us
Pretend they really care, but then they Jerry Lewis
Take that money that was allocated to us
Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us
Watchin Katrina, is worser than Ike and Tina
See New Orleans get bitchslapped by FEMA
Louisiana got racist-ass politics
Your honor, Osama, Obama
Even, yo' momma ain't fuckin' with my karmas
They want us to quit, forget
And not give a shit about these sick-ass politics
A lunatic is in the White House
Make me wanna go do a lick right now
But they'll make a nigga bow down
In the penitentiary, a billion dollar industry
To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis
And it seem like the world is full of cold places
Keep yo' head up, fuck what they said cause
You can do it and the man will get you through it
I believe that, homey, I believe that
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back
I believe that, homey, I believe that
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back
Here's another day at the stoplight
I'm lookin' in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South central is puttin' ice cube to the test
With four brothas in the ss
Now, I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slippin I'm fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Do these fools got a problem with me, or do they got love?
And when the light turn green, I don't bone out
I wanna see, what these black men are all about
'Cause if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm pluggin they super sport
First they get behind my ride
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scopin out the one smokin' indo'
Comin' up fast, rollin' down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, 'cause I'm color blind
Killa cali, the state where they kill
Over colors 'cause brothas don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop
And he won't stop and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little locs are gettin' a little too loc'ed
And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong words then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a u-turn, come back and get served, nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
But wearin the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me
'Cause I slang these thangs like a g
It's on, is anybody killin' for the summertime
I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind
I'm fresh outta county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
'Cause everyday, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story
So what's left, the judge goes deaf
When you try to tell your side and you ain't blue eyed
Boy you better duck, 'cause the book is comin'
And just hand your car keys over to your woman
Because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even shed a tear
'Cause believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph
'Cause brothas, you don't know the half
On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
But ever since I've been down, I'm colorblind
Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, young and dumb and full of come up, a baby loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke
Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin'
'Cause I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin'
Grabbed the a.k. and jumped in the g ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side
Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the 5 dollar stick and I put in my clip
So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sendin niggaz to harrisons ross
Caught one from the back and I looked in his eyes
Thinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by the other kind
Niggaz in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
'Cause, I walk the alleys of compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way I get burned baby
Lou wears blue, big fred wears red
Put 'em together and we color 'em dead
Dead, dyin', gettin' smoked like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral
I understand how all my homeboys feel
'Cause I've been shot and to this day, I pack my steel
'Cause I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
With blue and red bandanas on the street
And if you're slippin, you'll be six feet deep
'Cause me and t-bone, we pay it no mind
And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind...
Aiyyo Ice Cube man
Since you went solo, what's up with the rest of the crew?
So High you can't get around it
So low you can't get under it
So High you can't get over it
I can't get over it
Nothin' can stop us now
Have you never sense the recite in my rhymes?
Standin' on stage and I'm grabbin' my nuts
Have you never sense the recite in my rhymes?
Standin' on stage and I'm grabbin' my nuts
I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang
See, I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter
Said, I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang
Said, I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter
Give me that beat fool, it's a full time jack move
Chilly Chill, yo, homie make the track move
And I'll jack any Tom, Dick and Hank
That's the name of the suckers I done ganked
I get away from a copper
Drop a dime, I'll break you off somethin' proper
With the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B, T-Bone and that's J.D.
And here's how we'll greet you
Stop!
Here we go, Wait a minute, Wait a minute, Wait a minute
Drop an Old School beat
Goddamn, I'm glad, goddamn, I'm glad
Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now, you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Lookin' like straight bozos
I saw it comin', that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
When y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline
No Vaseline
Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-C-E
And let me tell you a story or two
About a punk-Ass-Nigga I knew
Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin' up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin' her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red Ridin' Hood, and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence? y'all I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go
Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit
Once upon a time in the projects y'all
I damn near had to wreck a whore
It's Ice cube came to pay a little visit to you
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I ain't fuck up my night
Yeah
Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood
Like everybody from the hood, is up to no good?
Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood
Like everybody from the hood, is up to no good?
Run from the ghetto bird
Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird
Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird
Up early in the morning, dressed in black
Don't ask why? 'Cause I'm down in a suit and tie
I tell ya life ain't shit to fool with
I still hear the screams of his mother
And it's getting to my temple
Why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?
It makes me so mad I want to get my sawed-off
And have some bodies hauled off
Hug my crew, and maybe shed a tear or two
And I wanna get blitz
Grab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce
About a brother who had to be the one and only
So I dedicate this to my dead homiez...
Another homie got murdered on a shakedown {three gun shots}
And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown
Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted {two gun shots}
A framed picture and a closed casket
A single file line about 50 cars long
All drivin' slow with they lights on
He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath
What good is that when you're six feet deep?
I look at that shit and gotta think to myself
And thank God for my health
'Cause nobody really ever know
When it's gonna be they family on the front row
So I take everything slow, go with the flow
'Cause that's what Pops told me
But I wish he could have said it... to my dead homiez
I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun
Now it's Rest in Peace after every one
Except me, but I ain't the one to front
Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month
Plus, I knew him when he was yeah big
Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig
But somethin' ain't right
And it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight
Lovin' each other in a caring mood
There's lots of people and lots of food
They say Be Strong and you're tryin'
But how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'?
So that's why Ice Cube's dressed up
Because the city is so fuckin' messed up
And everybody is so phony
Take a little time... to think about your dead homiez.
Damn we burn up niggas
Feeling fucked by lench mob niggas
Don't be a bitch girl
It is a fuckin' death bitch
Representin' south centeral
Representin' west coast
Play it again
Ice cube

Bitch, hit the freeway, dirty mack's get tossed
'Cause I fuck around, and jump your ass like Kris Kross
Just might blast, snake in the grass

Found at a trunk of funk
Tall and stiff as a philly blunt

So if you jack me homey, I never jump out
No!
I just tickle these switches and tickle these bitches
That's lickin' all on my paint job like liquorish
I know a lotta dances, they call me Jolly Ranchers
'Cause I shine like Rudolph, nigga fuck Prancer!
Ice Cube, reflect like chrome
When I'm in the hood, I run it like Rome
You see my lo' lo'
Doin' what it 'pose to do
And that fo' do'
Doin' what it 'pose to do
You know my big watch
Doin' what it 'pose to do
I make the bitches watch
Doin' what it 'pose to do
I see that big ass
Doin' what it 'pose to do
When you walk pass
Doin' what it 'pose to do
You know my shit shine
Doin' what it 'pose to do
I make the bitch mind
Doin' what it 'pose to do
Call her ass right there, she got that kush
And I'm a run all through it like Reggie Bush
And I'm a hit that bush like George Bush
In the middle of the night like a crook
Don't fuck with her, her ass is average
Only fuck with the ones with the whole package
Who gives a fuck if yo' ass look good
Fine bitches, you shit out of luck
You got do it all, not just send them all
Cook and cleaning, love a nigga's shitty drawers
Naw, I'll keep you flossin up at Ready Tellers
The kinda shit that make them other bitches jealous
Pull up, jump out, I'm like new money
And watch the bees in the house come and get the honey
Ri-ride through the hood
Ride through the hood
Ri-ride through the hood
Ri-ride through the hood
Ri-ride through the hood
Ri-ri-ri-ride through the hood
<O'Shea! O'Shea!
Get your ass in here, boy
You hear me calling you?
When I was young I used to hang with the seventh graders
Little bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders
Fucking with the girls in the fourth grade
Either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids
Walking with the schoolhouse bully
By doing that, I had a lot of pull, G
Cheating on tests, making a mess
Cussing like a sailor at recess
It must a been a half moon
'Cause you'll catch me running out the little girls' bathroom
Chewing on Good and Plenties
Got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies
Yo I was living like the class clown
Pulling all the hokes, making all the jokes man
When you young it's hard to see
That it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD
Popping out your window with a BB gun
Better yet knocking on your door and run
Playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank
Even though I was still shooting blanks
As soon as the dark hit
I was stealing candy out the corner market
Until I got my ass whipped
'Cause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit
Thirteen, that's how old I was
When my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz
And I was looking at any butt and ass
Me and my homies started cutting class
Going up to the high school
Looking for any bitch I could lie to
Tell 'em I was older than I really was
Smoked my first joint and got really buzzed
That's what a mack's made of
But when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love
Hard as a rock the long way
And then I put the rubber on the wrong way
But I still gotta have it
Overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit
Goddamn I was hot
A virgin but I still knew how to lay pipe
Even though the hoe worked me
I still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
Then the shit got strange money
I started shaking and jimmy felt funny
Then the nut came gushing
I jumped up got dressed and start pushing
'Cause I thought the bitch broke my dick
'Cause I was still young doing dumb shit
At 17 got my first Volkswagon
And mastered the life-long art of dragging
To the women in college
Hung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge
Breaking in cars and all that
Hitting punk fools with a baseball bat
Fucking at a real fast rate
Till they said that I might not graduate
Then I said fuck the dumb shit
Cause Pops'll fuck me up quick
If things continued
So I start rapping about shit I been through
And I got real good
Now I look at all the kids in the neighborhood
Trying to be baby macks
Doing shit that I did seven years back
Going through a stage
But before they can grow up they on the front page
And they mommas is having a fit
'Cause they died young doing dumb shi
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
No, that's the old style
In ninety-deuce, shit ain't quite the same
Bitches gotta brand new game, yo
It's kinda hard to see
But the dating game ain't what it used to be
Back in the day, if a ho wanted ya dough
She give you a piece of ass and there we go
Go and get knocked up and then get socked up
You be broke and locked up
But the news done hit
Bitches all over on some new improved shit
To y'all macks
Come to find out that bitches are pullin jacks
I remember every night all you had to worry about
Was gettin' caught at a red light
And the nigga gettin' ya five, day to days
Now shit done changed
'Cause you gots to watch the ones in the skirt
And it ain't about gettin' burnt
I know it sounds strange, but could you
Stop thinkin' with ya dick for a change
'Cause you'll get a bullet in your brain, mr rich
And about that bitch, don't trust em
They try to catch a dumb nigga in the act
You came to the club, stepped to the bar
And pulled out a wad of doves
After you got buzzed, she walk by
You saw how big her ass was
Got her on the dancefloor
And she started dancin like a ho
Jimmy got stiff, she ain't have a ride home
So you gave the bitch a lift
She didn't wanna trouble you
But hopped her big ass in your bmw
Hopped to her house and started kissin'
And jimmy just wouldn't listen
'Cause you got real horny
And that ain't cool at four in the morning
Started undressing the ho
Got to the drawers and the ho said no!
Not on the first date
It's gettin' kinda late, could you come back at eight? 
You said yeah! 'cause you thought you met a wholesome ho
But nigga, she know you rollin' in some dough
And you'll regret and somethin' 'bout a bitch you just met
Don't trust em!
Eight o'clock on the dot, nigga's hot
Dick hard as a rock
Straight on a solo creep
Can't wait till her little boy go to sleep
So you can seduce the g
Bust a nut and make an excuse to leave
You got her worked out 'cause you the man
But the bitch got diff'rent plans
She said take off your clothes, jump in the bed
While she powder her nose
You get butt naked, 'cause you ready to wreck it!
'Cause you's a motherfuckin punk, next thing you know
The door flies open with a blast
With four niggas in ski masks
Pointin a gun at the pimp
You're scared as a motherfucker and jimmy done went limp
They beat you down just a taste
Take ya to your house and make ya open up the safe
Drove you far, tied up in the trunk of your own fuckin' car
Take you out and pop the cap
I told you the bitch was a trap
Don't trust em!
Damn
I'm broke
My feet hurt
And that bitch is slippin'
It makes me wanna - creep
It makes me wanna - creep
Damn, I'm such a G it's pathetic
Here comes the big-headed nigga that's dippin'
Sippin' on Courvoisier
Goddamn, I must have the floss today
Now pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary
So I'm chasin' bitches like Tom chased Jerry
I'll put the pedal to the flo'
In my two-tone Ford Explo-a
You know how it's done
Sounds bumpin' ain't that somethin'
Jumped on the 110
She's flyin' in the Blazer
Like, Go Speed Racer, but I ain't gonna chase her
Like Racer X, but I don't flex
'Til it's time to have sex
So when you wanna get togetha?
'Cause you know a nigga like me is down for whatever
And I'm down for whatever
When I was little, I didn't wanna be like Mike
I wanted to be like Ike 'cause
Papa was a rollin' stone in the '60s
And he liked green just like Bill Bixby
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty
Pockets never skinny
Played let's get it on in the living room
And when he gets drunk better give him room
'Cause he'll turn the party out
Sayin' This is my motherfuckin' house
And y'all gots to go through the door
And if you can't find the door
He'll help you with the 4-4
Talkin' much shit on the grass
And straight down to blast
I'm still in my P.J.'s
He's in a turtleneck sweater
And we down for whatever
And I'm down
Solid pro is down for whatever
The Don Jagwar is down for whatever
And it don't seem to stop
Now, I don't talk a lot of shit
But when it's time to get busy with these hos, let's go
'Cause I'd rather see a skinhead dead
Than my niggas wearin' blue or red
'Cause I got the gift to hit them hos swift
And I'm smellin like a fifth of somethin'
Yeah, that's right
I'm standin' in the store
Koreans act so nice
'Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchell's
Donut and you know what?
I'm cool like dat like Digable Planets
But don't take a nigga for granted
'Cause, whether it's a verdict of the L.A. Four
You just don't know
That this rappin'-ass nigga will change with the weather
And be down for whatever
And I'm down - creep
And I'm down for whatever
Bumpin' in your Jeep
Ice Cube - devoid of pop
And I will never dance for you trick-ass niggas
It makes me wanna - creep
It makes me wanna - creep
Supreme gangsta shit
We dream gangsta shit
{Rain pouring} Yes {electric shock, beaker tingling}
Yes {knock on dorr}
Yeah what is it? {continual knocking on door}
Yes, I'm straight, go to bed {thunder claps}
{Animal screams} Yeah! Yeah!
{Woman screaming} It's ALIVE!
{Ice Cube}
It's pourin rain, thunder and lightning
Clash of the titans, I'm home writin
Gangsta rap has arrived, I'm the only man alive
October 31st, 1985
Hard times, just got harder
Adolescent Ice Cube, the shit starter
A martyr, thanks to the father
For bein this mean as sixteen raps, feel like the bitch scream
You learned about your triple beam from me
You stopped payin' for pussy and hit that ass for free
A little G never thought, that I could change the world
Witta attitude, a Raider jacket and a jheri curl
Got every girl wantin to do me, screw me
Boyz N The Hood, the first rap, the first movie
So whatchu gon' do 24-7, 3-65
Dr. Frankenstein
Dr. Frankenstein
{Mr. Short Khop - x2}
Ooh wee, it's alive
You better run and hide
Cover your ears and your eyes
{Ice Cube}
The world had to bow to this new style
Dial 9-1-1, makin' more money than the law allow
But Fuck Tha Police, they can get deez
Now who was sayin' shit like that before me?
No-body, but everybody wanna take the star's place
And be Scarface in the car chase
Illigitimate, counterfeit
Even got white boys talkin' shit off the shit I invent
No no, motherfuckers musta took a photo
Tryin' to call my gangsta shit 'mafioso'
But who ya usin'? Fool it ain't no solution
To the evolution, of pimps and prostitution
I cuss, skanlous, I give a rush
To niggas who mind turn to mush, smokin' on brush
Hush, I'm just a lush for this Hen
Chrome electroids, connected to my pen
When, blowin' motherfuckers ain't knowin' what we goin' through
Spiritually, lyrically showin you
They call me, 'AmeriKKKa's Most Hated'
Gettin' liberated by this monster I created
Dr. Frankenstein
{Mr. Short Khop}
We love to bump you Frankenstein
Yo' shit is the best
Take my body and my mind
Don't fuck with the stress
Hit me with that game to win
If you want, hit me again
We love you Frankenstein
We love you Frankenstein
{Ice Cube}
Now how many times did a nigga have to warn ya?
It's outta hand, 'cause sucker ass niggas like you
Try to pay the rent off my blueprint
New cent to the industry
You thought my shit was biodegradable, uh uh, it's unfadeable
Unstoppable, runnin' through your suburbs
Incredible thug words
We gets down, nigga do the Monster Mash
And watch a nigga like me collect monster cash
'Cause I'm sittin' wit this bitch who got monster ass
Keep 'em wonderin how long the Don will last
And never pass, and when I want it buttered on toast
Can't no nigga see Ice Cube on no coast
So all you gotta do is focus
And see that I'm the fuckin' loccest with this hocus pocus
Dr. Frankenstein
Dr. Frankenstein, ugh
{Mr. Short Khop - x4}
Ooh wee, it's alive
You better run and hide
Cover your ears and your eyes
This ain't Sinatra
This ain't the Carter
I am the chaperone nigga who brought'cha
I am the author... this is Holy water
From the Holy Father the Rock of Gibraltar
Step up to the alter step up to the slaughter
Get circumsized son and turned into a daughter
Nigga know they oughta drink the fuckin' kool-aid
Industy laid out authorities are too late
MC's passed the due date nigga as they do hate
You are Bobby Boucher I'm the Mane like Gucci
I rock the Louie but not like Kanye
Nigga see me kinda like Harry Belafonte
Step into the room they be like ah Day-O!
Yeah 'cause they know a nigga ain't play-doe
Shots all fatal is this Laredo
Boarder town I knock'em down just like legos
Drink the Kool-Aid!
I ain't the Doctor
This ain't the patient
This ain't that nigga always on vacation
This ain't no white boys rehabilitation
This is crazier then a boat full of Haitians
This is inflation mixed with degradation
This ain't no dead rappers reincarnation
I heard it was a New West Coast I ain't worried
I murder more stars then Conrad Murray
I got more bars then the penitentary
I wrote this shit without a rhyme dictionary
Young bucks try to step up to the harim
Looking for some pussy I'm a old buck I dare'em
Drink the Kool-Aid
Peace - don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' sucotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
How the fuck do you figure?
That I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?!
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
'Cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me 'cause there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside...
You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh
'Cause we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine
It was plain and simple
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucka'
The shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
It's a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside...
Standing in the middle of war
In the middle we flex
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, 'cause I'm comin' from the coroner
Sayin' my rhymes with a Ph.D.
Who's black - don't wanna role - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin'
Who the fuck are they foolin?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder what's under my waist
That's a fact got a fear on their bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
Yet Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!
Peace - don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' sucotash

Every January 16th, it's the dreamer, the dreamer.
And all of you say, i have a dream; the dreamer.
And what did he dream? it stuck him right there.
And little black boys, and little white girls
Will one day hold hands together.
Shit.
Is that where it's at? is that where it's at now?
Them little blacks hands are yours.
You can't hold the black brothers' hands?
But you gonna grow old holdin' crackers' hands
Before you hold each other's hands?
You gonna walk with your enemy
Before you learn to walk with one another?
How sick can you be?
Where you gonna go when the brothers wanna bust a shot
Where you gonna go when I wanna kill bloodclot
Supercat said that the ghetto red hot
Bust a gloc, bust a gloc, devils get shot
Nappy-headed, no-dreded look where ya read it
Buck the devil, buck the devil, look who said it
Listen what I say after 1995 not one death will be alive
God will survive, him protect the civilized
Who really cares if the enemy lives or dies?
Not me, not me
Me never eat from the tree with the apple
I'd rather have a snapple
Do you know where you're going to
Do you know where you're runnin' from
Scared of the sun, I live in the sun
You shrivel up like a raisin
And burn like the blunt that I'm blazin'
Ku klux klan scared of my nutty beats
Cause them nutty beats equal bloody sheets
Out number you somethin' like 15 to 3
See, don't love your enemy
Enemies, enemy runnin' from the g

Where you gonna run when God wanna do ya?
J. edgar hoover, I wish I woulda knew ya
With the boom ping ping is the ring from the fire
Me not afraid, cause me know elijah
Goin' to the east but straight from the westside
Swing down sweet chariot nad let me ride
Through the fire, through the fire that will please us
I know that farrakhan is your baby Jesus
Devil don't you know I'm a soldier?
In god's name and the baby claim I'm gonna hold ya

You don't care if me die from the cracka
You don't care if me have a heart attacka
You don't care if me get car jacka
You don't care 'cause you're nothing but a cracka

When God give the word, me herd like the buffalo
Through your neighborhood, watch me blast
Tribe of shabazz, get in that ass

Tried to get a rent a car
But he laughed when I showed him cash
Had to mash 'fore he called the feds on my ass
Went to vegas for the weekend

Countin' money, eatin rats, gettin' pussy all day
All I do is lean back, still makin' greenbacks
All I do is lean back, still makin' greenbacks
Still makin' green, still still makin' greenbacks
All I do is lean back, still makin' greenbacks
Haters get mad 'cause I'm still makin' greenbacks
I'm a fat cat, look at me, stomach like a Volkswagen
Still I can handle my, business got these hoes braggin
They wanna throw me out - but they bet' not touch me
Is this nigga fuckin' crazy, or is he just lucky?
Actin' like he own the place, y'all niggaz best to rendezvous
This nigga ain't no pussy y'all, this kind of cat all he came to do is
People wanna know how I make that money
Momma Ice Cube didn't raise no dummy
This fat cat don't chase no mice
Hoodrats think they can live off Ice
Enemies think I'm finicky, nigga be
Walkin' 'round here like a Kennedy
Tend to be, movin like a centipede
Y'all muh'fuckers still just Little League
Now I know when the haters get mad, I'm doin' my job
Some niggaz can't dunk till you throw them a lob
Better go find, another one to rob
You just a role player this my squad
You get Lenched, this my Mob
Ain't that I, you a facade
All in the alley, lookin' through the trash
I'm a fat cat, lookin' through the glass
You know it ain't no stoppin' all tha doggs I'm droppin'
It's Friday night, so everythang is poppin'
I got skin, let's spin on da hand
So let tha games begin
Yakity yak, don't jump back or it's on
Callin' up Earl on tha car phone
Mack 10 just got out of court
Rollin' through tha hood in his super sport, ropin' Too Short
Eighteens got tha rearview mirrors vibratin'
And deep dish daytons
You know how we do it
Ain't nuttin to it but tha floss
Overcrowdin' Harrison walks
'Cause if ya fuck wit ours
We leave scars
Out of g ride cars
Livin' like stars
Might hit tha highway
On tha Vegas run, fool, 'cause it's Friday
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in tha air
If ya don't care
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in tha air
If ya don't care
Standin' outside on a Friday, livin' on tha edge
'Cause we all got 'dem hard heads
It seems like we all are waitin
For a drive-by, playin' tag wit Satan
But we chillin', yeah, we ready and willin'
Ya hear about tha latest Westside killin'
Forty sippin'
Set trippin'
Fo' dippin'
Get tha grip in
Neva slippin'
BG's tryin' tah hang out
But OG said, take ya little ass in tha house
My big homey just got out
Used tah be down, now he's just crack ad
He's 'bout hard as Darth Vada
In his sweatshirt, khakis and Chuck Taylors
Just see him in the driveway
Gettin' beat like a smoka fool, 'cause it's Friday
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in tha air
If ya don't care
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in tha air
If ya don't care
Why must I be like dat and chase da cat
Or settle for a hoodrat
Dookie braids no dreadlocks
Flyin' in and out of jail, have a chicken and a cock
And I love her 'cause she down
Tah fuck around wit tha underground pussyhound
And her ass is big, round and wide
Jacked up, makin' nigga down tah ride
Smokin' indo
Playin' dat Super Nintendo
Hear a rat-tat-tat on my window
Gave her ass dat pelvic thrust
Don't trust tha rubber 'cause it's bound tah bust
In tha oven in tha nappy
I had on two, so I was happy
'Cause dat hiv'll make ya dick hang sideways
And dat ain't cool, fool, 'cause it's Friday
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in tha air
If ya don't care
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in tha air
If ya don't care
Throw tha West Side in da air
Throw tha East Side in da air
Throw tha South Side in da air
Throw tha North Side in da air
Oh yeah
Please, welcome O'Shea Jackson better known as Ice Cube!
How you doin'?
Good to see you.
Well known that the Crips and the Bloods are allegedly coming together.
Yeah, you've been alot in the media lately than other rappers, we'd mentioned earlier Cube, that uhm...
You know? You have been labelled a lota thing.
Or anti-careerist?
It's probably the reason why they say that it's beacause some of the lyrics were...
Aimed at the women, bitches and hoes, and all that.
I wanna talk a little bit about that, too.
So and brothers, uhm... folks walkin' around, totin' guns, uuuuhm...
All that kinda stuff, do you think that sometimes those images and those lyrics...
I-I speak... in a perpective as uh... brothers on,..
What we need to do is look in the mirror.
I-I, I do want the white community to understand our community more...
And see what's going on, and see what, what uh... the things they've done to us in the past...
Are still affectin' us now... mentally, you know?
And,.. the reason I said it's because, I mean everything I said about, uh, uuuhm... you know?
Anything you want to know about the riots...
Was in the records before the riots! All you had to do was go...
To the Ice Cube library and, and, and...
Pick a record and it would have told you.
You know? I've given warnings...
So in other words, it's almost like a... war-warning or prophecy?
I-I've, I've given...
I've given so many warnings on what's going to happen.
If we don't get these, uuh...
These, these things straight in our lives, the clashes the-then, you know?
This here...
These words all about money.
Fuck Dying
Ft. Korn
Ice Cube
Ice Cube!
That's Don Mega to you you lil' cocksucker
I am the Angel of Death
And your name is on my list
Sheeyit!
Come with me...
I ain't goin' nowhere wit yo' ass
And if you put your hands on me, we gettin' down right here
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army!
Join the party, I can provide the army!
Join the party, I can provide the army!
Come and hear the voice of the man they call the Trojan Horse
Ride on the outside, with inner force
Throw you off course, of course, you missed the runway
We mash, like the first kickoff, on a Sunday
Collisions, divisions of niggaz, down to listen
And when we on the mission, call your mortician
Join the party, I can provide the army!
First we flank 'em then we spank em... I outrank em!
You can call me Citizen Kane, for my reign
Ten years great, one of the ten great
Mr. Media, look inside your encyclopedia
2002, see Ice Cube
Fuck a five-star, I'm a live star
What you got to die for? Who you wanna ride for?
It's the suspect king of the roughnecks, bonafide
Worldwide, your highness, the finest
Big as China, nigga rhymer, chart climber
Quick to send a first-timer back to his Aunt Jemimah
Physi-cal, nigga roll with the winners
After these dinners, go out and represent us
We got antennas, scanners and satellites
To see if you battle right, we got to bite
Hold on tight, shake, and pump venom
Some haters don't learn till you leave lead in em
See the dead in em, rigarmortis spread in em
Keep your mouth shut, motherfuckin mouth slug
See these crossed legs, quick to cross Feds
Foe to mighty one, it's the mighty son
Yeah...
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army!
Join the party, I can provide the army!
Join the party, I can provide the army!
Man, what's up with these niggas out here
Mad at us 'cause we on top
I love to see niggas gettin' money
Better get it while the gettin' is good
Get it while you can, man
And stop hatin' me, fuckin' with my shit, 'cause I got more hustle than you
Get yours, get yours, baby
I'm seeing millions, niggaz don't understand
Nnow what? I'm makin' moves, puttin' cash behind plans
To blow up, will he style like this
Every day, I parlay, sip Henne and Tanqueray
Stay in the mix like Alezay
V.I.P., my shit parked valet
On the prowl again, to get honeys familiar with the smile again
Some try to assault Dre, it's still cavi
I'm eatin' steak while they struggle to break the slave mentality
I givin' livin' definition long as my hearts tickin'
I fought and made the world listen
Whatever fly Dr. Dre invented
Turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on sixty inches
I push a Rover, shit platinum before the session's over
Rap master with the Houston heat holder
These playas best to get they shit in check
'Cause when I get my hustle on, ain't no playin' with a full deck
Burn 'em at a thousand degrees
And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese
Burn 'em at a thousand degrees
And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese
Buck the whole world
Meant that, gotta stay strapped
'Cause ninety-nine a niggas, carry they gats
Super fist fightin' shit might come down to dyin'
When the time comes down for the tryin'
I got nine reasons why niggas shouldn't step in my face with the nonsense
'Cause I'm always heated, and you can taste this
Audi little something out the seams a my trousers
With no hesitation, I got a team to come clown ya
I down ya, so let your people know what they face
With the type of individual that'll bomb a sub-station
Kaboom, and everybody dies outside
There ain't no escapin' the Reaper, so don't try
Go ahead, close ya eyes, who the next to step?
Face down, hit, bleedin' on the steps o' death
Check yo self, you just been invaded by true soldiers
Burn 'em at a thousand degrees
And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese
Smokin' weed I never trail, I lead
Spendin' dough, tripped the cost of a ride like it was pocket money, Gs
But these are the things real playas do
Talkin' shit is real things that the hatas do
I'm namin' you
Shit's thick, it's time to run for shelter
I kept the word, things could happen to marks like it was helter skelter
Dear diary, I'm runnin' outta pages
Fadin', in and out, takin' purple hazes
The dazes, Revelations in the last stages
Red skies institute, the silent horns playin'
I'm prayin' with tears in my eyes
'Cause I'm tryin' to make it into eternal peace without dyin'
But they eyein' my bank account with beams on my Rover
Burn 'em at a thousand degrees
And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese
Blame me
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R.A.W R.A.W
You lookin' at the grand wizard
War lord vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothing like a man that can do wha he wanna
Ain't nothing like man on that you knew on the cornna
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up westside California
Nigga I'm hot as phoenix Arizona
Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain you a lieutenant
I can say what I want to say
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle Just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Ya spit saliva and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta and why should I change that
But aren't you the same cat
I'm tryin' to get me a Maybach
How you muthafuckas gonna tell me don't say that
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971
So if I act like a pimp
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy headed hoe
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin' 'bout real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain not your back use your brain not a gat
Don't be scared of them people
And don't be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot vaness and imperial
Look at my life Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't got to be fake cause He is my homie
If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow
You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow flow flow
You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow
It's R.A.W R.A.W
Oh yeah and another thing for all y'all niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talkin' about gangsta rap
Cause 9 times at of 10 you don't know the fuck you're talkin' about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
And stay the fuck out of mines
Hey muthafuckin' cube, what the fuck's wrong with you?
You didn't kick the rest of that gangsta fairytale shit.
Why don't you kick it one good time.
Niggas on the playground wanna know what's happenin'.
You left 'em hangin' man, what the fuck?
Little boy blue is outta folsome
Now them three little pigs gotta roast him
Drivin' down sesame street and I bet
That little muthafucker's out fuckin' smurfette
Ain't saw the wolf yet, but it's no doubt
They'll catch his ass slippin at his grandma house
They got the MAC-10 pointed out the coop
'Cause they gotta follow they nose like fruit loops
Peeped out little miss muffet on her tuffet eatin grits
She saw the MAC-10 and the bitch had the shits
Ran into her house, called up her crew
Cause red riding hood wants to kill little boy blue
And the wolf too, what is mister rogers doing?
Moved out his jordan, bought him a ewing
Him, little boy blue and the wolf in the cellar
Planning on gettin' cinderella
Cause cinderella still works for the pigs
Through with the dwarfs, doin' bebe's kids
Now snow white got the horny ass fever
Doin' the beauty's beast like jungle fever
Now the word's on the street
When the crews meet
You better make alot of room
'Cause it's on with the pigs and them other nigs
When the cow jump over the moon, everybody jump.
Now little boy blue is up front
With the nine millimeter, ready for the hunt
Little red riding hood caught his ass slippin'
Drew down on the boy cause the bitch is steady trippin'
About to get loose with the deuce deuce.
That's when the boy said, What about the gang truce?
The little hoe had no words
The wolf came around and the bitch got served
Three little pigs bought wigs
Dressed like sheep, cinderella is little bo peep
Tryin' to creep, on the crew
The wolf, the rogers, the blue, they through
Cause the pigs did the buck buck bang, ping
Now you hear the fat lady sing
Cinderella ran like a trick
To the pay phone cause the bitch is still a snitch
Now the pigs are caught by the pigs and taken
In the pen to get fried like bacon
You still can't trust no hoe
And ice cube'll tell the kids how the stories, should go.
Yeah cube, man that shit was dope nigga.
You all that and a bowl of grits.
Nigga that shit was on props, nigga.
Yeah that's how you kick that shit for the ninety-deuce, nigga.
What's happenin' nigga?
Yeah nigga that's gangsta fairytale part 2 nigga.
All you trick ass niggas can't fuck with it.
Yeah
Gangsta
I still got the recipe, South Central LA is the pedigree
Don't try to tell me what it better be, I'll have your ass up in physical therapy
I'm outlaw like a Cherokee, the rap industry tried to bury me
But if I die on the mic up in Larabie I'm so heavy you bitches couldn't carry me
I don't accept no disrespect only thing I expect is self check
Just grin and bare it, got an ass whooping that your ass don't wanna inherit
Most rappers are parrots, they say what they told to say to get a neck full of carats
Got to run 'cause here comes the blob 'cause, Uncle Sam is like part of the Mobb
Break your self he'll take your wealth don't get it twisted u a muthafuckin' elf
And Santa Claus will go for self all you got is your balls and your health
Niggaz brag about what they got, but we don't own a skyscraper, now that's paypa
One generation from slums, happy for these little crumb... you little bums
You always talkin' bout some fuckin' rims or interior, that kinda shit will keep ya ass inferior
I'm tryina eat tomorro, not tryina hear 'bout the little bitty shit you ball
Nigga be quiet ain't shit private, everything for sale you can buy it
All this self snitchin', all this self tellin' muthafuckas going back to the watermelon
If you try to get wit me
Pull a four on the fifty
Fuck yo monkey ass up like bobby did whitney
Trigger fingers get itchy
When niggaz get bitchy
And they need they story told on Jerry or Ricki
Well you're green and you're iffy
I'm clean and I'm spiffy
If they lock me up today I'll be back in a jiffy
All my niggaz that's wit me
All my bitches are picky
To ride around that's right on time
Bitch you know it's tricky
Take a hit of the sticky
Everybody get tipsy
When we hittin that whisky
All my niggaz get pissy
Don't fuck wit no sissy
All we bumpin' is missy
If you know where I am motherfucker come get me
I'm a man out of mickey
All my niggaz love hickies
That don't go away till ya well in your sixties
All I'm wearin is dickies
Don't try to evict me
When we come to atlanta we gon re-open nickies
I'm a gangsta rap teacher, nigga you better know it
It's the don gotti Jr. slash motherfuckin' poet
Sit back and take notes while I spin like 100 spokes
My flow is razor sharp I'm comin' straight for ya throat
With that west coast gang bang
Watch him when his chain hang
East coast down south
Niggaz do the same thang
Throw up ya dubs like wutang who bang
Harder than that nigga barrellin' through ya hood wit two chains
Swangin' like he's nuts, 'cause he don't give a fuck
I know nigga that ain't bangin' in no khaki's or some chucks
It's that westside, connected with that nigga who flow so wreckless
He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I bet this
Motherfuckin' coast ain't got shit after me
Ain't have shit before Cube except a Dub C
The mack circle is back with mad purple in fact
I'm bout to join the Lynch mob that's me squirtin' the mack
Nigga, some don't think I can flow, so here we go
To a new track, to show the wack, that I can throw
Styles that show up, I blow up and blast here
Niggaz still trippin' off the shit I said last year
About a bitch is a bitch is a hoe is a slut
And I don't like niggaz on my nuts!
So I dedicate this one to the groupie
And the charlie, all on my snoopy
Brothers keep askin, ice cube yo when will you bust
They surround me and make a big fuss
Now I was taught, back on my block
That you don't ride on nobody's jock
For anything they do, fuck him and his crew
Unless, you were gettin' paid too!
I'm not saying this to diss each and every fan
Women you can ride, man be a man!
Shake my hand, and make it a firm shake
Say, whattup ice cube?  and then break
'Cause if you're hangin' there I'ma tell you loud and clear
Get off my my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here
Motherfucker, back up off me
I'm not signin no autographs, I'm not givin' no free t-shirts
And I'm not havin' none of this bullshit you're talkin'
Youknowhati'msayin?
I step into the club, to rub-a-dub
It seems like all the little hoes fall in love
With my money, cause yo about a year ago
I was just your ordinary average everyday crazy ass bro
But you know, I just can't be equal
'Cause they know, I know a lot of famous people
But to a one-night stand, there's no sequel
Here's the pickle, pretend it's a popsicle
See for a fat booty, I do damage
They think I'm a star, so I take advantage
It's just another ice cube groupie test
She's a hoe 'cause they knew her at the front desk
Told her to meet me, at the room 110
And the bitch showed up, with her boyfriend
I let him in, all he could do was grin
He had a camera, a t-shirt, a pad and pen
He said, yo ice cube, can you sign this? 
I only did it cause his bitch was the finest
She blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown
Like - how can we get rid of this clown?
Me and her sat down, he got a little jealous
Cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us
And he asked me question after question
It felt like a motherfuckin interview session
Then his girl got up, I heard the do' shut
And he was still there, swingin' from my nuts
I said, get the fuck out! and made it loud and clear
Get off my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here
I see me about ten mark ass motherfuckers fans
Knock on the door, talkin' about whassup?
Yo man, it was about a hundred and twenty dicks man
Niggaz start, niggaz comin' out of hotel rooms
Without no bitches!
They can get gaffled like they in a motherfuckin raffle
Punk ass
Yo, I respect the respectable
If your girl is all on my dick, check the hoe
Say, yeah that nigga he can rap fly
But you know, stars are up in the sky
Cause all I got is hard dick, and bubblegum
Just ran out my last stick is where I'm comin' from
I'm not tellin' you to diss mr. ice cube
Cause you know, I'm the one that can show and prove
Now groupie girls, I just make 'em wait
But the groupie boys, I can't tolerate
I hate it so much, I'ma start givin' stitches
To the niggaz that's starin' like bitches
'Cause I'm not a fairy, a mary or a faggot
Gimme the eye, I'll fly, and tag it
Now you see? jockin ain't healthy
Cause you think that I'm young and I'm wealthy?
With juice, so I see you try to run behind
But I'ma tell you punk, you gets none of mine
'Cause I was taught, see a fool, use a fool
By the niggaz who terrorized the old school
So don't try me or buy me a beer
Nigga, some don't think I can flow, so here we go
To a new track, to show the wack, that I can throw
Styles that show up, I blow up and blast here
Niggaz still trippin' off the shit I said last year
About a bitch is a bitch is a hoe is a slut
And I don't like niggaz on my nuts!

So don't try me or buy me a beer
Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood like everybody from the hood is up to no good.
You think all the girls around here are trickin' up there lookin' like Superchicken
At night I see your light through my bedroom window But I ain't got shit but the pad and pencil
I can't wait till I hear you say I'm going down, mayday, mayday. I'm gonna clown
Cause every time that the pigs have got me y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi
Military force, but we don't want ya standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher
So fly like an eagle. But don't follow us wherever we go
The shit that I'm saying, make it's heard Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird
Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird
Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird
Now... My homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex
And let me try the four next Now the four I was driving was hotter than July
Looked up and didn't see it whippin' in the sky Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom
Calling all cars, I think we've got em. I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood
I think I drove through every single hood South Central, Compton and Watts
Long Beach, bust a U, here come the cops Wish I had a genie with about three wishes
Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious You know that I'm running
Shit, I hear it humming Fuck, I see it coming
Is it a bird? Yup Is it a plane? No
I hit me a right on El Segundo Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala
Let's see if they would folla me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another
Met me a baby pitbull and his mother Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window
I wish it was my ten-four had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third
'Cause I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird
Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back
On. Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115
Miles an hour, with the police chasing him. Ehm, they're not gonna be
Real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh...
Ehrr, they hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse.
Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't wanna see him could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?
See, I didn't want to bank you but don't make me bank you, thank you
Tried to get yo the hood, and you might guess that a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle Saying, Fuck, where did he go?
I bust me a left from Rubellon. Park The 735 and I'm bailin'
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man, She helped me run like Harriet Tubman
Looked out the window by the black bed I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face I close the blinds 'cause I didn't wanna catch a case
All that night, I heard the bird circle while I was eating fish and watching Urkel
She said I could sleep on the couch By two A.M. I was digging her out
Fuck the ghetto bird
Which way is he going now? Ok, now... now he's... he's actually southbound... on a service street...
And, uh... Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure
Out which service street he suddenly turned off on. Uh, the sheriffs are... are... well I know that...
Sheriffs ground units got thrown off
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird
Life...
Niggas used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy,
Pass the hennessy it gives me energy,
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at I clear the whole pack,
Talkin' shit 'cause I'm down for my set I'm a vet
Smokin' on a wet cigarette
I start bustin' and they scatter like water bugs
'Cause these westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothin' can save us from sportin' Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors,
Hot rocks fly from the back seat, and
Busta ass niggas run like a track meet
Killer king is the hospital
Feelin' numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit black mothers have fits I don't give a shit
Fool I'm a vet you can bet that
Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there
My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning takin' out the trash
Feelin' like a loser alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
Are you from the westside is it so?
In slow mo fo' fo' slugs face down in the mud
Puddle full of blood left for dead
The pain starts to spread now I can't feel my legs
I meet doctor who at King Drew medical center
As I enter I.C.U.
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to
Now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holdin' this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube
I be pissin' through a tube Fool I'm a vet
Fool I'm a vet you can bet that
Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair
Fuck a V-A they need G-A
Gang hospital for a crippal now I'm drinkin' rippal
Same corner same hood I'm still there
With bandanas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hoodrat hoes I'm fired
They mad 'cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody wanna put they dope on me
Sayin' I won't get searched by the LAPD
I'm sitting on a doorway duece five
Dependin on that to keep my ass alive
I don't got bows but my arm's about a one-six
My fuckin' legs, lookin' like tooth picks
Some times I can't deal got to beg the B G's to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch now I'm on the torch smokin' cocaine
Just to maintain nutin' to gain nutin' to lose
And last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom
Feelin' like a two year old you can't get a sip from the brew I hold
Nigga it's the only friend to a stranger AKA hadicap gangbanger
There's a lot in my life I regret becomin' a ghetto vet
Fool I'm a Vet
Fool I'm a vet you can bet that
Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair
Life...
Yeah...

For every nigga that done took one for the hood
Your daughter was a nice girl, now she's a slut.
A queen treatin' niggas just like King Tut.
Gobbin' up nuts, sorta like a hummingbird,
Suckin' up the Lench Mob crew, and I'm comin' third.
Used to get straight-As, now she's just skippin' class.
Oh my, do I love to grip the hips and ass.
Only 17, with a lot of practice on black boys' jimmys and white boy's cactus.
A lotta niggas like bustin' nuts in her teeth.
Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic,
That don't mean shit, 'cause she's givin' up the ass quick.
Quicker than you can say candy, the bitch is on my Snicker... and oh man she
Can take on three men built like He-Men;
Her little-bitty twat got gallons of semen.
Fourteen niggas in line ready to bang your
Pride-and-joy, I mean daddy's little angel.
Tell the bitch to get her ass out the house,
'Cause your daughter's known for givin' up the nappy dugout.
I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!
Mister, mister, before you make me go,
I'm here to let you know your little girl is a hoe.
Nympho, nympho, boy is she bad; get her all alone and out come the kneepads.
I know she's a minor and it is illegal,
But the bitch is worse than vanessa del rio.
Tell the fuckin' slut to please hurry up,
And wear that dress that's tight on her butt,
So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed,
Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead.
Face turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles.
Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes.
You should hear how she sounds with a cock in her,
Boots get knocked from here to czechoslovakia.
Two on top, one on the bottom;
First nigga got the boots, man, you shoulda shot 'im.
'Cause after I got 'em it was over. now niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover.
On daddy's little girl.
She keeps nuts in her mouth like the bitch was a squirrel.
So tell sheryl to bring her ass home,
'Cause the line at my house is gettin' loooooooong, and...
Nigga, you need to stop snitchin'
All that yip-yappin' and jaw-jackin'
Nigga, if you scared, go to church
You knew the job was dangerous when you took it
What up? It's the big boss Dogg
Snoop D O double G, Eastside L.B.C.
And I'm bobbin' to the beat of my O.G. homeboy Ice Cube
And I'm C-walkin' on the muthafuckin' concrete
Yo' if you're fucked up, put your cups up
Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg, nigga what's up?
See he's a gangster, I'm a hustler
Yo, it's either thank you, or it's fuck you
And if you walk by nigga, I'ma knock fire nigga
We can get it crackin' if it get to clickin' clackin'
Look at Mr. Jackson, nigga, with no reaction
If you scared, go to church, we gon' hit you where it hurts
That don't work, we'll put you in the dirt
And when you get that blowup, it make you throw up
When you realize your favorite rapper ain't got no nuts
Click clackin', pistol-packin', Crip raggin' folio
Who the only nigga in the club with the toolio
You ain't know? Yeah you did; there it was, there it is
Is that Coolio? Naw bitch, let me in
Jibba-jabba snatcher get at ya, spit at actors and rappers
Hang out with kidnappers and jackers
Make money off crackers; can you imagine how I keep shit crackin'?
It's the big boss Dogg, I'm back in action and smashin'
I flash with the bling I surpass the supreme
You don't really wanna have a clash with my team
I mix hash with the green I'm the, last of the kings
If I got a bitch with me, she got ass in them jeans
Rollin' through yo' neighborhood, my Cadillac so clean
Servin' all you suckers 'cause you all dope fiends
Just like that dopeman, nigga what's up?
You run up with that bullshit, I'll fuck yo' ass up
You scared, you scared
You scared motherfucker, you scared
You scared, you scared, you scared, you scared
You scared motherfucker, you scared, you scared
You scared, you scared
You scared motherfucker, you scared
You scared, you scared, you scared, you scared
You scared motherfucker, you scared, you scared
Eight for haters, Nine for the cause
Never question the size of Ice Cube's balls
Uh, gotta get it... uh... hmmm... get it, get it
--Baby--
Stab through the neighborhood, these spinin'
Weez winin', scrap with the John Lennon
Head rests, TV's in 'em
Best in the nation, on this playstation
The Don Daata, gotta get you hotter
Been a buck naked nigga smokin' water
On a Friday, the get high day
Blowin' at a hot date, findin' Shade
Black and bicantay, with ass everwhere, how you do that there?
A sight to behold, break the mold
Just tryin' to get some before the world explode
I see you tryin' to get caught
Well shake what your mama gave ya, plus what you bought
We fuck and we fought, we laugh and we cry
Told the truth and we lie
You be good to me, I'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and I'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--
You know you ain't right standin' at the light
Think it's chocolate with that shit too tight
And if I fuck around and get you in the car with me
Motherfuckers would think I had a star with me
Now see the haterism increase
They hate when you got a dime piece
And I got one shotgun, and I might catch a hot one
When I'm lookin' for love and niggas got none, uh
If you let me handcuff your wrist
Bonnie and Clyde ain't got shit on this
'Cause Bonnie and Clyde had to take a risk
But most of my money see it's all legit --baby--
It's all about your state of mind
Now what would you do if I handed you a tech nine?
Are you feelin' me?
Would you stay down like Hillary?
Even if you thought about killin' me?
You be good to me, I'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and I'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--
Are you the type of girl that would call them folks
Have your man leave the house in chains and ropes
Don't need the kind of girl that'll have me in court
On lawsuits lyin' about demestic abuse
Have a bitch like Judge Judy cussin' me out
Garnish my cheques, reposses my lex
'Cause I come from a place in southern Californi
Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni
But fuck the world don't aks me for shit
Unless you my boo, and I'm fuckin' you
The rest of these broads ain't knowin'
That I'm a have you bumpin' Lauryn, in somethin' foreign
Come through blow the horn
Stick your wrists out the window
And wave to your kinfolks
Let 'em know who you with
And to your crazy ass daddy, let him know who to get
You be good to me, I'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and I'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--
{Repeat last 3 lines, 4 times}
Now, if the greenbacks don't stack large on my side of the yard
I ain't fuckin' with it
This cake has got to be all icing baby
Now I know I'm taking the biggest piece
But God damn I'm the biggest fish with the biggest mouth bitch
Well stick with me, do as I does, and be as I be
We be stackin chips, packin clips, mackin chicks
Makin' hoes, take these clothes, from these sto's
Walkin' slow, there go the po', now here we go
Parking lot to the spot, marriott
'Cause what I got to make a knot, is very hot
Who's at the do', go and check, I got the tec
Tell him that you soakin wet, until he jet
Now lift up your fuckin' dress, where's the rest
Bitch can hide a treasure chest, in her breasts
Uh-huh strip search, whip skirts
Uh-huh shit hurts, but it works bitch
You can jerk niggaz but you can't jerk me
Hoe I only tell you once that this dick ain't free
I'm talkin' greed
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed
We smokin' weed, you and me
Lookin' for that currency
Now bitch niggaz don't mean shit, from where I sit
Magnificent blow your back out, if you act out
Eighteen deep when the plane soar
The bitch threw her tits asked my click who we pay for
Penetrate the clouds, loud, and obnoxious
Surround the airport with feds and helicopters
Escorted, detained and deported
Scared of the ly-rics, and when they bitches hear us
We the clear-est, you can fear us
Smile on the day of your disappear-ance, smoke in mirr-ors
Break 'em all, pull over and jump out
'Cause I can take 'em all, all bustas shake 'em all
I'm at the mall, buyin shit, like hot dog on a stick
These bitches all on the dick
And now you got to deal with the niggaz that I feed, greed
When you get your hands on it, wanna fawn it
Wanna dance on it, everybody want it
You punks is petty, still we steady, countin' fetti
I'm the one closin escrow, with the best flow
On everything counterfeit, the don mega
Blade runner, in a beige hummer all summer
It'd take about twelve honkeys, to convict
The nigga makin' you sick, ask the 12 monkeys
Up in detroit holdin' weed court, all through the south
Picked up a ounce in shreveport
To any motherfucker disgruntled exit wound, look like a funnel
Worldwide, international jet set
My niggaz love fuckin' bitches that they just met
Get it wet, and you can do anything
When I'm in paris niggaz French-kiss the pinky ring
Yeah, ice cube, trillionaire
I own a mansion and a yacht, haha
We do it like it should be does
Yeah, westside niggaz is very greedy, uh
Death row is very greedy
Sic-wid-it records is very greedy
Dangerous music greedy greedy greedy
Ruthless records greedy, suave house, greedy
Sosodef, greedy
Rap-a-lot greedy as fuck
No limit, hah, hella greedy, uh
Def jam greedy, we all know priority greedy as a motherfucker, hahaha
Hey I got twenties on my benz you still fuckin' with a gem
What can you tell me, nigga?
Ha ha, that's my shit
Uh, yeah
I hear a beat like this, and think about growin' up
House parties, with gangbangers showin up
Represent your hood, everybody throw it up
They say Cube get on the mic, nigga blow it up
I used to lyrical, political
But now you want it sugarcoated like cereal
Dr. Dre made me rap acapella
Me and Jinx did a show at Dudo's {?}
With K-Dee, I think it was two shows
Then Dre introduced me to E
Cruisin down the street in his red Jeep
He said, yo niggas we should flip it like this
Cause them Boyz N the Hood like the gangsta shit
I put the pen to the pad, young nigga was raw
And told the world how we felt about the law
It was real
I see the pain
Back down memory lane
Oh shit, it's B.W.!
Them niggas on tour and they comin' our way
Little one is still tucked away
In that trailer park, just bumpin our tape
Jerry Heller tried to make his escape
I had to bounce, while other niggas got raped
Same niggas turned around and said fuck me
No fuck you 'cause I'm down with Chuck D
And I'm 'bout to do a movie up, a classic
When I hit the screen, nigga it was magic
Never thought I'd see Eazy in a casket
Thanks for everythang, that's on everythang
I learned a lot of game from you
I like your son, he got his name from you
I tell him everythang that he need to know
If he ask my advice, I won't think twice homey
I see the pain
Back down memory lane
From Boyz N the Hood, to XXX 2
Everybody wanna know my next move
Fans all around say We love you Cube!
I wanna take time to say I love you too
I love all my fans 'cause they know I'm a man
And not a little boy or some fuckin' play toy
A lot of niggas say I grew up on you
And let me know if anybody fuck wit you
Cause you talk a lot of shit about the red, black and blue
And how they treat a nigga called Katrina, did you see her
White folks worry 'bout them fuckin' misdemeanor
While black people dyin' in that God damn arena
Just because I'm actin' nigga never stop rappin'
It's in my blood homey, I'ma keep the party crackin'
Money keep stackin till they put me in a casket
Who you think you fuckin' wit? Here's another classic
I see the pain
Back down memory lane
I'm Ruthless, I'm Ruthless...
Street Knowledge...
Lench Mob...
Westside...
Uh...
I see the pain
Back down memory lane

Here He Come lyrics by Ice Cube
I am the one, that you heard about, read about
I am the one, that had to take the ghetto route
I am the one, don't make me pull this ghetto out
I'm comin' straight from the cave who let him out
Crazy nigga thought he was gone, but he ain't gone
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home
When I hit the block, watch them scatter like roaches
So don't be fake, 'cause I know what a hoe is
Handle my business, no playin' 'cause I'm focused
You the definition of what a fuckin' joke is
When they see you comin', they play with your emotions
Fuck with my emotions and they find you in the oceans
Yeah I said oceans, yeah I mean plural
My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl
We'll fuck up your world, no boos to my drama
We'll include yo mama, if you fuck with my commas
I ain't tryin' to scary you
I ain't tryin' to hear you
I ain't tryin' to control that nigga in the mirror
I'll I'm tryin' to is bark before I fight
Before I take you down, might as well be polite
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come

A nigga for the people, where ever they go we go
Now when I roll through the hood, lil' kids watch my every move
Tryin' to be a good example, don't make me bury you
If you sit on my swagger, bitch take some carellflu
Don't underestimate the damage caused by a '22
Pop yo' ass right behind the ear within' hear
Nothin' like a firecracker, hits you like a linebacker
Don't forget the grind factor, I am a grinder
And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya
Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China?
Nothin' mothafucka just don't act like a vagina
You won't catch the rath of this hardcore rhymer
Now you got 55 niggas right behind ya
Now you wanna talk it out, but we don't negotiate
Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate
Straight from the west and we got to be respected
Here it's going down, here 'em runnin' for the exit
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come

Glitch Mob niggas takin' off like a spaceship
Pace those to Euros, eatin' those green and great chips
Get 'em by the bag, you can say we Feedo Lay chips
I'm so hungry that I can eat these niggas faces
Beat the plastic surgeons givin' Hollywood a face lift
Off the grape shit, and I'm feelin' like I'm faceless
The Mob you ain't in, nigga don't say shit
You ain't nothin' to play with, nigga I beat the basics
Cock and spray shit, quick to leave a nigga faceless
Playin' Superman, we get a brave nigga sprayed quick
Niggas can't fade this, music for the ages
Because we get it in like Young Crush
She be payin' big fishin'
In the water bitch you in the deep end
Boy I pull you deep in, underneath the deep end
Nigga have you sinkin', when I hear you creepin', hear you sayin'
I am the one, that you heard about, read about
I am the one, that had to take the ghetto route
I am the one, don't make me pull this ghetto out
I'm comin' straight from the cave who let him out
Crazy nigga thought he was gone, but he ain't gone
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home

Yo, I wanna get high
I wanna get high
Walking through campus with my backpack
Bailin' to orientation
So I can change the nation
See many faces but none of 'em mirror me
Show my ID to the punk ass security
Step on the quad, lookin' for the track squad
Walked by a bitch who think she's God
Passing me a flyer, talkin' 'bout the Messiah
She wanna take me higher
Keep your rhetoric in the heavens
Look and see a bro' with a fro like Michael Evans
Done spent 6 years in the college
Always telling me to question the knowledge
Sittin' in the black hole with the black stroll
And not even one cave bitch in our click
Sayin', fuck Professor Fitz
Don't like scholarships because they hurt me
Nothin' but a slave to the university
That's why ya see me on the track field run by ya
Caught by a liar who wanna take me higher
Shit, he wanna take me higher
Wait until they get a load of me, shit shit
I wanna get high, so high
Chocolate Thai
I wanna take flight, ya goddamn right
It's a party every fucking night
Been there for about six weeks
Walked by the freaks
Look, black greeks
How the fuck ya figure
I dig ya me bein' from niggafied nigga
White boy in the room with me
Who never saw BET, what the fuck
He's about to erupt and turn red
Start hangin' with the muthafuckin' skinheads
'Cause he can't deal with the overkill
College ain't nothin' but niggerville
And he regret that his school is filled
With niggers, jews and wetbacks
Plus chinks, now he drinks
Hour after hour, screaming white power
Motherfucker want me to call him sire
He wanna take me higher
Shit he wanna take me higher
Shit wait until they get a load of me
Shit shit shit
A girl gets date raped just like that
At a frat, now she chase the cat
Feminist saying women is God's gift
Do you need a lift, can I take a sniff
Do I sound sexist 'cause I'm chasin'
After Deja, she from Texas?
Down to kick the asses of the fascists
Who wanna put me in the oven and burn me to ashes
But I'm not burnin', the world keeps turnin'
And nobody learnin'
'Cause college is full of shit
Teachin' me to memorize nothin' but the lies
Chillin' at a rally for peace
The beast from white power up in the tower
With the M-1 gun and a scope on dope
Thinkin' he's the great white hope
Motherfucker levels off
He wanna see me six feet deep shoveled off
'Cause Columbus University is nothing but a empire
Who wanna take me higher
Shit they wanna take me higher
Wait until they get a load of me
Shit they wanna take me higher
They wanna take me higher
Unh damn, they wanna take me higher
Damn, wait until they get a load of me
Damn, unh, they wanna take me, they wanna take me

C'mon Cube let me rap on here
I'm, I'm just tryin' to sack somethin' up!
The hood mentality is a crippling disease
That attacks your nervous system, it makes you nervous of the system
Gangstas and hood rats are especially susceptible to this growth stunting mentality
The hood is where I'm from, but it's not what I am
The hood is where I'm from, but it's not what I am
Fuck school nigga, I'ma be a dope dealer
I'ma be a killa, yep, a urban guerrilla
I'ma stack scrilla, yeah, buy me a villa
Sell a 5-0 to my auntie Priscilla
I don't give a fuck that she look like thriller
Hit that shit one more time and fuck around and kill her
'Cause I got the heart of a pittsburgh steeler
Black nigga draped in gold, with a nine milla
Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary mail
Love the way these niggaz smell, keep comin' back, can't you tell?
Love to see my mama cry, love to see my babies struggle
Love to see my woman juggle nuts 'cause she got to hustle
I don't give a fuck how my life go
Now I'm a slave man to this caveman without geico
Everybody wanna call Michael a psycho
But he ain't never came through the hood with a rifle
Gunnin' niggaz down 'cause they don't got the right clothes
Hit the wrong person 'cause we shoot just like hoes
First I was blood thirsty, mr.-mr. controversy
Now I wanna beg for mercy, should have took my ass to berkeley
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?
Fuck school, nigga, if I grow a little taller
Everybody tell me I'm gon' do it, I'm gon' be a baller
So fuck that thinkin', fuck that thank and fuck them Lincoln's, I want franklin's
Come back through here with my crew, I'm gon' have my own shoe
I'm gon' be that little fool comin' in your living room
Starting point guard nigga, fresh out of middle school
Either it's the NBA or it's the NFL
I don't know what else I can do to keep my ass up out of jail
I wanna be like Tiger Woods, swing that club, make you sick
Leave this field, leave this prison, tell you motherfuckers where to kiss 'em
I wanna be all broke up, movin' all old and slow
I wanna be a alcoholic just like broadway joe
I wanna be a sideshow, kinda like Iron Mike
Used to have a few bentleys, now I just ride a bike
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?
Fuck school nigga, they ain't tryin' to educate me
All they give a fuck is what I memorized lately
I'm gon' have to teach myself, clock that money, get that wealth
I wanna be like santa claus, I don't wanna be no fuckin' elf
No kid left behind, but he get the run-around
Can't you motherfuckers see that they tryin' to dumb us down?
Don't trust the government, president is for sale
He don't give a fuck about a nigga, just a oil well
Sell crack, go to jail, bust a rap, go to hell
Do I got to sell my soul if I wanna go to yale?
Go kiss oprah's ass if you wanna be gail
I'd rather have my ass kissed up in bloomingdale
You can go be a pimp, you can go be a hoe
But you only gon' get paid off what you know
If you don't know shit, then you can't work for me
Cause you read your first book in the penitentiary
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

Man I ain't gon be shit in the morning after drinking that uh ...
...If I can sell you the American dream, I can sell you anything
I got to get out, I'm getting put out of my house
I got to pack up, my refrigerator and couch
It's a set up, but the bank wants me out
Or the L.A.P.D. will smoke me out
This suggestible weight, it choke me out
They gave me a loan and I had no clout
They gave me a house, for me and my spouse
Call my momma and my aunt,
Y?all should re-finance,
I let them dance with the devil,
Dig their own grave and I gave them the shovel
Fuck, my daddy built that house
And when he got drunk he almost killed that house
Is this the American dream, or the American scheme?
That got me walking in these American streets?
Its kinda sad when you have to get a hernia,
'Cause you help your grand mama move her furniture
If I can sell you the American dream, I can sell you anything
Look at this maggot, with a stimulus package
I can give a fuck about a dow jones average
What the fuck you do when your paycheck is average?
Law abiding citizen turn into a savage,
Got to feed the children, got to feed the habit
Fell into a rabbit hole, chasing that rabbit
Now I'm in wonderland feeling like the Son of Sam
I'm at your west coast branch, gun in hand
Imma feel like superman,
Walk by the teller, better call the trooper, man
Big bad wolf, we're sick of these scams
Sick of these plans, sick of this dance
Walk into his office took the nin out my pants
You're not a man, you're a servant
Then I pray to God nigga nine get to workin?
I never get the working
You know I heard they hood robbin?, your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
I never get the working
You know I heard they hood robbin?, your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
Uh, drug dealer envy
Doctor feel good, give you what you need
In California, prescribe that plead
Oxy cotton and codiene
Turn your grand mama into a fiend
I know you bout to die, but let me see your ID
I know you bout to lie, but can you pay this fee?
If you can't pay, then please have a seat
You can't see a doctor but you could see a priest
We can't save your life until we get some insurance
Your premium is paid, add that insurance
I hope you got endurance,
They got me on hold and I'm under the influence
Nurse high as a kite,
In charge with my life,
And everything is lost,
Without a blue cross
You know I haerd they hood robbin?, your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
You know I heard they hood robbin?, your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
You are the prince of darkness
Arch enemy, father of evil
Hell born, demonic, savage, fierce, viscious, wild
Tameless, barbaric, uncontrollabe, obstinate beast
Horny little devil, you gotta back up
Horny little devil, you can't bust a nut
Lookin' at my girlfriend's black skin
You wanna jump in, but she don't like white men
So don't throw that work you fuckin' jerk
Or get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker
She ain't with the pale face
Cause y'all fuck at a snail's pace
And you might get sprayed with mace
By the ebony
So when she's doing her job you better let her be
Don't try to pinch the gluterus
Thinkin' that you about to knock out the uterus
'Cause she'll tell you to kiss her ass quick
And where I'm from, devils get their ass kicked
Mr. Sexual Harrasment
Asking for a blow while the answer is fuck no
Looks like you wanna terminate
But that's when I go Psycho like Norman Bates
I wanna kill the devil for talkin' shit
'Cause he can't get a taste of the chocolate
African breast; cause white bitches got no butt and no chest
Black women have bodies like goddesses
Sorta like Venus, but put away your penis
Cause the devil is a savage motherfucker
That's why I'm lighter than the average brother
Cause you raped our women and we felt it
Cause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet
So horny little devil, you better listen
Before your ass comes up missin'
And it's like that
Now you wanna get me
Horny little must be a F-A-G
Tryin' to fuck me out my land and my manhood
Got broke eating Spam and canned goods
Locking down on my neighborhoods
Treat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand
But my ass is a virgin
You mignt have fucked the Indians
But you can't surgeon me
And when I'm on top I won't be fuckin' ya
I'd rather put a buck in ya
'Cause I hate the devil with a passion
And when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin
Dig a hole and throw his ass in
And I won't be happy till I'm down to my last ten
Get his fuckin' pitchfork
Tie him up, and then feed the bitch pork
Little devil wanna fuck me out my pay
But horny little devil true niggaz aren't gay
And you can't play with my Yo-Yo
And definitely can't play with me you fuckin' homo
'Cause we'll blow your head off
And turn that white sheet into a red cloth
Plus when they're all dead
I can quit that jheri juice and get a bald head
Then let it nap up
Go down to the corner store and beat the Jap up
Clean all the crap up
Out my city
Now the whole block look shitty
Put his dick on a wood block
Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop
Now who's the next to nut
Color Me Badd, but you can't sex me up
So don't even try to put a dick in a die
Because this is what why in 1991 I'ma get my gun
Put an end to the devil, so get a fucking shovel
And now, the wondrous world of..
Hey, come to Los Angeles!
You and your family can have peace and tranquility.
Enjoy the refinement..
Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?
Hello, my name is Elaine --
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles
A place where bustin' a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove compartment
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin' but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin' alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive
Hi this is Elaine again.
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles,
Or is somebody taking your things? Have you witnessed a drive-by?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again.
This is Los Angeles. This is Los Angeles.
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
'Cause it ain't nuttin' but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
'Cause most niggaz get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
'Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe
And you won't survive in South Central
Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin' like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
Punk motherfucker!
And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill
Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin'
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God damnit!
'Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a vice
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
'Cause South Central L.A., is one big yearn
Waitin' for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin' ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
'Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin' a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central
Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,
You tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out.
And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,
You know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke.
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit.
You'll sho' get got, just like that.
This ain't no joke motherfuckers.
Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer,
Puttin' his two cents in...
This is Los Angeles.
And now, the wondrous world of..

Imma get him, why? 'Cause I can't baby sit him
Imma whip him, treat him like bad ass children
Is it evil, y'all better call them people
How I get down, just ain't legal
Money long, sorta like Louis Vuitton
I run this shit right here, call me marathon
You a small donation bitch, I'm a telethon
West Coast million, what is he really on
Is it that shit that niggas go silly on?
And y'all know what I represent
And if you got a problem with that
And I be everywhere on the map but
I rep that dub, I rep that S, I'm a monster
West side, Lochness, I'm a problem
Matter fact, I'm a mess, Los Angeles, so scandalous
South Central, home of so much potential
But if you go there the warfare is mental
Bring your wheelchair you probably gon need it
Leave this motherfucker a paraplegic
N-ggas around the world that think they wanna bang
Iam too West Coast for the West Coast
Too Fresnos just to whip toast
Too soul food and burritos
Iam down with Angelinos
Go downtown and give a bum a C-note
This my town, I run it, you walk it
You just now learnin the game, I taught it
And if you got a problem with that
And I be everywhere on the map but
And if you got a problem with this
Let me know so I can add your fuckin' name on my list
All you West Coast DJs check your wrists

Imma play it on Banker, play it on Western
All of bad ass will make your head turn
Motherfuckers wanna take our style
And run that shit 3000 miles

This war show all at our place, damn
Can a nigga get a lil ol taste
Of some of that shine, it look like mine
And if you got a problem with that
And I be everywhere on the map but
Y'all know what it is
Is this too West Coast for you motherfuckers?
So what, sanctioned by the OGs of America
The Grand Wizard is a certified G
That mean genius bitch
That mean genius, bitch
I wanna kill sam
The army is the only way out for young, black
Teenagers.
We'll provide you with housing, we'll provide you
With education,
We'll provide you with everything you need to
Provide a life.
We'll help you to be the best soldier in the u.s.
Of a.
'Cause we do more before 7 a.m.
Than most niggers to their whole life time.
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
I wanna kill him, 'cause he tried to play me like a
Trick,
But you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck wit.
I got the a to the motherfucking k, and it's ready
To rip,
Slapped in my banana clip.
And I'm looking,
Is he in watts, oakland, philly or brooklyn?
It seems like he got the whole country behind him,
So it's sort of hard to find him.
But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth,
Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out.
'Cause the shit he did was un-called for,
Tried fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore.
And that shit ain't fly,
So now I'm setting up the ultimate drive-by.
And when you hear this shit,
It makes the world say damn, I wanna kill sam.
Momma, some man at the front door
Uhm hi, I've got reasons to believe that someone
In this household
Has just turned eighteen, am I correct? 
This is why I wanna kill the punk,
'Cause he tried to take a motherfucking chunk of
The funk.
He came to my house, I let 'em bail in,
'Cause he said he was down with the l.m.
He gave up a little dat,
Then turned around, and pulled out a gat.
I knew it was a caper,
Her.
Tied me up, took me outside,
And I was thrown in a big truck.
And it was packed like sardines,
Pull of niggers who fell for the same scheme.
Took us to a place and made us work,
All day and we couldn't have shit to say.
Broke up the families forever,
And to this day black folks can't stick together,
And it's odd, broke us down, made us pray to his
God.
And when I think about it,
It makes me say damn, I wanna kill sam.
Now in '91, he wanna tax me,
I remember the son of a bitch used to axe me.
And hang me by a rope till my neck snapped,
Now the sneaky motherfucker wants to ban rap.
And put me on the dirt or concrete,
But God can see through a white sheet
'Cause you're the devil in drag,
You can burn your cross while I burn your flag.
Try to give me the hiv,
So I can stop making babies like me.
And you're giving dope to my people chump,
Just wait till we get over that, huh.
'Cause your ass is grass 'cause I'm a blast,
Can't bury rap, like your buried jazz.
'Cause we stop being whores, stop doing floors,
So bitch you can fight your own wars.
So if you see a man in red, white and blue,
Getting chased by the lench mob crew.
It's a man who deserves to buckle,
I wanna kill sam 'cause he ain't my motherfucking
Uncle.
Well two bees in a bucket
Mother motherfuck it
You either flavor flav it
Or you chuck chuck chuck it
Kiss my ass or suck a d.i.c.-
K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me
I fucked that lady in the bed
I missed that pussy and I bust a spread
I tried it again in a thumping wagon
The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging
Tried it again and I failed to grasp
I missed that pussy and I bust my ass
Then I fucked this lady in the tree
The baby came out and said run-dmc
I knew this girl who looked just like you
Light brown and a fly hair-do
I wanted to do her, screw her
So I stepped to her
On-key bitch had more ass than a donkey
I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over
Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over
Just call me the plumber at the end of the night
Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe
She didn't get offended it was splendid to me
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be
I guess I just wine her and dine her
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her
Waxing that ass like rain dance
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her
Took her to the comfort inn
Tucked her in
Pulled out the third leg pumped it in
She said will you call me
Yeah I'll call you a bitch or a hoe after I ball ya
Naw I'm just playin' but it's still the same
Cause a nigga like ice cube is only out for one thang
I was free as can be white-black, I was free to be equal to anyone.
Listening to you, you are so precious I just can't believe it! I am shocked! Your scaring me!
What is he saying that you have a problem with?
What is he saying that you have a problem with?
What scares us is I think we hear violence.

I'm so scared to go around the world next year, because I was never afraid to dismegnet on listening to you, it's really scary hearing what your saying, I'm very scared!
What is he saying that you have a problem with?
What is he saying that you have a problem with?
What scares us is I think we hear violence.
Think you don't know what the fuck it is you talkin' about.
They're saying questions about us fearing, wepsal fearing, you know, what will the black folks do and stuff, we should be running down the street, screaming and ranting and raving 'cause when you look at the sartistics, Who is the one guy? From the policemen? From the KKK? From the skinheads?
What scares us is I think we hear violence.
What is he saying that you have a problem with?
And why is it when a black man stands up to speak for his people, and all the people stand up to speak for their people, there's no problem with it?
What you saying?
He said black, he said juke.
And people talk... they talk like that.
But why is it when a black man stands up to speak for his people, you feel so threatened? And everybody's paranoid? And you talk about shot sigar gaytion? We live in hall and we live in wats, we live in Befestifison that's a form of 7 gaytion. We through Beafenher we get killed. So what are you talking about?
Yeah that's cool
Er, everything closed so we just
We might as well just go straight to the hotel
And just get some rest
Let me slide this dick up on in ya
If I was fucking you right about now
Have to go brag to your fucking crew
On how this rap nigga dick you down
Tenderised them guts and didn't have to kick you down

And your sex styles?
And all the niggaz that you think about fucking
So do what I tell you and everything'll be all right
Get the fuck on 'fore these niggaz start to fight

Gave it up to me, a gangsta, after the club
If I was fucking you, I'd be pakin the piss
The horny weight dick gettin' laid is for chips
Bitch I'm tryina' make grips

Hin the gin and juice the mix
No time to pause, gots to drop draws
Prep though a ass-spanking', breakin' down walls
Hit the twat chopper style
If I was fucking you, you'd be like fuck everybody
Cube, this pussy yours
Washin' dishes, rubbin' floors
Doin' chores for a nigga
Open doors for a nigga
Ridin' shotgun, holdin' forty-fours for a nigga
At the motelly, got you on your belly
In come morcelli
Niggaz calling K-Mac, bitches calling Kelly
Do it like Arthur Fonzarelli, hit the lights
So we can try to reform these potential dykes
Credit card maxed-out
Bank account tapped-out
When I call you break your neck
You do whatever please me, runnin' burs while I take it easy
Will as you do whatever, live your life just to please me
These buster-ass niggaz make the shit so easy
If I was fucking you, I'd let the homies fuck too
Run up in the guts, bust nuts and we're through
Have you fiendin'
Cooch screamin, needin' cleanin'
Creamin', tag-teamin', suckin' semen
Keep it low, put it in your grill 'cause you love me
Hold it till you choked off the bitch then got gut
And roll one to smoke, grab my shit and shake my spot
Nineteen inches of complicated funk. hahahaha
Ango urgin', probably be vomiting dick for a week though
Suckin' on semen, hahahahahahah...
Hmmm... be careful what you wish for, you just might get it
I'm speaking as a Black man from America... which is a racist society.
No matter how much you hear it talk about democracy...
It's as racist as South Africa or as racist as Portugal...
Or as racist as any other racialist society on this, on this earth.
Preaches separation and practices separation.
America preaches integration and practices segregation!
This is the ONLY difference.
They don't practice what they PREACH!
For in South-Africa preaches and practices... the SAME thing.
I have more respect for a man, who let me know where he stands...
Even if he's wrong.
Then one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil.
I, uhm... I don't agree with him because I don't have to follow anyone to defend myself.
I think that, uhm... there are, every people, uhm...
All people have been... frustrated in some form from another.
But, uhm...
I don't agree with him, I don't follow a man, and I don't think anyone should follow one man.
I think they should follow their conscience!
I think the most of them, most negroes, that they feel sorry for themselves...
And I think that this keep some that, uhm...
Much more than they would be.
If they didn't feel so sorry for themselves.
If Martin Luther King, Roy Wilkins or any of these uuh...
Compromising negroes who say exactly what the white man wants to hear...
Is interviewed anywhere in the country, you don't get anybody to offset what they say.
But whenever a black man...
Stands up and says something that...
White people don't like then the first thing that white man does,
Is run around and try and find somebody to say something...
To, to uuhm... offset...
What has just been said!
This is NATURAL!
But it is done.
You know what I think?
An ideal of an integrated America, the dream of Martin Luther King, I think you givin' up.
This is not, I'm not tryna be a Smarterica, I'm calling you honestly...
That I think you givin' up! 
You know, it's interesting... how... white folk... sit here...
Thinking that... I have a reason... to lie to you...
As though you are so powerful.
And you are so wonderful...
And I am so ashamed of my words, that I have to twist and turn, please!
You are not dealing... with that kind of man.
You're dealing with a man... who means what he says.
Now homey do you dig, do you dig, do you dig?
It is what it is, it is, is is
Now will I ever get it right? Get it right?
Even though I'm out at night, livin' life
Girl I'm tryin' to make this money, I ain't even playin'
Course the game I'm in, it ain't even payin'
When I'm on the go, on the go
Everybody wanna know, wanna know
Cube where the fuck you goin', each and every day?
I just turn around, and I say
Now homey do you dig, do you dig, do you dig?
It is what it is, it is, is is
Feel the devil catchin up, catchin up
I put it in the Lord's hands, he is the man
But got to pay the rent, pay the rent
Without the government, government
Please get yo' swagger up
Got to get my swagger up
Better get my swagger up
Check this out homey
This business right here, is personal
I would go around you, over you, under you or THROUGH you
To make sure none of my family suffer
Do you understand me?!
There are seven known wonders of the world, you about to witness the eighth, muthafucka...
I got King Kong in my trunk, King Kong in my doors
My nuts play ping-pong from the noise;
You can hear me from a block away
I'm sitting next to your ass and can't hear what you got to say
My shit is loud, my ears is ringing
My paint job is wet, my chrome is gleaming
I feel like a vet ballin' on these rookies
An old-school bully, you must have played hooky
I bring it like a bookie, my aggression is depressing
Don't give a muthafucka time to learn his lesson
A lunatic, y'all know what I represent
The only rapper that wanna fist-fight the president
It Take A Nation of niggas to hold us back
It Take A Nation of niggas to hold us back
It Take A Nation of niggas to hold us back
It Take A Nation of niggas to hold us back
When I bang this it's dangerous, niggas go brainless
So bang this with the four-five stainless
And understand that you looking at the famous
West-coast rapper who act like an anus
Hollywood, they thought they could tame this
Pit-bull, but I know what the game is
Them fuckers cheat like an NBA ref
If you smoke one? They'll electrocute you to death
I got god on my intellect, Godzilla by the neck
When the nigga come through, who you wanna holler at
Ghostwriters hit the deck, when ya boi got a tech
Where the fuck is Africa-Bamabata at
We need to take it back, fuck Viacom
Clear Clear Channel and Radio One
You muthafuckas programmed by the programmers
That's why you getting locked up by the dope slammers, not me
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
They music so fluffy, I'm a stay gutter
That shit is kinda popcorn, my shit is so butter
My style never change in 22 summers
Straight independent and doing my numbers
This shit don't sell, you know I'm still paid
So sour-puss niggas, can drink lemonade
I'm doin' it for the love, You doing it because
You need that advancement to spend on them dubs
I don't need a penny, but I need many
Don't worry bout ma money boi, 'cause I got plenty
You muthafuckas worry 'bout flossing so much
You don't know the fundamentals, you forgot how to brush
These thirty-two teeth will give your ass grief
Bite you like a fat burger if you got beef
So whose it gonna be, your favourite MC
Your scared of the government, they scared of me, now what?
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas and streets of crack
So young, so angry... damn that rap music
Break 
Shit
Yo
Yo, uh
Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
I got my grub on but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Thinking Will I live another twenty-fo'?
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all
Which court are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggas every way like M.J.
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' 
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas and watch me break 'em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones and I'm yellin' Domino!
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Picked up a girl I been tryin' to fuck since the twelfth grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the SuperSonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep
Put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube The Top Gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the morning, got the fat burger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear blimp
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Halfway home and my pager still blowing up
Today, I didn't even have to use my AK
Hey wait, wait a minute, Pooh
Stop this shit
What the fuck I'm thinking about?
Break 
Shit
Yo
Yo, uh

Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'
Thinkin' will I live, another twenty-fo'

Freakin brothers everyway like M.J.
I can't believe, today was a good day
That's right...
Creep to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin, didn't even look in a brother's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV Raps

Hehe...
Left my homie's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryin' to do since the twelve grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
Felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my jimmy runs deep, so deep
So deep put her butt to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her butt off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for the murder
Two in the mornin got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, Ice Cube's a pimp
Drunk as hell but no throwin' up
Half way home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I gotta say it was a good day
Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand
Cause after I do ya
Huh I never knew ya
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
Ice cube won't wait so give it up cow
After we do it you can go home now
I'm a brother with a big long...
First of all let me tell you my name it's yo-yo
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no
Yo-yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
No, yo-yo's not a hoe or a whore
And if that's what you're here for
Exit through the door
There's more
To see of me but you're blind so
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0
Ay what up buttercupper miss yo-yo
I know you like to rap and like to flow so
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world
Stay down and play the playground you little girl
What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping
'Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening
It never fails I'll always get respect
And you lose so take a rain check
Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon
Well you're mistaken
It's not going that far
I make brothers like you play the back yard
You used to flow with the title but I took it
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it
Damn it look it
'Cause you're talking a lot of bull
Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull
This is a man's world thank you very much
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch
Break
Ah miss yo-yo so what gives
I hear females always talkin' about women's lib
Well get your own crib
And stay there
Instead of having more babies for the welfare
'Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger
The name is ice cube you know that I ain't the nigga
For you to look at when your hair get nappy
So take a piece of the pole and be happy
Hell no because to me you're not a thriller
You come in the room with your three-inch killer
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown
I'm a put it like this my man
Without us your hand would be your best friend
So give us credit like you know you should
If I don't look good you don't look good
I doubt it baby 'cause we're still most dominant
But you don't know how funky that I can get
This is a man's world thank you very much
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch
Break
Man women I put a lot of fear in em
'Cause I had it up to here with em
Drink a beer with em
No way 'cause I can only deal with 'em about an hour every day
Yeah if you know what I mean baby
Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe
If you was more of a man instead of faking it
Women deserve the credit when they're making it
Yeah so what's the problem
Well I think we solved it
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it
Yeah I admit you can flow
Well that's true
But you see I'm a pro with the bank too
Yeah I can see you got it good
Oh that I know
But you see you're not better than yo-yo
The brand-new intelligent black lady
You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me
So what up then
Girl what you tryin' to do
To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through
This is a man's world thank you very much
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch
Or a big butt...
Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand

Police, eat the dick straight up; you know why?
I got Jacked just the other night.
What I'm doing walk in the streets?!
Man, what the fuck you mean what I'm doin' walk in the streets?
You gon' buy me a motherfuckerin' car?
Everytime I try to STEAL one, you take me to jail!
So what the fuck you talkin' about?!
A nigga like me... strugglin' to stride!
Nigga walking in the streets at night is like committin' suicide...
So what the fuck's next?
I'm tired of this motherfuckin' shit!
Niggaz popping off the Mob.
Talking about I'm The Nigga You Love to Hate.
Bitch!
Back up off my tip, for the simple fact; you're only like a gnat on a dog's dick.
I do Gangsta Rap
They want to blame the world problems on Gangsta Rap
It's our fault;
'Cause motherfuckers are dying in Iraq
It's our fault;
'Cause motherfuckers is starving in Africa
It's Gangsta Raps fault;
That people are poor
Can't get enough to fucking eat or live their life
That's rap musics fault.
It's rap musics fault;
We got all these god damn laws, and restrictions and shit we can't do
They blame it all on us
I'm blamin' them motherfuckers for Gangsta Rap
Because if they didn't create these kind of conditions
I wouldn't have shit to rap about
You know what I mean!
A'right, a'right, everybody back up, star status comin' through.
The man is in the building.
Don't touch him, don't look at him, and don't ask to take a picture.
I walks in, with that California swagger
With that attitude that it ain't nothin' badder
Now you can call me rapper
Or you can call me mister
Big money trapper, fuckin' with your sister
I'ma do it my way, from here to Zimbabwe
It's too hot today
Fuck what you got to say
Fuck if you mad at me, better go change your battery
Ain't gonn take my sunshine, like I hit the lottery
Ah, he's a show off, a hot head go off
Yeah don't make he mad
He might tear the fucking door off
Take all his cars, and don't try to fall
'Cause one of his people, might cut your fucking toe off
Ice Cube baby, make you take him serious
Everthin' I say, ends with a period
Everthin' I do, ends with you curious
Lookin' for the best rapper
God damn period.
And we don't gotta put up with this brainless rap
And we don't gotta put up with this brainless rap
Comin' live from Los Angleas

I know you saved a little something
I know your mouth is still runnin'
All smiles when I'm coming
When I step up in the spot

Nose all in the clouds, Y'all think I'm too proud
Got to stay above the crowd, How you fuckers like me now
Some of y'all start to smile
Some of y'all start to frown
Some of y'all back up
All niggers start to clap

They want to whoop my ass, but this ain't Rocky
Star child comin'

Y'all promise me you won't T.R.I.P
Or I'ma have to hit your ass with a 2-piece
Hit you with some rice and two more sides

Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin for beats
Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it

And give it that gangsta lean
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass

Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm outtie
So when I come to your town don't crowd me
'Cause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me

When you see me on ya block, call the police
Let them motherfuckers no here come the beast
Oh, in the late night hour
Straight out of Compton, a crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
And I'm rollin' with the motherfuckin' Neptunes
When I'm caught off, I got a sawed-off
A midget bitch that'll suck a niggas balls off
You too girl if ya fuck with me
I'm gettin' head in the lane doin' sixty
About to crash like Teddy Pendergrass
Mama said a hard head make a tender ass
To all the dogs that bark a lot
Who don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
We'll be creepin' in the parking lot
Motherfuckers don't know if I can park or not
'Cause I circle like vultures, La Costa Nostra
Bumpin' all the baddest bitches like I'm 'posed to
What's yo name, what's yo number and ya culture
You need nuts in yo face like a poster
If you in a club nigga then shit bang
If you on the streets nigga then shit bang
If you on the block nigga then shit bang
And if it's what ya need boy, do ya thang
If ya in a Range Rov then shit bang
If you in that 600 then shit bang
If you on that Steel Horse then shit bang
But if it's what ya need boy, let it bang
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
Fuckin' pig wanna act like he like me now
In 86 same bitch tried to lock me down
And motherfuckers wanna ask why I'm cocky now
To all the bitches that think they bootylicious
I think they nutritious, I think they do dishes
I'm makin' three wishes or takin' they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches
Egomaniac, lil' homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an asshole and it ain't a knack
So take a hit of that and remember that
Where my motherfuckin' niggas and my bitches at
In the late night hour hit the front to back
Check the motherfuckin' rims on the Cadillac
On the ass attack, can you keep it tight
And if the head right, nigga there every night
This is for my niggas that's schemin' for cash
This is for my people that's countin' they riches
This is for my niggas that's countin' they cash
This is for my people that's schemin' for riches
So check it and everybody get naked
This might be a nigga last record
But respect it 'cause I could do it all night playa
I'm all fight playa, you all spite playa
It's all right playa, a nigga might care
But to catch me you gotta do a light year
Ice Cube insane in the membrane
Baby go ahead please do the damn thang
We gonna get chu' high nigga
Our rhymes will get chu' by nigga
Tell me if I qualify nigga
To bail in like SuperFly
I wanna get that, cop that, buy that, drive that
You want it too but don't know where to start at
Fuckin' with me, nigga better bring his hard hat
Nigga where ya heart at, leave ya on the tarmac
Where my top at and my nigga Mack
Ridin' shotgun, with the top gun
Don't catch a hot one soon as he spot one
Westside Connection is a doctrine
This ain't another club song
Or love song that y'all can fuck on
So get the fuck on
A nigga rich can't believe the bullshit that I'm stuck on
Uh-huh, understand this
I don't give a fuck about what y'all talkin' about
I ain't tryin' to hear none of that shit
Nigga I'm a do what I wanna do
When I wanna do it, how I wanna do it
And you better hope I don't do it to you
Now, I don't care what you got to say
I don't care what they got to say
Nigga I'm grown
Let me tell you a little somethin' about me
I was born not to give a fuck, wanna drink, get your cup
Turn it up, throw it up, take the world, blow it up
Somebody slow it up, roll it up, smoke it up
My own can't keep me from loc'n up
One ear out the other, one man out to smother
The neighborhood, that left me here without my brother
You undercovers and you dirty muthafuckers
In the hood, that still fuck without rubbers
Club hop, bar hop, car shop, nail shop
To the mall, spend it all, why not
What bills, what rent, don't know what's spent
Why you care, do you work for the government?
Fuck it homey, I'm a laugh now and cry later
Get your paper we can laugh now and cry later
All you players you can laugh now and cry later
Investigators let you laugh now and cry later
See I'm a product of this urban decay
A nigga dyin' for tomorrow, but live for today
A nigga lie steal and borrow, and cheating's okay
Don't you tell these muthafuckers that my name is O'Shea
'Cause I'm a look up my baby's credit, let him regret it
7 months old he's already got a jail record
I'm the one to blame, put it in my mama name
She's not a drama queen, but I got the bling bling
I need the watch and the bracelet and the earrings
I need you all to show up at my hearings
Tell the judge I'm a nice guy, good guy
And I'm a play the sad face when he look nigga
Fuck it homey, I'm a laugh now and cry later
Get your paper we can laugh now and cry later
All you players you can laugh now and cry later
Investigators let you laugh now and cry later
The number you are calling was lost, and cannot be called back
Your last call return service
It's fucked-up, that y'all won't answer my calls
Tell mom, at least she can send some drawers
These walls, make y'all forget about me
I'm comin' home, in 2033
But that's irrelevant, did you get the mail I sent
What I tell a bitch, you better stay celibate
She start lyin' to me, tell me who she ain't fuckin'
Never tell me that my homeboys ain't nothin'
Bun in the oven, it belong to my cousin
Got the nerve, to tell me that you really love me
What?
I'm a get the ass when a nigga make parole
Hit her with my cane, cause a nigga gray and old
Fuck it homey, I'm a laugh now and cry later
Get your paper we can laugh now and cry later
All you players you can laugh now and cry later
Investigators let you laugh now and cry later
Man, it ain't right man
Y'know y'all ain't doin' me right man
A nigga tryin' to do right man
Y'know I'm tryin' to change my life man, y'know?
I done found the Lord while I'm in here, y'know?
I I'm tryin' to do right now, I mean
Y'know I'm sorry for everythang
That I, I I mean y'know
That's fucked-up how y'all doin' me man
Y'all niggas could at least send me somethin'
All right, first four guys, let's go... lock it up.

He'll draw down and then check his beeper
He's clockin' them chicks and bucks
Gettin', his little dick sucked by the, clucks
And will he do dirt? Fool oh please
Little locs are harder then the ogz
You fall to the ground and beg please

A straight killer, a fool, a lil ass gee...

Little nigga nuttier than a snicker
You wanna be like mike, you don't wanna be like me
A fool, a killer, a lil ass gee...

In the 1-man cell, it got'cha thinkin'
Sendin' more kites than Benjamin Franklin
20 years old but your still a veteran
Won't touch down till we're livin' like the Jetsons
Proud of yourself, because you done done it
Gotcha 22's and your name on your stomach
Think about a woman
Rather stand in line or bust the ass of a young buck
Got stuck, now you're bleedin'
Hospital ward, is got your reading
Learn about the knowledge of self ya see
That ya mad enough to go and stick the death to these
See, it ain't about bein' hard
But that's what'cha tell the little homies in the yard
Ya already done did 10
And wish you could start all over again
Brand new inmates and who do ya see
Your baby brother in shackles, a fool, a lil ass gee...
A fool, a lil ass gee
Yo this go out to the little hardhead homies
Who probably gon' see more assholes than pussyholes
When they get you in that system.
Hell naw nigga fuck this
Nigga let me up out of here!
Nigga y'all can't take me to jail anyway
I don't even know why y'all got me gaffled
Look, fuck that, when my big homies find out about this shit
Y'all gon' be workin in Alaska, so dress warm motherfucker
Hahahaha, yeah
Look at that lil' ass Westside loc'ed out
Insane-in-the-brain little nigga servin' 'caine
Use to have to ask could he cross the street
Now he's rollin' in a G, the G is on E
Now you know what fuckin' set he's claimin
A wild little nigga and it ain't no tamin
And just when you think everything is calm
Bang, ping, catch you with the sleeper
He's clockin them chips and bucks
And will he do dirt? Fool oh please
You fall to the ground and then bleed
Just got served by little niggaz on a 10-speed
Twelve years old, got bumps they can't keep
A straight killer, a fool, a lil' ass gee
Hey, you little niggaz need to get up out the spot man
What, what nigga you think I'm a lil' punk or somethin'?
What you trippin' for man?
When you run for yo' gun, just to save yo' life
It's just a ... little ass gee
When you hatin' on these fools on these motherfuckin streets
I'm just a ... little ass gee
When I step up on yo' ass with the shank
Niggaz know it's just a ... little ass gee
Just a young motherfuckin tryin' to clock my grip
I'm just a ... little ass gee
God damn, it's a trip
Now it's straight Crip, or Blood
But I ain't surprised
It's 12 months later, yeah, I see you got a little size
You motherfuckin crook
You want respect cause you didn't get'cha manhood took
Drinkin' that 'gac like it's no tomorr-y
Westside hustler, fuck Atari
Been to jail, and it ain't no thang
A underage boy that's smokin' tye
And that's your idea of junior high
All you want for Christmas is guns and triggers
Little nigga nuttier than a Snickers
You don't wanna be like Mike, you wanna be like me
A fool, a killer, a lil' ass gee
We have people, that have been conditioned
Not to expect to live, beyond the age of 30
They no longer care
Once they no longer care, they're extremely dangerous
I'm not afraid of bein shot
Cause that's the environment I grew up in
They got yo' ass stretched like Stretch Armstrong
In the one-man cell, it got'cha thinkin'
Sendin more kites than Benjamin Franklin
Twenty years old but ya still a veteran
Won't touch down till we're livin' like the Jetsons
Proud of yourself, because ya done done it
Gotcha 22's and your name on your stomach
Never even think about a woman to fuck
Rather stand in line to bust the ass of a young buck
Hospital ward, is got your reading
Learn about the knowledge of self ya see
Got ya mad enough to go and stick the deputy
But that's whatcha tell the little homies on the yard
Ya already done did ten
And wish you could start all over again
Brand new inmates, and who do ya see
Your baby brother in shackles, a fool, a lil' ass gee
A fool, a lil' ass gee
Yo this go out to the little hardhead homies
Who probably gon' see more uh, asshole... than pussyhole
When they get you in that system, and I ain't trippin'
Hit the sunroof, and let's contemplate the freaks we can run through
Got the chauffeur pullin over
Snatch one inside, she wanna ride with this mission
Close the partition, he like to listen
All fuckin', no kissin', just smokin' and drinkin'
Super vets in a super stretch Lincoln
Thinkin' 'bout the good ol' days of hip hop
In its purest form before the eye of the storm
I could give a fuck about you hatin', on my way
To the Colliseum with seventeen-five waitin
They scream for the limousine, it's all clean
Tinted, your shit is rented, you know we spend it
While you worry 'bout the five mics, I'm in the limelight
Wit movies comin' out, yo' time is runnin' out
I just finished doin' Live At The Apollo
Indication from my driver damn we're bein followed
Caught him in motion, had me potent, let him know about the showin
And how I'm knowin' to keep it cracked open
Cans of ass-beatin', plus on how I crash meetins
And have your whole staff leavin' half-breathin
Got shit to hold my own, big bucks
But Khop's soon to run it through em, nigga check nuts
Put to the test then put two to rest
Wiped out with lights out, two to the chest
Hold it now tell a few, legitimate
We loaded, for revenue, let's get this shit
And split this shit for three days, count it three ways
Nigga fuck what he say, havin' heat pays
It's all about the thoroughbred, top choice with the voice
That keep ??? moist
Mr. Short Khop expected the truest, dare you niggas step to us
I stay connected till death do us
The alley was pitch black, I'm in the back of this black Lac
These fuckers pull up in a Ac
They don't understand the impact
Two thousand dollar three-piece suit, can you spend that?
'Cause I'm down to play a double-header in stormy weather
Superstar, goddamn them niggas got me
Why is my thing-thing burnin like this?
What have I, done stuck my duck in?
I went to the free clinic, it was filled to capacity
Now how bad can a piece of ass be?
Very bad, so I had to make the trip
And thank God, I didn't have the drips
I was there so a hoe couldn't gimme that
Just to get - twenty free jimmy hats
Now look who I see
Ain't that... yeah, that's the bitch from up the street!
With the big fat tail
Who always told Cube to go to hell
She thought she was wiser
Now she's sittin' in the waitin room, burnin like heat-mizer
Yeah I see ya
First Miss Thang, now Miss Gonorrhea
Man it's a trip how the world keeps turnin'
It's 1991, and look who's burnin
Does it get you hot? It's got me hot!
Burnin up, burnin!
What have I, done stuck my duck in?
Now everybody is a victim, you can go see 'em
And you'll hear more claps than the Coliseum
Sittin' there all quiet and embarrassed
Whup - there go that bitch who was careless
I remember - she wouldn't give the cock
To anybody who lived on the block
Now hoe, look what you got
BEND THAT BIG ASS OVER for the shot
Cause somebody is pipin hot
Drippin like a faucet, I'm glad I didn't toss it
Got you a college boy, who was worse than me
And he probably fucked the whole university
Still wanted him to dick you down, kick you down
With some bucks, now who got fucked?
With a nigga for the money he's earnin
But ask for some water bitch, and look who's burnin
Does it get you hot? Can you get that?
Burnin up, burnin!
Why is my thing-thing burnin like this?
.. At which there is, a little surprise
Yo, it ain't my fault you got the heebie-jibbies
But you still try to act like you didn't see me
So I walk over, and say Hi,
Bitch, don't try to act surprised!
You shoulda put a sock on the pickle
And your pussy wouldn't be blowin' smoke signals
Man, this is gonna kill 'em
Guess who got a big fat dose of penicillin?
They'll ask, Who?, and I tell 'em you
The new leader of the big booty crew
And after the day, I'm sorry to say
You come through the neighborhood, you couldn't give it away
To a nigga, who's out to get major paid
But you'll have him, pissin out razorblades
But a bitch like you... ll be returnin with the H-I-V, R.I.P.
I'm burning up!
I'm burning up!
What have I, done stuck my duck in?
.. Done stuck my duck in?
It's hot... I'm burning up I'm burning up!
Yo, niggas, what's happenin' out there?
This muthafuckin' MP, nigga to kizzon. You heard me?
Hookin' out with my nigga, Ice Cube and all.
We servin' y'all salted niggas, hot wings, nigga.
Y'all better realize that this muthafuckin' War and Peace shit, so muthafuckin' Trill.
I mean so muthafuckin' real.
When niggas from the sizzouth and niggas from the west and the east and the muthafuckin' north hook up
And show y'all muthafuckers that don't matter.
Where ya from is how ya come 'cause we all 'about that cheddar nigga the green muthafuckin' Benjamin's. You heard me?
We gon' stay 'About It, 'About It, rowdy, rowdy
And my real niggas, this shit for y'all.
'Ey!
'Ey, girl!
'Ey, jibba-jibba!
Oh, what? You can't speak?
You know? You ain't gotta be starring' at my show, baby!
Make it ruff
Whassup?
What?
Hahahaha, baby baby!
Make it ruff
I make niggas say 'woof' 'cause I'm in the coupe with no roof
'Cause I'm ruff, and nigga you can buck these nuts
If you comin' with that smooth shit, hard core rules shit
Mothafuckin wannabe mack
I gots ta buck... you... right on up, punk you lucky that cha livin'
'Cause I'm the unforgiven; I like power, ain't a damn thing funny
And I won't slam like onyx or never ever stutter
But I'm b-b-butter;
And I'm here
You can lick me up and down till I yell stop!
Damn bitch ya missed a drop... 'cause I don't play when I sway
It's the quicker picker upper;
A pro that moves slow before this hoe I'm quick
To dump her; so eeny-meeny-miney-mo, where's my dough?
I gots ta make a livin', I out ta get mo;
Money, and got more nuts for ya honey; so
Come and break me off, this nigga's walkin' soft;
It's the smoothness that make niggas move to this;
For you ruffnecks, I'll check you with my tool and shit;
Don't sweat 'em, just let 'em play that hardcore
Role; we still cool, but just make it smooth...
You know what, it's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I'm chocolate thunder;
Ruff as sin, cuts on ya skin
And I blend with the tracks, see I'm black
K-dee is the mack; matter fact
Niggas hit me up with the c's and b's
But you don't wanna fuck wit these
'Cause I'll put 'em on ya
And we'll have to wake ya mothafuckin ass up with ammonia
'Cause hardcore rap is always on the map and it don't stop
Devoid of pop; and if I drop another smooth hit
It'll still be hard, 'cause I helped start this shit;
Make it ruff
Make it- make it ruff
I hate when niggas get too fuckin' sexy on the track, I'm pro black.
I like hittin switches.
Hard rhyme sayer!
Creepin', ain't no sleepin', ain't a damn thing changed; I hit hoe after
Fool, I kill at will and still can fade that shit; 'cause it's the
It ain't no sweat for me to buck buck nigga don't give a fuck; you
Better duck duck or get your ass stuck stuck!
Don't make me act a fool! nigga, make it ruff!
And I'm in here...
Make it ruff
Make- make it- make it ruff
Make it ruff
Ice cube's up in this motherfucker
Make- make it ruff- ruff
Yo, we in a fight for our lives
We in a fight for our lives
And the trick thing about it
I don't know if we can win
And what's sad? I don't thing we WANNA win
Can you help me? a nigga need a job
I'm desperate, for some corn on the cob
I'm helpless, will I have to steal and rob?
No black? dinner so I got to ask bob
Bob got a job but it's done by a robot
No lunch breaks so it could do a whole lot
More than a human being and it's European,
Ran by a Korean, American,
So there I am, surrounded by aluminum
There's no way you can run,
There's no way you can be,
It's just and me, versus modern day machinery
It's man vs machine baby
My head's in the guillotine baby
It might take it off clean baby
Automated dreams it was man vs machine baby
I'm a fly caught in the web
A fish stuck in the internet
Don't they know I'm a deathly catch?
Eat this meat, every bite so full of stress
So what can I say to you?
I'm highly relatable and biodegradable
I thought we was unfadeable
Slaves to machinery, is that the way to go?
I don't need you to fuck 24/7
I guess that computer love
I don't need you to love
Human contact ain't what it used to was
It's man vs machine baby
My head's in the guillotine baby
It might take it off clean baby
Automated dreams it was man vs machine baby
The whole world is automated
It need to be investigated
When people are eliminated
What we supposed to do when its time to feed all the babies?
Here's another topic I'm addressing,
So learn a quick lesson, about your smith and wesson.
Sit your ass back and comprehend,
As I let you know about man's best friend.
Now remember, it used to be a dog like lassie,
But now in '91 it's a gun if you ask me.
Just like a jimmy hat's used for protection,
I use my nine when suckers start to flex it.
'Cause if you run up and try to play mine,
I rather have a ak than a fucking k9.
'Cause if you shot your gun and my dog tries to fetch ya,
Me and the dog's going out on a stretcher.
And I ain't with that, so I gotta get that
Big black gat, aim and I hit that.
Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend.
Man's best friend
Here is the reason why ice cube's packed,
Just in case the little punks try to jack.
I can't put a motherfucking pitbull under a coat,
And a small on my back.
So I gotta take my beret off, and I betcha
It'll probably work a 100 percent better.
'Cause it'll keep me out of danger,
With sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber.
So this goes to all y'all intruders,
Beware of the owner, 'cause the owner is a shooter.
I don't just wanna give your ass rabies,
I rather have your ass pushing up daisies.
And I can't do that with benji,
Rin tin tin, or spotch mckinsey
Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend.
Just don't let me see you shoot no dogs
Hey, I got shots fired here, send me another unit
Over thirty, white, male, middle class -- peter jennings
Take that motherfuckers
In every game, we gotta have the brains and the muscle
The game and the hustle... to be real on these streets
So here you have it, the Brainiac
With the Maniac
Verse One
While y'all niggas think about the papé
I think about which Titanic I'mma sink
The iceberg, with the nice words
I slice verbs and predicets, ghetto etiquette
Y'all better get, this dime-mega shit
The Braniac, the theory be conspiracy
Keep my eye on the birdie, but never get my hands dirty
Verbally call the Maniac and his attack dogs
Signing contracts with automatic jack clause
I get full of their shit and take flight on these niggas
'Bout to show these so-called
Wig-splitters and nigg-hitters
Who the man be, and what the number one clique is
Let my nuts hang on these busts
And hoes see how big my dick is
Maniac Mack 10 always keep the heat toted
And teflon tips keep the .44 loaded
Straight quoted in nine-trey, by the dime
Now we connected
He said, Mack, when you westsidin' and ridin' is expected
So I...
You in the Stargate, trying t'escape, it's not an option
Got torture techniques for them lies, don't ever lie
Just put the car in drive, we can go ride- get this money
Determined as the Energized Bunny, make a left
Underground parking, guns start sparkin'
ATF enemies all around start chargin'
Tryin' to fuck up my new suit and my weekend
Ask me what you want, you bitch! I ain't speakin'
Shit, I gives a fuck what the next nigga think
It's like this on mine, potna
By all means, I got the ball
So it's your life, not mine nigga, so you make the call
Now, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the fuckin' fool
Or you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool
I'm off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak
It's Mack the Maniac, nigga
What's the plan? Everything thought out
Everything bought out, like Bill Gates
My niggas love steel weights
I'm still great, after 12 muthafuckin' years
I act kind to my peers and everybody that listen
They know when the Brainiac's missin'
The big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk
Got all the haters, claimin' that they wanna talk
You argue wit 'em and negotiate, and I really wanna kill 'em
I'm tired of the bullshit, man I really wanna peel 'em
Dog, I knew they were scareless
'Cause my brother Snoop told us
So fuck the money and the dope that they punk-ass owe us
Now when I see 'em, it ain't no question it's all the way on
But I'mma wait in front of they momma house
For that one nigga to get home
And when I gun, watch his body jump
And it's all going to amaze me
To see his own self
Layin' there with his own brains on the pavement
And it's on... keep takin' till it's gone
And it's on... feel the wrath of the chrome
Wessiiide!
Ice Cube the Brainiac
Mack 10 the Maniac
I love the sound of gangsta shit in the morning.
Bitch you know the size.
World muthafucking wide.
You ain't got to be in the pen to be in prison.
You in the prison of your muthafuckin' mind.
What kinda time we got up here?
Everything is real on this concrete and steel.
Everything is real on this concrete and steel.
The Warfare is Mental.
The Warfare is Mental.
Supreme gangsta shit.
We dream of gangsta shit.
Now I wanna see if you punk muthafuckers is paying attention.
I love the sound of gangsta shit in the morning.
Motherfucker, you'd better break yourself...
My skin is my sin, look at my complexion
Section 8, erection great
Balls like ru paul and a big fat plank
Get you higher than a spike lee joint
See I'm a chicken hawk and I'm hunting chicken and watermelon
It ain't nothing but hard time bailing
Just got a misdomener
'Cause I got a deuce-five, and I'm black as sarafina
Get the hell out somolia, we didn't call y'all
I can't wait till I can kill all y'all
Damn I couldn't get close enough to sock him
I plead guilty your honor
'Cause I dissed the pope more times than sinead o'connor
Huh huh, cool, like butthead and beavis
Truer than the mack but I'm downer than he is
And that police chief named willie
Can take his motherfucking ass back to philly
Dropped a bomb on a crew named move
Years ago, here's a hoe
That's ready to stop me, they think I'm khadafi
Rolling in a six-tre jalopy
They want to give me ten in the pen 'cause I'm smelling like hen
My skin is my sin
I get around like tupac, just bought a new glock
And I want what you got
So please give it up so I can live it up
Just like the rich but I still eat grits
I don't know karate
But I can still beat the dog shit out of nazis
You claim you want to put in work
Plotting to blow up a church
See you devils are all the same
You'll gun down a congregation in Jesus' name
Using me as a scapegoat, well cracker don't sleep
Far from a goat, more like a black sheep
Lamb of god, and it's odd
That allah is a man that don't need a tan
And you can't stand when I talk like that
And why do black men have to walk like that?
'Cause we swing low like a chariot
And now I got harriet all on my dick
Cause my shoe size is much bigger than a motherfucking 10
My skin is my sin
Who's that janky-ass nigga with last?
Standing like a g pissing on America's flag
Dub c, the nigga from westside
Westide maad circle bailing with a double barrel
Cause uh, my skin is my sin
And all I need is knowledge of self and ammunition is my best friend
When it's time to roll nigga, we ain't calling on Jesus
I'm calling mad dog for the 9 millimeters
'Cause I give the song with those peckerwoods to the fullest
And a bitch by the name of America's on it
The same bitch that jacked my forefathers
And the indians took my motherfucking religion
Place a holy Bible in my hand, but for what?
Like jim kelly said, you try to set me up?  shit...
I'm too slick for your lies in disguise
When will you devils open your eyes and realize?
Like pepsi, niggas got a new generation
And we don't want your American education
Ain't no brain washing this way
Fuck America, tom meztger, and kkk
And to the cracker named j.b. stoner
Don't let me catch you on no corners
I see you on TV talking more shit
But just like your punk-ass anscestors, you's a bitch
You's a bitch if I ever saw one
Grand wizard bring your ass on imperial so we can get physical
And watch God show and prove
Not only mentally but physically the black man rules
So run devil run, you's to best start running
Because the niggas are coming, oh, the niggas are coming
And ain't no way you gon' win
'Cause I come from a tribe of o.g.'s and my skin is my sin
This is the final boarding call for flight 1259
Departing from Los Angeles, final destination to St. Louis
Thank you
Damn G, the spot's gettin' hot
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?
Police looking at niggaz through a microscope
In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope
They trying to stop it
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?
Catch a flight to St. Louis
That's cool, cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers
Rented a car at Wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grabbed the 3.80
'Cause where we staying, niggaz look shady
But they can't fade South Central
'Cause busting a cap is fundamental
Peeping out every block close
Seeing which one will clock the most
Yeah, this is the one, no doubt
Bust a U Bone, and let's clear these niggaz out
Hey! Hey man! Whassup nigga?
Now clearing them out meant casualties
Still had the L.A. mentality
Bust a cap, and outta there in a hurry
Wouldn't you know, a drive-by in Missouri
Them fools got popped
Took their corner next day, set up shop
And it's better than slanging in the Valley
Triple the profit making more than I did in Cali
Breaking up rocks like Barney Rubble
'Cause them mark-ass niggaz don't want trouble
And we ain't on edge when we do work
Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
Getting bitches and they can't stand a
1991 Tony Montana
Now the shit's like a war - Gang violence
Where it was never seen before
Punks run when the gats bust
4 jheri curled niggaz kicking up dust
And some of them are even looking up to us
Wearing our colors and talking that gang Fuck,
Giving up much much love
Dying for a street that they never heard of
But other motherfuckers want to stand strong
So you know the phrase, once again it's on...
A gang from South Central Los Angeles, which are known for their drive-by shootings,
Have migrated into east St. Louis leaving 3 dead and 2 others injured. No arrests have
Been made. Police say this is a nation-wide trend, with similar incidents occurring in
Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma.
BOOM, my homie got shot he's a goner black
St. Louis niggaz want they corner back
Shooting in snowy weather
It's illegal business, niggaz still can't stick together
Fuckin' police got the 411
That L.A. ain't all, surf and sun
But we ain't thinking 'bout them boys
Feudin, like the Hatfields and McCoys
Now the shit's gettin' tricky
'Cause now they looking for tha colorz and the Dickies
Damn, the spot's getting hot from the platter
I'm about to pack up and start slinging in Seattle
But the NARCs, raid about six in the morning
Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin
Put his Glock to my chest as I paused
Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers
Tryin' to give me, fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender ain't givin' a fuck
The fool must be sparkin
Talkin' about a double life plea bargain
You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G
Plus the Black Guerilla family
And the white pride don't like Northside
And it's a riot if any more niggaz die
No parole or probation
Now this is a young man's Summer Vacation
No chance for rehabilitation
'Cause look at the muthafucking years that I'm facing
I'mma end it like this 'cause you know what's up
My life is fucked
Police eat a dick, straight up
Look here you little goddamn nigger,
You're not gatling nobody, you fuckin' understand me?!
That's right, now get down on the goddamn
Ground! NOW! Fuckin' move! NOOWW!
Let me take a shot at him!
Rodney King, Martin Luther King, and all the
Goddamn kings of Africa!
This is the final boarding call for flight 1259
Departing from Los Angeles, final destination to St. Louis

Now this is a young man's Summer Vacation
No chance for rehabilitation
'Cause look at the muthafucking years that I'm facing
I'mma end it like this 'cause you know what's up
My life is fucked
Police eat a dick, straight up
Look here you little goddamn nigger,
You're not gatling nobody, you fuckin' understand me?!
That's right, now get down on the goddamn
Ground! NOW! Fuckin' move! NOOWW!
Let me take a shot at him!
Rodney King, Martin Luther King, and all the
Goddamn kings of Africa!
Journey with me
Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nutsac
I'm in a murderous mindsate
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck, buck, lights out
'Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggaz get hauled off
Touches your motherfuckin' flesh
Shoots your fuckin' heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to reck mine
Fool it's your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitatin', I ain't hesitatin'
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag
And your frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller
Than this graveyard filler
Cap peeler
'Cause I'm a natural born killa
Terror illistrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma
'Cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker
It feels like I'm bustin' a nut
When I open you up
'Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
'Cause I'm givin' dirt naps
Comin' with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep
'Cause ever time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin' nose
Ain't seen the sun in 66 days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never ever ever made a hoe stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how your livin'
I'm the unforgivin'
Psycho drivin' murdera
It's authentic, don't panic
I can't stand it
Goddamn it
Schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit 'em with a brick
And I'm dancin'
Mass murderer, natural born killa
And I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna
I don't wanna die
I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of sirens
Terrified screams from the streams
Of Strycnine
Dumpin' on any motherfucker tryin' to trick mine
'Cause motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dialate
It's so much pain
Migraine
Headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'm a pull a fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal just like Nirvana
Tic Toc
Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube
On some murderous shit
Keepin' niggaz in order
Makin' there live shorter
Ready to slaughter
'Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter
Or a dime
Mushroom's got my mind
Hallicinatin', ain't no debatin'
I'm creatin' an escape
Route to be out without a doubt
Scot Free so don't even think
About tryin' to stop me
'Cause I can't wait
I'm out the gate
On the for realla
A thrilla
Or a natural born killa
Gi Gi Gi Gi Ga Ga
They call me, Da Da
6 million ways to murder
Choose one, lose one soul
Bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggaz goin'
Bump in the night
Should I peely
Should I kill her in my iller
Then a natural born killa
Should I peely
Should I kill her in my iller
Then a natural born killa
Should I peely
Should I kill her in my iller
Then a natural born killa
Journey with me into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer since I came out the nutsac
I'm in a murderous mindset
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck buck, lights out
'Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggaz get hauled off
Touches your motherfuckin flesh
Barrel two
Shoots your fuckin' heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool it's your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head

Say you little son of a bitch, what choo tryin' to be?
--When I'm big I wanna be a thug--
You wanna see the bad guy?!
You need people like him, can point cha fingas!
You ready to die?! O - K A Y

'Cause they ain't touch the bad guy! oKay?--
I'm the nigga of the century

C'mon, you think you bad?
How bad you are?!--
I'm the nigga of the century
-C'mon lets see how bad you are
C'mon bad guy! C'MOAWNL!--
We the worsest, all purpose
You want murderers?
Well you Serve us, hattin' motherfuckers with curb dust
You heard us, don't shit make us nervous
Not even when these fuckin' feds try to serve us
Mention me, when you write it in your history
As a nigger with the key to the mystery
Grand motta ain word don't mean shit to me
Who gives a fuck what they think, and what they see
Live how I got to live
Give what I got to give
Teach my kids positive, as well as the negative
Hope to raise better kids
The world needs a seditive, pray to god that we let him live
--'Cause you bad guy!-- I'm the nigga of the century
--The diamond scruff!-- All you niggas better mention me
--Me that's who!-- It ain't no mystery
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me
--You better mention me!-- I'm the nigga of the century
--O - K A Y!-- All you niggas better mention me
--Me that's who!-- It ain't no mystery
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me
A nigga told me to keep hope alive
Survive, and 95 'I'll get you paradise
So I tried, nigga had to swallow his pride
But look into my eyes, I'm too wise to cook fries
Twelveth grade graduation, summer vacation
Mama said get the facin' on them applications
Didn't know back then, I was too young
Public school made me dumb as a motherfucker
What should I do in my life
Reverend Price, do you got some advice
Before I roll the dice
A nigga don't wanna shoot craps, 'cause it ain't all fun and games
When you tryin' to get that money mang
Gangbang, maintain or slang cane
TV got a nigga where he can't use his brain
What the fuck you talkin' bout, choose or loose
--'Cause you bad guy!-- I'm the nigga of the century
--The diamond scruff!-- All you niggas better mention me
--Me that's who!-- It ain't no mystery
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me
--You better mention me!-- I'm the nigga of the century
--O - K A Y!-- All you niggas better mention me
--Me that's who!-- It ain't no mystery
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me
Who am I when it's do or die
You can see a man's sould through the human eye
Can't spend all your lifetime gettin' high
'Cause you and I got to do, for you and i
Acktin' wild as a jevenile
Now my whole life depends on the outcome of a trial
Wait-pow! these people ain't playin' now
Got to bring 85 percent of the time now
Fuck that, rather roll with the ruff pack
In the jet black, listenin' to ruff rap
See it's quite simple, you bitches ass niggas don't know
What I've been through, the weather's presidential
The warfare's mental, I sell my soul to the lord
For the perfect instrumental
And the number two pencil
And all the hussle found in chromasones of my kinfolk
--'Cause you bad guy!-- I'm the nigga of the century
--The diamond scruff!-- All you niggas better mention me
--Me that's who!-- It ain't no mystery
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me
--You better mention me!-- I'm the nigga of the century
--O - K A Y!-- All you niggas better mention me

Bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!--
~I got that bomb... bomb... tit-tit...
Tity-tit... tity-tity... tity bomb... bomb... bomb
W-when I hit you uh uh uh...~
Many motherfuckers criticize pros and how they play
And many motherfuckers criticize rappers and what they say
Even though they criticize, secretly they fantasize
But they know they'll never paid be to play
Yeah
I'mma kill one of you young punks
With a old school flow
Though I walk through the shadow of death
I gotta make sure that my shoes and my outfit fresh
You bitches get jealous when you see me coming
Y'all would too if you see my woman
Y'all know what we 'bout to do
This shit here 'bout as sick as the flu
Drunk motherfuckers wanna vomit on my shoe
Niggas can't have shit prolly 'cause of you
Rappers go to jail like Oprah go to Yale
Steffan policy, don't ask, don't tell
Where my water-bees as I go get the mail?
Half black is the new black, can't you tell?
It was blue-black like Wesley Snipes in new jack
Now you got to have a white mama just to do that
Tiger Woods, he used to be a safe nigga
Go ahead and let your daughter have a date with him
He'll make with her prolly in a wife-beater
Tiger 'bout to change his name to cheater
I don't like it when you call me Big Poppa
From South Central and I hate helicopters
If we at school, I'll break in your locker
See me with a water bottle mixed with some vodka
Drink responsibly or drink constantly
Be who you wanna be in this economy
Drunk as Sean Connery at the finery
Can't throw me out, motherfucker, I'm the honoree
Trust me, I'll never be the nominee
I don't kiss enough ass, I'm too honery
Ice Cube, be where the piranhas be
Swimmin' upstream, eatin' all kinda meat
West Coast treat it like hyenas
Take what you want from these lying ass cheaters
Eat the fuck out these big cat beavers
That's how we act when you don't wanna feed us
Crazy motherfucker ever since I was a fetus
Might as well join us, you ain't gonna beat us
Please believe us, you can ask Jesus
I'mma be here 'bout as long as Regis
Understand, I never pledge of allegiance
See this ball of confusion might cause a conclusion, boy
I see you're cruising for a bruising
Fucking with a principal that don't like students
Don't you know that tension is a lynching?
And if I fail to mention then I'm spinning out my pension
The reason I home in
'Cause this right here ain't no country for young men
Sunny, you done fucked up the churches money
I'm red fox and you that big dummy
This junkyard was a empire
Y'all let it get overran by vampires
Most MCs is God damn liars
Like them supervisors working up McGisors?
Bitch, I'm not a dodger I'm a Laker punk
You's a fucking clipper, you can call me Jack the Ripper, cut you up
By your gizzard then down by your liver
Rooter by the tooter, gut you like flipper
Dipper y'all better treat me like the skipper
Head trigga, the air nigga
Air honkey and air critter
I come thourhg and kill every litter
No country for young men
It's just a ball of confusion
No country for young men
Your world is just an illusion
No country for young men
It's just a ball of confusion
No country for young men
Your world is just an illusion
Fuck all y'all!
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK,
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Lookin' like straight bozos?
I saw it comin', that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all muthaphukkaz moved Straight outta Compton
One big house, and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo,
Dropped four Niggaz, now I'm makin' all the dough
White man just rulin'
The Niggaz With Attitude -- who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggaz just phony
I put that on my mama and my Dead Homiez
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losin'
Aiyo Dre, stick to producin'
Callin' me Arnold, but you Benedict
Eazy E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company,
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me
Tryin' to sound like AmeriKKKa's Most?
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flown,
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B,
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're gettin' fucked out your green
By a white boy with no Vaseline...
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're gettin' fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick is smellin' like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to Let a ho be a ho
So I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls,
'Cause I heard you're, like, givin' up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella,
Gettin' money out your ass, like a muthaphukkin' Ready Teller
Givin' up the dollar bills,
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say,
'Cause he's goin' out like Kunta Kinte,
But I got a whip for ya Toby;
Used to be my homie,
Now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer,
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga, gotta run and hide!
Yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren,
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfuckin' joke, they let you on the scene
To back up the Verse Team
It ain't my fault one nigga got smart,
And they rippin' your asshole apart
By takin' your green
Oh yeah --- the Villain does get fucked with no vaseline
I never have dinner with the President---
I never have dinner with the President---
I never have dinner with the President,
And when I see your ass again, I'll be blasting it
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella ---
Fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me,
Eazy-E would be hangin' from a tree
With no Vaseline ---
Just a match, and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on...
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation,
Off the Massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga! What you thinkin' bout?!
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Niggaz4Life crew
With a white Jew tellin' you what to do
Pullin' wools with your scams;
Now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Punk, always into somethin', gettin' fucked at night
By Mista Shitpacker
Bend over for the Goddamn cracker
No Vaseline...
I can show you the pawls and bawls, the Taj Mahal
To the strip in M.I.A
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Prague
To the beaches in Tropez
I can show you the world, girl, the world, girl
But ain't nothin' else like LA
I can show you the world, girl, the world, girl
But ain't nothin' else like LA
Nothin' like LA
They got the wrong impression
They got to learn their lesson
It's such an obsession
I'm just an exception
When I come to you, girl, I need your affection
Every time you walk by, you get my inspection
And all you gotta do now is make your selection
And it won't be hard to win this election
I can show you the pawls and bawls, the Taj Mahal
To the strip in M.I.A
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Prague
To the beaches in Tropez
I can show you the world, girl, the world, girl
But ain't nothin' else like LA
I can show you the world, girl, the world, girl
But ain't nothin' else like LA
Nothin' like LA
I done been around the world, I ain't impress
I can't wait till we hit LAX
Tokyo is cool, yeah, I feel the U.K.
But can nothin' fuck with California-A
Especially LA and I'm feelin' the bay
But nothin' like rollin' down PCH
Top down, west bound, it's all good
You don't go Hollywood when you from Hollywood
Let's go to the hood and fuck with the haters
Then to the Staples Center and hang with the Lakers
Number 6 is cool but 24 is the champ
And even D. Wade and Chris Bosh know that
I can show you the pawls and bawls, the Taj Mahal
To the strip in M.I.A
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Prague
To the beaches in Tropez
I can show you the world, girl, the world, girl
But ain't nothin' else like LA
I can show you the world, girl, the world, girl
But ain't nothin' else like LA
Nothin' like LA
The BET awards and even the Grammys
They always pick LA over Miami
I love Miami, I ain't dissin' Miami
But where would you rather get robbed for your Grammy?
Ain't nothin' like Sunset Boulevard
Compton and watch if you wanna be hard
We got it all, what you thought not at all
If you sick of this shit then take a Tylenol
It's just me and my woman verses all of y'all
And we takin' a bow for our curtain call
The angels is lost, they don't wanna be found
If God is lookin' for 'em, I can show Him around
I can show you the pawls and bawls, the Taj Mahal
To the strip in M.I.A
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Prague
To the beaches in Tropez
I can show you the world, girl, the world, girl
But ain't nothin' else like LA
I can show you the world, girl, the world, girl
But ain't nothin' else like LA
Nothin' like LA
It's on like Donkey Kong
You wanted that fast buck
Now I gotta light that ass up
The nigga with the big fat trigger
Don't test me, gravedigger had to take a swig
Of the ST, remember the time we first met up
You threw your set up now you gotta get wet up
Boom! ping! buck! pow!
Now who's that nigga with the diff'rent style?
Uh, ya wanted ta trip
It's all about the clip and who can empty it
First mate, they made day AK
And I'll Kurtis Blow ya ass away like AJ
I'm almost certain I'm put on the hurtin'
Bitch, it's curtains!
Locced in my motherfuckin head
Gotta play connect-the-dots with my infrared
You in danger, Mr Gangbanger
It ain't cool to take nappy from a stranger
Wit'cha drive-by's it took time to catch ya
But now I gotta wet'cha
S-I-M-I
Valley for the KKK, rally
A place on the map where the order is
4 devils can beat up a motorist
And get nothin' but a slap on the wrist
Gorillas, gorillas report to the mist
The fist of fury and I'ma shove em
Motherfuck the jury and who ever love em
Why you have to leave it to Beaver?
Now I'm chasin Beaver' ass with a cleaver
With the swing, swing, swing and chop, chop, chop
Get them on, nigga
'Cause tonight we're havin' chopped liver
And I'ma cut out'cha heart
Start the fryin pan for the devil a'la carte
Twelve motherfuckers ya better be glad I never
Met'cha
'Cause I'm gonna wet'cha
Now wet motherfuckers are bloody
'Cause a bullet'll mould your ass like silly putty
Right into shape
A hollow point'll run up in ya like ya got weight
Comin' out'cha back, Mr Mack
Now they got yo' guts in a sack
Use to have ya crew real fat in a huddle
Now you're wet in a puddle, here is the Ice Cube
Rebuttle
You ain't gotta chance, 'cause even if my bullet just
Glance
Ya still wet your pants
So what'cha wanna do when I got'cha ass point blank
Ya guaranteed to spank
Stiff as a board, ya floored
Go meet the Lord and then get ignored
'Cause you're on your way to hell and that I can
Bet'cha
That's why I had to wet'cha
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - who is it? 
It's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggers in the parking lot
She said fuck em, 'cause they get sparked alot
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
And then I put my nikes on the coffee table
Her brother walked in he's into gangbangin
'Cause he walked up and said what set you claimin
I don't bang I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of good times
I hate to feel bad but I'm in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt
She said please excuse my house and all that
I said yeah 'cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin' at a fucked up black and white
Her mom's bitchin cause the county check wasn't right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig
'Cause I was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids
They were runnin' and playin' and cursin and yellin'
And tellin' and look at this young punk bailin
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her mom's got the 12 gauge mossberg
The nigga said yo, what's for sale
And the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars
From a smoked out fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said bitch I didn't know this was a crack house
I got my coat and suddenly ...
The cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome
And I said to myself once again it's on
He threw me on the carpet no slap jumped back
Stomped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to wrap me up, slap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said get out my face I musta had a grudge
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge
The girl I was with wasn't sayin' nothin'
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell 'em somethin'
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the patty wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects!
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - who is it? 
It's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggers in the parking lot

First he tried to wrap me up, slap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said get out my face I musta had a grudge
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge
The girl I was with wasn't sayin' nothin'
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell 'em somethin'
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the patty wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects!
Once upon a time in the projects yo
I damn near had to wreck a hoe
Baby up in two-ten, is on a nigga
Bendin over pickin' up her mail, she can tell I'm dyin' to get her
I'm sittin' in yo' livin' room, slash kitchen
A nigga ain't tryin' to be the fuckin' groom so stop bitchin
Some nigga in a eighty-kay, yo' baby daddy
Here we go with mo' drama in the projects
Wait a minute, who is this motherfucker?
You better take his ass in the back, and start talkin'
Nick that bud 'fore it bloom, and start stalkin
Youse a fool if you think that I'm jumpin' in
That nigga jet, smokin' on a ciggarette
You say domestic shit, get you soakin wet?
Well come widdit and get it, blow my socks
While I'm drinkin' all the kool-aid, watchin jamie foxx
This fool wearin black, his girl, in the see through
Niggaz tell me you got a house full of platinum...
Where the platinum at motherfucker?
Wait a minute motherfucker, this my house!
Once upon a time, once upon a time
I'm like baffled, they got me gaffled, with the duct tape
Another knock, it's the girl from two-ten
Here to drop salt, that's when them bitches fought
I thought, i bet-ta plan my escape
In the midst of this commotion, ice cube is breakin tape
I'm free, bombin on the first thing I see
And guess who walk in, with a nine, and a grin
He started layin everybody down, about face with a frown
I'm runnin' to the bedroom, I lock the do'
And grab the phone, the bitch phone ain't turned on
I think I'm gone, that's when I hear a soft knock
It's the girl from two-ten, with her number, and a glock
Said, call me up, if it's for sex, or chin check
Nigga get you a real ass bitch from the projects!
And I just might do that
Once upon a time, once upon a time
Attention all nigga rows and nigga hoes
We've decided to rob this motherfucker the legal way
Nobs injecting ourselves to become property on the stock
In the penal system. in the justice system
As the world turns, it burns while it's spinning
Coming to a fucked-up ending
I can't wait till the day everything in the hood is straight
And I can hit the purty gates
Until then, the pen is unfair
Bellin' in court, lookin' like a scarecrow
On capital hill, they them passed a bill
The judge gave me a 'l'
But y'all can't tell
I wait and cry in my cell
Convicted negro, superhero
Speaker at our house
Takin' lyrics in my mouth
Mix a lot, got hoes puttin' titties on the glass
We blast in the west for example
And rap about this shit over funkadelic samples
And straight call me a g
Penitentiary, I hear you calling me
Penitentiary, I hear you calling me
Thinkin' of illegal ways to get paid
But it ain't shit, got to be legit
South-central l.a.
You can buy your game from the c.i.a., hey-hey
And south-central l.a.
You can buy your game from the c.i.a. baby
When the evil outweighs the good
And you only give a fuck about rucks
Plus we got a black mayor
Would you like a piece of me? not a mate
My world is a one-mile radius
Could the crips and bloods be all rotten
When the trilateral commission is plottin'?
What you gonna do when the earth erupts?
Fool you on master's woe
Asshole from the senate
How can you relate to a project tennant?
Motherfuck you and not the courtman, no corrections
Tryina' get a section of this west-side connection
Just because you gotta stay
You ain't gotta rot away
We gon' come and get you one day
Be this hour, I have done weeping.
Thy have poppeth my coochie 'til I can't poppeth
No more!
And titties teetering on times this & a ass the size of Alaska.
What's up baller, I'm an owner now
You niggas ball for me, I be kickin' it up in my suite
Lookin' down ain't none of y'all fuckin' with me
I'm like a bully that you mothafuckas hating to see
Better whisper my name, like The Wizard of OZ
If you say it three times, a lyrical barrage
This is not a mirage, there's no way to dodge
This Cobair engine, met before it collaged
I'm swearin to god, this worse than Jihad
Fuckin' with Cube, is like the Book of Eli
I'm pullin my blade, I'm slicin you bastards
You local mothafuckas, I rap to the masses
You internet bitches, My pen is so vicious
The genies' out the bottle, and grantin no wishes
Before you attack, ya should've asked Mack
He would've told ya I'm the architect of Gangsta Rap
You mothafuckas in the D-League, I'm in the G-League
I got the most money, I smoke the best weed
I got the best kids, And the best life
With a fine wife, Nigga I'm in paradise
Amateurs think it's easy, but you and that bitch
Ain't about to be the next george and weezy, Just pay to see me
I'm a pro with a show that's incredible, You better let it go
Better learn how to do the dougie
Before I rap you in a snuggy and push you in the buggy
This is Ice Cube, know the people love me
Yeah, yeah
Blaze one for the nation
Brrrrr
Brrrrr
Brrrrr
I got lyrics that wake up spirits
They told me how to make big hits and spend digits, can you dig it?

With four or five niggas that's musclebound
Send your head to the taxidermist
Won't be satisfied, till I get my face on a thermos

Got to live it, or we gots to visit who is it,

Fresh out the trenches, the wood works
City of the ?tempeon?, where the hoods lurk
In search of the rich blocks, to lick spots, and kick rocks
From shattered glass, down the pig locks
Want tips by the clock you niggas scramblin for fouyan
And settle for crumbs and croutans
I'm out for armored bucks and armored trucks, with armed killas
Bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos
Ain't no harmin me, the army full honary niggas you can't see
So while you pace bitches and saturns livin' jenky
I hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankey
After ben frankeys,
With the big skullen eyes you niggas bound and nullified
Sit back and mine stack it multiply
Ask about me

If you got a herringbone, welcome to the terrordome
Two-eleven, sorry reverend

{And who the fuck are you? }
Thirty in a holdin' tank, catch the vapors

Concrete bench kickin off the hemorrhoids
Ese's deep, don't fuck with dem boys
Phone check, co-llect call from the baller
Her mama said please don't call her
Seen one of my peers, what the fuck you doin' in here? 
He said, one-eighty-seven on the enemy
And they treat me like I just shot a kennedy!
Deputy bitch thinks she's the queen bee
Ink on my thumb, index, and pinky
Sir, what set you from?  play dumb
General popu-la-tion
Mama put your house up, and I can bounce up
Out this motherfucker, that's why I love ya

So don't run up, wit ya gun up
'Cause I got the back breaker, double pump rump shaker
'Cause we can play hookie in the aqua boogie
With concrete nikes, ya gets no stripes
Livin' unforgiven with the mic on
And punks runnin' like roaches with the light on
And that's all the shit I'm startin
You lookin' for a punk with benefits
Cause you got a baby, that take many shits
And you know I got a grip like a baby on a tit
Scopin hopin, thighs open
But I kick back, six-pack, and hit the phillie slow
Hooker hoe - really doe

Please listen to my demo {x8}
A nigga told me, the record company's the pimp
The artist is the hoe, The stage is the corner
And the audience is the trip, god damn
Incredible young nigga, you can't believe I'm just one nigga
God damn I've gotten bigger
Intellect superior,
Walk in a room and make the whole interior, inferior
If you look me in my eyes
You might fuck around and loose control of your mind body and your soul
Grab ahold
Undisputed on the microphone, what choo think
If you wink, I'll make you ich think
Did you blink, did you ever drink your own brain matter
Shotgun enima, this ain't no cinema
All praises due to the creator
--For this man here, that can't no nigga stand near--
True, inventor of the double-you
What choo wanna do, I got the red and the blue
Show me one nigga dedicated to raps
I'll show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps
Record company death traps settin' decoys
Just to pimp young b-boys
With a cup full of yak, studio contact
Maniac with a contract
Well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble
About to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level
Bullshit points, plus he want to rub it in
And take all my publishin', god damn
Do I take it up the rectum
Just to rock the spectrum
Give up a right arm, just to do a form
Hell no, all you motherfukers goan leave this bitch limpin'
No more, record company pimpin'
No more No more No more No more
I'ma keep it simple, it went from please listen to my demo
To get your ass out my limo
Stretch presidential
It's essential 'cause the record company will have your ass in a rental
If you let 'em, You have to behead 'em
Contracts you never read 'em
CEO's you never met 'em
Sent to an atourney, Burnstein and Burney
Nigga that's his lawyer, ain't got nothin' for ya
Treat ya like they emloy ya, I'm a warrior
Bite you in the ass like a Georgetown Hoya
When they ignore ya cause, you got to hold your balls
Catch a motherfucker slippin' in bathroom stalls
And then you show 'em that you ain't a rookie
Let 'em know that you'd rather have, more points than more pussy
Pimp turned bookie
Now how the fuck I get in so much debt
God damn, we just met
Welcome to the rap game
Motherfucker be confused and broke before he know what's happenin'
You can be the star and fuck women
I'ma just play the back and keep winnin'
No more No more No more No more
It went from please listen to my demo
To get your ass out my limo {x4}
Mama's, don't let your kids grow up to be rappers
Unless you tell them if they gonna get in this business
They better learn this business

You messed around and let me read up

Ice cube nigga you better D up
And when I come by bitch, you better be up
Ass suck, face in the pillow

Got to do my thizzle
The only nizzle that I never ever fizzled
Origional, you niggas know

Hit you wit these things that I'm holding
Who wanna squab wit that frozen
Now who wanna battle with the chosen
You niggas lotion

I lined up ten dicks and took out appendix
So go get forensics
Let 'em know I'm geronimo
Till it's my time to go
You better find your ho
Get yer babies and your momma
And move to Guantanamo
Doubt my skills I'm payin' my bills
I'm up in the hills
You niggas are kills
Even though I'm on a fucked up label
You bitches know what I can bring to the table
This right here it's payback
From way back I don't play that x 4
I like bitches like you
Find two wearing light blue
The freak get high too
With a fly do
Not a Erika Vado
Tha's looking for an eye do
Now what can I buy you
Just to try you
Need another bitch to lie to
Need another bitch at my cool
Oh please can I trouble you
For a double scoop
A nigga need some TNA
Now you cna dick but you can't get no DNA
I heard you was a big freak
I like Mike and Ikes
I like watching dykes
I like going to fights
I like earning my stripes
In the book of life
There's only two women
Big ol good ones
And good ol big ones
My job is to tell it like it is..
See who the fuck I'ma jack today
Nigga broke, shit
And it's early in the mornin
Today I'm going to tell you the story of Robin Hood
At last, grab my ski-mask out the closet
Now let's see how big did my balls get?
I brush my teeth - it takes a thief
Swervin, 'cause I'm tryin' to roll up the chronic leaf
At a stop sign, I take a hit and hold it on
Drivin' down the two-lane highway
It's all bad, thinkin' bout shit I never had
Knowin' I can do my best in Westwood
Cut off by a white BM, driven by a yuppie
He sticks up his finger like, Fuck me
Now I gotta to follow him HOME, with my CHROME
Send him to the Twilight ZONE, it's ON
Niggaz say I'm gone 'cause I'm fuckin' with the rich
Don't need a snitch, so I'm rollin' solo
In a straight bucket, no it ain't a low-low
He pulls up to a seven bedroom, eight bath
Oh yeah! He's got to feel the wrath
Tied his ass up and took everything I could
A nigga straight robbin, mobbin, back to the hood
Since two-eleven is my favorite number
Holy Bandit! Leave yo' ass stranded and you know that
Unhook the LoJack, cellular phone under the flo' mat
Actin' like your ninety-five Coupe, is headed fo'
Beirut they wanna shoot me like a terrorist
Trigger finger got blisters
Heard from your sisters, you be rollin' on the twisters
Now when we meet, I can make your heart beat...
... And make you feel, so neat
Or you can get us fifteen
I'm king of the Slim Jim, it's the incredible
Nine-oh-two-one-oh, is where I'm headed foe
Don't need no Merry Men, I fuck around and bury them
Motherfuckers got to know that I'm lethal
Steal from the rich, and slide it to my people
I stalk, rich ass people like Hudson Hawk
Bitch don't talk, let's take a walk
Nigga got nuttin to lose, you know the rules
The purse and the jewels or the eleven o'clock news
Which one? Magnum gun to the titties
Makin' scared devils, move from my city
With the strong-arm, fuck the long arm of the law
Had to clock her with the handle, cause
Your husband's a thief with an S&L scandal
Don't feel bad if you're stuck up, ah
Nobody move, nobody get - shut the fuck up!
I'm nervous, quick to serve this
Heat in yo' meat, make your blood skeet
A nigga just tryin' to get on his feet
So hurry up rich bitch, before I twitch
She said, Don't rape me, and don't kill me
Nigga don't want to fuck, yo' filthy ass
Just give me the cash and we good
All I wanna do is rob you on my way to the hood
You know somethin' Robin? You're takin' too many chances.
You must be joking!
You're takin' too many chances.

Now, how wide can that ass get?
It's gettin' drastic
Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night
I got a full tank of unleaded

Should of picked up an old girl that I know

About to get an attitude, what's hapenin'?
Baby, how you actin'?

Well then, bitch, you got to go
I put her ass out, on Imperial
Ho slammed my door next to Texico
Kick my Lexo, broke my window
Put out my indo
Jumped out and said bitch, are you crazy?
Fucked around and got lazy
She jumped in my car, took off, now I'm stuck
And all iI want to do was fuck

I had a full tank of unleaded
I had a full tank of unleaded
I got a full tank of unleaded
I got a full tank of unleaded

Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night

But shit, I was around 8, but, bitch, it's gettin' late
If I wrap my dick in plastic
Now, how wide can that ass get?
It's gettin' drastic
Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night
I got a full tank of unleaded
I got a full tank of unleaded
Should of picked up an old girl that I know
That's what I get for fucking with you young hoes
About to get an attitude, what's hapenin'?
Baby, how you actin'?
No?
Well then, bitch, you got to go
I put her ass out, on Imperial
Ho slammed my door next to Texico
Kick my Lexo, broke my window
Put out my indo
Jumped out and said bitch, are you crazy?
Fucked around and got lazy
She jumped in my car, took off, now I'm stuck
And all iI want to do was fuck
I had to stroll all day, I had to walk all night
I had a full tank of unleaded
I had a full tank of unleaded
You can't fuck with the criminal rapping over gangsta shit
First I load the clip and then I make the hit
I know some y'all can't fade this
Lench mob niggas are the craziest
So you and your boys are ass-out
When I'm rollin' in a seven-deuce glass house
The mob ain't nothing but a menace
When we get the motherfucking dog in us
Playing them old beats
I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies
Ready to peel your cap
You can't believe faces of death on wax
Some say the mob ain't positive
Man fuck that shit 'cause I gots to live
How I live and you could either give a fuck punk
Yo or get your ass bucked
Some rappers are heaven-sent
But self-destruction don't pay the fucking rent
So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job
I'd rather roll it wit the lench mob
To be down with the mob is simple
Mind your own you want a spot find your own
And take mine if you're badder than the strong man
I do the right thing I do the wrong thing
Do anything 'cause I ain't faking the scene
It's all about how much bacon you bring
And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it
Yo you ain't seen nothing
'Cause if you testify you're living blind
Cause in the city you live and let die
Rolling with the fools one time can't beat
On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet
He said i know you I said you might
My name is ice cube I did a song you didn't like
So he soaked me up like bounty
Had to do a week in the county
A piece of cake it was just like a party
Cause in the county you know everybody
No I didn't kill or steal or rob
Locked up for what 'cause I'm rollin' wit the lench mob
If you know a female that's rollin' with the lench mob
Watch your step cause the gat is kept
In the purse like my homegirl yo-yo
You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no
'Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out
After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out
Get the picture or bitch
You'll get the eighty-six
If she wanna try and mix
Business and pleasure make up your own mind
You gotta be a hoe on your own time
Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep
Yo the mob is still deep
And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit
You thought you got with the crew you can't get with
So get the noose ready for the lynching
Now 235 is what I'm benching
But nowadays it's still not enough
I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush
Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job
Rolling with the motherfucking lench mob
Good evening. police, do not try to adjust your radios. there is nothing
Wrong. we have takin' control over this city as to bring you this special
Bulletin and we will return this motherfucker to ya as soon as the national
Guard move in.
The cops wanna catch the nigga that won't fetch
But I'll blast ya, never call ya master
Who is that kickin up shit much faster?
Rollin' on a scooter, you know I might do ya
See a black clock and my buckshots run right through ya
I never knew ya
'Cause I'm not a trick
You can suck the biggity-dick, I'm not the piggity-pig
I get away quickity-quick
On the plane to south central
Never get played by the monkey wrench ho
Staedy mobbin I'm just like robin hood
Up to no good, so many bitches on my wood
To the right of me and to the left of me
Bitch, I got so much game I need a referee
Throw a penalty of ass interference
Damn, y'all over me, so bitch get on the bitch
Here comes the cops so I better hit the fence
Better run fast 'cause the dobermans pinch
And I won't play mine in the daytime
Goddamn, here comes the canine
Four legged copper that wants to use ice cube as a whopper
But who's the first nigga to outrun a chopper?
No lie say hi to the bad guy
What? you gon' gaf... yeah!
See one-time, hit 'em up
'Cause you know the lench mob is down to get 'em up
People think ice cube roll with the gangs
'Cause I'm in a coupe de sittin' on thangs
Ain't gotta tell me twice about the jack
See a got a 9 in my lap ta take care of that
Caps get peeled on the regular
'Cause niggas try to get me for my cellular
Knick knack paddy wack, the mack daddy's back
Kidnappin hos like the patty hurst jack
Have the white ho, where the fo'-fo'?
Go rob a liquor store, they can't blame it on a nigga row
Bring the money to the rooster

And come back up man
You wanna point the finger at me 'cause the og

Humpin, jumpin', had the place jumpin'

California air
Chain all blue like it's runnin' out of air
I keep a bad bitch with a fat derriere
And you know that hoe fresher than a new pair
Retro elevens on the pedal, I'm taking this to the next level
Competition best to dress up in a Chevelle
And if you niggas still wanna make a deal with the devil
I can help you meet him, introduce you to my barrel
All you artists walkin' round with yo wack raps
They gettin' fucked by the game, Kat Stacks
They gettin' fucked by the game, Kat Stacks

And I'm fuckin' all they bitches

And it's money over bitches

Smoke big trees

West coast style baby, on some California shit
They might've told ya that I was hard on the bitch
You know how it go, some bitches think they slick
Look at me and think they about to get rich
Uh, oh, uh, oh, danger, danger

Last coast, motherfucker
Last toast, motherfucker
Old money, old money, old money, old money
Old money, old money, old money, old money
Old money, old money, old money, old money
Old money, old money, old money, old money
Old money, new money, no money, nose money
Don't try to turn the Godfather into sonny
Don't try to turn your forefathers into money
The rap guy got the whole world prayin' for me
Crazy tunes DJ it for me
I'm the real Iron Man
You just rub it down me
I'm crack head and black face
Fresh out the country, nigger

Look, mamma, look, mamma
I'm soul on Ice
Look, mamma, look, mamma
I'm soul on Ice
Look, mamma, look, mamma

Hey
Fuck a ghost writer sittin' in the back
Of the studio, tryin' to write a nigga rap
It's the muppet show,
Ice Cube, true MC,
Write everything I say, even back in the day
I'm a spit it, how I feel it, fuck a gimmick
You can keep your catchy lines, I'm a 'bout to write a rhyme
If you got a backpack, tryin' to act black
Think you know the culture, you's a fuckin' vulture
You never a approached the mic
You dress like a dyke, sayin' what you don't like
Who deserves five mics, who deserves two
But the nigga wit two still can serve you
This West Coast flow is different in the East
But in ain't no different in the streets
I'm spittin' pollaseeds - I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one 'cause I don't want to be greedy
Cause the salt might make it so
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one 'cause I don't want to be greedy
Cause, these niggas is salty
Will make you choke oh oh
You miggas got me fucked-up
I'm spittin' pollaseeds on the porch with the torch
In case these niggas come around to see the porsche
When I branish, muthafuckers vanish
They don't understand like a nigga speak in Spanish
No comprende, me no speak no enlgeh
Now you doin' shit like Darrel Stingleeh
Don't get stung by the muthafuckin sting ray
Keep it movin niggas, y'all better king me
Put your rap careers up on ebay
Crazy toons is the muthafuckin' D.J.
Baby drop to your knees, he deserves a bj
I got a big brother, nicknamed cj
When you see him in the hood take it eazy
If you a breezeh, take him to the heezeh
Do him like Halley Barry did Michael Eleeh
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one 'cause I don't want to be greedy
Cause the salt might make it so
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one 'cause I don't want to be greedy
Cause, these niggas is salty
Will make you choke oh oh
You miggas got me fucked-up
I ain't playin'
I got pulled over by the police
And I had some pollaseeds in my hand
The police pulled me over and said
2017, we got a young black nigga over here
Age 18, look like he's 35
Look like he drinkin' a henesee, and smoke every night
I need back up
This Nigga might have a 22 with duck tape on the handle
Wit the twista Hit ya, It's the chippa
Pistol grip, the sciff scippa, ready to finger rear view mirror
Ready to bust wit my bandanna bumpin oldies
Cube, throw me the line like golden the kobe
So I can bust a cripwalk on these niggas
Yellow tape, bark these niggas, fuck all these salty niggas
They can't hold our shit
Gangsta rap ain't dead, muthafuckers just stole our shit
All y'all niggas know its alamoni
All y'all did is switch yo name and ate a style up like ravioli
Own your club raps and pisses talk shit
I'll knock your Comm-A-Dee glasses off ya face under the transmission nigga
From the West side, fuckin' up the program
Wit the surplus, Highly hangin' up the blow hand
Dub-zizzala Tippin on them drolics indeed
Spittin' shells at you niggas like pollaseeds
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one 'cause I don't want to be greedy
Cause the salt might make it so
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one 'cause I don't want to be greedy
Cause, these niggas is salty
Will make you choke oh oh
You miggas got me fucked-up.
Now is the time...
C'mon y'all
Stand tall, live your life to the limit
Cause haterism seem like a fucking epidemic
And look at Ice Cube, I ain't no gimmick
I'm straight from the hood, I got to represent it
Now - every day I think about my color
And all the crazy shit we do to one another
I ain't your blood brother, but I'm your 'cause brother
Let's take it back to the love and how it was brother
If not, we gon' pull these triggers
Show the world we deserve to be called niggaz
I make a fuck-up, like Don Imus
Bow on his knees, and call me yo' highness
You can too, you got the power to
Don't let this motherfuckin system devour you
I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowin' you
But check it out I understand what you goin' through
But remember, brothers and sisters
You can still, stand, tall
Just be thankful...
For what you got
I know what y'all motherfuckers thinking, heh heh
Here comes another rapper with a song about hope
All you wanna hear is a song about dope
And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope
But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap
No~! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note
Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes
And some of our people used to hang from trees
Now the only thing hangin' muh'fucker is DEEZ
So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right
Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke
I'm the sunlight, too bright to look
When it's all said and done I should write the book
You too cool for school, too old to know?
Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow
I understand, it ain't no love lost
But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus
Yeah, f'real
I was born in the mud but I came out clean
That's till the government tried to intervene
Tried to lock me up when I was only 19
Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream
I make shit raw that piss off the law
If you want some fake shit turn this off
If you want some realness I know you can feel this
Maybe we can heal this just like an illness
Black on black, I got'cho back
People don't think that we know how to act
Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack
And the CIA, won't take it back
Never on top, always on the bottom
Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham
'Cause I can tell you now it's gon' turn out rotten
Keep on pushin, get 'em till we got 'em
Stand up, f'real...
Raise your hand if you sick of this bullshit
God damn, the bigger the cap the bigger the peelin
And when dealin' with the Lench Mob you gots to know
Steady Mobbin is not just the name of this jam, but a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers that's known
To break 'em off somethin', give it to me
Four or five niggaz in a mothership
Better known as a goose and we all wanna smother shit
Bent, front and back glass got tint
Tryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools can't hold us
Every chance we get, we hittin up the rollers
Comin' up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin bean pies
Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
With U Can't Touch This on the front
I'm bout to get rich
Cause life ain't nuttin but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama hoes
So after the screwin
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
I'm out the do'
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
'Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch, 'cause I'm steady mobbin
Bustin' caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
'Cause I'm gettin' major
Fuck Pac Tel, move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends
Don't drink 8 Ball, cause St. Ide's is givin' ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin in the street
Niggaz get mad, tempers are flarin
'Cause they got a few bitches starin'
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches, make for happy Feds
I'm making my duty to cuss em
Out, 'cause I just don't trust em
And if you tell on me I'm bombin on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin
Since one-time so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the glock
And I'm rollin' on rims
Eating soul food, and neckbones from M&M's
Grumblin like a motherfucker
Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bailin'
When I hit a left, I moved felon, 'Whattup loc?'
Don't you know that niggaz get smoked
That take they life for a joke, get in nigga
I take you to the pad zoom
Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my low rider
Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps
But hoes lickin' us like stamps
One fool brought the music for the yams
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch
'Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Give me the nappy and make me happy
The hoe said 'Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?'
I said yeah, but I don't play sex
When I'm putting on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night, no longer steady mobbin
God damn, the bigger the cap the bigger the peelin
And when dealin' with the Lench Mob you gots to know
Steady Mobbin is not just the name of this jam, but a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers that's known

Before somebody say don't fuck with Cube you know!
I'll strip you in your living room
Face down, paralyzed from the waist down
I'm a buckin' clown, but don't fuck around
Doin' movies now, but I'll lay you down
South Central style, pull them thangs out
Don't make a millionare have to send you there
You know the story of the tortoise nigga and the hare
Nigga run nigga run never get there
I'm a walk, fuck a bitch when I get there
Nigga this a marathon, ask Farrakhan
Fuck the cemetery that I'm buried on fuck 'em
The blood of Ice Cube got to carry on forever
Forever what the fuck are they yellin'?
Gangsta Gangsta, stop tellin' ... stop snitchin'
You can have whatever you want
In the hood, it's do's and don't's
So when it get hot in this kitchen
Stop snitchin, nigga stop snitchin
Microphone master, super rhyme maker
Gun blaster, who's the life taker
Who?
Who the fuck is a lifetime Laker?
I slap the Maybeline off Tammy Faye Baker
Who the fuck got more than an acre?
In Los Angeles I got to have paper
I'm a nigga, don't talk to my neighbors
Straight ass----, always up in Vegas
Lay it out for these niggas to follow
Get the point, but these points is hollow
Now this here, is hard to swallow
But if you do it's like hittin' the lotto
Little nigga with big bravado
Hit the throttle niggas hit the bottle
Can give a fuck if they life is hollow
Where the fuck was you, when I rocked the Apollo, bitch?
Ay, who put this thing together? Me, that's who
Who I trust? Who I trust? Me, that's who!
Nigga, nigga, nigga, can't you see
Somehow your words incarcerate me
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Lock me up in my prime, Alex Mohammad
Get out whip your ass like Alex Mohammad
Rumble in the Jungle, nigga don't play Dumbo
In the hood nigga known as Columbo
Get the people on the phone, tell the jumble
Spit fluid and swear he didn't do it
Got my bottom bitch locked up with Martha Stewart
She say she had the hoe cookin deep dish
She say Martha fuckin' cook fish and eat fish
Westside y'all niggas got to peep this
That's your weakness, can't keep a secret
Don't say shit, boy that's basic
They want to send a nigga back to the slave ship
Stop snitchin'
You can have whatever you want
In the hood, it's do's and don't's
So when it get hot in this kitchen
Stop snitchin, nigga stop snitchin
You can have whatever you choose
But out here, it's don't's and do's
So after we finish this mission
Stop snitchin, nigga stop snitchin'.

Hustle mang, hustle mang, hustle mang
Haha, today was a good day
Sometimes I just get on my knees you know what I mean
And pray to the man with the master plan
Lord have mercy, my people so thirsty
Come feed 'em, either Jesus or Mohammad
All we get is vomit, come like a comet
Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach
Only you can do it, Imma learn from it
Do what I gotta do, try not to plum it
America used to shoot like reptiles
Don't worry tomorrow, let's get this right now
They wanna run us in the ground
Educate yourself, before they dumb you down
Get your money boy, the legal way
Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may
Now rich white men they got the world fucked up
Why should I give a fuck about a Styrofoam Cup
Environmental saying, but if I go green
You know what I mean bitch
Ice Cube for President, let's just do it for the hell of it
See how I run the government
Make money irrelevant
I might tell a chick, it's illegal to resell of it
Secret service don't know where the hell I went
Sorry y'all, I had to fuck a super delicate
Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama
American dream, Ice Cube and yo mama
The Terminator, are you Sarah Conner?
Arnold Swarchznegger, can kill who he wanna
In California, they strap you to a jurny
And murder your ass, in front of your atourney
Do you really wanna take this journey?
And scared of none of y'all, muthafuckers like bernie
Mad step back, I got the mac 11
Unlike Obama, Imma have to back my Reveron
Now the Lord is my sheppard
My flow is respected, world wide
In the west I got to rep it
So please check it, cause my style is infected
With the virus, Ice Cube's the ocyeros
I bailed through, they wanna put up in bail view
'Cause my point of view is not red, white and blue
It's black and blue residue
I know what crack can do, to a whole fuckin' avenue
Spit on it, and they'll get mad at you
You know I do this bullshit for your gratitude
Imma Nigga Witta Attitude
Imma do what I gotta do, just to change my latitude
In the system, rollin' with my diamonds glicnin
And niggas listenin', from your local prison
Imma prism, your only vision is a rainbow in the sky
When I spit the ism
I do gangsta rap.
They want to blame the world problems on gangsta rap.
It's our fault 'cause muthafuckers is dyin' in Iraq.
It's our fault 'cause muthafuckers is starvin' in Africa.
It's gangsta rap's fault that people are poor.
Can't get enough to fuckin' eat or live their life.
That's rap music's fault.
It's rap music's fault that we got all these god damn laws and restrictions and shit we can't do.
They blame it all on us.
I'm blamin' them muthafuckers for gangsta rap.
Because if they didn't create these kind of conditions, I wouldn't have shit to rap about.
You know what I mean?
A'right, a'right. Everybody back up. Star status comin' through.
The man is in the building.
Don't touch him. Don't look at him and don't ask to take a picture.
I walks in with that California swagger.
With that attitude that it ain't nothin' badder.
Now you can call me rapper.
Or you can call me mister.
Big money trapper, fuckin' with your sister.
Yeah & I'm a do it my way, from here to Zimbabwe.
It's too hot today.
Fuck what you got to say.
Fuck if you mad at me, better go change your battery.
Ain't gon' take my sunshine, like I hit the lottery.
Oh, he's a show off, a hot head go off.
Yeah don't make he mad.
He might tear the fuckin' door off.
Take all his cars and don't try to fall.
'Cause one of his people might cut your fuckin' toe off.
Ice Cube baby, make him take you serious.
Everything I say ends with a period.
Everything I do ends with you curious.
Stop lookin' for the best rapper.

They call me cocky.
Just because I won't let 'em chop me.
They want to whip my ass, but this ain't Rocky.
I'm as hot as a habotchi.
Star child comin'.
And I promise y'all I'm a keep it one hun'ed.
Y'all promise me you won't T.R.I.P.
Or I'm a have to hit your ass with a 2-piece.
Hit you with some rice & 2 more sides.

The black man and black woman have no FURTHER!
No beginning and no ending... BEFOOOORE Alpha...
And AFTER... Omega!
History and historians'll record...
The black father and mother of morality... medicine... music, and mathematics.
The father and mother of all the nation of religion, philosophy... art... science and civilization!
No further!
All they can say about the black man...
Is he WAS, he's HEARS... and he SHALL BE!
Before HIM there were none.
And after HIM... there will be NO MORE!
Before we can make a way for the peace maker...
It's like a holocaust to the boss when I toss
Too much knowledge kicked then you're lost
In a shuffle of feet, jinx the fiddler
And I control your mind like hitler
You bow and vow to authority
See now, a sucker with a style just boring me
So I show k.n.o.w.
L.e.d.g.e. it might trouble you
Then I transform like a decepticon
With a mic as a bomb
In my right palm
But I don't stay calm
So panic
Others can't flow so they go schizophrenic
You thought I dropped a dud in your face
Until you taste the blood of the bass
Then you faint, or better yet pass out
When I'm on the mic, believe it's ass out
You think you're raw so you draw
You lose, you're hung, you bite your tongue
The whole town saw in awe as you strangle
A noose on your neck, and you dangle
From side to side in the blazing heat
You're beat, you're dead, the fools fell off
You feel you're turning red, it's said
That your head burst
And this is only the first verse
Of the bomb
Don't break up the fight let them rumble
Over the years I've watched some go super-bad quick
Now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach
Now ask yourself, who's stupid?
I take funky funky beats and I loop it
And pimp slap you in the face with the bass
And the boom from the bomb that I drop
Stop
You have a flat top as a fashion
I love black women with a passion
But when they gotta go and show their ass in
I gotta clown the hoes, yeah
You gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres
They'll steer you wrong
Ice cube's got it going on, hit me
For the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme
The system ain't wholesome
They want to put a young brother in folsom
And others see me on lockdown
But I come up foul then they get knocked out, word
To the brother that rolls the herb
Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that
Jinx got the gat, and it's a fact
He'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap
Now who's the mack?
Who's the hoe?
Who's the trick?
I got many, many styles won't you take a pick
But don't be alarmed
When I trip and stumble and fumble
Drop the bomb
I'm solo, you ask how I'm living
Still dropping more shit than a pigeon
With the l, the e, the n, the c, the h,
The m, the o, the b, the great
Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha
It's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers
And if you try to upset the pot son
You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun
I make the beats, I make the breaks
I make the rhymes that make you shake
Make you find
Ice cube never caught in the middle
I make shit to kick you in the ass a little
And still never hesitate to stutter step
Or bust a repitition on the mic
Still dissing all the hype
From left to right
How many left to fight?
So what that lench mob like?
Hey wassup Cube?
Man I'm glad I caught you at your momma' house homey
Wassup man? You still got your pager right or you lost it?
Y'know my code right? I been pagin you for about a week man
Check this out, you owe a nigga somethin' man
It's the curse of money, once you get it, fool you got it
Buy a new pair of drawers and motherfuckers spot it
Niggas plotted, to have me knotted up in basements
Till these cocksuckers see what they're faced with
Their fantasies of a life stress-free
Full of orgies, in the Florida Keys
But this bullshit is so thick, it's like mountains
Sick of threatenin all my lawyers and accountants
The decibals, gold diggers goin' for the testicles
Soon they realise, I don't invest in hoes
Sometimes it's like hell on earth
When everybody tryin' to get your ass for all your worth
It's the curse
When you hot, they think you got more than you got
When you not, motherfuckers callin you a flop
I just laugh, the curse everybody wanna have
Before you sell your soul better do the math
I start to scream shit like May day, may day
'Cause motherfuckers think it's all grav-ay wit my pay day
And like I said, it's the curse of money
See this ass kissin' yes man
Shakin hands with the left hand, get my weap-an, get to stepp-an
Fuck every phony ass nigga round me
Got to have some gas money if you goin'
If not who you fuckin'? Who you flowin? Who you owin?
In '98 don't shit come free
Not even hard rhymes that's describin these hard times
When you hot, they think you got more than you got
When you not, motherfuckers callin you a flop
Before you sell your soul better do the math
To relax I smoke a stick, the shit make me sick
Gotta gang of new homies, and relatives on my dick
No time for drama, busters get sprayed
Motherfuckers, sweat me like a spy
They wanna kick it 'cause I, got the curse of mulah
Make me wanna start scrappin and look at me to make it happen
What the fuck was they doin' before Mack 10 was rappin' ?!? Tell me
Like David Banner, when I tweak I turn green
And every time I'm seen it's like people start to fiend
It's the curse
When you hot, they think you got more than you got
I just laugh, the curse everybody wanna have
Leave your ass broke
Rabbit ears, nigga for pockets, haha he
I'm cursed! Hahaha, but I love it
And now, The Drive-By.
Outside the South Central area...
Few cared about the violence because... it didn't affect them.
Fall ain't 9 'em's you blist in the envelope as I call a mom.
And empty wallet, illegal paperwork, first 3 out of the 10.
And the single file on the bench, let's go
Open your mouths, count your tongue, bend your ears one at a time
Okay, bend your heads over, shake 'em out with your fingers
Hands above your head, hands up in front of you
Over
Move those fingers
Reach down and lift your nutsacks
Drop your nutsacks and get back you dick
Turn around
One foot at a time, pick up legal toes
Other foot.
Bend over grab your ass spread your cheeks and give me two big coughs.
Niggaz are in a state of emergency
So sign your death certificate
Fuck all y'all
...
Lisa got him
- All right, on three. One, two... threeee.
Get all folks together, walk this way.
Can't believe it though. The homeboy... Hey, open that door
- Open it
All right
- 'Right
...
We've come together by God's demand
Whether it be for life, or death
Well, this morning, it's over the mourning of one of our little brothers
This brother was a good brother
He didn't get into an excessive amount of trouble
But it's one thing...
It's one thing!
It's one thing...
He was the wrong nigga to fuck with!
I love chrome and paint, lookin' for some motherfuckin corners to bank
West coast what the fuck you thank?
Before you check my rims
When you leave the parking lot, check ya limbs
You better check ya friends
And see if ya baby momma left with them
Blacks and Mexicans - stop all that bullshit in the pen
Understand that is us verse them
They can give a fuck if we sink or swim
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
I got to show my ass
To thank these motherfuckers for my past
In South Central, Los Angeles - Grandmama smoke cannabis
Granddaughter wanna dance and shit, her own momma can't stand the bitch
If you fuckin' up, pray to the game lord
Wanna bust a nut? Pray to the game lord
Nigga get ya cup, pray to the game lord
You can throw it up, pray to the game lord
I love where I from, hungry ass niggaz better get you some
Smart ass niggaz play dumb
Y'all can't fuck with the city I run
If I snap my fingers, better curl up just like a fetus
I hope you know Jesus
Because if you don't, boy you will see us
Where? Up in your house, two double barrels up in your mouth
You got some 'splainin to do
And don't get the line 'cause we aiming at you
Can I get ya in my world baby?
Can ya grease my Jheri curl baby?
Did you flip yo' wig
To let Michael Jackson baby sit yo' kids?
That nigga old as hell
They need to throw the motherfuckin momma in jail
Let 'em know
Fuck wit this if you want to, the game lord will punish you
Punish us if we ain't true, to the game like we 'pose to
I'm the game lord, y'all come now
Casanova niggaz, got the sun down
Run down every hoe that wanna go shoppin'
Get they kids, take 'em to the mall, buy 'em somethin'
Are you a gentleman?
Big bear wit a nigga named Gentle Ben
Ladies, he'll be yo' friend
Wait for the cable guy - even let him in
Not me, I won't flex or bend
Just 'cause a hoe promise me some trim
You better get wit the rest of them
'Cause can't none of y'all even fuck wit Kim
Some niggaz was born wit hoe in 'em
I was put on this Earth to spit ism
And I shall return like it's written
And slay all the suckers who be sippin
I been servin' niggas since 1985
Niggas want the gutter
Ice Cube, Jay-O Felony
My nigga Gangsta, Squeek Rule
Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangsta
Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Keep it gangsta y'all, I want to thank you all
Niggas comin' with that bullshit, it's gankin' y'all
We can ride to this kinda shit and bank them all
Nigga ball till you fall motherfucker that's all
Can't none of y'all hang with me putin' in work
Turn this motherfucker up unless you goin' to church
Nowadays, crazy ass bitches want they bills paid
Tryin' to pot I get real as Chris Rock
It's Ice Cube comin' straight from the gutter
There is sa-lethal in the gas chamber
I'm full of anger, nigga the west is in the house
But you still in for some danger
And when I'm through, I take your bitch and finger bang her
But if she looks tossed up, I'll slang her
Beat you like mama dearest with a clothes hanger
'Cause the gang a niggas be tryin' to spit
But you can't spit it like this
I come equipped to rip, any battle
And leave him strung in his crew
But they put me in the twist like Trump
I can collapse or puncture, the lungs of anyone
Give him a chance to spit his last word, unerve
Then he done
20/20 ain't good enough
Rappers they ain't seein' me, this Jay-O Felony
And nobody can stand three of me
Caution keep MC's out of my reach, I'm on a mission
And be gettin' to your fuckin' hide to be called a physician
But loked to choke the shit out a fool, nigga dat's on doo low
It's the Mah-hurage-ny, my niggas; kamekaze
Illuminaughty, bitch hoes in they body
We the riders, we push like mahz-er-aties
Do karatees, on hatters, and you hotties
Fuck the party, come on, my niggas focus
We the richest, pretend that we the brokest
Niggas notice, as soon as you're checking quotas
Who dat? next out the game, in blue kahks
Gangsta's the name, niggas wonderin' how I do that
By the thug way, package and transportin' the drug way
Only means of makin' a livin', the Crip and Blood way
I'm on grates when I'm grindin'
I'm on stakes when I'm dinnin'
And on Sunday's on the wine
And I can make your birds rise like geese, K-Mac tell 'em
Hard or soft determines how much a nigga sell 'em for
Now if you cook it yourself you get extras
Dub that shit to death with this dub thang
Only a few niggas left with this love mang
Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Look in my eyes
I see the dollar sign dogg, and my dick start to rise
Buzzin' like a bee 'cause I crave for the honey
Million dollar tickets make bitches look wicked
So you innocent hoes, ain't got to like ta kick it
Done fiend for the green, keep you itchin' in your panty hose
You wanna get on my team, and live my dream
Captain of the ship is what I'm boastin'
Down the boulevard, flossin' hard
Lights hit the chrome, don't go lick 'em like a movie star
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta
Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Now that's how this shit go!
And I know you don't like me spittin' in your muthafuckin' face
But ain't a muthafuckin' thing, you can do, about a nigga
Punk muthafucker!
Some people may say well, you overdramatized it
No we're not - it's not a drama workshop, it is a reality
Things like that do take place in prisons
The murders, the suicides, as well as the rapes
Do take place inside these human warehouses
Nigga I'm a hustler, act like I'm lovin' ya
Don't mind fuckin' ya, just like the Governor
Used to be the dope man, rolled a hundred spokes man
When I come through, treat me like the Pope man
Ghetto spokesman, I know niggas
In Eastside Oakland all the way to Brook-lyn
And they love my shit drawers, what you smokin'?
Think you got the balls, nigga I'm a Trojan
Catchin all that just like a prophylac'
Don't reproduce, that bullshit is whack
Flavor Flav with a white bitch that is whack
Got to put the nigga back in my Cadillac
Take him to the hood, where it's action packed
Let him know that the target's still on his back
It's a hustle called capitalism
Got my niggas in prison, all stuck in the system yeah
Recognize who's a hustler, George Dubya
He's the one that's sittin' back, fuckin' ya
With a big dick stuck in ya
I'm from a place where the fuckin' Terminator is the Governor
I got a Public Pretender... tryin' to make me a winner
Nigga please don't surrender... they'll have you for dinner
The ghetto is a nigga trap, take the cheese
Soon as you do it here come the police
Invented and designed fo' us to fail
Where you gon' end up, dead or in jail
You only got two places
State of California, got two faces
Muthafuckin' devils, get straight racist
When they get you in them lonely dark places
Concrete slave ships, never move
Where niggas like us get used like a mule
Don't let 'em catch you, arrest you
Strip and undress you, throw you in a cesspool
You wanna know the crime of the century
A ghetto elementary, a mental penitentiary
Black man, you never been friend of me
Boy you kin to me, why we enemies?
The ghe-tto is a trap
Fuck where you from, nigga look where you at
Where you wanna be? Point it out on a map
Don't be scared to leave homey, we can come back
If you wanna come back to this bullshit
Most of it comin' straight out the pulpit
We got to change our ways in the hood
Understand that it's AIDS in the hood...
The ghetto is a nigga trap, take the cheese
Soon as you do it here come the police
Invented and designed fo' us to fail
Where you gon' end up, dead or in jail
I got a Public Pretender... tryin' to make me a winner
Nigga please don't surrender... they'll have you for dinner.
I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga
That's why I'm sick of gettin' treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk 'cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine-double-limb
The damn scum that you all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down it's all about coming up
So what they do go and ban the ak?
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top brougham
When I'm shooting let's see who drop
The police the media and suckers that went pop
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put 'em overseas they be begging to come back
They say keep 'em on gangs and drugs
Yyou wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen than in college?
Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate
That's from the nigga ya love to hate
Break
Fuck you ice cube
Yeah, ha-ha, it's the nigga you love to hate
Fuck you ice cube
Ay yo baby, your mother warned you about me
It's the nigga you love to hate
Yo, you ain't doing nothing pops
Yo, you ain't doing nothing pops for the brothers
What you got to say for yourself?
You do like how I'm living? well, fuck you
Once again it's on, the motherfucking psycho
Ice cube the bitch killa cap peeler
Yo runnin' through the line like bo
It's no pot to piss in
I put my fist in
Now who do ya love to hate
'Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball
'Cause I don't fake you're begging I fall off
The crossover might as well cut them balls off
And get your ass ready for the lynching
The mob is droppin' common sense and
We'll gank in the pen will shank
Any tom dick and hank or get the ass
Fake it ain't about how right or wrong you live
But how long you live
I ain't with the bullshit
I meet cold bitches no hoes
Don't wanna sleep so I keep popping no-doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And if you're locked up I dedicate my style in
From san quentin to rykers island
We got 'em afraid of the funky shit
I like to clown so pump up the sound
In the jeep make the old ladies say
Oh my God wait it's the nigga ya love to hate
Break
Fuck you ice cube
Yeah come on fool
It's the nigga you love to hate
Fuck you ice cube
Yeah run up punk
It's the nigga you love to hate
Yo, who the fuck you think you are calling girls bitches?
You ain't all that
That's all I hear, bitch, bitch
I ain't nobody's bitch
A bitch is a...
Soul train done lost they soul
Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others damn
It almost look like the bandstand
You ask me did I like arsenio
About as much as the bicentennial
I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools 'cause they all scared of
The ice cube
And what I say what I portray and all that
And ain't even seen the gat
I don't wanna see no dancing
I'm sick of that shit listen to the hit
Cause yo if I look and see another brother
On the video tryin' to out-dance each other
I'm a tell t-bone to pass the bottle
And don't give me that shit about role model
It ain't wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each
Cause laws are made to be broken up
What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up
And build mold and fold theyself into shape
Of the nigga ya love to hate
I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga
That's why I'm sick of gettin' treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk 'cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine-double-limb
The damn scum that you all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down it's all about coming up
So what they do go and ban the ak?
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top brougham
When I'm shooting let's see who drop

In the deep dark bowls of the
Underworld order must be maintained.
Without a strict and unforgiving
Chain of command, chaos is inevedeble
Wazup youngsta, sience your tha new booty

The peckin' order. it's the order in how we do
Things and move things. see somebody gonna
Tell you what to do, after I tell that
Muthafucka what to do.

Big fish, whale like itchy cower
Stepin out the shower it's the peckin' order
Ax ya daugther how we peck, inspect
High class ass the projects
Push my lex to the California range
Souther lane
Infamous skeems is on the brain for my connect game
Take a svornnotes to make a c notes
Doin' all tha howdy bullshit floats and niggaz don't
Some niggaz don't gangsta paradise say nuttin nice
Yeah we livin' so tight we need Jesus in our lives
It's the peckin' order
It's the order how we do things and move things
Only fuck wit the true things
Havin' heavy in the course whit the world of depresion
Messin wit the wrong bitches never learn our lesson
Stressin, no guessin, never question even when we playin'
We testin, confession
Hold accountable for anythang you repeat
It's the peckin' order, ask your daughter how we peck
When we smoke you it's your best friend we suspect
It's the peckin' order
It's the order how we do things and move things
Only fuck wit the true things
Now come on, come on partner, come on.
I don't wanna hear none of that shit man,
All that cryin and beggin and shit.
To be honest whit you that shit really don't even
Affect me in no kind of way partner.
You wastin your muthafuckin time.
Let's get this shit goin', let's get it over wit
Come on back here, back here, I can't make no muthafuckin mess right here
Check this out homie, make it easy on yourself.
I know you want a motherfuckin open casket
Where your people can see you and kiss on you.
But you are pissin me off
And I will blow noodles out you muthafuckin head
And none of that happens after that
So come back here, come on, right
Come on, ey but you know, one more thing before I do this
You can run but you can't hide from the westside
Night stalker, shit talker, run and tell them Mr. L.M.
Nigga with the gat and I'm back
Off the everyday prey that I slay
Rolling with the fo' chase ya through south-central
Monkey-wrench hoes should know that, she'll get the balzac
'Cause I'm not staving, but fuck that
Johnny carson hoe never had me on the late night show
Coming with the shit that'll hitch
Steady mobbing cause the flavours good
There goes the neighbourhood brother with the 3rd album.
How come he don't fall off?
Rolling with the sawed-off gauge
Turn the page of the chapter, caught up in the rapture
But you know anita, she can get the pita
Eat 'em up yum, and your flawed
Rather burn billboard and the editor
Here comes the predator.
Check your head for the new style
Fuck lawerence powell and presino, wynd and koon
Pretty soon we'll fuck them like they fucked us and won't kiss 'em
Riots ain't nothing but dodge for the system
Fighting with the beast, no justice, no peace
If any, even if we fuck up denny
Niggas are sick of your white man's tricks with no treat
That's right, now it's on, on sight
You call me a muslim, no I'm not a resident, still got my vote in
Farrakhan for president, a white America, I'm tearing ya
A new ass hole. Who's the nigga with the new black?
Strolling to your suburb house and I douse with gas.
Now who's cleaning up trash?
Eat 'em up yum, and your flawed
Rather burn billboard and the editor
Here comes the predator.
Get my black rag showing and I'm ? ? ? ? ?
Kiss my grips like ? ? ? or mel's diner
I'm meaner than a wicked wild hyena, chasing antelope
Put a chrome to your dome, watch it bust like a cantelope
I can't stand a rope, so don't try to hang 'em
Talk about dog's, boy I can sling 'em
Ratta-tat-tat on your noggin
Cause ice will cream your ass like ? ? ? ? chocolate
I get crazy when I catch a rap
Even be flipping the toungue like ? ? ? ? das-efx.
So who is ice cube?
I'm a rapper, actor, macker
Got a little problem with the redneck cracka
Get the polly, whack her, ? ? ? ? is a devil shit-packer
Coming with a crazy pitch
And the statue of liberty ain't nothing but a lazy bitch
Don't wanna give up the crack to the black
But you call it racial, if we go and break the hoe
But eat 'em up yum and your flawed
Rather burn billboard and the editor
Here comes the predator.
I was told, 'cause I didn't witness the whole act
In and out was the movement of the bozack
It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin
Then the nut came gushin
And it was hell tryin' to bail to the ovary
With nuttin but the Lord lookin' over me
I was white with a tail
But when I reached the finish line, young black male!
One cell made two, and two cells made fo'
And so on, so now I'm a embryo
Then I got a hunch
That I'ma be on lockdown, for nine months
Chillin', with my mother to guide me
And nuttin but a stomach to hide me
From all that worry and bullshit
Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick
Cause my time is up and I don't care
With one big push, I'm outta there
June 15th, it's just my luck
In 1969, a nigga is the product
Ghetto ass nigga, you ain't shit,
And you ain't gon' never be shit!
I learned how to walk and talk and all that
They put me in school, but it don't matter
'Cause I'm sittin' in history
Learnin 'bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me
They try to shape us
But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin rapist
So I stopped payin' attention
Ice Cube, headed, straight to detention
Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways
I'm sent home and I don't got all A's
A high school dropout
My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out
But I got tossed, he's the boss
I'm out of there and mad 'cause I lost
Now bein on my own is a factor
So I become, the neighborhood jacker
Gimme your car, run your jewels
Makin' a livin' robbin fools
And if I let my nine rang out
You know, it'll make your brains hang out
So what's your fate?
Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate?
The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled
I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red
And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck
Stuck up by the motherfuckin product
Uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job
If you wanna stay in my motherfuckin house
Many young men reject the traditional values
That are important to their parents.
Church, school and family
Have been replaced by street, turf, and gang.
Twenty-one now, and paid in full
Feelin' bad, from all the shit I pulled
On people back in the day
Plus, I got a little baby on the way
So I'm tryin' to go straight
I'm with my baby's momma, out on a date
Till the punk ass cops ran my plate
Now I'm on a bus upstate
Oh, the young nigga done caught a case!
Sent to a concrete hoe-house
Where all the products go, no doubt
Yo momma, I gotta do eleven
Livin' in a five by seven
Dear baby, your man's gettin' worn out
Of seein young boys gettin' they assholes torn out
And then he got shanked with a spoon
And he was 'sposed to get out soon
Is it my fault, he was caught in production
Where a young black life means nothin'
Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar
You say I'm better off in the slammer
And it's drivin' me batty
Cause my little boy, is missin' daddy
I'm ashamed, but the fact is
I wish pops let me off on the mattress
Or should I just hang from the top bunk
But that's goin' out like a punk
My life is FUCKED!
But it ain't my fault, 'cause I'm the motherfuckin product
He ain't shit
Just uh turn your head...
For you, and uh brace yourself this won't hurt.
The world, belongs to me
Niggaz don't know my pedigree, W-S to the C
We be them hogs, that make it rain cats and dogs
We got the Bud just like them frogs
Now everybody on the West, show some love
And everybody on the East, respect the Corniche, it's not on lease
Breakin laws, swimmin through the water like Jaws
Gumby's pause, and take they drawers, no balls
God damnit, niggaz take my planet for granted I can't stand it
Catch a flight across the Atlantic
Step off the plane, nuttin but expense of the game
Bitch I'm rich you know my name, show me the cane
Now are you sure? One hundred percent pure
'Cause if it's not, believe me the shit gettin' hot
I got a plot to make your whole family deaf dumb and blind
The world is mine nigga, back up
I gots to get mine before I act up
It's a quarter to eight, I'm not finished my plate
I got a phone call to make, my niggaz tell me it's fake
Oh what a mistake, here's what I want you to break
Tie his feet with some weight, throw his ass in a lake
And then set up a date, between me and his mate
Tell her lobster and steak, and bitch don't be late
Oh the pussy was great, I'm still sealin your fate
Cause you can't imitate, the nigga you love to hate
Can I grin, show my fin, I'm down with mack 10
Dub-C, K-Dee, and Kausion
It don't stop, niggaz get to bowin' a lot
When we enter the spot, look all the niggaz we got
Worldwide, nigga take a look outside
Got a brother named Clyde, he's like Jekyll and Hyde
Ice Cube is the lick, Westside is the click
You wanna check our cajones we got the feds up on us
We gotta roll on Daytonas because we know that they want us
And if they catch us in rap, it's a reasonable doubt
My niggaz pointin me out, my momma scream and she shout
But we got enough green, from our triple beam
To hire the prosecution, and the dream team
I'm a partner in crime, the world is mine
Yeah, you punk ass niggaz know the side, so check it
When you meet us, you better bring your heaters
Cause the only way you could beat us, is if you cheat us nigga
We tight, ha hah
Where you from nigga?
Where you from nigga?
Ha ha ha, Westside
God damn, it's a brand new payback
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
How many motherfuckers gotta pay
Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK
Caps gotta get pealed
Cause The Nigga Ya Love to hate still can Kill at Will
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
And you can New Jack SWING on my nuts
Down wit the niggaz that I bail out
I'm platinum bitch and I didn't have to sell out
Fuck you Ice Cube, that's what the people say
Fuck AmeriKKKa, still wit hthe triple K
Cause you know when my nine goes buck
It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from 12 stories up
Now let's see who'll drop
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man
I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
Make sure before you buck wit duck quick
Punk, 'cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck wit
I'ma let y'all know one thing man..
Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin L.M.
It's the number one crew in the area
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Punks roll when I put in work
Cause Lench Mob niggaz are the craziest
And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
South Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell
Hittin fools up with the big ass L
One time can't hold me back
Sweatshirt, khakis and crokersacs
Stop givin' juice to the Raiders
Cause Al Davis, never paid us
I hope he wear a vest
It's all about the L-E-N-C-H y'all know the rest
Motherfuckin crew, motherfuckin mob
Do a motherfuckin job in a motherfuckin squad
In '91 Ice Cube grew stronger and bigger
And I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
One-and-two, ah-three-e-and-ah-four-and..
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Like I said, it's a brand new payback
Now in '91, let's see who beats the jack
Sir Jinx grew a little bit taller
And hoes can't roll on
Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta Hold On
Don't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
Goin' up against the Zulu
Break his spine like a jellyfish
Kick his ass till I'm smellin shit
Off wit the head, off wit the head I say
And watch the devil start kickin
Run around like a chicken, grand dragon finger lickin'
Yo, turn him over wit a spatula
Now we got, Kentucky Fried Cracker
Mess with the Cube, you get punked quick
Pig, 'cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with!
God damn, it's a brand new payback
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
How many motherfuckers gotta pay

All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard
The West coast warlord, and the future is today
Cause tomorrow - that shit never come
I worry 'bout today and this urban decay
I worry 'bout hip-hop, when did it flip-flop
Get whack, and turn into gridlock
I don't know is it a government plot?
I don't give a fuck whether you love it or not
That's all we got and if you throw it away
You dumb as OJ, off a for-tay
In your Izod, this the rap God
What'chu gon' put up, in your iPod?
Downloader, what'chu gon' do
When your favorite MC, got to sue you
'Cause he got to eat ain't nuttin taboo
Get your ass beat by Erykah Badu
Cause you wanna steal this good music
Put me out of business, now you lose it
Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout
This is very hard to swallow
Keep your hand up on that throttle
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
Tomorrow, I'ma handle my business
But today, I'ma drink this liquor
Cause tomorrow, I might be a little quicker
But today, I'm just the same old nigga
You know that shit is still a day away
Do yo' thang baby put your life on layaway
Cause everybody is Nostradamus
Boy don't you know that tomorrow ain't promised?
To all the lil' mamas
Don't do a nigga, like Isiah Thomas
If you a bitch, please be honest
Actin' like a hoe you're not an an-gel
While you're, daydreamin 'bout your future
Motherfucker come around the corner and shoot you
Don'tcha, get stuck in neutral
Put your shit in drive, while you still alive cause
Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout
This is very hard to swallow
Keep your hand up on that throttle
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
Tomorrow~! That shit never come
I know it sounds strange but today is never done
I'm up in the Range when the clock strikes 1
While y'all countin' sheep, I'm countin' Benja-mons
Up on my feet at the break of the sun
President of the Gangster Na-tion
We don't go to war, we go to the store
We rob from the rich, and give to the poor
Hip-Hop, oh what a bore
Lettin college motherfuckers run the front door
Don't let Viacom, dictate the heat
The nerve of them, I never heard of dem
Askin me about, my urban spins
And if I got about, a thousand of them
I'm a crate MC, accordin to them Fuck that!
Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout
This is very hard to swallow
Keep your hand up on that throttle
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard
The West coast warlord, the future is today
Get your grind on mayne, get your grind
On mayne, get your grind on
My ego is big as Heatrow
Got this elite flow, easy as a free throw
Yes this negro is rather lethal
You about as lethal as a mojito
Be my amigo, eat my burrito
You're a fuckin' seagull up in Francisco
I'm up in a Regal, still in my pea coat
Murder's what she wrote, this is more evil
This is less than zero, don't be a hero
Nigga I'm a pharaoh, with double barrels
Goose bumps, hair rose, when I shoot these arrows
At your Camaro's, rollin' down Melrose
Still down with L coast, till the fuckin' cell close
Nigga don't test me, you're gonna fail those
Ain't should arrest me, blow like Dizzy Gillespie
I don't aim, where your vest be
Bang
I'm too hot, to stop, walkin' up with two Glocks
Way more than two shots, that'll make your roof drop
House shoes, blue top, money like I move rocks
Dissin will get you socked, and yo' bitch move wop
Whole crew popped, by this old school new shot
G niggaz still keep my weed in a shoebox
Dippin rollin' through blocks, dippin while the crew pops
Eatin chicken dinners in my cutoffs and tube socks
Play my shit a lot of deejays they do not
Cause me and bitch niggaz don't mix like two cocks
Who knocks with them pocket rockets that'll shoot dots
Have your skull on the news lookin' like goulash
When they ask who the top don't mention us as foolish
Eat yo' ass up like a pack of barracudas
Put the barrel to ya, like we never knew ya
Send the metal through ya, Da Lench Mob shooters
I know vatos and they get popped most
Niggaz that flip mo' chicken than Bosco's
Squattin down the block low, hop in that hot fo'
And I can spot Poles when they not in cop clothes
Squabble with the combos, Maylay got those
Crates or case, boxloads like they came from Costco's
They be poppin' bottles, we knockin' hollows
Promise by tomorrow I can have the spot closed
Talkin' pronto, somethin' like a lotto
Chips and cheese fuck meat, nigga these nachos
Speakin' on guap' though, cause that's a combo
Keep my green on the side like it was cilantro
Comin' with the honchos, that's in a stock Rolls
And everythang up out they mouth is like the gospel
It won't stop flow oh I'm not though
Lench Mob, big swanger, don't bang is the motto
How many bullets can your back hold, suckin from the HK
The red dot's on your dome, from the light ray
Boom bam bust oh shit kid, your head is a pile of puss
I'm kickin up much dust, the nigga ya can't trust
This is my shit, my hood, my turf
My gold, my grip, whatever the fuck it's worth
I don't need nobody comin' in my territory
Tryin' to rip a nigga off and fuck your fuckin' sob stories
Take a good look at my motherfuckin jacker
About to feel the wrath, of a greedy ass cracker
Pale as snow, so you know the hoe stand out
Comin' in my hood with his hand out
Tryin' to get over on the black, but the motherfuckin mack
Will put a fuckin' slug in his back
And with the boom ping ping, it ain't no thing to blast
On greedy motherfuckers that trespass
Olly olly outcome free, here come the G
I'm saggin, and Enter the Dragon like Bruce Lee
I gots to get mo' money mo' money
Can't get pussy with no money
See I'm kind of greedy, cause all my heroes
Got zeroes in back of a one
Here's my gun, about to get paid at last
But now I'm gettin' covered, in dirt and grass, kick it
The madder I get, the higher the debt, the deeper you get
The thicker the sweat
'Cause I'm a nigga with fat clout
But ya in, but ya gotta get back out
No easy job, for some suckers is out to rob
Crosshair on your dome and your mind's blown
You wanna go home... ain't that a bitch?
I got a full time job of takin' suckers out
Breakin 'em off, yeah word, I love revokin clout
Test me, stress me, who could the best be?
The teflon nine go through vests G
But when you're greedy you don't care about life itself
You're chasin extreme wealth
You can't be trusted cause trust ain't in the fuckin' game
Scandalous is your fuckin' name
I'm the motherfucker you're stuck wit
Ice Cube -- Wronnnnnnng nigga to FUCK WIT!
I'm rich, pitchin a bitch about gettin' mo'
The big fish, swimmin in big dough
The G backstabber, I got ta have a
Lexus Coupe, when I troop
With the ski mask, gotta get the cash
My homeboy ain't home, so fuck it I'll trespass
How many bullets can your back hold, suckin from the hk
The red dot's on your dome, from the light ray
Boom bam bust oh shit kid, your head is a pile of puss
I'm kickin up much dust, the nigga ya can't trust
This is my shit, my hood, my turf
My gold, my grip, whatever the fuck it's worth
I don't need nobody comin' in my territory
Tryin' to rip a nigga off and fuck your fuckin' sob stories
Take a good look at my motherfuckin jacker
About to feel the wrath, of a greedy ass cracker
Pale as snow, so you know the hoe stand out
Comin' in my hood with his hand out
Tryin' to get over on the black, but the motherfuckin mack
Will put a fuckin' slug in his back
And with the boom ping ping, it ain't no thing to blast
On greedy motherfuckers that trespass
Olly olly outcome free, here come the g
I'm saggin, and enter the dragon like bruce lee
I gots to get mo' money mo' money
Can't get pussy with no money
See I'm kind of greedy, cause all my heroes
Got zeroes in back of a one
Here's my gun, about to get paid at last
But now I'm gettin' covered, in dirt and grass, kick it
The madder I get, the higher the debt, the deeper you get
The thicker the sweat
'Cause I'm a nigga with fat clout
But ya in, but ya gotta get back out
No easy job, for some suckers is out to rob
Crosshair on your dome and your mind's blown
You wanna go home... ain't that a bitch?
I got a full time job of takin' suckers out
Breakin 'em off, yeah word, I love revokin clout
Test me, stress me, who could the best be?
The teflon nine go through vests g
But when you're greedy you don't care about life itself
You're chasin extreme wealth
You can't be trusted cause trust ain't in the fuckin' game
Scandalous is your fuckin' name
I'm the motherfucker you're stuck wit
Ice cube -- wronnnnnnng nigga to fuck wit!
I'm rich, pitchin a bitch about gettin' mo'
The big fish, swimmin in big dough
The g backstabber, I got ta have a
Lexus coupe, when I troop
With the ski mask, gotta get the cash
My homeboy ain't home, so fuck it I'll trespass
Ay, yeah you, motherfucker
You know who I'm talking to
Yeah, you that motherfucker that betrayed your homeboys and you ain't
Shit
Yeah, you about to get your motherfucking ghetto pass revoked,
Motherfucker
Punk-ass mark, bitch-made
Punk-ass trick in a basket
You got caught up in the mix...
It's the nigga ya love to hate with a new song
So what really goes on
Nothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch
They hate to see a young nigga rich
But I refuse to switch even though
'Cause I can't move to the snow
Cause soon as y'all get some dough
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
Moving out your neighborhood
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good
Little kids jumping on me
But you, you wanna be white and corny
Living way out
Nigger go home spray-painted on your house
Trying to be white or a jew
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
Get the hell out
Stop being an uncle tom, you little sell-out
House nigga scum
Give something back to the place where you made it from
Before you end up broke
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked
I ain't saying no names, you know who you are
You little punk, be true to the game
Break
Yeah, motherfucker
Yeah, you thought we forgot, huh?
Yeah, get a little money and moves out the neighborhood and shit
But you still ain't shit...
When you first start rhyming
It started off slow and then you start climbing
But it wasn't fast enough I guess
So you gave your other style a test
You was hardcore hip-hop
Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped
Giving our music away to the mainstream
Don't you know they ain't down with the team
They just sent they boss over
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
On mtv but they don't care
They'll have a new nigga next year
You out in the cold
No more white fans and no more soul
And you might have a heart attack
When you find out the black folks don't want you back
And you know what's worse?
You was just like the nigga in the first verse
Stop selling out your race
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
Niggas always gotta show they teeth
Now I'm a be brief
Be true to the game
Break
Yeah motherfucker
I see you got your fancy cars and shit
But you know what?
You still ain't shit
That's right, I caught you slipping
You know I could've gat you
Yeah, but I didn't even trip...
A message to the oreo cookie
Find a mirror and take a look, g
Do you like what you see?
But you're quick to point the finger at me
You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
Black man can't be no yuppie
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
You don't associate with the negroes
You wanna be just like jack
But jack is calling you a nigga behind your back
So back off genius
I don't need you to correct my broken English
You know that's right
You ain't white
So stop holding your ass tight
Cause you can't pass
So why you keep trying to pass?
With your black ass
Mister big
But in reality, you're shorter than a midge
You only got yourself to blame
Get a grip, oreo and be true to the game
And ice cube practices what he preaches
He continues to live in south central los angeles
And he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood...
Be true to the game!
Turn on the radio take a listen
What you're missing
Personally I'm sick of the ass-kissing
What I'm kicking to you won't get rotation
Nowhere in the nation
Program directors and djs ignored me
'Cause I simply said fuck top forty
And top thirty top twenty and top ten
Until you put more hip-hop in
Then I might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the c
And go and dis me in a magazine
How could you figure the brother could dig ya
DJ face down in the river
No it's not a threat but a promise
I'm as
Crazy as they come see
Mama didn't love me
All I got is my nine
And to calm the savage beast here's the alpine
Turn off that bullshit!
Turn off that motherfucking radio!
Turn off that bullshit!
Turn off that motherfucking radio!
Turn off that bullshit!
Play the music motherfucker put the music on
Damn!
Tune in to the radio listen for a minute
Yo g stick a fucking tape in it
Cause all the radio do is gangle
That r&b love triangle
If you're out there kicking it with the brothers
You don't care about lovers
You wanna hear a young nigga on the mic
Going buck wild
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles
That's where I'm coming from
Reality that's what they're running from
So if you're down with ice cube let me know that you know
Yo turn off the radio
You know what? you know what?
Basically those black guys and those rap guys
They don't know what the fuck they're doing
I hate those fuckers
I hate em
Especially that one guy
The amerikkka's most wanted
Ice cube--i hate that fucker
Get him off the air, get him off, get him off
Get that rap shit out of here!
Just get me a gat so I can smoke this motherfucker!
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen... let's get together
And give a great big round of applause to
Ah shit
Scarface is on the mix
So yo, suck a nigga dick
Or make a nigga rich, or somethin', BITCH
See I come from the place known as the South Park Zone
Talkin' shit ain't into clickin take your punk ass home
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll chuck
Hit you in the chest with a motherfuckin tec and watch you jump
So die motherfuckers die motherfuckers die
Look deep into the eyes of a killer smokin', fry
One nigga you can't fuck wit
'Cause I'm a born killer with the mind of a lunatic
So bring in bodybags when I start bangin'
'Cause I'm leavin' motherfuckers laid out, with they brains hangin'
Straight gettin' down for mine
And I'll fuck up a bitch, 'cause I don't mind dyin'
So feel me drill me, put a bullet in my head, but yo
You can't kill me, 'cause I'm already dead
Scarface goin' psycho, yeah
Play pussy get fucked and take two to your head
I'm Bushwick Bill, but call me Chuckie
5th Ward hard bitch, play hero and buck me
'Cause I'm known to pull your skull out
Grip a motherfucker by his neck and gouge his fuckin' eyes out
I'm insane by a longshot, hey
Chuckwick Bill, a.k.a. Charles Libre
A short nigga with some lonnnnng nuts
Drop you dead in your bed now I'm ready for a long fuck
Necromance that ass for a minute
And split that motherfuckin click when I'm finished
You punk bitches be retreatin
Freddy and Jason runnin' home with their mouths bleedin
So welcome to the Slaughterhouse trance
5th Ward Texas Chuckie's Concentration Camp
You punk motherfuckers fled
And those who didn't make it got two to the fuckin' head
Buck him down, buck him down, come again
Two to the chin, Ice Cube'll blast they ass till the end
With my pistol, runnin' from Da Lench Mob
Is How You Survive in South Central
Kick the instrumental, run and get your bigger crew
'Cause it's Judgment Day, and Ice Cube is Terminigga 2
Pow pow buck buck pow buck
Your name is Stucky Mack, now you realize that you're fucked
Two to the brain I leave a migraine
Have you coolin like a vegetable, but you're not edible
It's the incredible, buck your ass from head to toe
Audi 5000, don't wait for the Feds to show
'Cause they'll have me go up up the river
Where the white boys'll try to make a nigga
Walk, walk the plank, got the shank, hide the tape
Around the handle, gotta let 'em know what I stand for
In the chow line, now is the time
See the trustee, walk up from behind
Real quick shank shank, leave his ass red
Motherfucker dead, from two to the head
See where I come from the crime rate only rises
The murderers disguise in all ages shapes and sizes
Bitches picked up and dicked up, niggaz they gettin' stuck up
Give up what you got, or get your ass shut the fuck up
Run 'em down and gun 'em down yeah that's how we do it
Niggaz get killed, and then filled with embalmin fluid
Step to the niggaz that I'm checkin'
Pull out the tec and I reckon you'll get murdered in a second
Bang with the nine, boom with the pow
Motherfuckers are fallin' and crawlin on the ground
Snitches get stitches, bitches that act snotty
Inside the parties even the hotties get turned to bodies
Now I heard, they got other places that's similar
But I represent, New York you fuck around I'm killin' ya
A whole block of cops patrollin when I'm rollin'
And if my pockets are swollen you know somebody sick I've stolen
Yeah you niggaz get ripped, when my clip, goes in the
S-M-I-T-H W-E-Double-S-O-N
Or the reliable revolver
And like I said before, it's the motherfuckin problem solver
So bring it on nigga, get brave
It's plenty motherfuckers gettin' sent to early graves
'Cause when a nigga gets fed
Then all you motherfuckers get two to the fuckin' head
Mr. Dirty Harry, you look really scary
With your .357, officer Kevin
Spent 11 years on the force trying to get mine
Head got the flat top, boots got the spit shine
Don't give a fuck about my neighborhood
Just wanna do your eight hours, then hit the showers
Shoot a brother down and you don't send flowers
Goddamn sherrif, can't wait to tarriff
A chunk of a nigga ass, but watch a nigga blast
And get away nigga fast
You ain't gonna have me face down no more
You ain't gonna have a chance to clown no more
To the boys in blue, I got kids too
Ain't going out like a jigaboo, no no no
On my way to the store
You see me in a Range Rover, now you gotta pull me over
But where oh where is the ticket?
You got your hand on your gun 'cause you're wicked
You don't like the face of the original man
But you gotta treat me like an individual man
Talk right and I'll talk right back
Show some goddamn respect to the black
'Cause I gotta get back to my wife
But I'm sorry, you ain't gonna take my life
Just because you got a badge
Did you think Ice Cube was gonna wave the white flag?
Cracker please, you can yell freeze
I'd rather die standing up than die on my knees
You think you can do anything you want to do
To my crew when you come through, man fuck you
Shooting up South Central
Catch your ass slipping at a rent show
Could have popped you off, one dead cop
But I know you got a wife and a dog named Spot
I show a little mercy 'cause I'm civilized
Looking through a nigga's eyes at a much bigger prize
But when I saw Rodney it got me so hot
Made me wanna go out and pop me a cop
Cause every time you see me sagging
Here comes the Grand Dragon, in the motherfucking patty wagon
Try to play me like a trick
Sometimes you act like a dick, Mr. Nightstick
Back then, I used to throw my Mack-10
But nowadays you got the black skin
Back then you don't like the voice of a nigga named Ice
But you ain't gonna take my life
You man let's get an understanding
I know that your job is demanding
But I only got me one life to live
You only got about six shots to give
And I got a big AK with a 50-round clip
So why should we trip?
You ain't gonna punk me, so what you trying for?
Ain't no job worth dying for, is it?
Might pay a visit to Petey Wheatstraw
When you stop me on the shore, officer of the law
And if I did something wrong, you can lock me up
Never never never gonna sock me up
So next time you have the urge, all of the sudden
To fuck with a nigga for nothing
Think about me, a brother that's 23
I got a son and a J-O-B
So before you pull your gun, you'd better think twice
Pig, cause you ain't gonna take my life
Ice Cube feat. Krayzie Bone
Until We Rich
Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle it don't stop, until we drop
Krayzie Bone and Ice Cube...
Get your mind right, and get your grind right
Get your mind right, and get your grind right
Look into my eyes if you wanna know me
Before you hypnotized, homey what do you see
A figure that's just a little bigger than dealers
A hustler countin' figures ain't pulled no triggers
Can you dig us, we be the ultimate lick
We's the hitters, that make the ultimate hits
Kinda floss-ey, kinda boss-ey
It's gotta be done my way, do what the {fuck} I say
Top of the pyramid, homey what I tell you
If you leave this Westside umbrella you hit the cellar
Bring me my slippers, black robe, and my globe
And I could rule the world with my eyes closed
See the mission's to get what we don't got
Until we filthy rich and on top --
-- You betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle it don't stop until we drop
Krazyie Bone and Ice Cube
See the mission's to get what we don't got
Until we filthy rich and on top --
-- You betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle it don't stop until we drop
To all the little homies that's watchin TV
I see you tryin' to be a O.G. like me
Chasin dreams, pullin mo' schemes for wealth
But the best thing in life is health, be yourself playa
Television it'll keep yo' ass wishin forever
You'll never get you life together
Don't talk about death, I got too much life to live
Too many orders to give -- what it is, showbiz
Lord knows, In God We Trust
To the kids of the world that's waitin for wealth
Waitin for health, you better do for self
Homey that's yo' last cup
Forget about the fast buck; boy, get you ass up
People use yo' brain to gain
Do something that ain't never been done; and we can spend hun's
Wipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones
Throw away the guns, have nuttin but fun
And homey we could do that {shit}!
Police have a fit, when yo' paper's legit
We gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own
Send your baby to school and she'll come back grown
We got to talk to our grandma's
And she'll help us throught them dark halls, and them pitfalls
Everybody know we got the world to gain
We got to stop the pain, lord stop the rain
Keep goin', little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin', little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin', little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Hey young thugs, the world is yours...

Google me bitch, ah won't cha, ah won't cha
Google me bitch, yeah I told her
Won't cha Google me bitch
Try to Google me bitch, listen
I ain't ghetto, don't you know I'm urbanian
Fuck with the kid and I'll turn into Damian
Google me bitch, wanna know what my name is
Don't even ask, stupid ass, am I famous?
Are you famous? My resume is heaven's way
Of tellin' y'all that God will make a way
I rock a motherfuckin' mic 'til the break of day
Darrell Dawkins flow, y'all need to make a breakaway
Microphone fiend with that guillotine killer team
You motherfuckers won't amount to a hill of beans
When I ride by, well over thirty five
Y'all still run and hide, scared of a drive-by
I ain't ghetto, don't you know I'm urbanian
Google me bitch, wanna know what my name is
I ain't ghetto, don't you know I'm urbanian
Google me bitch, wanna know if I'm famous
Google me bitch, ah won't cha, ah won't cha
Google me bitch, ah won't cha, ah won't cha
Google me bitch, I told her, won't cha Google me bitch
Try to Google me this
I'm urban and ordained
Your little ass is kind of churban and propane
Your little flame is like a flicker
And my bang is off the motherfuckin' Richter
I'm hard liquor, Cirrhosis of the liver
Black lung is what I deliver
That's what you get, if you ever try to smoke the nigga
Don't provoke a nigga, I'm from that urban community
Lookin' for some unity, fuckin' you and me
I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?
Nothin', I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?
I ain't ghetto, don't you know I'm urbanian
Google me bitch, wanna know what my name is
I ain't ghetto, don't you know I'm urbanian
Google me bitch, wanna know if I'm famous
Google me bitch, ah won't cha, ah won't cha
Google me bitch, ah won't cha, ah won't cha
Google me bitch, I told her, won't cha Google me bitch
Try to Google me this
My resume is heaven's way
Of lettin' you know that God will make a way
Could you tell me who released our animal instinct?
Got the white man sittin' there tickled pink.
Laughin' at us on the avenue
Bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew
We can't enjoy ourselves
Too busy jealous... of each other's wealth
Commin' up is just in me
But the black community is full of envy
Too much back-stabbin'
While I look up the street I see all the japs grabbin'
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood
Build a store, and sell their goods
Four or five babies on your crotch
And you expect uncle sam to help us out?
We ain't nothin' but porchmonkeys
To the average bigot, redneck honky
You say comin' up is a must
But before we can come up, take a look at us
And all y'all dope-dealers...
Your as bad as the po-lice- cause ya kill us
You got rich when you started slangin' dope
But you ain't built us a supermarket
So when can spend our money with the blacks
Too busy buyin' gold an' caddilacs
That's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'
Exploitin' us like the caucasians did
For 400 years - I got 400 tears- for 400 peers
Died last year from gang-related crimes
That's why I got gang-related rhymes
But when I do a show ta kick some facts
Us blacks don't know how ta act
Sometimes I believe the hype, man
We're messin' up ourselves and blame the white man
But don't point the finger you jiggaboo
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you
Pretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice
No ice cube, just vannilla ice
And y'all sit and scream and 'cause
But there's no one ta blame- but us
Us ... will always sing the blues
'Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
But if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
'Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'
Just like a beast
But I'm the first nigga ta holler out {peace, black man}
I beat my wife and children to a pulp
When I get drunk and smoke dope
Got a bad heart condition
Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's
Bet my money on the dice and the horses
Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces
Go to church but they tease us
Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus
They used to call me negro
After all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe
No respect and didn't know it
And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford
In jail 'cause I can't pay the mother
Held back in life because of my color
Now this is just a little summary
Of us, but y'all think it's dumb of me
To put a mirror to ya face, but trust
Nobody gives a fuck about...
I see them niggas
You see them niggas?
I see them niggas
Get your ride on, ride on
This ain't the day for you to die on, die on
I'm a nigga that they lie on, lie on
See these shoes you wanna try on, try on
Yo, we can go to war with the enemy
All we need is A.K.s and Hennessy
This ain't back in the days of Tennessee
See muthafuckas run till they catch one
In the back, and it might cause a cardiac
Bitch act like he died and we brought him back
Him screamin for his mama and his sister pack
Flatline -
These niggas wanna act like
They ain't never had a full can of act-right
Make me pull out my gat, right
And smoke his muthafuckin ass like a crackpipe
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
Get your smoke on, smoke on
Here's another verse to choke on, choke on
To all my niggas in the pen, get your yoke on
To all my thugs in the house, get your loc on
We can really give a fuck about a broke home
All we care about is bitches we can poke on
Nigga, what's that bullshit that you spoke on?
Better roll on 'fore we split your whole dome
'Cause you're fuckin' with Ice Cube the Terrible
Fuck around, I make your life unbearable
Make you live all scary and careful
Come through my neighborhood, you better tip-toe
'Cause if you loud, then you might get chased down
Westside Connection catch a case now
Po-po's find your monkey ass face down
Tell your mama that you in a better place now
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
'You can hate me now'
To all my niggas with the lleyo
They rock it up like Play-Doh
They cook it up like Waco
Better do what I say so
Better lay low, cause you fuckin' with a halo
Death to the niggas with the big mouth
And death to you devils from the Old South
And death to you hoes turnin' tricks out
And death everyone that go the bitch route
Check it
If you infected by this record
Bow down butt-naked
And pray to God
Ice Cube won't spare the rod
Westside Connection here to mob, nigga, rob
We can take it to the streets
We can take it to the concrete
You niggas know where the Don be
You bitches ain't tryin' to find me
All you haters need to shut the fuck up and get behind me
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
This is dedicated
To them haters
Who ain't gon' kill nothin'
And who ain't gon' let nothin' die
You know em
You know em
When you see Ice Cube you better holla
And pop a collar
When you see Ice Cube you better holla
And pop a collar
Ice Cube the great!
He has indicated to us that he has sufficient... firepower...
To... blow up the Bradley vehicle...
And in fact his words were,
'We are ready for war... let's get it on'
War... War, and peace
Sing it!
War and peace, forever!
War and peace, together... always!
I'm at the highest peak, still glad the meak is understandin me
Artillery, thoughts of killin' me is just a fantasy
The man in me is ready for war, like Holyfield/Tyson IV
A gang against you niggaz on the shore
Either or, your whole family is on the floor
Windows breakin all around em, you can't climb this mountain
I'm at the fountain, with my troops
I start screamin at 'em like Patton, we gattin at you fools!
Negotiate... strategy is the key!
I hope they ain't... exclusively after me!
'Cause if they are... we gots to be who we be!
And make a star... out of a head enemy!
The papers said... that he died tragically!
They found his head... with no legs and bo-dy!
We made a pledge... to the Dub-S-C!
Bloodshed... if they got no love for peace!
Sing it!
I'd rather break bread than uh, break your head
Break your legs, have 'em broken, I ain't no joke
Don't provoke, the gun smoke from the highest slope
Eternal peace, for my peoples and my folks
My crips and my bloods, criminals and my thugs
Just show a nigga love when I'm rollin' on them dubs
Just, give a nigga hugs, we can ride on this piece
Westside for Life but still down with the East
Sing it!
After the haters attempt to blow up his car
We find our hero, Ice Cube, on the ground
Bruised, but not beaten
He pulls out his cell phone... WITH THE CHIP!
And begins to dial Mack One-Oh
Who's faded and rolling through Inglewood
With Mr. Short KHOP
Words... are spoken
Yaeeyaae uh huh uh huh brrr
We be clubbin'
Hey hey hey hey look here look here first of all I wanna welcome
All y'all broke ass entreponiggas to the Player's Club. Yaeeyaae
It's packed niggas don't know how to act
We the macks V.I.P's in the back
With a stack of numbers
My niggas like 'em dumber
We oughta get 'em smarter
Baby take my order
The only shark that swim in Henn no water
Got ya daughter doin' shit you don't think she oughta
Gave the order to slaughter any ass like that
You know how the loni act off the cognac
Down ta get this mothafuckin' party crackin'
Nigga back in so we can smoke a dub
We be clubbin'
Everybody likes when the girl
Shakes something

To the best of our ability. Riots, melees and disturbances
Of the peace are against the interests of all our people; and
That there's a series of fires. A lot of looting is going on.
Not guilty, the filthy, devils tried to kill me
When the news get to the hood the niggaz will be
Hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust
Kickin up dust is a must
I can't trust, a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a unicorn
Born, wicked, Laurence, Powell, foul
Cut his fuckin' throat and I smile
Go to Simi Valley and surely
Somebody knows the address of the jury
Can I talk to the grand wizard, then boom!
Make him eat the barrel, modern day feral
Now he's zipped up like leather tuscadero
Pretty soon we'll catch Sergeant Koon
Shoot him in the face, run up in him with a broom-
-Stick, prick, devils ain't shit
Introduce his ass to the AK-40 dick
Two days niggaz laid in the cut
To get some respect we had to tear this muthafucka up
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
I gotta mac-10 for Officer Wind
Damn his devil ass need to be shipped back to Kansas
In a casket, crew cut faggot
Now he ain't nothin' but food for the maggots
Lunch, punch, Hawaiin, lyin'
Niggas ain't buyin, ya story, bore me
Tearin up shit with fire, shooters, looters
Now I got a laptop computer
I told you it would happened and you heard it, read it
But all you can call me was anti-semitic
Regret it? Nope, said it? Yep
Listen to my big black boots as I step
Niggaz had to break you off somethin', give Bush a push
But your National Guard ain't hard
You had to get Rodney to stop me, cause you know what?
We woulda to' this muthafucka up
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
It's on, Gone With the Wind
And I know white men can't dunk, now I'm stealin blunts
And a cake from Betty Crocker, Orville Reddenbacher
Don't fuck with the black-owned stores but hit the Foot Lockers
Steal, motherfuck Fire Marshall Bill
Oh what the hell, throw the cocktail, I smell smoke
Got the fuck out, Ice Cube lucked out
My nigga had his truck out, didn't get stuck out
In front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas
Oh Jesus, Western Surplus got the heaters
Meet us, so we can get the 9's and the what-nots
Got the Mossberg with the double eyed buckshot
Ready for Darryl, and like Beretta would say
Keep your eye on the barrel, a sparrow
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
But I'm rollin', so that's a fucked up slogan
The Hogan's, Heroes, spotted the guerilla
By the Sizzler, hittin up police killer
The super-duper nigga that'll buck
We had to tear this muthafucka up, so what the fuck!?!
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
{Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!}
Wind, and Theodore Briseno. The four officers accused of beating
Wessyde-fa-life-in-ya!
Yeah, I'm with this, what we throwin' up?
All you busta ass niggaz out there
Back to set the record straight for all these busta ass niggaz
Who trip, this how we do it nigga
Front back side to side
We be givin' it up, till the day we die
Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have ta erupt
So motherfucker West Up!
Nigga clear the lane, here I come, once again
With this, gangsta click, droppin' this, gangsta shit
Strictly for the riders who ride us I gotta WestSider
Rhymer for them niggaz that's sittin' on them Dayton wires
Pump the bass, hit the switch
Cause Ice Cube, Mack 10, and Dub-C, back up in this b-i-itch
Straight hoodsta for life, ain't no lookin' back
Ink in my flesh, WestSide tattered on my chest
Walkin' with the shadow of death
Through the land of the skanless, South Central Los Angeles
Home of the Crips and the Bloods
Where even the strongest niggaz is drug through the mud
And visitors from outta town best to stay in Hollywood
You get that tourist ass ganked strollin through my hood
West coast till the casket drop
I be throwin' it up, so motherfucker West Up!
It's gun ho Mack one-oh please you can't fuck wit deez
Ice Cubez and Dub-Ceez is my G'z
And hip-hop, top three niggaz the new bosses
Never slippin 'cause we flosses, packin Nina Rosses
Nigga, thought you knew how we do it
Ain't a Damn Thing Changed, always on them thangs
Forever and a day, so back up, gimme room, don't neglect
Just respect and everything I can't check I wreck
Now you can cross out the bustas and snitches
Shit only killers hootchie bitches and hot hydraulic switches allowed
On the turf where the real hogs dwell
Sewed up the hood, the fattest bolas on the block for sale
Inglewood City, the throne I call home
Niggaz be so bright, you might need your locs on
To bail through, it's fin you're in with Mack 10
And I gotta confess up, nigga this West Up! for life
Now I got ta show you how the West coast rocks
No razor blades, in my mouth, just a glock
And I'm hittin you up, with that W-S
The sun, rises in the East, but it sets in the West
No gold teeth, you gets a wreath
So hand me the goodies, stockin mask, no hoodies
Christmas day, I'm in a tre
While some of you niggaz got the robe reindeer and a sleigh
We don't call it five-oh, we call it one time
It's my life my life my life my life, in the sunshine!
One nine weighs a ton
How the fuck you think that the West was won?
Now shit can be squashed over a forty ounce of backwash
No jokes, the land of locs and hundred spokes
In the East, we can be brothers
But when you come to L.A., watch your motherfuckin colors
West Up! nigga
Give it up, give it up
Like the nigga James Brown, me and my niggaz are puttin' it down
So bustas be wary cause see we represent the city
Where niggaz caught slippin is left with they brains drippin
City of the Angels, more like a concrete jungle
Full of macks Cadillacs and crack sacks
I pledge allegiance to the shit till I die
WestSide!
In any country, prison is where society sends it's failures
But in this country, society itself is failing.
Today, how you like me now, I'm in the mix?
It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota
Got the baking soda, let the water boil, workers all loyal
Dropped out the twelveth
'Cause my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees
Now I slang keys
Infest my hood with crack, 'cause I'm the mack
Take a nation of millions to hold me back
Too big for my britches, and I got bitches
Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches
Used to get 18 when my g was alive, now a key is 13 5
'89s the number, another summer
Police ain't get no dumber
Streets dried up, used to think it would last
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past
They tried to blast me for selling a boulder
Now I got my ass in minnesota
Got my own crew, it's on brand new
Damn what can I do?
Today...
What the fuck can I do?
Already done stack me half a mill ticket
Bought a house next to prince, so now I can kick it
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my benz
Goin' to see the twins, play at the dome
My at&t cell phone
I'm almost home
Gettin' excited, indited, spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest
And everything I own got repossessed
Now take a look at the dust
And I'm happy 'cause I only got 36 months
Never picked up a book
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look
Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew
And see, what can I do?
Today...
Fucked-up in the pen, now it's 94
Back in L.A., and I'm bailin' in the dough
Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch
So where to work at, and niggas smirk at
Me say ain't nuttin' poppin' from here to the L.D.
What you tell me?
No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe
'Cause, they sent in the troops
Even tho I got muscle, that ain't my hustle
Takin' niggas shit in a tussle
No skills to pay the bills
Takin' 'bout education to battle inflashion
No college degree, just a dumb ass g
Yeah you nigga
Who me?
I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess
Have you ever been convicted of a felony? yes
Took some advice from my uncle fester
All dressed up in polyester
Welcome to McDonalds may I please help you?
Shit, what can I do?
Today...
The white man has broke every law known to man to establish amerikkka.
But he'll put you in the state penitentary, he'll put you in the federal
Penitentary for breaking these same laws. now we gonna look and see if

Larceny, rape, racketering, conspiracy to commit murder, extortion,
Aggravated assault, mayhem, sodomy of the black man, trespassing,
Embezzelment, purgery, kidnapping, smuggling, grand theft, brandishing
A firearm, carrying a conceled weapon, breaking and entering, and
Premeditated cold-blooded murder.

What's the definition of a pyroclastic flow?
That's what happens when a volcano blow
That's what happens when Ice Cube starts to flow
Red hot lava mixed with salava
Pulvarising everything in it's wake
Nothing can survive a pyroclastic flow,
And no one will survive this one.
Fucking around in a crap game
Niggas think I'm soft cause now I'm in the rap game
And I don't hang out as much
Bang out dope cuts
Standing on stage and I'm grabbing my nuts
But when it comes to getting in a circle
I'm hitting sevens turning broke niggas purple
Looking for little joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke
When deuce-deuce hit the floor yo
Now which of ya wanna fade the twenty?
I'm turnin' your fat pockets skinny
Ah yeah I'm shaking the ivory
And boom it's like they die for me
Fool you can get loud, get mad, hit the joint
But don't forget my point
There it is yo
I put my nike on the bet so it won't slide
Money gone 'cause I'm never hitting deuce-five
I'm never hitting four-trey no way
You wanna leave but come on hoe stay
Nigga see but that'll work
Poppa needs brand-new shoes and a sweatshirt
Fool you can't even fuck with that
And now that I'm winning I gots to get my gat
'Cause I see your homies starting to look
And broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks
And I'm feeling like a baller
Bucking fools now the circles getting smaller
Now you wanna go and scheme
Punk niggas like you just love to triple-team
So I pick up my money and start walking
Cause now I let the gat start talking
Now since y'all lost you wanna go out like a sucker
Take that motherfucker
Listen to the preacherman
But are you talkin' to me
I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet
If I should need the swine flesh
Your body is a mess, but you're blessed
With a father, son, spirit and the holy ghost
But my whole neighborhood is comatose
Lookin' for survival
The devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible
400 years gettin' our ass kicked
By so-called christians and catholics
But I watch 'em burn in a fire
See I'm a g, that's why I ain't in your choir
'Cause I see, 'cause I know
The church ain't nothin' but a fashion show
Get the devil to a 187
And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven
You're waitin' for the devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
A beast in sheep's clothing
But I'm rollin' with that knowledge of self
Cause heaven ain't just wealth
So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe
Do I have to wait outside?
White man, please take another look
'Cause we couldn't be readin' out of the same book
Cause youse a crook and I'm a brother
King James had sex with his mother
Is that your edition? Is that your religion?
Black man, you gotta make a desicion
Cause God is comin' on day number seven
And he won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven
The same white man that threw me in the slammer
He bombed the church in Alabama
So if I cock the hammer, God won't mind
If I have to kill the human swine
Cause God is a killer from the start
Why you think Noah had to build his ark
And God is a man from his feet to his hair
That's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer
I just stare at the church man
Spendin' more money on the church band
But Elijah's got a plan
Cause one day these babies are uprise
Much more than bowties and bean pies
Kickin' knowledge at 7-11
And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven
Microphone check, heh, yo
Heh, yeah...
{They won't call me a nigga..} - 2X
Listen to the preacher man, but are you talkin' to me?
I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet
Thy shouldn't eat the swine flesh
Your body is a mess, but you're blessed
With the father, son, spirit and the holy ghost
But my whole neighborhood is comatose
Lookin' for survival
The devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible
400 years of gettin' our ass kicked
By so-called Christians and Catholics
But I'ma watch 'em burn in the fire
See I'm a G, that's why I ain't in your choir
'Cause I see, 'cause I know
The church ain't nuttin but a fashion show
Get the devil do a one-eighty-seven
And they won't, call me a nigga, when I get to heaven
{They won't call me a nigga}
{When I get to heaven}
{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}
You're waitin for the devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
A beast, in sheep's clothing
But I'm rollin', with that knowledge of self
Cause heaven, ain't just wealth

Got the white man screamin - Damn that Farrakhan!
Cause one day these babies'll uprise
Much more than bow ties and bean pies
Kickin knowledge at the 7-11
And they won't, call me a nigga, when I get to heaven
{They won't call me a nigga}
{When I get to heaven}
{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}
God damn, another fucking payback wit' a twist
Them motherfuckers shot but the punks missed
Ice cube is out-gunned, what is the outcome?
Will they do me like malcolm?
'Cause I bust styles, new styles, standing...
Strong... while, others run a hundred miles
But I never run, never will
Deal wit' the devil wit' my mother fucking steel - boom!
Media try to do me
But I was a boy-n-the-hood before the movie, yeah
Call me nigga, bigger than a spook
But you the one that voted for duke, motherfucker
White man is something I tried to study
But I got my hands bloody, yeah.
They say I can sing like a jaybird
But nigga don't say the j-word.
I thought they was bugging...
'Cause to us uncle sam is hitler without an oven
Burning our black skin
Buy my neighborhood - then push the crack in
Doing us wrong from the first day
And don't understand why a nigga got an ak.
Calling me an African-American
Like everything is fair again, shit
Devil you got to get the shit right I'm black
Blacker than a trillion midnights
Don't believe the hype was said in 88 by the great chuck d
Now they're trying to fuck me ...
{Wit' no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline}
It's a great day for genocide
That's the day all the niggas died
They killed jfk in '63
So what the fuck you think they'll do to me?
But I'm the o.g. and I bust back, boom boom
Bust back, boom boom,
Peel a cap, boom boom!
Gimme room in the fire of the sun
Hear the mack come
Hear the black come
Watch jack run
Motherfuckers can't gank me
Fuck a devil, fuck a rebel, and a yankee
Overrun and put the presidency
After needin that, I'm down wit' o.p.p.
I met farrakhan and had dinner
And you ask if I'm a five-percenter, well...
No, but I go where the brothas go
Down with compton mosque, number 54
Made a little dough, still got a sister on my elbow
Did ice cube sell out? you say hell no!
A black woman is my manager, not in the kitchen,
So could you please stop bitchin'?
{Gun shots}
You missed and didn't hit the lench mob either
But I got the fever for the flava of a cracker, not a pringle
Bust a single, here's my new jingle
The kkk has got three-piece suits
Using niggas like turkey shoots
My motto is treat 'em like a prostitute.
If I say no violence devil, you won't respect mine,
Fuck the dumb shit and get my tek-9.
And if they approach us
A-ight, a-ight - I bury those cockroaches.
And if you can't deal wit' my kill at will
Here's a new gift to get
Try my death certificate.
Amerikkka's most, amerikkka's burnt - it's like toast
Like jordan I'm going coast to coast.
Dribbling the funk
Here comes the nigga wit' the mother fucking monster dunk
Get off me punk
{You better eat your wheaties}
Darryl gates got the studio surrounded
'Cause he don't like the niggas that I'm down wit'
Mother fucker wanna do us
'Cause I like nat, huey, malcolm, and louis.
Most got done by a black man's bullet
Give a trigga to a nigga and watch him pull it.
Negro assassin,
I'ma dig a ditch, bitch, and throw your ass in
When they shoot, no, it won't be a cracker
They use somebody much blacker
What I do?
I call up the geto boy crew
'Cause my mind's playing tricks on me too.
Never die, surround my crib
Makin' sure nobody creep when I sleep
Keep a 9 millimeter in my jeep - peep!
When I roll, I gots to roll deep.
Ain't going out cheap
Make the mad circle on cypress hill 'cause it's so steep.
They'll never get me
They'll never hit me
Mother fuck that shit j-dee.
Now I relax
Grab the st. ides brew so I can max.
Sitting on the window 'cause it's so fucking hot,
And then I heard a shot -
Boom.
Drivin' down the big black highway
The flyway. Hey bitch, you goin' my way?
Now I got a passenger
I look at the miniskirt, now I'm askin her
Would you like to hit the fat bud?
Or perhaps should I run your name through the mud?
I mean, are you giving up the nappy dugout?
She said no, well then get the fuck out
'Cause I know where the hoes be feinin'
Plus your bad ass got my six-deuce leanin'
Bust a u on the avenue.
Why oh why there ain't shit to do?
But then sir jinx played his mix
And you thought that beat played out in 86
Lookin' for my dogs
Looked up in the mirror being followed by the hogs
One time's on my motherfuckin line
Why the fuck the swine had to get behind a nigga like me?
They must thind I'm a G
They both walk up with the g. l. o. c.
Started they investigation
No driver's liscence no registration
When I stepped out the car they slammed me.
Goddamn y'all who got the camera?
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just give me just one more hit
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just give me just one more hit
No lights no camera no action
And the pigs wouldn't believe that my slave name was Jackson
He said don't lie to me
I'm lookin' for john, matt, or spike lee
The muthafucker called for back up
I guess they planned to beat the mack up
He called me a silly ass thug
And pulled out his billy ass club
Tearin' up my coupe lookin' for the chronic
Goddamn nobody got a panasonic
Found an empty can of old gold
Came around and put my ass in a choke hold
Fucked around and broke my pager
Then they hit a nigga with the tazer
The big fat pigs were tryin' to hurt me
I fell to the floor and yelled lord have mercy
Then they hit me in the face y'all
But to them it ain't nuttin but a friendly game of base ball
Crowd stood around I said goddamn ya.
Who got the camera?
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just give me just one more hit
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just give me just one more hit
Who the fuck got the camera?
I knew when I saw that deputy smirkin'
That they was gonna put some work in
Mr. law had to hit me in the jaw
'Cause I called them faggots with guns and badges
They played rat-a-tat-tat on me head
But if I had the gatty-gat-gat they'd be dead
A victim of a big fat 187
And little devils don't go to heaven
Last night there was 11 but they weren't scarin me
So they tried the flashlight therapy
I looked at the black one and called him a traitor
I don't give a fuck if you got a beta
Just take my colored picture
So I can go downtown and bitch and pitch ya?
The one that called me a spook
His name is officer david duke
If the crowd weren't around they would've shot me
Tried to play me out like my name was rodney
Nowadays police gettin' badder
But if I had a camera the shit wouldn't matter.
Bitch who got my 9? Who got my 9?
Y'all done did it this time, uh.
Who the fuck got my nine?
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Who's the mack? is it some brother in a big hat
Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?
Rolling in a fucked-up lincoln
Leaning to the side so it looks like he's sinking
Into that leopard interior
This nigga thinks every girl's inferior
To his tongue, get a dumb bitch sprung
As she's selling more butt
Don't even get a cut of the money
His name is sonny
And he know the play
And hope to od that he don't find a runaway
That's looking to become a star
He'll have your ass in and out of every car
With every on and rick, sucking every john's dick
Come short of the money, get your ass kicked
You don't like it but you still call him hunk
Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk
You wanna leave but sonny started talking fast
And it make you wanna go and sell more ass
He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack?
Who's the mack?
It is that fool that wanna pump the gas
Give you a sad story and you give him cash?
He starts macking and macking and you sucking
Quick to say I'm down on my luck
And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way
Then you see his sorry ass the next day
Are you the one getting played like a sucka?
Or do you say, get a job, motherfucker?
Every day, the story gets better
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-assed sweater
He claims he wants to get something to eat
But every day you find yourself getting beat
He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways
'Cause he's in a daze
And almost get his ass hit for the crack
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack?
Who's the mack?
Is it that nigga in that club asking
Have you ever been in a hot tub?
I know the game so I watch it unfold
When I see the boy pinned to your earlobe
He's talking shit and you crack a smile
When he tell you that he can go buck wild
For a girl like you and make it feel good
You know it's drama but it sound real good
He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging
The pussy so he can keep bragging
He say, I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me? 
The pussy so he can keep bragging
You wanna do it but you feeling like a h-o-e
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over
'Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover
Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack?
Macking is the game and everybody's playing
And as long as you believe what they saying
Consider the a m.a.c.k. and with no delay
They are gonna get all the play
But when it comes to me, save the drama for your momma
It's ice cube and you know that I'm a
Mack in my own right
When it comes to rhyme and rap
'Cause all I do is kick facts
Unlike iceberg slimm
And all of them be claimin' be p.i.m.p.
No, I'm not going out that way
I'm just a straight up n I double g a
Next time you get over on a fool
And you did the shit like real smooth
Thank ice cube for giving up the facts
And ask yourself
Who's the mack?
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Yeay.
Wassup Crip Loco
Yeah, uh, ya nigga shot me last night
Smoked a nigga for nuttin'
What the fuck.
Why the fuck you wanna murder me?
Your punk ass never heard of me
I never did nothin' to your family
Still you wanna kill a young nigger randomly
You wanna take the life God handed to me
Send it back to him, 'cause you ain't a fan to me
Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me
That's an animal, a fucking cannibal
I'm Jeronimo and Hannibal, we international
Gangsta bull I'm a bull in Barcelona
With a karona
You's a fake ass nigger, where's ya owner?
I'm real live man, you a persona,
Now I'm a goner, call ma momma in the corner
Mister gun man, your plan is working
'Cause niggers is dying and mommas is hurting
Why you wanna murder me?
You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am
I could be part of your family tree, now
Sent by G.O.D
To save the word you and me
You never know who you facin'
Who ya chasin' The life you wastin'
I was made by the one and only G.O.D
To take my life to the T.O.P
Now here comes a motherfuckin' D.O.G
Who ain't happy till a nigger is R.I.P
Tryin' to be som'in' you saw on BET
Either T.I.P or B.I.G
I don't give a fuck what you saw on TV
But a 187 don't make a O.G.
I'm a O.G, never had to fake it
God gave me this, how you goin' take it
What you goin' tell 'em, when you get to heaven
When he asks you why did you send back his present.
Who the fuck are you, you motherfucking peasant
Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessin'
Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes
Nigger, hell on earth is being stuck in the 80's
Why you wanna murder me?
You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am
I could be part of your family tree, now
Sent by G.O.D
To save the word you and me
You never know who you facin'
Who ya chasin' The life you wastin'
Before you shoot me man think about it
Lets go have a drink about it
Before you make a stink about it
Man lets talk about it, maybe we can walk about it
But just don't be a coward
And take my life 'cause you got the power
Of the white man's gun powder
'Cause you might face a gun tower
And time never run out
They take the fun out, till your life run out
So don't pull the gun out
If you ever want a house, just like Run's house
It's better than a big house
Less four-five some woman we can dig out
Find a place we can pig out
Party all night, till the owner say 'get out'
Why you wanna murder me?
You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am
I could be part of your family tree, now
Sent by G.O.D
To save the word you and me
You never know who you facin'
Who ya chasin' The life you wastin'
Dedicated to all the niggers, that's dead and don't know why.
Who wanna look at the nigger that shot 'em
And ask these questions.
Why me homie? Why me?
Yeah
Every hood's the same

Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed
It's the same ol' same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day to day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower living?
The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons
Thank god for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids

Y'all wanna know why it's noise in the hood
Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a crip and a blood in the hood for real
'Cause when niggas get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by five-o
Grandmama came to court with her bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A., state property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the four-four up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
The game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the big bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' 'em up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Ready to Buck! Buck! Buck! But it's a must to Duck! Duck! Duck!
Before I bust!
You lookin' for the one that did it.
You like my vote? No your never gonna get it
'Cause I'm the one with the tight mad skills
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills, Sittin' at the pad just chillin'
Larry Parker just got 2 million, Oh what a fuckin' feelin'

Got me a plan to break Tyson out of prison
You come my way you get served
Still got a deuce that'll bunny hop the curb
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin, never seen with a happy grin
Show da phat frown 'cause I'm down, take a look around
All you see is big black boots, steppin, use my steel toe as a weapon
Kick ya and flick ya, now they want to label this nigga tape with a sticker
But that's nicety, 'cause I got a Body Count like Ice-T
From here to New York I get 'em skins, and I ain't talkin' about pork
Swine, pig, dig

Ready to bring that noise and kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys
April 29th more power to the people, and we might just see a sequel
'Cause police got equal, pay, A horse is a pig that don't fly straight
Doin' Daryl Gates but is Willie Williams down with the pilgrims
Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave...
I'm wicked enough to pull this
'Cause now it's on to the fullest
Gorilla straight from the mist
But I don't miss when it comes to this
Bring the yellow tape

Through with the picket signs, take his job and stick it
Bigot, 'cause I get wicked.
Ha, Ha, Ha

Servin' more than peanuts bitch
Niggas tryin' to stay rich
How many ways... can a killa get paid?
How many niggas want a gansta boogie
I see the junkie in your eyes
What do you see me when you see me
A G in disguise
Been hypmotized since '85 with gansta shit
All you niggas get live and represent my click
Got bits and pieces on my mind commin' together like lettuce
Dear God protect us, 'cause we're mobbin' like Good Fellas
Alias Carlion, maybe the war is on
Prone to let my daughter live rich before she's grown
If I murdered Capone, would you consider me a villain
Chillin' with millionares, ex-killers, and set-trippers
My murderous complex begin to hit 'cha
Slip ya worse than New Jersey Drive niggas
'Cause I'm in a
Rush to bust straps like mack-10's
When I'm strapped in
A '95 Impala
Breakin' like Vegas for my dolla
While I'm commin' like a hundred miles and gunnin' who gonna test
The southwests connect when it ain't shit you possess
Yes we got the endo
Splurgin' in Benzo
Turnin' virgins to nymphos
Look what 'cha in fo
A 'G that's gonna let his khakis sag
Mr. Mike and Ice Cube, franch braids and rags
Byatch
How many wicked wayz, can a gansta' get his pays
When he's trapped in a maze
I represent the phrase that says crime pays
Bitches can we fuck, niggas' can we blaze
I treat bitches like puppies
I got a plate full of guppies
Appropriate dish for the big fish
Niggas' rich
They have my straps
Women with gaps
Now they wanna' sit in my laps and listen to raps
But no
Heard a nigga' tight named Mr. Mike
Had to catch a flight, its only right
Stepped of the plane, Mean Green and Tony Draper
Killa was the caper
Lets make some paper
See we can't get enough of this gansta' shit
Sick as leukemia for weed in my gansta' click
Lets take riches
Witness two niggas' dome in the killa' zone
Bring your killa' chrome
'Cause we headed to the terror dome
Some niggas' never make it home
As long as you got your front

And like this
Let the weed blow, cause all you G's know
Who got the wickedess flow
The criminiminals
Say What
Niggas' wanna' short my cuts

How you sound
Ganstas' make the world go 'round
Guppies bow down

Chase his ass down to Atlanta, GA
Find out where he stay
Locate my gate
Catch him in the hall
Make his ass call
They won't believe all the heat I bring
From Palm Springs
Niggas in line to catch the ring
Of the dyin'
Keepin' it calm, so talk slow
'Cause you'll never know
When I'm ready to blow
I'm a pro of the lifestyle of the Bloods and Crips
Make a lot of cookies filled with chocolate chips
The Westsides always been down with the South
With Suave mother fuckin' House
Damn, what you doing over here? whassup?
Yeah I was thinking about you the other day
And I was thinking I should have never fucked wit' your ass
I should have left you right where I founnd you
When I was with you all you ever do was bitch
Talk shit, but you could suck dick
So I didn't sweat all the fussin' and cussin'
I would stress and strain to mantain
And didn't need to hear your motherfucking ass complain
Bitch I got fifty cents on this genesis
Talkin' 'bout niggaz got to vacate the premises
An' outa nowhere your ass got hard
Poured out the pub, then you got drugged
We at it again, I tried to count to ten
There's no end to your naggin'
You can't treat me like I'm faggin', hoe
To be king of my motherfucking castle
Breakin' all my dishes
And fuck all my x-bitches
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours
On an' off, off an' on, bitch I'm grown
It was a time we used to bump and grind
Without a motherfucking reverend
Managoua twages and bomb-ass massages
And dreams of three-car garages
You say I'm cheating when I'm up at the studio
Come to find out you the hoe, oh
And you was way out
Talkin' 'bout rap, was gonna play ya
You made yourself loud and clear
Started fucking with this baller named chris
Couldn't resist the rolex on his wrist
I kept on writing my raps with profanity
Now I'm on tour fucking bitches like fanady
You tried to diss this, now you missed this
And the first and fifteenth is like christmas
Send me naked pictures but give it a rest
With mrs ice cube tatood on your breast
Now you at the back door of my show
Hell no but it's still delicious
Went from rags to riches
And fuck all my x-bitches
Fuck you, fuck you, especially you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours
Now I hear you sayin' yeah I used to fuck 'em
Not lettin' 'em know I was a young buck then
Niggaz axin' me man, did you love her? 
Second cousin, friend
Bitch since when?
Never bought your ass a goddamn thing
That I had to pay for
I was hateful
Fuckin' everything that I could get my paws on
Walkin' through hell with gasoline draws on
Now I'm on the mic, music is my life
It's your thing if you like the switches
But it's my world and fuck all my x-bitches
Never go down the same road twice

But I'm doin' good, fuck the police that's rollin' through my neighborhood
Fuckin' peaker wood see me in the 5 speed
I don't care if his muthafuckin' eyes bleed Yeah yeah!
This is my weed, this is my world
Don't get mad when you see them hundred spokes twirl
Candied out while you spit yo' last on the pearl
The Don Dada, I'm hotter than holly watta
I Wish I was your baby father 'cause I got a fuckin' head on my shoulder
And led in my holster, face on the poster
The kinda nigga that you wanna get close ta'
But you can't so you start the lyin'
Just like that nigga that think he dyin'
Get ta cryin' snitchin' and testifyin'
To all my people if I'm talkin' 'about your baby mama
When she meet Ice Cube tell her save the drama.
Yo Cube, I'm gon' have all the bitches here.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
Yo man fuck them bitches, they ain't call me back
'Cause I just paged my auntie.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell your auntie.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
Tell your cousin, tell your sister, if she want me.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
I'm a be as real as I can with this
Not just the fake analyst on canabis, who only say that the world is
Scandalist, without findin' out a way to handle this
Dismantle this, either with the rhyme or the fist.
How the fuck we get in the belly of this bitch?
I be rich if it wasn't for the snitch
Lyin' to the enemies, wild conspiracies
I'm a say this till the day that I die
7 35's bring on bitches lies
While you bullshitin' I'm hard hittin' like
2Pac, I keep spittin' till my heart stop
Young niggas tryin' to tell me that I'm played
Once they say you played, nigga you must be paid
Pushin' weight since the 10th grade do my thing
Got more plaques than Jordan got rings, nigga sayin'.
Yo Cube, I got the new Biz 9000.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
I got the Playstation in the windshield nigga!
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It---
Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell your auntie.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
Tell your cousin, tell your sister, if she want me.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
I hate to see your ass comin' Yep with your mouth runnin'
Talkin' 'about somethin' What? that ain't meanin' nothin'
'About your second cousin who be always buzzin'
Where she was or wasn't, who she now fuckin'
Stories by the dozen Punch you got the sequel What?
To let you tell it Randy Moss is your people
It's evident, your ass lie like the president
How the fuck can your friends be the benjamins?! Punk
And your little ass car's full of fender benz
There you go on the stand with your hand up lyin'
Testifyin' about a man that's in handcuffs
We should do you like the Mack said
And if he lie like a crackhead pop 'em like a black head
Let him ooze, let him loose
Let him lie by his muthafuckin' ass on the news. Yeah yeah
Yo Cube, check out this ring, 69 karots.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
It's Kryptonite nigga, Kryptonite!
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell your auntie.

Tell your cousin, tell your sister, if she want me.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--

Nigga ask the bartender if you think we lie
But if you think we high, nigga think again
'Cause when it's sink or swim
You got to think to win
And if I drink this hen
Everybody will know it
'Cause I ain't going for it
So pray to the Lord that I don't pull out
Cuss out and bust out

Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date
But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great
As soon as I get a word we can rush the safe
Fuck them license plates because life is great

Niggas jealous of my shit
You unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit
While you're rooting and recruiting
Nigga 6-8 whooping
I was in the hood shooting 'cause I had the wife whooping
I come from padres gold in oversized jars
I past up strife and got star awards
No time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing
Came out the substation to the hip hop nation
The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga
Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga
Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it
I keep pushing, don't quit it
Don't stop till I get it

We puttin' it down, constantly
Get your ass up and hurra
Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder
What's the date and time it don't matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort
To make a long story short
Ran into this girl named Carla
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala
She said what's up yeah what's the deal
Check the hairdo of course it ain't real
Then I looked down she was fat in the front
I asked how long, well about seven months
Oh how time flies when you're having fun
She said yeah but the damage is done
Where you been, on a little vacation
Oh by the way congratulations
Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue
Then she said the lucky man is you
I dropped my brew
And everything looked fuzzy
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy
She said yeah remember that date
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said damn are you sure it's mine
'Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times
She said that day no I wasn't whoring
Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about giving up the money
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy
Naw 'cause then I'd really get faded
That's murder one cause it was premeditated
So what I'm a do
I don't have a clue
How many months left damn only two
I'm gettin' faded
No cigar, G
Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded
It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her
See the booty and the front was all in place
But the girl had the pitbull face
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid
Oh lord god forbid
My homies see me at the motel
Cause those fools would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept
And hold your big fat butt steady
Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing
That I'm a hate myself in the morning
I got drunk to help me forget
Yo another day another hit shit
I'm gettin' faded
Ay yo you know what time it is
Nine months later she's ready to drop the load
And everybody in the hood already knows
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me
You know Ice Cube can't be having that G
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger
JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up
I'm gettin' fed up bitch
'Cause I know you're tryin' to break me
But if I find out your tryin' to fake me
I'm a buff that duff for a hoot
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is getting kinda major
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver
Looking like my next-door neighbor
She said it was mine that was her best guess
But let's check the results of the blood test
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative
Damn why did I let her live?
After that I should've got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no I just told the hoe who laid me
Excuse me bitch it's a switch
You can't fade me
Naw baby not this way
Yo you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger
I don't fall for the okey-doke
And before I fall for the okey-doke
I let the pistol smoke
Now sing it
Yeah baby you can't fade me
Naw unfadable baby
You don't wanna fuck wit these
You don't wanna fuck wit these
Run up you big-ass bitch and I'll have you clockin G's
Wit my knockout jab, mess around and stab
Yo' ass in the gut, I don't give a fuck
Down with the brown, clownin these honkies
That got us in the mix with they 666
Tricks get found, stinkin like tuna
Bailin through your hood in my fresh suede Pumas
And I don't hit gates, nigga pump yo' brakes
'Cause I ain't runnin', you better start gunnin
Take your hand off your metal
There's nowhere to hide, cause the world is a ghetto
Want my afro long like Mad Dawg
On a velvet poster, 40 on the coaster
Cause moms don't play that shit
Sayin' you need Jesus, 'cause I got the fresh sweatshirt
With the three fat, creases
And it's on like that, nigga where you at?
At a phone booth, I'm comin' in the Coupe
Beanie pull over, fool there they go
Drive real slow so we can let them hoes know
That G's even bust on L.A.P.D.'s
Make 'em eat cheese, 'cause they don't wanna fuck with these
And he don't wanna fuck wit these
I got mo' flavor than a hoe with a dick
And a stick of gum on her tongue, I get you sprung
With the psycho-alpha-disco, my fist go
In my pocket, grabbin on my pistol
But I won't pull it out till it's time to spit
Make the girls say, Damn, niggaz can't have shit
'Cause I see Satan, waitin in the cut
For this black motherfucker, to bail out his hut
And I don't give a mad-ass fuck
My chinny chin chin hit him up with the right
And then I bend bend got his ass in my sight
My Chuck's hit the cement, then I bent the corner
Hypnotize yo' ass like that shit Knee Deep
And you hate it, gang-affiliated
Niggaz be bumpin, just a little somethin'
From that loc'ed out nigga that cater to the O.G.'s
And let you know, that you don't wanna fuck wit these
And you don't wanna fuck wit these
And you don't wanna fuck wit these
Rollin' through the hood, when I see a bitch
I hit the switch, she's on my dick
Fresh t-shirt, thick like I hangs
They say I got St. Ide's rushin through my veins
From the CRASH units, all the way to Vice
They claimin Ice Cube, ain't nuttin nice
'Cause I keep hittin, fuck Bill Clinton
No repentin, just representin
I can walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun, 'cause I ain't the one
Bang you're dead, brains out your head
I wish I was the nigga that invented infrared
Now I got it poppin' but what's that odor?
Smells like a hot pot of that bakin soda

Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My truth can, ill - fool I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it
Comin' from the West Side
West Side, comin' from the West Side
Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Whom got got, and who got shot
Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob, Planet of the Apes
I'm down with Eiht, and Watts Up
Kam is solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want The Bomb just like George Clinton
S-K-D is down to catch a body
Put on Knee Deep, we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it
You know how we do it
Jack B. Nimble, and Jack B. Quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick, cause
I'm that fool from South Central
You think you stuck yourself, with a number 2 pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With Mo' Bounce to the Ounce in the dash
Mash up, Ve-nice, headed for the West
Everything is great, slow down for the dip
On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin'
Stashin' a glock and I thought you knew it
You know how we do it
Comin' from the West Side, West Side
Nuttin' but a West Side
It's hittin' on the West Side
Fool, you know how we do it
Yeah... yeah!
Fool -- you know how we do it
West Side
Comin' from the West Side
Nothin' but the West Side
Ain't nuttin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on artillery, you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My truth can, ill - fool I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'

Gettin' six on artillery, you don't want to see a G

Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it
Wessyde, it's bumpin on the East Side
It's slammin' on the South Side
Makin' noise on the North Side
Chillin' with the homies, smellin the bud
Double parked, and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Whom got got, and who got shot
Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window

Now Jack B. Nimble, and Jack B. Quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick, cause
I'm that fool from South Central
You think you stuck yourself, with a number 2 pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With Mo' Bounce to the Ounce in the dash
Mash up, Ve-nice, headed for the West
Everything is great, slow down for the dip
On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin
Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin
Stashin a glock and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it -- and
You can't fade the R-E-M-I-X
Goin' to the bank cashin big fat checks
What's next on the menu?
Got a big fat booty to attend to, ooh
With the rhythm it takes to dance to but
We got to live, too
Mobbin and robbin and squabbin and stealin
K-Dee and me, I got the feelin'
And won't be happy till I'm platinum loc'
The freshest MC in the world, who is?
Fool, you know how we do it
I'm hittin on the West Side
It's bumpin on the East Side
Slammin' on the South Side
Makin' noise on the North Side
This world, so trife
Your money or your life
Keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life
This world, so trife
Your money or your life
Keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life
I got that gangbang mentality, movie after movie
Can't get it outta me, who wanna battle me?
Mouth is a Uzi, I thumbtack your ass
To the concrete, treat you like a floozy
This pyroclastic flow that I lay
Will turn this fucking booth to Pompeii
Now what will I do in broad day?
I turn Broadway into a hallway
Motherfuckers wanna know the herbs and spices
They come to me and wanna know what my advice is
I'm spiritual, nigga, like Jesus Christ is
And lyrical, bitch, I'm 'bout the nicest
Content longevity
Plus I spit shit that sit on your brain, nigga, heavily
I can do this shit 'til I'm 70
On the Vegas strip, yeah, there I be
This world
So trife
Your money or your life
Keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life
This world, so trife
Your money or your life
Keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life
Now I get that money, make that cheddar
Play a double header, we can do better
You can get wetter, blown out your sweater
So much game, need Dick Vivetta
Now Helen Keller can read this letter
23rd space if you read alphabet-a
I'mma go-getter, you's a point setter
Pointin' at me like you got a vendetta
Boy, you know better, they used to call me
Cube The Impaler, ask Jerry Heller
You the kind of fella that look for Cinderella
I'm the kind of fella that steal her umbrella
Now this ain't a diss, don't tell Rocafella
And don't try to exorcise the ghost of Makivella
But I just got to be the best storyteller
A tough, Slick Rick win with this acapella
This world
So trife
Your money or your life
Keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life
This world
So trife
Your money or your life
Keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life
