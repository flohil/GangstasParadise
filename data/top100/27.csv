That's how all my niggas know
Blowin' dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll
Money hoes cars & clothes
That's how all my niggas know
Blowin' dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll.
We in a drop top Chevy with the roof wide open.
My partner's lookin' at me to see if my eyes open
'Cause I've been drankin' & I've been smokin'
& flyin' down 285, but I'm focused.
It's a 454 SS, I race Porsches.
White leather seats as fresh as Air Forces.
I say I'm doin' 'bout 100 but the track still bumpin'
Number 8 on NWA ""Straight Outta Compton.""
Pull up at your apartment sittin' on 20 somethin's
& the dope boys holla ""What's happenin'?"" the kids running in.
The cliques start dancin' & the broads start choosin'
& the cars been parked, but the rims keep movin'.
Sign pictures, by an onion of good & throw the deuces.
I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood, I'm use to it.
So if your rear view shakin' & your seats vibratin'
24 inch J's got the chevrolet skatin' makin'...
Money hoes cars & clothes
That's how all my niggas know
Blowin' dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll
Money hoes cars & clothes
That's how all my niggas know
Blowin' dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll.
I made a million & I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest.
& a civilian in the tightest ride, I want the best.
I refuse to get a 9 to 5, I'd rather flip my keys.
Been payin' my dues since '89 tryin' to get my cheese.
Diamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know it's me.
Ain't no dream or no fantasy bitch, it's T.I.P.
Broad buffin, like a baby do a binky
5 karat VVS's on my muthafuckin' pinkie.
Half of Hennessey & Belvedere what we drankin'.
Pimps score ourself a broad what the hell you niggas thinkin'?
Y'all niggas spend a weekend in the islands in the fall
24's be shinin' when I'm ridin' 'cause I'm ballin'.
I'm callin' out shots like a pool shark.
My tool sparks in the dark when I fool marks.
Y'all fool hearts in the wrong place & the wrong time.
I gotta strong mind to grab my chrome 9 & shoot at your ass for a long time.
But I'm'a get that ass hauled off.
Fuck around with the clique
They'll be lookin' for your dick with a stick
Nigga y'all soft, so y'all off.
I'm'a ball at all costs, spit game to a dame
Look around this thing 'til she falls off.
Some balls off, I got the...

That's how all my niggas roll.
I ain't flossin' little shawty, I'm relaxin' right now.
I'd probably still be trappin' if I wasn't rappin' right now.
Braggin' about pistols at the house.
Strap right now.
Keep on talkin' folk, I'll lay you on your back right now.
Wanna act right now? Get smacked right now?
Hey I'm above a muthafucker, I don't know to back down
Clown down, we're makin' friends; talkin' about what you makin' nothin'.
I'm 21 & 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothin'.
Played by the niggas gettin' head for a change,
Use the lead when I spray, end up dead from the K.
They ain't ready for the raid, pay heavy from the yay
I told the class ""kiss my ass"" I make 11 everyday.
I'm gettin'...

Hey, hey

Witout da braids I'm da closest thing to O-Dawg
Minus the testimony
Say it ain't so, homie!
Hey

Aye, where I live just as big as yo projects, dog

How I walk, how I talk, how I stack dat chedda
What I drive, how I dress, nigga looks just betta
Hundred stacks on that nigga I'm just... Betta
Hahahahaha
Somebody better tell 'em mayne
They swag owe my swag everything
Very plain to see you study me awful hard
To the point that my swag need a bodyguard
I'd like to thnik to thank you 'cause uh y'all oughta be
Havin' y'all swags sendin mines an apology
A lot of little mes, I see, got beef
But what's the possibility, stop, see, you not me
Hardly work for hella beams
Step up to the guillotine
Get decapitated
Don't see how half you rappas made it
Say good... bye to the fame and the fortune
Say la vi
What the game need with you, nigga? They got me
I ride through the city so clean
Seat really low, auto-mo
Billies, so pretty, but I'm illy tho
No comparison
Ain't a nigga mo' thorough than this gangsta American
Flow, dope or da heroin
King like Evalyn
Champaigne mayne
So durranged and buligerant
Ranked up there with Benjamin
Who? Andre 3K, B.I.G., Jay-Z, UGK, Scarface, Machievelli the great
Wayne, Common, Kanye and
Lupe
So fuck what you say
You welcome to ask who you made
Bet they say as of today
I'm back on top like a toupe
Hey
All objections overruled
It's overdue both high
And sober too, I'm so high
Up over you
Same guy you see in the streets it's as fly as here in the booth
So don't be surprised when you meet me to see that I'm really the truth
So uncoof
Nigga, who want proof?
Must agree that shit idea
Can't no one undo
I stay on my 1,2
Nigga who want 2?
Turn a brunch into a brawl
Do what you gon' do
I'm wired
Hot as a bitch and still
Cool as a fridge and dear
This year I'm on a mission dear
Think that was somethin'? Listen here..."

I'm on my grind, Grand Hustle, got the mind and the muscle
50 carats in the crown just to shine on you suckers
Still tote the Glock .40 for the haters and the busters
Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me, I'ma bust 'im
I don't need no security reachin' for my jewelry
Get ya niggas popped quick, filled full of hot shit
Fresh out the box, Tip hopped in a drop 6
Made a quarter mil in the pen gettin' stock tips
Haters wanna stop Tip, mad 'cause they not Tip
Ball every summer so ya baby mama jock Tip
You don't want no drama, pimp, I promise I do not slip
Chrome .45th hid well if the cops trip
Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of that
Five carat stones with the platinum all up under that
Rap beef, I ain't gonna participate in none of that
I'm aimin' at yo fitted cap and you ain't gonna want none of that
A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP
Ask anybody who runnin' A.G., bet they finna say me ASAP
Niggas hatin' on P$C get straightened ASAP
A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP
I know a lot of rappers don't like me, but they won't fight me
Feds swear I sell dope, well why they won't indict me?
Advances on the throne I ain't never taken lightly
But all that tongue wrestlin' hatin' while I'm gone don't excite me
How many rappers you know that can hold they own on Rice Street?
Any steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly?
In normal population, half the jail just like me
Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gone strike me
Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely 
They barkin don't bother me, I be bombin' 'fore they bite me
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be
Shiesty with a conversation quite pricey 
My fists so rocky and my wrist so icy 
Might be thrown off my rocker just slightly
Feisty, flamin' hot temper don't ignite me
I'm only gonna ask you ""find the exit"" once politely
A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP
Ask anybody who runnin' A.G., bet they finna say me ASAP
Niggas hatin' on P$C get straightened ASAP
A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP
What up, say hello to the man of the people
My plan is to keep you at least two levels under me where I need you 
I'ma take advantage of my chance to defeat you
Ya true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you
I'm grown, nigga, so let it be known we ain't equal
You're sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I cant reach you
Beat you to a fucking pulp if I need to
The very spot you standin' in then is where I'll leave you
Seen on the scene, white tees and Evisus
O.G. status, I don't beef unless I need to
Sissy you way outta line and you runnin' outta time 
Hang behind closed doors when you heard I got some time
Yeah, I know you were thinkin' ""out of sight and out of mind""
But I'm the wrong one for you to try if you were tryin' to shine
Listen, nigga, this shit here is more than just a lot of rhymes
I don't know what you do for your respect, but I'ma die for mine
A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP
Ask anybody who runnin' A.G., bet they finna say me ASAP
Niggas hatin' on P$C get straightened ASAP
A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP

Every time I take, penitentiary chance all I take
God with me I'm a find my way
Nigga they ain't even fuck around nowaday
Feds came in the house, say they found my yay
A couple handguns and a new SK
Bag full of weed and some gram of yay
But fuck it though I gotta keep my grandma straight
Catch a case, getaway by the grace of God
Standing on the corner slanging slabs of hard
Just a young soldier no camouflage
Man them niggas ain't tough they're just playing hard
I pull a fuck nigga card on GP
Between 'em make 11 mill and peewee
We spray your block, turn around pull and repeat
And let everybody look at it on TV
I'm certified I'm gangster, getting on the rock like my banker
I'm in the gated mansion, no neighbor
New Italian suits on my hangers
I got Cuban links and diamond rings
Solitaries of shiny things
Aye fuck how tough you tryin' to seem
Come try the king, 'cause I'm about my
I'm about my issue babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Have you ever heard? The point blank blast of a Mossberg
Whole block never mind, look you've not heard
Lil' nigga keep it moving like they not scared
And I hear it, they do or die
Kill after kill in the coupe so fly
Man the niggas over there tried to shoot your guy
Man the fully automatic.22 go by like damn
And they fly as I am, it's hard for you to tell how high I am
Oh my God damn, you see it don't believe it still
And all I ever had was a Glock 23 and an extra mag
Presidential weed and a extra bag
2 or 3 bad bitches I'm a get the friend
We set to land and I'm a get the plan
How to violate your little sexy ass
Then get in the Jag
Just ride this till you get to splash
You a wild girl, go cowgirl
Keep the noise down, you loud girl
Turn down, don't know how girl
No white girl cause
I'm about my issue babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Couldn't listen to niggas they said I dream too much
Heart fucked up, guess I sing too much
Numb to it now, bring a gun to it now
When this shit pop I'm a run to it now
Niggas talk loud but they dumb to announce
Read he got away so he tryna play it down
When they kick down your door and they run through your house
Cuffs on your wrists and they cussin' you out
It'll make sense then, telling you that they got your prints then
What's the reward for your risk then?
Niggas game goofy, this just in
Time after time, know we need a light nigga blind lead the blind
Why do we ride? Grind to provide nigga not just to shine
Blood in my eyes, stress on my mind let a fly nigga fly
9 on my side, God I'm your child but times are so wild
Playing with me? I'm a draw down and I'm a show out
If it gotta go down, I'm prepared to go now cause
I'm about my issue babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da"

And my bank roll got a big dip
She gon' bring it on a big ship
Quite trill, no Quik Trip

It's automatic got a baller habit, smokin' aces what you facin
When you hatin', ain't no rehabilitation
For that monkey on my back, hundred thousand dollar stack
Ya ain't heard, used to serve Firebird like a Pontiac
Rewind me back, ay you know where they used to find me at?
In the back, sacks full of somethin' for insomniacs
Dope boy, trap nigga in my past life
Now I just serve rap nigga plenty act right
You know where we at, right here, like yeah
In the club on the furniture, fuck do I care
Tell the club owner here, Rosé, Remy bottle please
Got a carload of bravado, ain't nobody hot as me
I don't bend, I don't break, I go in, I don't play
Tell your friend that the game can begin if she stay
I pass out cake like your birthday bitch
If you kiss both of those, lick that, take this
(T.I.)
Ay, a dope boy with the swag of a pimp nigga
Except one thing, I'm paid more than them nigga
You see a bitch can't afford this life
Have to fuck a ballplayer and a mayor every night
Maybe twice, late at night we, be in white tees
Me and Skateboard P, no Nike's
Just a pair of Margiela, get a broad tell her
Rain dance for this paper, better get her umbrella
Yeah, had guns like an arms dealer
Dream team lawyers, he ain't never been a dumb nigga
Nigga, this your girl, better come get her
Turn her to a dick monster, nut muncher
Sperm rag, cum dumpster, left amongst her
Bitches in the past, pretty titties, plenty ass
They just drink up what we give 'em, take shots without any glass
Fuck her in the face till it fall off or till she gag, gag, gag
(Pharrell)
And it don't stop
A lot of niggaz out there think that they could do what we do
Be my guest, go and front for the people
But just like a storefront they gon' see through
That you sweet like bubblegum and they gon' eat you
How you blowin' up? Nigga they chewin you
And when you hit rock bottom they shoo'in you
Like ""Ooh, you eww, get away!""
Naw you, yeah right, okay
Don't listen to these guys, these niggaz full of lies
Cut 'em open and they cover up the floor, you surprised?
Every time they talk about what they gon' get
They been lookin' at my blog knife and forkin my shit
While I'm tryin' to get the new G-5 with the kit
With the bed in the back, cause my son hate to sit
And all that dark blue shit, y'all niggaz been had
My diamond's rainbow like they registered for GLAAD
Every aspect, whether plane, boat or pad
Tote a brightness like your chain 'pose to have
Got it from the ring so you know that they straight
Plus the Audemar twins, I guess my wrist couldn't wait
To tell ya"

I can see, you look like you're ready to ride
And girl obviously, it's mutual, ooh you wanna give it to me
Ridin' off in Hollywood
Kicking it with hotter bitches, all they get's a lot of wood
Give it to 'em hardcore, all they do is holla good
Her ex he be short strokin', I lean in it follow through it
She's so sexy, her complexion say she from Bollywood
In my section, I wonder will a thousand dollar do it
If not a fifty or a hundred, still I gotta do it
You surely would, if you were me then for sure you could
Get her and her partner out the honda
Have 'em both fuckin' and suckin' to mañana
Hey nigga you with baby he don't want no problem
If your man ain't a killer, what the fuck I care about him
No comparison ain't nothin' rare about him
Witness saying he was just standing there and then they shot him
Trigger got no heart when that thing squeeze
Or they catch a body to make you my main squeeze, yeah
Don't be bullshitin' with me

She said she don't like girls, she did that night
They were taking turns, I was taking flights
In competition man them bitches hit that pipe
Going down on it
If it ain't a bad bitch then I don't want it
Ain't no mediocre
Experiment with pretty bitches, that's the shit I told her
As long as they got pretty toes and they ain't got a odor
And showed her, how to stack paper to foldin'
Colder than eskimo shoulders
You strong with it, I don't play
Tote four four for the vultures
Eat pussy Lord yes is she looking gorgeous
And you're just a lot of talk
Them three got on the molly then the four of us we got it off
And they ain't get paid like they playing college ball
Go out receive a cock and balls
Bullshit me, not at all
Don't be bullshitin' with me
I don't care if you've got a boyfriend or not, girl
It's at ya own risk if you kick it with me
'Fore it be over you be spending the night, girl
I can see, you look like you're ready to ride
And girl obviously, it's mutual, ooh you wanna give it to me
Quit playing with me
I know you got a nigga he just gon' be mad at me
So if you love 'em, think he's special, don't come home with me
'Cause when I get you to my crib you gon' belong to me
I understand if you don't wanna go
Just know what's gon' happen once we get through the door
Promising you something you never seen before
Say you with me if you down I ain't tellin' nobody
So tell me what you gon' do
When you ready you can fall through
You can bring a friend too
Say you with me if you down I ain't tellin' nobody
So tell me what you gon' do
Yeah you can fall through
You can bring your friend too"

Broke my parole to have a good time

The door was locked so I kicked it in she was trippin' on the bills, I think she was high on some pills she through my shit out into the yard then she called me a punk and slapped me real hard and in my drunken stupor I did what I should have never done now I am sitting here talking to you drunk and on the run
Chorus:I sittin' at the bar on the inside waiting on my ride on the outside she broke my heart at the trailer park so I jacked her keys to her fucking car and crashed that piece of shit and stepped away

Different signer: guess it was meant to be romance is misery so much for memories and now I am heading to the penitentiary see me on TV the next cop series I am a danger I guess I should have did something about my anger but I never learn, real things I don't concern I pour kerosene on everything I love and watch it burn I know it's my fault but I wasn't happy it was over
She threw a fit so I crashed that piece of shit
Back to normal voice:And now I am going back again back to the pen to see my friends when we all pile up on that county van they'll ask me where I've been I've been at a bar on the inside (chorus) NA NA Na NA nA nA na na na"

Hey, hey, hey, hey
I got my 44's, and my dro
And my Chevy on 24's
And my hoe, now where I s'posed to go
See me ridin' in a Chevy, 44 on the seat
With a quarter o' of blow gettin' loaded wit C
No tags, no license, the trunk loaded with D
Ridin' Fulton in D where we know it to be
They pull us over, you think I'm stoppin', you must be fuckin' wit me
If they don't want to die tonight, they best stop fuckin' wit me
I'm'a pull over in Bowen Homes, my cousin and me
And they gon' hide me in they home while they lookin' for me
We the neighborhood superstars, pimp a Chevy pullin' hard
Thousand dollars worth of dimes in the trunk with rockstars
We puttin' fear in cowards hearts when they see us on the block
Swirvin' in the deuce and quarter, bustin' shots just because
The hell I care about gettin' caught? I'm makin' bail by 12 o'clock
Back in the spot with the same old serve and drop
I pull a hoe in Bangkok, drop her off at TIP's spot
I'm burnin' rubber, fuck the cops, another day on my block
I got my 44's, and my dro
And my Chevy on 24's
And my hoe, now where I s'posed to go
I'm Cadillac daddy, pulled up on some hoes from ol' Natty
I said I'm Pimp Squad hoe what's happenin'?
Westside get them panties snappin'
She asked me can I do the Laffy Taffy
I said I do to make the pussy happy
Let's get a room over on Virginia
Step inside a suite and then continue
You in for a lil fender bender
Baby just remember make it quick
You niggas kinda know me I'm the shit
I'm the in the bubble kush Chevy
Well at least that's what it smells like
Hit the gas, poof, fire blowin' out the tailpipe
Tailpipe that's all these hoes wanna lick for the night
Treat them like Tina, beat the pussy, and ya call me Ike
That's right, monster ride sittin' on the 28's
Sounds like a stadium, you would've thought the Braves played
The engine runnin' like Vick, with the Falcons on the hood
Mr., Mr. Westside, yeah, you know they in my hood
I got my 44's, and my dro
And my Chevy on 24's
And my hoe, now where I s'posed to go
Ain't no tellin' where I'm goin', 'less I'm steppin' out
Sittin' on the high life, windows up in the clouds
Open up the console, that's where I got my gun
Right next to that, get the bag and roll another one
I got vitamins, make a freak fuck all night
Hoes know, killers on the Westside earn stripes
Make that money turn bright, just look at my piece and my grill
Swirvin' off Church St., the pimp God gave me skills
I was born up in Bankhead, y'all remember me
Way back in 83', T.I. stayed on the street from me
Just 'cause I'm from Bankhead, niggas having beef wit me
Half never seen a G in the cab of my Beamer V
Ten screens fallin' in my Chevy watchin' Lean on Me
Ridin' down Simpson, bout to waste my purple lean on me
Purple linen clean on me, the whole zone 3 on me
Waffle House Charger, yellow-black I got a bee on me
I got my 44's, and my dro

In the middle of the trap, we hang the dro blaze
Niggaz in the trap ain't changed in 4 dayz
Waitin on a page dat sayin' the blow came
Instead of us just finding mo ways to get paid
Anyway, in the fire, I done been there homey
Niggaz ball, niggaz die and ain't shit fair homey
Dem crackers give ya some time and get to sit there homey

Without a gun, you got somethin'll make 'em bar you son
That's a million dollar mind, why, dez niggaz is dumb
Yeah they gon get outta line, but dez niggaz is scum
They outta sight and outta mind till you visit the slum, stay down
Stay on the grind and yo digits'll come, bottom line
You gotta shine no matta what you become
Dez streets is 40 percent of yo mind and 5 percent muscle
10 struggle, 10 time, and 35 percent hustle
And trust if dey don't burry the scared, dey burry the dead
When anticipatin pistol play, be very prepared
And if you ain't, find somewhere to burry yo head
Because them hot ones from the choppas tear ya body to shreds

And Ima grind it out, even if I'm dyin' it out
Ain't got no mo than me, so what the fuck you lyin' about
That man right there, but ain't gon be when dey start findin out

See what you need to do is take a chilly-willy pill
Go and chill yo ass out, fo dey deal yo ass out
A bad hand from a mad man, in a mad clan
All dem otha niggaz take a fall you gon take the last stand

Time, rhyme 'bout the times I invested in 'caine
Pleasure and pain in every aspect of the game
I'm the answer to yo prayers if you prayin' for change
So, I dare you compare us and say we the same
When I'm, climbin' the ladder, they stuck in the same
Mindframe, they accomplishments are nothin' to gain
Eventually, see I'm outta yo range
Except this rose gold glow from my wrist and my chain
I entertain young niggaz who slang
Like a picture, no frame, see it's simple and plain
My shit bang, spit flames, put niggaz to shame
Flow so insane, lyrics STICK IN YO BRAIN

Just be easy - the drama ain't nothin' to me
Ay be easy - before you have problems just breathe
Ay be easy - you ain't worth dyin', believe me
Just be easy - you don't want yo mama to grieve
Be easy - well mind yo bizness, don't bother the G
Be easy - swear you stuntin' but you frontin' to me
Be easy - behind the scenes or behind yo?
Ay, be easy
STEADILY kissin' ass when I came to leave
Set the standard for Atlanta, rearranged the lead
Okay, so what tha fuck is fame to me?
I been plottin' since kindergarten, you'z a lame to me
I give the niggaz what they came to see
A reflection of one self where they aim to be
As you can see it ain't no change in me
And you won't meet another nigga off the chain as me
I'm so fly, no lie, don't deny it, ya feel it
So inspired by my style, decided to try it yoself
Bet you won't, meet nobody ranked as high as myself
The checks you waitin' on, homes, I can sign them myself
Tote gats, dro smoked that, now I'm high
Seats way back in the Maybach I ride
Through the streets of the westside, I slap five
And throw dubs, show love, nigga HATE ME NAH

Wishin they could take a ride on my moustache
Or maybe see the inside of my plush pad
But I must pass, I know what you on homie
Up late one night early morning and hey, it dawned on me and
Love my mutha fuckin' life
I'm so mutha fuckin' tight
They say ""he think he the shit""
I say ""you mutha fuckin' right""
Teach a mutha fuckin' dyke to learn to love suckin pipe
Buses, cars, trucks and bikes in my yard
Up the price of my performance
Now I'm goin' for a half a mil' a night
Quarter million just to party
If you gossip get it right
Niggas shiest
But I know somethin' if I put end a nigga life
It's gonna begin a nigga trip to god and end a nigga life
Man I keep it one hundred, one thousand to be precise
If you round me frontin go find a mountain and take a hike
Yeah I know you set your sights on me, tryin' to get stripes
Homie look smaller but feel bigger in real life, don't he?
I'm all that and more, ain't nothin' 'bout the hype for me
I'm sharing life moments, ain't nobody write for me
You a one trick pony, I'm quadruple threat homie
Up late 4 in the mornin and hey, it dawned on me and
I'm clearly somethin' special, officially I'm the best who
Did it in my city and even in the U.S, you
Must agree, they can't fuck with me, I'ma beast unless you,
Hatin', you ain't gotta be sneezin for me to bless you
If the records don't get you, I bet the movie will get you
??...Will catch your attention, I'ma impress you
With swagger long term, Hollywood bitches to tag along
Groupies just imagine on, they know what I'm braggin on
I gotta message you can pass along, tell a friend
We getting long paper jay, we made it back from hell again
Knockin' on heaven's door, residing there forever more
Promoters, this worth every cent, you couldn't buy a better tour
And you are forced to admire the messiah
Expressin your desire, you're just preachin to the choir
The nation has it wired to hear your majesty, sire
I'm flyin high up one mornin and hey, it dawned on me and"

Do it for my daughters and my youngest son's mama who
Go buy what she want because she know it ain't a problem to
You do something to them and to you I'll bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two

20,Can You Learn,2012,Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head (2012),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Eh
I got a question for the ladies out there, yeah
Cause there's a few things that I would like to know
Before I fuck with you
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah eh
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah
You sure you wanna roll with me? I'm a complicated man
Live my life close to the edge, it ain't even safe to stand
Trouble Man, always into something
Numb to the consequences, guess it's coming if it's coming
But so much shit they say that I can't do because I'm famous
Guess I should live in a bubble like these other entertainers
The danger's so enticing to me, I don't even notice it
Guess I get away or get arrested 'fore it's over with
Prison sentence every year, got everybody after me
Reaper on my heels, I'm just praying he don't catch a G
Imagine me and you, somewhere happy with a few hundred mills
Sill I could go to jail for some years
'Cause I push it to the limit, the danger's so exciting
I'm loving every minute, girl this life ain't nothing like it
And you only live once so as long as I'm alive
I be living on the edge, shorty sure you wanna ride?
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah eh
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah
Ay ay ay
Aye, they say if the drugs ain't the death of me, the lifestyle will be
Law keep arresting me, sucka wanna kill me
Still we in the fast lane, grind break, next speed
A million dollar sports car, smoking on the best weed
Fist fights in night clubs for rap beefs
Shootings, retaliations, yes that deed
I guess they just got to catch me when they catch me
Because I'm putting it in they life if they attempt to disrespect me
Especially when I know they say what go around come around
That's why when we go around I keep a gun around
Cause bullshit, there be none around here
But I got a secret though, I wanna change - I swear
But suckas won't let me and feds still sweat me
So I'm looking for the worst to have you praying for the best
Think you can help me if they get me? Could you handle shit for me?
Think about it, is your body sure the answer assuming me
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah eh
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah
Girl would you give me your number? (tell the truth)
If I had an ok car, not much money
9 to 5, with a future on me oh
Tell me would you ever fuck with a brother like me? (would you?)
If I did time in my life, time in my life
Time in my life, time in my life
Tell me could you give your sex to me? (I really wanna know)
If I was fightin in the club, fightin in the club
Fightin in the club, fightin in the club
Hey baby!
Could you learn? (put your hands up)
Learn to love a troubled man
(If you got a drink I need you to put that in the air as well, ok?)
Hey baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah eh"
21,Castle Walls,2010,No Mercy (2010),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again
I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaires fantasy
With phantoms and Ferrari's in the driveway
But you see the pain and the change of the same man's sanity
Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently it's damaging the man you see before
You on the canvas he may seem all right but all the disadvantages
His family encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nines awhile I dare you, I scare you
While it really seem like the kings life seem glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera's don't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls
Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit
Of all that I've accomplished if my kids never win at shit
Me knowing this, why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
I guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major out there slinging, yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight
Would your favourite song about the whips, money and shit
Be relevant if you found out, the money wasn't real, nope
So me being the goat shouldn't mean more to me
Than see it to a king though
From a bad ass kid to man with some dough
Otherwise I may well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin with flip,
Shawty low, Gucci or Ludacris or if I'm fucking with a hoe
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
Or slap me in the face, ay, I'm just the man
If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records
It's cause this my life, these ain't just rapping
Shit, you think of that deep, did ya, dawg?
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Bitch ain't thinking with the deep, did ya dog?
Cause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if, I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls
Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom
But I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall
For the record ay, I could give a damn if I never sell shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell it
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
The day that I walk I ain't saying that I'm amazing
Down playing the way I keep fellas from catching cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
And when I say what I mean even when I'm sorrounded by the fakers
From one of the greatest centers, blessed with most of god's graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty,
I'm always being given to recordings than the level of your loyalty
Obvious you've been ignoring me
Who else ya seen make it through the storm, unharmed this charming
While all the critics was looking for prince charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out of used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
But most of y'all don't see the castle through the walls
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls"

Bumpin' Prince, Sade, or some Marvin Gaye perhaps, I
Put up my blues, put on some tailor made slacks
Some wing tip shoes, whachu know about that?(Ha)
Button down, cufflinks, hair cut, no hat (Yeah)
Just felt like gettin' clean and show I know how to act
At Neiman and Marcus let my girl blow three or four stacks
Gotta forever to cut the food, and damn I'm relaxed (Chillin')
In a real cool mood, no beef, no gats
But there real close by, niggaz better know that
(Jazze Pha)
I ain't hangin' with my niggaz, pullin' no triggaz

Gotta big sack of some of that shit from California
A bottle of Patron and a six pack of Corona
Dro aroma got the six hot and steamin' like a sauna
So I let the top back and I bend anotha corner

I ain't hangin' with my niggaz, pullin' no triggaz
I'll be back to the trap, but for now
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today
I ain't hangin' with my potnaz, I'm out eatin' lobster

Tonight I'm gon chill with my lady friend
She the type to keep a nigga open
I'm chillin' with my bitch today"
25,Chooz U,2001,I'm Serious (2001),Hip Hop,T.I.,"(Verse 1 - T.I.)
They say love blind, so why can't I picture this guhl mine?
Yeah I dig her but I figure, I'm wastin this guhl time
I'm runnin' from relationshipz, scared to commit
Mad at monogamy, sexually, I'm a misfit
But this shit's... way too much fo me
Usually I can take'em and make'em a cut buddy
Yo mama probably see me, and say that I'm no good
I was born in the burbs, I was raised in the hood
We from two separate sides of life, two different backgrounds
Shawty been legit and I just started to rap now
I ain't tryina act now, I'm bein real witchu
Really, I just wanted to kick it and chill witchu
But the picture got bigger, 'fo I could even paint it
Thoughts got deeper befo' a nigga could think
A playa like me on this, strange ain't it?
One thang bout yo feelins is this, you can't change it
Yo preception on me, I don't think I can maintain
We flirtin with disaster, this game we playin' iz dangerous
You the best thang that happened since I don became famous
But sometimes I think we shoulda remained strangers
(Chorus - Jazze Pha)
I... I chose you baby
(Stay with me now, stay with me, sing it fo me shawty)
I, I, I, I... I chose you baby
(Ah, come on, uh, uh, uh c'mon)
(Verse 2 - T.I.)
I like you to pursue, but still I respect it to let it go
Give it time, give it room to breathe and let it grow
I'll just tell her when I'm ready to change, I'll let her know
Hate to say it, but till then be friendz and nothin' mo
Evendoe anotha time, anotha life, anotha place
I swear I know we coulda been great
But rather than great, you lil heart take the smile of yo face
So I can treat you righ, I'm willin' ta wait
And ain't shit fake, I know it sound funny comin' from a felon
But I think I got a piece of whuz up in heaven
So to keep from, blockin mah blessings, think I better back up
Last thang a nigga need now is bad luck
But if my life was perfect shawty, I'da had her
I guess, I guess I don't deserve it, ballaz tell me you ain't worth it
So I gots to hit the surface, I'll holla when I holla
Act like I don't wanna see ya, and I'on wanna call'er"
26,Collect Call,2008,Paper Trail (2008),Hip Hop,T.I.,"On top of the world and I'm standin tall
But if I ever ever have to take a fall
Will you accept my collect call
Will you accept my collect call
'Cause everybody loves you when you ballin
But don't nobody want you when you fallin'
I gotta know will you accept my collect call
I gotta know will you accept my collect call
(T.I.)
I was told way back in the days when I was trappin
Never mind what niggas say judge 'em all on their actions
It's hard to imagik in the day when I was trappin
Never mind what nine when you traveling
Havin' fun gettin' paper catch a case and see how niggas act then
Out a cell partner been fired he rattin on me
Got a little benja pension now they turn they back on me
Shit 'cause out of sight is out of mind
Better put your trust in God homie man will let you down every time
And I'm speaking experience, serious
Imagine my surprise hearin from the inside
Everybody talkin' 'bout me like the nigga just died
TIP gone, 20 years at the least get 5
Man niggas just lie for suspicion of they snitchin
Not to mention the rumors of me committin suicide
God will open your eyes and show you who really with ya
But keep it in the back of your mind when it's over how niggas did ya
(T.I.)
I ain't never asked a nigga to do shit for me
I wouldn't do in return but guess you live and you learn
Don't expect my well bein to be a nigga concern
'Cause I know that ain't the way the world turn
'Cause everybody love to see a nigga assed out
Rather see you lose it all than to see you cash out
They gossip like bitches I don't even ask how
'Cause niggas ain't shit! I believe that now
And it don't even matter how much you do for people they'll love to
See you beat down livin' in the gutta, what a
Shame at the least in the game when you see
They want you locked up more than the police
The same can't wait to get a nigga off the street
They hate to see me sittin' on buckets off C
Dog beat bet to you don't even make sense
But that mentality is exactly why you'll never be rich, HATER!
(T.I.)
I remain a stand up guy no matter what I
Stood tall chest out head up high
With my back against the wall layin it all on the line
With God on my side I perform every time
Must I remind you
Similar to a miracle just short of amazin
Survived shit that would've drove most niggas crazy
Rose to the occasion whatever situation
Surprised haters and came out gun a blazin'
Theoretically speakin' but you rather be thinkin'
I'll fold 'cause you want a view of me I know
All I got is the family, friends come and go
And with that understandin I put none before
My folk you know enough to do the same I hope
If not, shit ya ass will find out
When you on top everybody wanna ball with ya
But when you not you wouldn't even know who to call would ya?"

The bills need payin' nigga simple and plain
Take a young'n who's aspirin' to get him some change
Won't nobody hire him so he get in the game
Went and bought a 50 slab, divide it up into ten
Sold 'em all, double down, did it again
By then you got enough to buy a quarter ounce
You sellin' dimes to forty fiends buy it and bounce
Throw some money to your momma keep some food in the house
Cop the outfit and the Jordans on the day they came out
Betta get ya self a pistol know the jackers is out
Flip another seven grams, oh you hustlin' now

Buy you somethin' to ride in, ya gotta be tight
Next time you buy somethin' take twenty-five hundred
Get four and a half it come back in nine don't it
Now stay low key when the money keep comin'
Keep some niggas on ya team to show these suckas they don't want it
By then your connect will clearly see you on ya grind
Shit you come to get a nine and he front you what you buyin'

I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead...
Ever had one of them days you wish you would've stayed home?
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you get jumped, here that's next
So they don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you're hit 4 times, bullet hit your spine
Paralyzed waist down, now ya wheelchair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday
All over bullshit dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be 'cos of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow I guess
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say

I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situations
Could've been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin' smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now I think about ""Damn, what a life I had""
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit still look back get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door.
Who would've thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
I had done took that ass whippin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night
'Cos I hit you and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who me
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take

Just so I can get out there and grind her ass
Wit yo fine ass, must I remind yo ass?

I made this song to let you know shit that I see ya when you workin dat ass
Make a nigga think later on he gone be twerkin' that ass

And ain't no room for nothing else in that skirt but that ass

And if you don't know what to do wit you better give it here shawty
Put a bend in her back, I'm throwing the dick she giving it back
I tell her if you ever give me dat ass I ain't giving it back
She bouncing her ass, later on I'm a blow a ounce wit her ass
Ride out wit her ass, cut sumethin' on the couch wit her ass
Then bounce to her pad, 'cause you know it ain't no housing her ass

Ay I'm working here, know what I'm saying
Try to put yourself in my shoes for a second
It's not personal I'm just sayin' though
Ay look
From when the moon came out till the sun came up
I was supplyin the days with what they flame up
Our mamas passing by, trying to explain us
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
But, try to understand that's how we came up
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)
Really we rather be rich and famous
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine
Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough mayne
I'm tired of people mis-representing my dough mayne
Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustling
For no gains (picture that)
(Hook (sample playing in the background))
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin' my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job
I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see
Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me
And I ain't always up to no good and on the creep
And ye' ain't always gotta pass through the hood without speaking (how you doing)
We ain't out here threatining your lives, raping your children
We just out here staying alive, making a lil' bit (you know)
Working hard, trying to survive chasing a billion
You hear us talking loud, just think of us as chamelions
Adaptin' to situations, but accusations is still there
And robbing your house, now you just hurting my feelings (maaan)
We got lives, we wanna live nice too
We got moms, dads, wives, kids just like you
But our options are fewer, its hell in high school
When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too
So before you go judging us loving us won't hurt
If you're under 25, staying alive is hard work
And for you to see what I'm saying, open eyes would help
If you could think about somebody besides yourself
Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself
Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help
Instead of calling the law, and busting my balls
With all due respect, we don't even be fucking with y'all (maan)
And we can't help it cause it is like this
We don't like it no more than you that we live like this
Always, stuck in the grind, from summertime to wintertime
Cut school, and sell fifty dimes by dinner time
See everything we know we learned from the streets
Since thirteen I've been hustling and earning my keep"

Okay the bucket's on tilt, truck is on stilts
Just did another deal today, at least a couple mil'
And I'm askin' you to chill, wanna pass that down?
I'm tryin' to pick you up and never put ya ass back down
Get rid of all your worries, why you draggin' that around?
Here, pop one of these, now pass that around
Fire it up, take a shot, now ya ass in the clouds
Can I bend you over? Throw your ass back down
No need sayin' no, we way past that now
I ain't them other niggaz, just control the flashback now
Make three wishes, you can have that now
And fuck the financin', payin' cash right now
Ay, miracle man make dreams come true
Take a ride, get high, 'bout the time you come to
I bet your life done changed, you likin' my last name
Done had a couple babies with a Bentley and a Range
Crib on the water, eatin' meals on a plane
And your life in the sky like you lived on a plane
With so much good shit to fill yo' brain
If the band seem strange I'm just sayin'
Ay, hey don't you wanna be high?
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride get high with me
Ay, ay, I know you wanna be high
You never wanna say bye to me, if you ever come fly with me
Ay, hey don't you wanna be high?
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride get high with me
Ay, ay, I know you wanna be high
Promise you'll never say bye to me, and if you ever get high with me
Let's go
(T.I.)
You see me, chillin' out kickin' back in the ride
With a, fly broad on the passenger side
Got a, nice smile and immaculate eyes
Before she, get inside she don't have to decide
'Cause she can have it how she want it, we can do it like that
And then I went and threw it to her and she threw it right back
She said nobody never gave it to her like that
Hit it from the back, I figure you would like that
Her head and tight pussy good like that
And damn, she ain't even from the hood like that
So she probably never really kicked it with a cool nigga
Other niggaz had her didn't know what to do with her
Intimidated by her face and her cute figure
Cause her waist real small but her ass way bigger
Hope she know that if I want her I ain't finna play wit her
All I gotta do is spend a day with her
Ay, hey don't you wanna be high?
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride get high with me
Ay, ay, I know you wanna be high
You never wanna say bye to me, if you ever come fly with me
Ay, hey don't you wanna be high?
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride get high with me
Ay, ay, I know you wanna be high
Promise you'll never say bye to me, and if you ever get high with me
Let's go
(T.I.)
Hey, hey what it is pretty girl, would you like to
Come and kick it with a nigga for a night or two?
And you can take your clothes off if you like to
And it don't matter 'bout the cost if I like you
I just do it shorty, I ain't gotta try to
Bust a move, bet ya I can satisfy you
And me chase right behind you, why boo?
I'm like you, know you fly but I'm fly too
You know how I do it, always ride good
Match the paint with the wheel, put the trunk in the hood
You dealin' with a real nigga, get it understood
I'm still from the hood, even when in Hollywood
With my beat down low and my top let back
You lookin' for a G, well you got just that
Hey I can be your king, you can be my princess
Baby all you gotta do is say yes
Ay, hey don't you wanna be high?
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride get high with me
Ay, ay, I know you wanna be high
You never wanna say bye to me, if you ever come fly with me
Ay, hey don't you wanna be high?
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride get high with me
Ay, ay, I know you wanna be high
Promise you'll never say bye to me, and if you ever get high with me

Shack it in the winter and the summer I'm a shine (getting mine)
It's plenty of money to be made from Candler Road to Bankhead
It's plenty of room to get paid for those that ain't scared
I got the hard for the j's and dro' for the dank heads

Triple gold and vogues, poppin' moe' blowin' pine
Honey brown wood grain wheel in the 'lac

Now that I made it rapping I ain't never going back
I'ma let the paper stack till it can't no more
Still got love for my niggas slangin' blow
Getting do' fo' sure

If this ain't yo trapp then what the fuck you doing in it?
What the muthafucking business, do you think you puttin' down?
If so then my corner you need to get the fuck from round
Unless you wanna sell some weed my nigga Beed got the pound
Anything else I don't need ya help, I got the hard locked down
37's ki's in da grill of the broam
Jumped from 33 to my folk in Boyd homes
All most gone ain't got but four mo'
Eternal Simpson Road ain't no more blow
Nothing left for you but to count my do'
Just something else to do while I blow my dro'

35,Drug Related,2004,Urban Legend (2004),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Country had fronted me 20 keys told me to keep 20 G's
And forgot to tell me 25 to eternity.
Now picture me, in a GS3 with all my fold
Versaci Coat, and armani lobe from slangin coke.
This ain't no joke situation nigga I'm I'll with it
My occupation clockin 6 figues so deal with it.
My mob be cannon, pealin? over teflon protect my belly
From 9 mm cannon while talkin' on celly's daily
Niggas frontin like they makin' pay
This is real pimpin', key comin' straight from the CIA and bill clinton.
You kinda thugs ain't got a clue do you?
Hey who the man who supply the man who supplying you with a couple grand?
Interracial freedom for some luxuries This ain't the bet.
Nigga Materialistics can't substitute for your happiness.
Lifes about how you feel about you and what you do
When you waking up in the morning you seeing who?
I think you niggas done bit off more than you can chew
Cause you don't even know why you do half that hot ass shit you do.
Why I'm trappin? 'Cause it's the only job with fair taxes.
Keep a nigga in tight to death in polos and air maxes
I'm blastin these niggas daily whenever they try to play me
Baby you wanna lay me, but baby you gotta pay me.
Nigga you owe me cheese, that's ground for beef
I'm rollin' with the P$C with a pound of chief.
Hey if this rap shit don't work, I'm stuck slangin drugs, until I make enough money to go and buy me a club.
I got 36 ounces that I got to move and 20 keys comin' to me on the 4th of June.
Soon as the school year ends, I pick up my keys
So crank the V12 to down to females and place 'em with cheese.
200 G's for the package, but they 10-5 a piece now.
On the streets they goin' for 21-5 at least
21-5 times 20 Look that's 4-30
But listen closely cause the dope game get more dirty.
If I cut 'em into ounces, 28 grams for 800 a piece
Hey 36 of them in a key, more cheese for me.
Now there's 28 g's and 800 cash just for one key, and I got 19 more stashed.
208 g's at 800 times 19 more, come out to 5-4-7
Comma 2-0-0
That's 547 g's and two hundred
47 g's you can ball 200 get blunted
The other 500 g's invest it in keys
So I can triple my cheese and have a million at ease.
That's how it is. This game ain't no life time deal
You better get as much cheese as you can and get the fuck outta here."

High as gas is, the country at war and people are starvin
And I pay a million dollars for Ferrari's, retarded, huh?
Sorry bruh, been a dick that been ballin since it started up
Season hoe, get 'em all to fuck 'cause they know this dough stack tall as fuck
Nah, it ain't that I'm rich that they hate so much
Least I could do it, not rub it in niggaz face so much
So I'm tryin' now while I'm rhymin not to brag about the island
Or the crib in Hawaii where all the walls slide in
House is wide open, we could bring the outside in
I think you should hear about it, but fuck it I'll be quiet
I just spit it how I live it homie I don't be lyin'
Would it make you feel better if I put my pockets on the die?
If I made less money, started to dress bummy
Would the haters and the critics have more respect for me?
Should I downgrade the crib and the way I live?
Now how about I don't and we just say I did, nigga
Ay say homeboy
It's real talk comin' at you live and direct homeboy, you dig that?

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams] w/ T.I. ad-libs
(But she's a freak though)
She got angel eyes, wit the baby face
(But she's a freak though)
I want my momma and daddy to meet her
Maybe have my name
(But she's a freak though)
They keep talking about you
Because they - can't keep up with your pace
You're my - super freak! super freak!
You're my - super freak!
(Verse - T.I.)
My momma taught me, everything fine ain't the finest
And everything that shine ain't a diamond
They say that change come wit time and I'm finding
That most bitches take your kindness for blindness
Yeah it feel good laying her beside you
Diggin deep, ol' nine up beside you
But we can't kick out in public, gotta hide you
Cause all my partnaz in the hood done tried you
It's true that you can't turn a hoe into a house wife
Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife
They say that you a freak I'm thinking that they bout right
Because that pussy's so good and your mouth tight
A pretty face, slim waist, and her stout nice
Juicy ass that them niggaz in the south like
She super sexy, got a nigga thinking 'bout a wife
Wearing all white, being wit her for life
(Verse - T.I.)
The main thing making niggaz judge you
Is the same thing that make me wanna love you
From the smell of ya hair, I wanna hug you
To the way you yell ""give it to me"" when I fuck you
Plus you ain't tripping off a nigga 'cause he thuggin'
That's why I'm twice as happy as relationships that wasn't
But my partna say you trickin wit his cousin
But nevermind, I don't listen they be buggin
They find it hard to understand how could T.I.P. love
This girl, when her man is out at strip clubs
Maybe cause T.I.P. girls leaving wit girls
And in the morning they'll be waking up with six girls
They don't know we more like homies when we pick girls
Why you worried 'bout it, he ain't gotta make you his girl
Fuck what he think about you, I think you the shit girl
Make me wanna bring another kid in the world
(Verse - T.I.)
Now I been told every nigga in the streets know
She ain't nothing but a freak ho
But when I look in her pretty eyes, I don't see it though
Now she done showed me some shit that I ain't seen before
But what we do behind closed doors is for me to know
All in all I've decided I'm a keep her though
I'm a fucking grown man, what I'm creeping for?
Just try me by the four, that's what I'm toting heaters for
I'd die by that for her a real good reason though
That's how I feel, let my partnaz and my momma know
Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go
I disrespect, she is selfish, she don't hide it
Though she may have been a tad misguided
All she need is a little affection, a lot of direction
A nigga wit a constant erection
And I done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing
Procrastinating, I wanna buy a ring and pop the question"

Psycho, nuts so, what I give a fuck fo?
All I know now is to get out and go for the gusto
So, fuck niggas, fuck hoes
They said, she said, nigga and what, so?
Fuck what they say 'bout my cases, fuck what they say 'bout my lady
Fuck what they say we were doing on that day of visitation
All I care 'bout is my out day and this next year of probation
How much dough I'm set to makin', where I'm gon go on vacation
Wait, damn ... okay, that's way too far ahead of me
So I'm just tryna take it day to day if they would let a G
Breathe, cop cars by the 3's
Bitches call me Papa John 'cause I keep that extra cheese
Overseas in the sun, living for the fun
In Milan with some bad bitches, probably wanna yawn
When will it dawn on 'em I'm a Don?
Ridin' foreign, curtains drawn, getting blown by a blonde
I'm the bomb, terrorist, hella rich, wreckin shit
Nigga ask about me, homie I suggest you tell 'em this
I'm sucka duckin, I'm sucka free
You ain't a G? don't fuck with me

Them sucka niggas out of style, G season
Them sucka niggas out of style, G season
My best flow too cold to just bring it out
But go to talkin' crazy though, you get yourself singled out
Half a million bucks to pack a whole arena out
Being a sucka I don't need the first thing about
You get the scene about, I'm coming at your face
Like a volcano head, lava running out your face
Hey, if your ass out of place
You done find the weapons they took away, I replaced
What can I say? Another year, another case
Another sentence completed, I'm confident and conceited
I'm sucka free, sucka duckin so tell them suckas to beat it
Don't fuck with me, buster trust me your future will be deleted
Such a G, ain't no touching me, luckily I defeated the odds
But out my to Allah and glory to God
And I ain't even Islamic, so sick whenever I vomit
Just throw me a mill or two and that ought to settle my stomach
Box of money he done it, call me Mr. HeRunIt
These niggas ain't really 'bout it,
They just be speaking ebonics
I'm nothing short of iconic
Promise you you don't want it
Strong as gin and tonic, my left you won't see it coming
My right should be running from it, I catch you with it - you done
I'm a keep it 100, you better get you a gun
Word bond, real talk
Do my dirt all by my lonely cause these suckas will talk"
41,G' Shit,2014,Paperwork (2014),Hip Hop,T.I.,"I'm a rich nigga like I don't know
I can change if I wanna, but I won't though
Steer right even when I'm on the wrong road
Real talk from the heart what I'm known for
Skinny jeans, I don't do those
I'm the starter sub-par oughta shoot for
Fully automatic chopper, you could shoot though
Now I'm movin' five mil' when I shoot dough
Audemar, Hublot
One point five on the two-do'
Old hustle, new flow
Old money, new ho
Suckers prayin' I'm a chill, but I'm too cold
Long as I'm around, fuck they need you for?
Ridin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks
Since nobody wanna make G shit
This is for the gangsters, for the pimps and hoes
This is for the dopeboy trappers sellin' halves and hoes
(Since nobody wanna make G shit)
They want G shit, give it to 'em
They want G shit, give it to 'em
I'm the one to give it to 'em
If you don't know me let me tell you somethin', shawty
Still got them choppers, make you run from it
Camouflage, dog tag
Got 'em followin', when you see me better haul ass
Keep it G at all costs, what you call that?
Crack rock, hip hop, I done all that
Certified trap nigga, sucker, fall back
A broke nigga he may entertain all that
All left field, keep it true, nigga
Save the flash in the dance for a new nigga
Keep speakin' for the ones who ain't got a voice
Kill 'em dead only when they leave no other choice
How I see it, if you ain't down to die 'bout it
Don't write my time, slime, why the fuck we talking about it?
Still ridin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks
Since nobody wanna make G shit
This is for the gangsters, for the pimps and hoes
This is for the dopeboy trappers sellin' halves and hoes
(Since nobody wanna make G shit)
They want G shit, give it to 'em
They want G shit, give it to 'em
I'm the one to give it to 'em
Now what the fuck is an ounce? We smokin' bout an LB
We don't even do the nine, sell it by the whole ki
And I'm a take this shit to trial, they got nothin' on me
They be on the Champagne, bitch, I'm 'bout to OD
Got a bag full of birds and motherfuckers gettin' robbed
Bars on the trap doors got it looking like a vault
Used to hit the highway over twenty of them things
Young nigga hit the club with the twenty unchanged
When Jay was beefin' with Nas I was sellin' cocaine
When Game was beefin' with 50 I was doin' the same thing
I was at the hospital, nigga, Meechy got shot
Fuck you niggas talking 'bout? I love that nigga like Pac
This is for the gangsters, for the pimps and hoes
This is for the dopeboy trappers sellin' halves and hoes
(Since nobody wanna make G shit)
They want G shit, give it to 'em

Ay, ay, ay listen to me
And when they push you down,
You got to get back up

Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
'Cause when you got the belt and the ring
People with ya poppin' bottles, taking pictures look around
As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement
Surprise, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this
Ay, what it is World
Yeah it's me again, back before you, at your mercy
Don't bend your knee again, no running from the truth
As much as we pretend, that it ain't what it is, than it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends, (I'm sorry)
For letting you down, I won't take you down this road again
Most of you now saying whatever, here we go again
Blogs, radio, and television all going in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment
I gotta say you f-cking haters is hilarious
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou
Point your finger now with me looking down
Same clown that was twitpic'ing at my wedding
On the same twitter page disrespecting
Wait a second (hold up)
Never mind my imperfections this is fact, remember that
No mistakes too great to recover and bounce back

(T.I)
I admit, yeah, I done some dumb sh-t,
Disappointed everybody I know
Try not to hold that against me though
My road to redemption has no GPS
So guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested
Yes it's hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
The bible say ""let he without sin cast the stone first"" (stone first)
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?
Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs or to be fair
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead
Difference is, my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to TMZ, the AJC and Wikipedia
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God, ain't that what really matters, nope
A matter of fact I'm wrong but after that the good I've done in your hood
Should it overshadow that?
Got the World laughing at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with
Even if you so legit that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence
The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this
Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what

Ay, let me see you get loose
Get loose, get loose, get loose
Ay, shawty, you can get loose
Get loose, get loose
Ay shawty, bust it open for me
Let me see you get loose
If you really wanna show me that you love me, get loose
No Grey Goose, if you don't get loose
Get up out the coupe if you won't get loose
Bend it over, reach for yo toe, get loose
Hold on to the pole, drop it low and get loose
No x-o if you don't wanna get loose
No more dro unless you gonna get loose
[Verse 1] (T.I.)
My potnas in the club and we chillin' to the max
Poppin' bottles, blowin' money, we ain't learn how to act
All in the V.I.P. spendin' four or five stacks
You can tell it's T.I.P. from how I bend my hat
Send the waitress to the bar but she comin' right back
Bet a shot of x-o'll get you on the right track
You got yo girl with you, better hold her hand, I'm a mack on attack
Turn yo head and she bound to get snatched
Give the dick to her once, get her hooked like crack
Takin' cum in the face, yeah I like it like that
Holdin' on to her waist while I hit it from the back
If she come wit *Pussy Popper* she ain't never comin' back
Rough sex, talkin' dirty, yeah she into all that
Gotta movie that'll prove that what I'm sayin' is all fact
Bra and panties all black and some real tall stacks
Suckin' titties, eatin' cat, shawty off the meat rack
[Chorus] - repeat
[Verse 2] (Nelly)
Let me see you drop it down, get that eagle on girl
Ain't no fuckin' way I'm leavin' here alone girl

Baby, I can make a mill if I rap or if I sing
Done tryina ball ma, I own a damn team
Even wit' a nuse nigga, still can't hang
Let me tell you who I'm is
Lunatic mayne, straight up out the heart land
Nine on my right, ten more karats on my other hand
In different colors mayne, worth a couple hundred grand
Damn mama, how you do that there?
How yo waist stay still but you move that there
Ain't got a clue right there
Seen a lotta ass poppin', but that's new right there
You invited to the house ma, you and yo crew right there
Check it, okay let's have some fun
I got four G's and 5 five G's in one
[Chorus] - repeat
You ready to get loose, shawty, better be
Sittin' on them leather seats
If not, pat yo feet on the concrete merely
Freak by choice, not force, I would never be
Charged with a rape, if she say no, I'ma let her be
Why should I let that worry me?
Too many bitches cherish me
Pimp till I die, be a playa till they bary me
Renegade, I'ma keep it pimpin', I ain't finna play
Anyway, I can hit the baddest bitches anyday
I done slept with the best, I ain't gotta flex
Got yo girl stretched out, pullin' up her dress
Checkin' out her spread and I am impressed
G-strings right in the middle of them wet
Her girlfriends with her and all of them next
I passed them a bottle, gave all of them X
Head *Pussy Popper*, so all them expect
The best sex, and that's what all of them get

(Get Ya shit Together... come on)
All the 8's, 9's, and dimes... I like to welcome y'all to the best time of ya life... ya understand that
All the stones are real and its chrome on all the wheels... ya know
Anything less is uncivilized
(T.I)
Aye, I pull up to the club, lift both doors up
Hopped out clean and ya hoes choose us
Walked in the door make the show hold up
Cause my neck and my bracelet was so froze up
The kind of stones bitches wanna see close up
So we don't approach them, they comin' and approach us (yeah)
Roll the dro up then go post up
Look down cause that's where it's gonna go, sho nuff
In the V.I.P. and all eyes on us
Hoes chill, poppin' pills, blowing dro no duff
Whatcha say you got a man, so what
I don'y know him, and baby he don't know her
I got a new phatom and my own chaffeur
Ya think ya finna be thinking 'bout him, no sir (haha)
Probably prefer to tell ya man goodnight
And she don't wanna know what the good life look like

Chains swing to my jeans, and my T-shirt clean
In caee you been reasearching, I'm the King
With a style as mean as the earth seems
Chest on ice, and my wrist on gleam
30 karats in the ring, money ain't no thing
You think I'm playin', but I ain't joking
The dro king, if it ain't purple, I ain't smoking
Rubberband bank rolls, 50 thousand dollar cheddar knots
Try to shine, is you out your mind, boy you better not
I walk around with more money than you ever got
Shrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock
Shawty I can get you in whatever spot
Backstage, front row, what I got to front for
I'm getting bored, don't even know what I stunt for
Got a lotta rides, what it hurts to cope one more
(T.I)
To all my hot girls, if you wanna come chill
Lets roll on chrome wheels, let me tell you what it is
We finna throw a little party at the crib
Where the floors tricked out and the rooms like iiillllll
The basements cool, but the pools unreal
Where that millionaire lives, shit remains concealled
So pop a pill, put on your blindfold
I'm hitting the dance floor, and grab eighty-nine more
Let'em know we on the way, where they been trying to go
I knew I had'em when they asked me ""What kind of diamonds are those""
Headed to the spot, pouring double shots of XO
Play the ""Love Below"", ane watch'em undress slow
Flicks on the flat screen, make'em want to ""get low""
And spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole
When they kick it with the king, they don't wanna let go
So whatcha gonna tell a nigga, when he tells ya ""Let's Go"""
46,Go Get It,2012,Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head (2012),Hip Hop,T.I.,"I gotta grind, won't stop

Shine like no other, I be on some other shit

If I want it, then I got it
If I don't then all I gotta do is
Go, get it, stay about my bidness
Ball till I fall, floss until I finish
I can go, get it, stay about my bidness
I'm living just to kill it, stacking million to the ceiling
Everyday I ball brown, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louie down to the drawers, Luis Vuitton kicks
Got a man, how to swagger, bitch I'm stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they stupid dumb thick
I'm the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multimillion dollar shit
Money is the object, hot shit
Bitch I got a sawnoff on my arm
See bigger with no diamond
They just talk about they got it,
I'm the upper echelon, though
Bitch I'm bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream bout
Get your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen by, bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough, that's all I see
I g.o. g.e.t. i.t.
I live life, up late night
Get shit fake when I take flight

Don't sniff yay, but I blow dro
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that 44
Don't let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
I'm Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, other bitches
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper triail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
Purple label polo and a crew that's what I do
Man I strive and roll my denim in my new Margiella shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle
On Margharita Molly and the strong?
We menagin' for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it

Man I'm livin' the Goodlife
I'm livin' the Goodlife
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I was born into poverty raised in the sewerage
Streets always would be a part of me, it made me the truest
And even when my days were the bluest
I never ran from adversity, instead I ran to it
Fear ain't in the heart of me I learned just do it
You get courage in your fears right after you go through it
Now I come through in a Coupe on 22's
That ain't bad for a nigga who ain't even finish school
Don't get me wrong I never been a fool
I just put off graduatin' for a pair of tennis shoes
I used to use the beat to paint my pain
But nowadays man I can't complain
I got several automobiles and they all on thangs
Several size of tangent and they all in one ciain
Used to see me in the mall I'm the same
And gettin' brain from a couple broads on the plane
I come from Chi-Town lost and found in the struggle
Where dudes say stay safe and stay out of trouble
Speak is muffed the law and B gon try to cuff you
Those with duffles move weight and have muscles
I came through the dirt with a verse for the people
Open up for Daddy Kane and Eazy up at the Regal
The radio rarely put their needle on my record
They ain't see how the hood and heaven were connected
Sounds projected, ain't show how effective
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected
And everything I found real in life know I kept it
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested
When a nigga changed they keep saying that nigga strange
Couldn't see how my mind won't be the lame
Ahead of my time I caught up with the game
Making good music making paper making change
I put on gasoline drawers I stood in the fire
With enough heat to set the hood on fire
Man you niggaz think Suge was off the wire
You should've seen the squad before I had Messiah
We assumed the title as the number one supplier
Felt like I was selling blow since I was in diapers
And wish a nigga would come try us
We was cool with the killers, best friends with the lifers
Quick to up and scrap with niggaz who want to deny
For what we considered then as a lucrative empire
But like that pimping time flash by you
Now I wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
Prison ain't full and the reefer ain't bias
You ain't got to tell and distant the liars
Gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse
Lived through worse and reversed the curse"

Present the gifts without the curse
Her pleasure is my purpose
Pleasure to be at your service
Front row at fashion shows as well as Sunday morning service
But better days or for worse
If I'm paid I'm hurting in my pocket
She still got a nigga back that's for sure
No matter what may occur in life
Everyday with her is like a plus
I'mma love her till she be like that's enough
Pop a bottle get a couple wine glasses fill 'em up and lift 'em up
Let us toast to the future here's to us

And on visit day show up looking good smelling better, playing kissy face
Just wanna let you know we appreciate
Everything you do for us on a day to day
And I know we don't show you all the time but we lucky that you ours
No bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you

Even though them chicks be hating on us
Still I'm gonna keep her by my side
In whatever situation we gon ride
Make all my fantasie's come alive
That's no lie now
I'll be all right as long as your gon be beside me
10 million dollar mansions won't suffice
If you ain't gon be in there with me at night
The pieces to my puzzle's in my life
With all of my good days and all of my bad

You know the day I drop, man

Now hold up, st-stop damn it
Shawty, you're not jammin'

I can't stand it
I'm taking over spots to damage that B.I.G and Pac image you got
Stop dick ridin', your shit's tired
I doubt if even your bitch buy it for six 'ollars
I can't see how niggas who not spittin' ask why they not winnin'
Or why their record not spinnin, why niggas not feelin' it
Cause that shit is not real, and we know you're not out killin' shit
Crown grand royalty
Shawty, I must be
Whoever wanna shut me, uh-up
Just outbust me
Until then I'm king hood, don't act like you ain't know it
You wanna be supreme, hood, go get 16 for it

Since the days of 97 sats in the back of the trap, nigga
I ain't a rap nigga, I just happen to rap
What is different?
I ain't gotta act and still I'm hotta than that nigga
I think all of ya wack niggas should give your plaques
To the real killas and crack dealers writing your script
Get a grip, you need your ass whipped, for tryin' to be famous
Everybody know my flow is chainless and that's how I remain
Is T I P K I N G O F D A S O, a U T H
Labeled as one of the greatest when it comes to the flow
Give a damn what you think
'Cause if the legends of the south ain't complainin
Like Outkast and Goodie Mob
What the fuck do I care what you sayin'?
I'm T.I.P.
What, what, what
Yal still ain't heard
Pussy nigga, yal still ain't heard
T.I.P., King of the South, shut your muthafuckin mouth
Or come see 'bout me, homie
Well, whether you can't live with it
Or you just can't love it
One thing that you can't say
Is shawty we ain't bustin'
I was the King of the South before my single was out
I gave you everything from the ho to the dope game
Now hold up, wa-uh-wait shawty, wanna buy at 8 shorties
So go and get the weight shawty, out of the safe for me
They all can go for 140, meet me at 1:40
Now hey, don't play no games with me
I ain't no lame sissy
All I'm a bring wit me, is the niggas who hang with me
They smoke and drank and slang with me
So they'll bang with me
Know if they came with me, that they dyin' to die for me
Or bust a 45 at the blink of a eye for me
Now don't be fuckin' round, f-fore you be duckin down
You ain't goin' hear that bustin' sound
Till right 'fore you touch the ground
Now know that AK'll turn you browner than Bobby
And I were raised in the yay, rappin' just was my hobby
I'm king hood.

50,Guns and Roses,2012,Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head (2012),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Aye have you ever loved somebody so much you can't stand it but can't do without him?
Do anything for him cause you truly do adore him
Like dedicate songs, write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore him
But you feel like they feel like you ain't right for him
Therefore your heart's torn
Between being with him forever, leaving him never
But it seem like you argue and fighting over whatever
Maybe we can leave, find someone better
Even though you will, you never know none better
My heart says nah, she can't leave me never
Been head over heels since the very day I met er
Feel so deep in love I ain't been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind 'cause she don't shut up
Love her to death, don't know whether to kiss er or kill er
Should've known it
From the start it was already over
Now we're just too dumb to notice
Every paper
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don't know which one to choose
But either way, we're gonna lose
Stupid paper
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
Hah, I guess I'd rather suffer with her than be miserable without er
I ball out of Prada, Gucci, and Belinciaga
They keep her content, you keep down the nonsense
With every corner we turn, around the conflict
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with?
Where the fuck have you been? Your pants - they don't fit
Really, honestly speaking, some things I don't get
No matter how much she try she can't make it make more sense
Therefore, here we go again
Screaming, yelling at the top of our lungs, she going in
Seeing the kind of shit I be like if you was a man
I would go in your shit, real, no shit
But I love her so much that I can't forget
That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I'm sick
Still, I don't like to feel like this
If I wouldn't miss er, I would try to get a kill right there
Should've known it
From the start it was already over
Now we're just too dumb to notice
Every paper
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don't know which one to choose
But either way, we're gonna lose
Stupid paper
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
Every time we say our goodbyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside
I don't really ever know why
If I could live without you I'd try
Should've known it
From the start it was already over
Now we're just too dumb to notice
Every paper
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don't know which one to choose
But either way, we're gonna lose
Stupid paper
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses"
51,Hallelujah,2012,Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head (2012),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Sometimes I wake up feel like I'm in Forest City, Arkansas
Although I'm free I'm still a prisoner of all our soul
Sometimes I lead it, roof in 4, you never ride down since
Just prayin' homie, and reminiscin
Sometimes my nightmare seems so real, feel like I'm still in prison
I reach out far to meet her hand, I'm trippin' 'cause she listen
It's pitch black dawg, like I'm in solitary
So if my freedom was a dream, Lord please prepare me
It seems like Satan want my soul and he refuse to share me
My former 3 ain't talk about me like I'm getting buried
Bastards want me in the casket for my head cold
Trouble in my soul, these devils got a hold
Did everything, you need to kill me, like you did to Joe
He took my diamonds, took my rhymes, took my fame and gold
He took my babysitters, he took my wife and kids
But he can't take nothing God can't give me back again
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I went to jail, stood tall, then I fell again
It seems like I'm Jonah and right back in that will again
I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again
I had to pray and meditate, control my breath again
Like Lazarus I've risen from a better death again
The Lord is with me, I could stand against a thousand men
I read the songs of David, prayed to be like Solomon
God's wisdom walkin' all amongst these hollow men
I'm a king, I dare to lead when they just follow me
I see a better way, I'm keeping my eyes on the sparrow
I'm exiting my Egypt, tell 'em wave goodbye to pharaoh
Mother told me fore she left this earth that I was special
Ever 'cause I'm special, they gon make me suffer
Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother
Suckas, but he arose on the 3rd day
Just save your head and get a favor, let the church say...
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Yes, He loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Oh"
52,Hands Up,2001,I'm Serious (2001),Hip Hop,T.I.,"(Man speaking)
We going to Cuba wit' this one
Yeah, I been rehabilitated, rejuvicated
And most important:relocated
So now, with no further to do
Now ladies stand up
Or if you wit' me shake ya titties
Throw your hands up
And all the ballers poppin' bottles throw a grand up
And if you feeling like I'm feeling keep them hands up
And keep ya hands up
Hey, from the sunrise to the midnight star
I'm by far the hottest new thing the South seen
Bringing sixteen bars, got six clean cars
Vert's, Hoops, four doors, do momo's, and Tahoes
Star hoes, yo hoes is our hoes
Keri pullin up to the Shark Bar on the Northstar
Wit' a Puerto Rican porn star
We in La Vida La Loca
See you can't flow like me or rock a show like me
Get dough like me
Shouldn't signed 'em, he ain't gon' blow like me
But give me a quarter of his bonus and half his budget
And I guarantee he go double but if you don't, you in trouble
It's gon' take him three coupes just for him to recoup'
Or witness shawty flop, like the last three groups
While I'm in Cancun' 'round see-throughs on a three week cruise
It'll take more than the likes of these fools to make me lose
Sheesh, floppin is something I can't see
Ladies, obey the chorus
Shake ya titties for me please
Uh, I came to blow the spot
Hit the club wit' cheddar knots
Ridin' wit' a badder bitch
You gonna get or ever got
Try me boy, you better not
Shawty and I'm very hot
Toting forty cap, forty five nine's every glock
Blow you up in that very spot you standing in
Then vanishing
Undo this manana then, throw away this can and then
Back to poppin' mo and blow and dro and money handlin'
You and your lil' posse can not stop me and this clan I'm in
While you slanderin', you better ask ya gul who the man again
Turning out a superstar back into a fan again
Damagin' all who peek, line 'em all in the street
I'll do 'em one at a time wit' one line on one beat
Say ya almost gold, that's what I sold in one week
Got a flock of freaks, while you hold on to one biich
I'm like a Pez dispenser, shawty, I spit treats
The nigga who even sound good on a bullshit beat
Well pussy nigga, you can like it, you can love it
You can bite it, you can dub it
But you can't do it how we does it
When we ballin' in public
Where the grill full of gold or Seville full of hoes
Wood wheels and some Voe's or hun'ed gold spokes
I park at the club and a hun'ed hoes choke
Spark up some dubs, let them hun'ed hoes blow
I run game to get the hoe once they act like I can't run it no mo'
I stunt them hoes broke and her money po' po'
You can't smoke the way we smoke if you ain't smokin' no dro'
Drink the way we drink wit no Hen' and no Mo'
You can't ride the way we ride if you ain't slammin' Benz do's
Can't ball wit' me if you got eight but can only spend fo'
You ain't VIP like me and can't be searching your coat
Ain't no P.I. like me if you ain't workin' no hoes
Can't do the shit we do, the way we do wit' no dough
That's like trying to win a ballgame, if you ain't takin' no score"

Spillin liquor, yeah nigga
Blowin' tall off the wall
Burning rubber leavin' foul
Muthafucka how you ride
Choppin blades wit triple golds
Stay away from camilton rolls

'Cause it seem like you wanted other things than da king
Why you fightin', fussin', cussin', and disagreein' wit da king?
When you got cribs, cars, bling, and a king wit da king?
Is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams
Are you gettin' all the things that you needed and I ain't bring
Does it satisfy your self-esteem bein seen on da screen
Is this new nigga the real thing or is just a lil' fling?
Did he buy a nice bracelet and get ya a lil' ring?
Or give you all the attention and the lil' things?
He know what to do with the stuff you stuff in them lil' jeans?
Do he stand up and lean in it till you start screamin'?
Or smack your ass and kiss your G-String to start eatin? (muah)

Ay shawty

(Da one up in NYC?)
Nah, nah, not the one from New York, I 'memba her too doe

Lil bad bitch I met in da mall wit da big azz
(Oh, oh, dat bitch)
Here wha she said
(Whussup?)
I'll meet you at the hotel, we can fuck all night
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(Shit, let'z do it... where you at?)
I said, meet me at the hotel, we can fuck all night
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(Shit baby, keep yo mouth shut we can do it, sho nuff)
(Verse 1 (T.I.))
One day in L.A., I'm at the mall
Pickin' me up a coupla pairs of silk drawls
And I ran into this fine azz well built broad
She was in hard from a long way
So I'm finna go on swing shawty way
Just like da song say, 'cause I don't play
Miss lady built like a amazon
A 5'9"", light brown, wit some sandals on
Da kinda azz dat make you wanna grab a handle on
And fuck her all day in da hallway with the candlez on
So I wave, and I speak and conversation coo
She asked my name, where I'm from and why I talk the way I do?
I said ""'Cause I ain't from round hea, I'm from Atlanta shawty, but anywayz
We can still get togetha, 'cause I'm gon be hea fo a coupla dayz""
And then she say, she never been ta Georgia, she was dyin' ta visit
Well, I'm in room 312, at the Sofatel, I'm sho that they listed
She got the digits, say she like me, and that we can be friends
If I ain't welcome shawty, don't invite me, ain't no need ta pretend
I'm wanna lick on ya neck, kiss ya earz, and make yo knee bend
Put ya azz in positionz you never thought you'd be in
Now, I'm tellin' you shawty, fuckin' wit me, like divin of deep end
Have you sneekin, creepin' in Georgia, freak on the weekend
(Verse 2 (T.I.))
This time, it was me 'n' KP, in NYC
On some Quevo and Hennessy, and 2 sweets with two freaks
Some of da baddest thangz in Times Square wit some long hairz, cute feet
One of'em say she wanna drive me to Coney Island so she can show me the new beach
Couldn't nobody ride wit me doe, 'cause da car only had 2 seatz
Lil' cute freak, in da Z3, remind me of one of my hoez in da GC
Told me her name was Sharell but all of her friendz call her Cici
Say she up hea goin' ta NYU, but originally she frum DC
Say she'd love ta freak me, reminisce while listenin to mah CD
Lay me out on the beach feed me strawberriez 'n' kiwi
Shawty say she like wha she see, can't wait ta get down hea 'n' see me
Round Freaknik, say soon az you hit da city all you gotta do iz beep me
And let me know whut itz finna be, the Four Seasons or the Embassy
Get a voice mail round 10 ta 3, and then wha she said ta me...
Tell'em how you did the broad shawty
(I fucked the bitch... and forgot the bitch)
(Verse 3 (Too $hort))
I'm havin' fun... gettin' pussy on the run
Bitches comin' to mah room, tryna make me cum
In *Cleveland* last weekend, O-High Hoe, whuz really goin' on?
She said ""Stick it down my throat""
A lotta y'all married... to mah ex trampz
She shouldn't worry, I sent the bitch to sex camp
Taught her how to fuck, she made you fall in love

'Cause I'ma... beat her pussy down in the worst way
You waited six months, and I fucked her on the first date, at the Hotel
(T.I. & Too $hort talkin' through Chorus)
Meet me at the hotel, we can fuck all night
(Hoe, don't tell nobody... BIATCH!)
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(That'z right... we runnin' up in deze hoez...

Ay say KT
I remember bro standing out ten of uh
Flip a bird split it up
Antenna stickin' up
For crooked cop patrollin'
If the rad-doh rollin'
All the dough I'm throwin'
Fuck a jail I ain't going tonight
Quick to pull a 4-4 in the fight
Under the street lights
Rollin' the dice
We was so enticed
By niggas like slick money and ice
We figure prison end should come with the light
Along with losin' your life
And there were no way we thought
We'd go to jail for any case we caught
For all the yay we bought
Not a dime did we say we borrowed
Bought damn near every pair of jeans at the mall
Had our way with the broads
Hit the rink but we ain't skatin' at all
Seem like every other day we brawl
That AK on call
When I think about all we done
It's amazing to see how far we come
Remember
(Mitchelle'L - Chorus)
I remember walkin'
Didn't have a dollar in my pocket
Now I'm watching stocks like what's the options
Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh
How life's changed
I remember hustlin'
Tryin' to get these crooked cops off us
Now I read about it in my office
Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh
How life's changed
(T.I. - Verse 2)
Ay say C-Roy
Remember days we was slangin' the hard
In a crib with no lights
We used to stay in the dark
Remember Captain Mac bonin' man
They were retarded
I don't know who kept us laughing the hardest
Since our sacks was the largest
Didn't take us long to corner the market
I remember everyday was a party
15 16 with dreams of being cocaine bosses
In pursuit of that
We made so many terrible choices
Like the time we made away with that Millennium
From the dealership
Before our day won we killin' em
Late nights
Gun fights
High speed chases
So close to the good life we taste it
Damn the consequences pimp
If it's a chance we take it
First case a month in juvenile and get probation
When I think about all we done
It's amazing to see how far we come
Remember
(Mitchelle'L - Chorus)
I remember walkin'
Didn't have a dollar in my pocket
Now I'm watching stocks like what's the options

I remember hustlin'
Tryin' to get these crooked cops off us
Now I read about it in my office
Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh
How life's changed
(Scarface - Verse 3)
We started small time dope game
Hustlin' that cocaine
In the state traffickin'
High feeling no pain
Numb to the fact
That we was poisoning our own kind
I ain't give a fuck
He gettin' his so I want mine
Young and with that attitude
Somebody finally gimme that
I ain't give a fuck how I got it
It was real as that
So if I had to peel a cat
Somebody was dead then
Since I'm a killer
That's the condition my head's in
Can't work too hard to get my money
I refuse to
Slave for the next man a raise nigga fuck you
These streets are 9 to 5
You want it we can get it for ya
And even though they steady changin'
This is still a hustle
Still got them same rules
Man I be the same game
We'd even found some brand new money
Still we maintain
This ain't integrity
We upheld in the street life
Livin' the mother fuckin' dream
Niggas singin' like...
(Mitchelle'L - Chorus)
I remember walkin'
Didn't have a dollar in my pocket
Now I'm watching stocks like what's the options

Alotta pussy niggas talk like broads love runnin' they mouth
But then turn and run in they house

Next thing you think you know the go POW

Naw, I'm prepared to war what it is nigga win lose or draw
I'll never get caught murkin' y'all 'cause it ain't what you do
The question is who saw?
Shawty I'm way too raw
Catch me any day you want you could think I'm a play if you want
But the fact still remain if I got a AK and you don't
Well then playa you gone
Don't get me wrong there's some niggas wanna kill me too (Well where they at?)
But they ain't sayin' bout shit because they very well know where I'm at
They could catch me in the booth right if it really like that
Naw nigga that they hoe get him in the whole shit, the 44 spit they holla oh shit
Protectin' her and you both hit
You betta check ya girl or you be so sick

And I don't miss 'cause I'm focused nigga

I got you tip

Fuck niggas might talk loud act real, but they don't really want this here
Pussy niggas betta act right, lay low we know where ya family live
Trust me you don't want me up in ya crib with a ski mask on duct tapin ya kids
You can pray all you want but I don't forgive
Ya shoulda been doin' that before ya did whatcha did
I ain't gotta spell it out pimp you know what it is
I'll rest you case to ya real man you know what it is
Plus I got a hundred goons with me, dressed in black
Fifty at the front door, 50 at the back
Half got K's, half got Macs
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out, show me where he at
We can do him right here, we could catch him in trap
Run up on his 'lac put a hole in his hat
With his brain on the dash, and his thoughts in his lap
And dump 50 more on him and tell him to hold that
Lights out, no hasta manana, hasta la vista, sayonara
Y tu no tomorrow, no remorse and no sorrow
And the next one a y'all niggas try me like that
I swear to God man I'm really gon' snap
(Busta Rhymes)
Right now I'ma give you somethin' that a make a nigga beg please
When a bullet whiz by I could feel a little breeze
Drop to ya knees, see the big barrel of the chrome
Fifth triple grip handle in the squeeze
I keep a couple of those for the niggaz who talk shit
When I go to Jacob and cop that ring
If you try to see me I'ma cock that thang
And I'ma pop that thang, and the shots gon' stain (really?)
The nigga ride inside the truck with me (and) for the most part the nigga
Stuck with me And tell you somethin' if you really were smart and you knew
Better people probably tell ya don't fuck with me
Front if want motherfucka you can catch it
Smile on my face even though I got a ratchet
Pop off (police) pull me over believe I got a compartment if I gotta stash it
Must I just remind y'all niggaz when I come through
Know that I'ma find y'all niggaz take two
Bust so many shots gun powder probably blind y'all niggaz now (Ok, ok let's go)
See you don't know really wanna feel that Mossberg blow (naw)
Clap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga
When I finish it'll turn into an absurd show (listen)
Then you better observe yo
Feel the sizzle from the bullet of the glock burn slow (ssss)
Shit probably twist you up just a little
And have your body leanin' lookin' like a quarter past four
Stay down betta (lay down)
Checkin' for a nigga, come and put your body in the dirt
I don't play bitch you, really need to go the other way
If you ain't know I got it under my shirt"

And most broads find it hard to understand me
But the same attitude that make crews goddamn me
Is the same ones that got me lookin' cool at the Grammy's
Haters wanna damage me but King you'll never be
Shawty holla at me when you get your first felony
Then holla at me when you've been on Dave Letterman
Say they never seen a real nigga so elegant
Lames wanna hear that real shit and I'm tellin' it
Trained the game to be sold and I'm sellin it
Chasin a Honda mil', that bullshit is irrelevant
We can race if you wanna, I bet on me and you'll never win

62,I Can't Be Your Man,2001,I'm Serious (2001),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Yeah,
To the ladies,
One mo' message from T.I.P.,
I represent every man in America,
Naw, the world
You wanna know what he what he
Thinkin' bout when he ain't
Talkin' to you bout why he can't
Be your man you sure you wanna know
Here it is
My girl say I don't love her
She say we just fuckin'
Nothin' against you
It's just that I hate tux
She wanna toast with the Mo' and the ice
Throwin' the rice
Wake up with me for the rest of your life
Ask me where I'm going, when I'comin' back when I bounce
Runnin' her mouth, call herself the queen of the south
Redecorate the crib throwin' satin on the couch
Catch me out adulteratin' takin' half of the house
Well it ain't she don't deserve it
Just I don't wanna give it
The life she wanna live
Shorty I don't wanna live it
Makin' money shorty's missin'
To all kind of digits
From KeKe's to Chaniques's
To Bianca's and Brigettes's
Poppin' up unannouced, shorty call 'fore you visit
Nothing about a number, mind your goddamn business
Look bitch, some shit bout Tip won't change
We can hang, but I got to let you know one thang
I can't be your man
It ain't you it's me, sorry shorty
I can't be your man
Where I been, I don't see no rings on these fingers
I can't be your man
Look to the future, find someone better than me
I can't be your man
You deserve much more, I'm no good to you shorty
Don't it seem like shit be cool for a month and a half
All of a sudden you frontin' and showin your ass
Complainin' bout what you got
Shorty look what you had
Before me, it was pull-out couches and Bilitant bags
Now she mad 'cause she ain't got a TV in her Jag
I tell you what if that ain't good enough get back on the bus
Give up the princess cuts and the Prada and stuff
I take you out to eat and you order a bottle of what?
Ungrateful wonderin' why I'm not faithful
Ballin's all good but this shit is just wasteful
Want me to pay your bills
Help you get a bigger crib
Shorty I don't mind helpin'
But show some initiative
Ain't brought nothin' to the table but hard times and heartache
Do something, get on the grind for God's sake
A reminder, rewind this message from your highness
For those that chose to take my kindness for blindness
I can't be your man
I don't cheat 'cause I ain't shit,
I'm cheatin' cause you ain't shit
I can't be your man
Every time I walk in the house you sittin' on that goddamn couch
You ain't got nothing better to do
I can't be your man
Cook, clean, iron, pay the water bill, shorty do something
Work with me
I can't be your man
Ay, pack you shit shorty, I'm droppin' yo ass off at yo mami house
Right now
One more scenario
Bout another jazzy hoe
That I met on the road
After a show in Ontario
Shorty say she got a man
That don't really scare me though
But she say he got a temper
So, but what he jealous for
Cause you told him you were cheatin'
Hell, well what you tell him for
Shit, what that got to do with Tip
You better let him know
Now she want to let him go
But what for
So you can get with me and keep being a slut hoe
I don't think so baby better stay where you at
I'm no good for you
Never mind the way that he act
You got a kid and a crib with him
What's better than that
I'm in town for the week you better settle for that
(End Chorus)
I can't be your man
I'm here for 4 days shorty, 4 days
I can't change the world
I can't be your man
He don't treat you right?
What that gotta do with me?
I can't be your man
He be cussin' you out and shit
You cheated on him shorty, can you blame him?

You in the damn living room more than the muthafuckin' furniture shorty

With the sorriest hoe in America
Why don't you take the weight off my back every now and then
Why don't you pay a bill

This is who I am nigger, I can't help it
I can't help it
In the ghetto with the drop Rolls Royce
They say keep one hundred... I ain't got no choice
I can't help it, always big bank
I'm so trill and you ain't - Cut it down (bitch I can't)
I can't help it... (ay)
See how I do it I'm so hood, gutta all gone Hollywood
Bitch I would if I could, I can't help it (ay)
The city won't be shit without you
15 million dollar houses still can't get that trap up out me
I can't help it..."
64,I Can't Quit,2003,Trap Muzik (2003),Hip Hop,T.I.,"(T.I)
Hell no I can't quit
Hell no man we got to much money to get shawti stay down grand hustle
Look...
IM this far from being a star and just that close to quittin
I never should of came close to missing
But I want to be a musician pimpin' not a politician listen feel my position this a rough transition
Plus I'm way to deep in the game to be trying to change
From fortune and fame and glamour I could be in the slammer
Or six feet under Atlanta it's a blessing to breath I walk the streets with seven felonies I'm blessed to be free
Long as somebody up in heaven who keep blessing the G T.I.P is still be blessing CD's so haters you can see these
'Cause I'm back now with something to prove everything to gain pimpin' nothing to lose
I oughta start smackin niggas when there's nothing to do
They to big shoot 'em in the leg and even the odds cause you ain't hard
Less you round with captain C ROD Trap with KT and brawl with JR
Fuck hoes with DP broke bread with JG
Switch labels like KP poofa did all that to me even
Though I'd rather go back to slangin drugs an shit
This a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit
I Can't Quit
Even though Police's hate on legit
And rappers hate it 'cause they know I'm the shit
Hell naw I can't quit
Some niggas hatin' on the money I'm getting
Most of them hatin' 'cause I'm fuckin' they bitch
Naw pimpin' I can't quit
Some niggas hatin' on the rocks and the rings
Some of them hate 'cause they don't think I'm the king
Hell naw I can't quit
People hate it when you better then them
They ain't hate start worrying then
Hey I'm winning I can't quit
(T.I)
Ten years an album and two deals fo' real we all know I should of sold two million at least
It's all good though I flow for the streets I do it for y'all every weekend see who in the mall
Still in the traps signing your shirts given you doubt
Kikin it with ya' then get yo' and your folk into the club
Holes of the pictures where girls gave kisses and hugs
Hold and I look at the show passing niggas the drove
One of the realist rappers niggas will know
But niggas be hatin' to the point where they be calling the station
But they respect it 'cause I'm ready and focused
Then I see they panties an vocals, I want you to know
This the closest you know this
Niggas in the game ain't real got to stay sellin records cause the fame ain't shit
And fuck the units that they name will sell
They'll break your hearts and see your favorite rappers lame as hell
(T.I)
Some of the people some of time times
Some of you rhyme but might not like one of them lines
I tell you, I let you criticize me one of them times
Those of you that think I'm to cocky get in front of the line
Whether you don't like my ego or my arrogant flow
Don't like it when you say I'm tyte
I say I already know
Don't like how I was talkin' shit before my album blowed
Think I need to calm it down become more like the average Joe
So, fuck yo' little thoughts and that little house you think I'm in
Get a Benz I value your opinion then think I give a fuck how many times my record spins
Well what you recommend, I'm back again"

Gettin' everybody attention
When I'm out record with spinnin'
They start it from the beginning
Get bottles of Christian Remy
And pass it out to the women
Pull out a stack of 20
Throw it up to the ceiling
Watch it fall to the floor
Start throwin' some more
Has anybody you know
Whatever part it you go

If I pull up in a Mercedes
I hop in out of the road

Niggas talkin' greasy but they don't wanna see me

Remember me and Jeezy, at least once a week we,
Hit the strip club, show these niggas how to treat freeze
One stack, two stacks, three stacks, four,
Nigga, five Stacks, go tell me bring ten more
And Lamborghinis and Apollos
They see me they screamin' holla
The robbers follow the ballers, so peg it soon my proudest
Still ain't nobody hotter, I put that on my daughter
Long as I be sittin' still, niggas still ain't cower
Atlanta you know I run it, everybody is Spanish
They gotta stay in their houses like everybody were punished
Tell them they to quit frontin' and them suckas sit down

67,I Still Luv You,2003,Trap Muzik (2003),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Don't hate me shawty
But even if you hate me shawty
I still love you
And now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good
I still love you
Forgave me once, forgave me twice, forgave me three times
I stayed lyin', you stayed down in the meantime
Had my son and turned around and had another one
I broke yo heart when I told you 'bout the other one
I stay in trouble ha? Ain't got too much to lose
Knew I could loose it all but never thought of losin' you
Eleven years ago I still regret me choosin' you
Meetin' you, pursuin' you and doin' you in '92
You fixed plates, showed yo face at every courtdate
And all you wanted me to do was call when I was out late
How could I let you go? I thought I knew it all
When you deserved the best and more, you been through it all
You think I sold yo dreams, but what I say I mean
Just take it to consideration, I was 17
I'm still the same man, just had a change of plan
Never ask you back and fuck a wedding band
But I still love you
Repeat Chorus 1 w/ ad libs
Went from resentin' you, hatin' you, now I'm missin' you
On the realest shit I ever dropped, dissin' pops
I never even thought, to ask my mom what happened
Just knew that you was livin' in Manhattan and I was trappin'
We never had a chance, we was in different states
But all forgiven, you was human and we make mistakes
You tried to make it up, but shit, you couldn't pay enough
You sent me tons of toys and clothes thinkin' you gave enough
But it wasn't though, and you wasn't there
That's all I knew, so I grew up thinkin' you ain't care
I know it wasn't fair, but ay, it wasn't fun
But now what's done is done, no matter wha, I'm still yo son
I could care less if none of yo other children come
I'ma be right there prayin' you live to be a million one
Finally I understand, hustlin', livin' fast
Tryin' to get the cash and settle down and be a dad
You probably never knew, 'cause hey, I never said it
But pops, I'm just like you, I'm stubborn and I'm hardheaded
But now you dead in the ground, no meanin' tellin' you now
But all I wanted was for you to be proud
I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
If I ain't told you lately shawty
I still love you
Now I only wish that I could
See that yo intentions were good
I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
Please don't hate me shawty
Ay, I still love you
And now I only wish that I could
See that yo intentions were good
(Watch yo boy, shawty)
How could I criticize my daddy on that last verse
Lookin' at my own dirt, you got some nerve
But be that as it may, I got some shit to say
It's been a secret, I can't keep it for another day
I got a lil' girl, not just two lil' boys
And that's been killin' me inside, eatin' me alive
And I can't find the words, nor the nouns or verbs
To express whachu deserve, girl you worth the world
But I'm a man and I ain't perfect, if you hear me now
I'll tell you wha had happened, when, why, where and how
Me and yo mama met, we kinda kicked it off
But we wasn't 'posed to have a baby, we just chillin' out
We had a lot in common, almost the same signs
Same goals, said thangs at the same time
But then we destroyed the situation like the a changed mind
How could I look her in her eyes and holla ""Dat ain't mine""
Her stomach gettin' bigger, and time is gettin' close
Six, seven, eight, nine months and I ain't told mah folks
Not just messiah mama, hell, I had told yo granny
Three kids in two years, baby, daddy panicked
But I ain't ashamed of you, I'm more ashamed of me
It's not at all yo fault, you'd be better off blamin' me
But now I realize, where the problem lies
Forgive me babygirl, I apologize
And I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
Please don't hate me shawty
'Cause I still love you
Now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good"
68,I'm Back,2010,No Mercy (2010),Hip Hop,T.I.,"I never let you down I'mma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?
Hard, I'mma ball on them squares, I flow
Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem me might be
But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me
Like a G, I hold it down for the town I'm at
In a flash like that, recognize I'm back
Strike a match, catch a fire, any moment I decide
That's enough of all your lies, boy, your buzz just died
Step inside, super fly, to the shoes in they coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do
My desire to retire grow with every new crew
'Cause these guys just don't ride like my nigga, you too
Tight jeans, funny haircuts, dancing on the screen
It's about the real niggas in the game so it seems
Just pretend to holla pimpin', givin' shit a black eye
Next he say he trapping in my head I'm like why?
Be yourself, you ain't gotta pimp bone in your body
I can tell ya ain't never bought a key or caught a body
Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane, me and Boosie
All go to prison and they flip their whole image nigga trippin'
Listen, do for you, that ain't in the cars
Think the power is in your gun but overall it's in your heart
Nowadays I don't know what's up with niggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
Violating, I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it and I promised I would put you on point
I'm disappointed in you, dog, you ain't hold it down at all
But I ain't going near ya jaw, just gonna show ya how to ball
Standin' tall through the storm on the yard or in the dorm
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for 'em
I never let you down I'mma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?
Hard, I'mma ball on them squares, I flow
Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem me might be
But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me
Like a G, I hold it down for the town I'm at
In a flash like that, recognize I'm back
Strike a match, catch a fire, CTI, add gas
What's a Molotov cocktail? They never break a glass
Scary-ass nigga, wanna come for me? You better bring it
I ain't mad, I forgive 'em, God I know they ain't mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hate I'm popping and they ain't
Rack they brain, try to think how to stop it and they can't
Ain't that lame? But then they hatred manifest to pure malice
I'm no longer being careless, I'mma let you niggas have it
Won't be satisfied 'til somebody dies and I'm patient, waiting
Know me and the reaper on a first name basis now
I'mma let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to
Hating in your blood, 'cause guess it's just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice
Keep it up and I'mma send your ass to chill with Aunt Joy
Hey, you can the bottom partner I'm up in the sky box
I got shit locked-down, nigga, why stop now?
I'm so above you hover over suckers, why drop down?
I'm so profound it goes down and
I never let you down I'mma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?

69,I'm Illy,2008,Paper Trail (2008),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Rebel for the hell of it, hella rich
Never have to sell a brick again, must I tell a bitch again
The bullshit I'm addressing check I'm on some next level shit
Never been fucked in the game, I'm celibate
Rarely out my element, barely out the ghetto with
One foot out and one foot in as intelligent as fellas get
Listen let's settle then, be clear I could fall back seven years
And still ain't no one ahead of me
Consider it a blessing if you get to stand next to me
Five star general, O.G. veteran
Caked like Entenmann, blowing that celery
Stack that cash like the U.S. treasury
Every single thing I ever did was done heavily
Rap until your seventy, still ain't no catching me
Put it on my pops, big phil aunt beverly
Be standing on the top still after they bury me
Nose in the air so stuck up arrogant
Ain't got long hot songs best cherish it
'Cause when I drop mine that's ova, finito
You paying for your foul like a free-throw (thou)
Now how could a nigga think that he could see me
Other than the magazine covers or the TV
You know I sold more mixtapes than your CD
You're waiting on your big break praying you can beat me
You ain't made it far as DC on the low
I been all around the globe like a god how they treat me
Broads hit they knees eyes closed when they greet me
Mouth wide open just begging me to skeet skeet
You in a deep sleep stop dreaming
I'm six albums in for 10 years I been fire hot steamin
The limelights mine I'm gleaming beaming
That's why I say I'm KING bitch I got my reasons
Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't 'bout that really, is he?
Nigga I'm illy
Hey I run this city clearly
Tell 'em get lost I'm busy really
Nigga I'm illy
Where niggas get off piss off
Me and mine oughta take time to pop a lid off
Shit all over the way bouncing me is y'all
Sick in yo fucking mind you figuring I would fizz off
Never cooled off Tip scorching
Minimal injury though they wishin me maximum misfortune
Number one hands down flow paints portraits
Everybody think you stink like horse shit
House full of chicks on some girl next door shit
A King Of Oneself 30 mill out the store quick
Of course this case lost all my endorsements
Tripled up on real estate still buying more shit
But Tip bankrupt according to your sources
I'm still caked up along with more reinforcements
Tore shit up from the ladder to the rooftops
Officially the hottest nigga rapping since Tupac
Before you rap 'bout me best ask 'bout me
I'm out my fucking mind need counseling
Please don't doubt me trust me drama ain't nothing
It's all fun and games till somebody start bustin'
Limit my discussion when rappers be battling
I find out about it better get to skedaddling
Pack your family's bags move 'em out to Seattle and
We ever cross paths you'll need ambulance and bandages
Live life glamorous so extravagant
Mandarin oriental worldwide traveling
Hip hop champion for real though
You couldn't fuck with me with a Brazil hoe nigga
But still though
Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that really is he

Ay take a good look at me - Now picture me unhappy
No cash and outta fashion, not flashin
Picture me doin' bad even if I wasn't rappin'
Picture me even breathe on the mic not snappin
I'm fire hot not lukewarm, my arms frozen
Picture me in a room full of hoes unchosen
Picture me with no P.O. and no 'dro
Picture pimps walk with some broads and ain't gettin' no 'tho
L.A. gone and I ain't gotta deal no mo' (Picture that)
A ghetto vision ain't real no mo' (Picture that)
Ah T.I.P. ain't work for MIA no mo'
He still so-so (picture that) he still po'
Nigga picture that, ah matta fact picture T.I.P.
Gettin' anything other than rich
Now can you picture this, young, pompus, African son of a bitch
Labelled as anything less than ""the shit"", I can't see it

Dis bad man you get shot, anyways
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day

And Polo gear that won't drop till next year
Be like this here, Cartier frames and Pierre Jouet wristwear
T.I.P. your majesty's right c'here
Notice when I came the dames disappeared, ya lames listen here
To play me, ba-by, hey he,
Gone need a track from God featuring Jesus or Jay-Z
Go on floss; ball where it cost
Smile for the cameras, take your shirts off
Y'all niggas actin', take ya skirts off
Hoppin bomb-ass nigga and he ain't wanna work boss
I'm gettin' sick and tired off these phony rendetions
Wonder why I don't consider them no competition
There's no vision - lil' ambition
How I feel about these niggas, and my word, are ya kiddin?
(T.I.)
Some niggas wonder what my goal is
They think it's goin' gold havin' hoes sweatin me
Fuck that, I'm in it for the longevity
Picture me as one of the greatest that'll ever be
Compare me to, Tupac, B.I.G., and Jay-Z
Work with legends like, Organo, I.Z., and J.D.
Neptunes, they even flow on one of Dre's beats
Fly to Miami, chill with Luke and we can trade freaks
I freak shows, just peep hoes under shade trees
Huh, but KP say just keep it top-notch
And make sure that the club is jumpin' like it's hop-scotch
Floss rocks and in the summer keep the top dropped
Ten thousand dolla work for clo', when I go shop
In the Apollo on them 'boes so the hoes jock
Especially when I rock that linen suit with no socks
In Polo skippers, they undo zippers,
And they shows cock, to show shot shit
Bitch, I'm serious

And I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt
Hey you can keep the dancers and the boppers, the plexers and the poppers
Let me fill up my Impala, boy holla at my partners
And I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt
I gotta couple of V's wit' the kits, MPV's on my wrist
A lot of glamour and glit's, but shawty I don't need that
My beginnin' was a humble one, a hustler I'ma son of one
Taught me how to number run, I went from that to number one
Had a hundred ones, I bought a slab flipped another one
Sold my little three-eighty east, and said I need another gun
The littlest in the trap, and gotta pack of ice and bubble gum
Junkies hatin' on my stacks, sayin' I'm nuttin but a young
Buck, niggaz say, ""What?"" Then he see me raise up
Just wanna see the little boy wit' nuts exchange old niggaz whole face soon
'Cause I spray the nigga's whole face up, wet the nigga from the waist up
They try you once and you pull a fall, and then tell 'em shaw' don't play wit 'em
I'm fourteen in the dope game and don't care of catchin' no case bruh
You can sell to me, that's intentionally, another nigga that it's too late for
Hey wait bruh, bet any nigga came from that?
Who lose it all the day, I bet he say he changed from that
Hey you can keep the game and the fame, the haters and the lames
Just gimme some cocaine and some wood I can slang
And I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt
Hey you can keep the clones and the clowns, the throne and the crown
Well-known in the town that I'm holdin' it down
So I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt
Okay now, now when I spit it, I spit it how I live it
Every verse I ever gave ya, it was fact, nothin' fiction
I'ma +Livin' Legend+.. no stuntin', no reppin'
You can check my track record, I'm highly respected
I'ma gangsta in the game, go ask Lil' Wayne
Ask Judge Johnson, how many times he saw my face
For, ""pistol here, pistol there,"" ""violation here, violation here""
Betta ask Rank, I ran the jail when I was there
I held it down, where-ever I go
When I'm in the A wit' the +King+, or in Detroit in the snow
I'ma pro, whether it's movin' snow or movin' 'dro
That's between me and you, I can get it for the low
But that's nuttin, everybody say they gotta story
Mine on ""Larry King,"" theirs is on ""Maury""
At the end of the day, it seems to won't go away
I guarantee +The Heart of the Streetz+ that you pray
Snowman bitch (bitch), I ride two-seaters (vroom!)
It's a cold world, so I keep two heaters (geyeah!)
I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt, you betta ask somebody (body)
Matter fact nigga you can just ask me (me)
A little over aggressive, yeah I just might be
But half the niggaz in the hood just like me (damn!)
You wonder why a nigga talk eight balls all day?
You should try standin' around wit' eight balls all day (Yeah!)
Somebody pray for me, I don't know nothin' else (AYE!)
Why should I help you, when you ain't tryin' to help yourself
I came in this game, fresh out the streets (yeah)
Who you kiddin' nigga, I put my life on these beats (Yeah!)
Fuck bein' broke, this a reality check (check)
While you mad at ya girl, ya betta check reality (AHAH!)
Gotta crawl 'fore you walk, you gotta think before you talk
Damn right they gon' hate (geyeah!), 'cause them niggaz aren't straight
(AHAH!)
Say what it do? Young Pimp C know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Yeah, nigga want me to speak on some ""king"" shit, know what I'm sayin'?
On the cool y'know... young nigga T.I. jumped out there
Said he was the king of the south
He ruffled a whole lotta niggaz' feathers
But niggaz didn't really understand what the nigga was talkin' 'bout
Y'know... and uh... so everybody had it twisted but...
Me I understood from the get go
That what the nigga was tryin' to put
In these motherfuckin' stupid ass niggaz' faces!
Was the fact that it's a whole bunch of kings down here
And as long as you takin' care of yo' business and doin' king shit you a king!
What these niggaz shoulda been tryin' to do was tryin' to get close to the nigga
And get some understandin' about the type of game
He was tryin' to put in these motherfuckin' niggaz' ear holes!
Understand what I'm sayin'?
So I'm layin' back I'm watchin' the game from the sideline
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
And I'm seein' all these ol' pussy ass niggaz out here
Talkin' 'bout they this and they that, but they really ain't doin' nothin'!
'Cause they motherfuckin' paper ain't right
When I see them in the street, they diamonds fake! Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!
Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
And them niggaz talkin' 'bout they ""trill niggaz""
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout? This comin' from the O.G. style trill
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout? Not these ol' fake ass niggaz
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit
Some other niggaz paid dues for, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
So this is what is... we bringin' Georgia and Texas together
All you ol' BITCH ASS NIGGAS that ain't down wit' the play
Move on to the side, all you old school rappers like 'Pac say
You niggaz flabby, lookin' like Larry Holmes
BACK YO' BITCH ASS UP! And, and, and, and move around for the South
'Cause it's our time to shine, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

What you mean, why should you? I think a more appropriate question would be why not.
I mean, look around you, exceptions to circumstances require exceptions to be made.
Would you not consider this exceptional? Any sane woman would.
But it's not so much who I am as what I am - a stand up guy, man of respect.

No fake, no flaw, man. Straight like that. It's the king, bitch

I come from Atlanta, the '80s and '90s but we was as real as it gets
And that's why we still here
Best watch what you say, you could pay with your life tonight
Fuck around and get killed
As I pray to the Lord, tell him if I should die tonight
First let me put up a mil'
Inside of the hands of one of the men
Who's gonna go kill or go to the pen
If ever should blood out my body may spill
The nigga, their partner, their family, they're killed
I'm talkin' for real, you kickin' that rah-rah to me
I LOL, shit's haha to me
Nigga ever disrespect, I wave bye bye to him
Got a Maybach, it's just like a Mazda to him
Chew him, up like the mouth in the teeth

You say she wifey, I say she a party girl
Type to eat bitches out when she on molly
You'll never know, which is to me that shit's obvious
She say you're pitiful, they think you're popular
That ain't gon' keep my lil' partner from poppin' yah
Take it, you droppin', you cement your bottle
So won't be no poppin' up, body's erased
No weapon, no charge, no witness, no questions
No stressin', no body, no case
Errbody okay, I will off that guy with my chopper, I throw it away
You can just buy me a cake
And most of the niggas you see standin' by me today
Were trappin' with me in the A
And down here we always three bitches, Rodeo, LA

That one day like the Phoenix aroused from the ashes
That a boy would be born unto a family in the slums
This boy would go on to use the knowledge he gained
While fighting for survival in the streets
To become a great leader

It's black as Bulgari, right next to the platinum Ferrari 
You niggas ain't gettin' money off of rappin' I'm sorry
Fucked the rent up, went and spent 60 large on a Harley.
It's where you stay 10,012 feet, not hardly
Now you see that we ain't able to compete. Now are we?
Hey pardon me, I'm givin' you the West Side Story

Wit' C-Rod and the squad

Have you seen that shit?
Ay, what these other niggaz talkin'
I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it
And I mean that shit
Ay, what's the big deal about him?
He ain't even that shit
I set the city on fire
Have you seen that shit?
(Verse Two)
It's only five rappers outta Atlanta who bustin'
And I'm one of 'em
The other four, you know who you are
But if you gotta think twice
Well shawty you ain't nice
Regardless of your publishing deal
You can't write
I'm the best thing left blowin' breath on the mic
The king of the south
Nothin' else worth a fight
You wanna bet?
Well put yo' budget up
Match the price
Me and you like putting matches to ice
You won't make it
Before I had a deal
I was still butt naked
God signed this, like keeping' the Lord's promise
The truth nigga
Like Beenie's first LP
You can do a song with N'Sync
And couldn't outsell me
I'm a legend in my own time
A prophet in my own rhymes
A king wit' a concubine
Niggaz like you, a dime a dozen
They come and go
So why I'm runnin' now
And I ain't never run before
Grab choppers, cock 'em and blow
Stoppin' the show
Bet or owe 'em, droppin' the hoes
You just keep watchin' the door
Pop 'em, watch 'em drop to the floor
Fluff his pockets and go
Put a quarter block on his nose
And a glock in his clothes
He can keep his watches and gold
For his momma to hold
She'll be there buyin' the hoes
Before the drama unfolds
They know shawty outta control
Got me hot as a stove
Puttin' holes in yo' Girbaud
Wettin' up yo' polos
44's and Callico's
A black and a chrome
Lettin' loose and splackin' your dome
Hoppin' back in the Brougham
Known for kickin' in yo' door
Wavin' gats in yo' home
Clearin' it out
I'm sorry I ain't hearin' you out
You hearin' about
The squad pumpin' Fe in your heart
Because you know sacrifice
Was near and dear to your heart
(Talking)
Ay, my niggaz
Y'all already know what it is
T-I-P, Grand Hustle, Pimp Squad
For life nigga
Sanchez on the beat, dig this man
I'ma keep it always pimpin'
I'm stayin' down
Y'all niggaz gone send yo' demos in
Get cha little motherfuckin' deal
Go sell records
Nigga I got houses, I got blow, I got dro
Nigga I got hoes, nigga I got property nigga
What you wanna do nigga?
Fuck y'all niggaz
Come see about me if you don't like it
King of da God damn south
Rubberband man in this bitch

With a smile on her face, when her lips on mine,

Feed her big peter, beat that pussy up so good she don't want me to eat her.
First I meet her then I beat her... whatever she need.
A few of these turn a nigga wifey to a cheater,
Keep her!
Head down and her ass up here,
Got her hair fucked up and her lipstick smeared
Take a city bitch here or a bitch from the boonies,
Wit a man at the crib but he don't know what he doing... hold up
Truefully she knew she do me, but she knew me,
Introduce me and she blew me and then she didn't say nothin' to me,
You don't like it then sue me

Big ol booty beggin me to decorate her pretty face

Broad looking for that raw, shawty I'm that nigga

81,Let Your Heart Go (Break My Soul),2014,Paperwork (2014),Hip Hop,T.I.,"We said we'd never be
Just a memory
And even though it breaks my soul
Still I never let your heart go
We're running way too fast
Chasing down that blue grass
Hope I didn't break your soul
And know I never let your heart go
Aight man, remember all a nigga had
With 20 grand cash, it was all in the bag
And we got it all with the crack
Lookin' for the plug in the mall with the gat
No, you never loan me a pair but he loan me a ride with it all in the back
How could you just call me with that
Acting like you think you gettin' all of it back
Still remember standin all alone in the trap
Waitin on a plate, lookin' for a way
And damn a big car pull up on me one day
Got a homie [?]
Huh, and it's been long since then
Damn can't believe you been gone since then
Huh, I really miss my nigga
Tramel [?] this for you, know you up there nigga
We said we'd never be
Just a memory
And even though it breaks my soul
Still I never let your heart go
We're running way too fast
Chasing down that blue grass
Hope I didn't break your soul
And know I never let your heart go
Ay, if you miss your nigga like I miss my nigga
Sing, sing
Ite, on the inside nigga you still tough
Ay, remember when we just 16
Mind on one thing, gotta be street kings
Now we numb like morphine
To the gunplay everyday is a war scene
But y'all was my nigga
No matter what I knew I could call on my nigga
And any bullshit involving my niggas
30 rounds in the clip, spray it all for my niggas
Yeah, cap, we were just teenagers
Provin to the g's in the hood we able
We ball on these haters
Doin' a movie screen made ya, you and me playa
Damn, why they have to give my nigga life
We can ball like a God till we bring him back
Really miss you nigga and ain't a motha fuckin' lie
Pimp squad till we die, free my nigga cap
We said we'd never be
Just a memory
And even though it breaks my soul
Still I never let your heart go
We're running way too fast
Chasing down that blue grass
Hope I didn't break your soul
And know I never let your heart go
Huh, I admit it I've seen
Back in the day how silly I seemed
Selling cocaine wasn't really my dream
Could get my family farther than anyone seen
Ay, and if anyone seen where I made it today probably really one thing
One 12 in the face, no he finna run games
Ain't gon trick me into sayin' one name
Nope, well go sit in the cell about that
For weeks I was mad in a hell about that
Police sayin' shit really wasn't my shit
It was his and he knew I wasn't playin' bout that
Hey, for every time I'm strapped
The 12 ride by, they ain't finding my strap
Judge woulda had a nigga heart by that
A nigga woulda sensed some blood by that
We said we'd never be
Just a memory
And even though it breaks my soul
Still I never let your heart go
We're running way too fast
Chasing down that blue grass
Hope I didn't break your soul
And know I never let your heart go"

[Jazze Pha] Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town
Hey shawty, I was feenin' for you
(Was you thinkin' of me, ay, ay...)
[Trina] Hey, let's get room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down
(Whachu would do?)
Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you
Bet they be like ""I know he tired of the nightlife
He want a wife, he just lookin' for the right type""
Yeah right, I be ridin' through the city lights
My hat bent, gettin' high behind the 'lac tint
I'm chilllin' with Brazilian women, heavy accents
They black friends translatin', got'em all ass naked, adjacent
Have relations wit'em many places
Leavin' semen in they Pretty faces
Make'em kiss they partners with it in they faces
Young pimpin' sprung women 'cross the 50 states
Got young ladies requestin' ""What's Yo Name"" on 50 stations
Askin' me what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration
But I ain't waitin' till the second date, I'm so impatient
Relieve'em of they aggravation, take'em rollerskatin'
On them Dayton's, tell'em ""Baby, stick with me, you goin' places""
Go replace'em, draw erase'em out my memory
Moist panties and wet sheets when they think of me
(Chorus (T.I.))
[Trina] Hey, let's get away and a room on the other side of town
Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you

[Jazze Pha] Hey, let's get room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down
(Tell'em shawty)
Yeah baby, I was feenin' for you
Yo, yo... uh...
From Miami to Cali, from Vegas to Jersey
Got'em in Houston, Virginia, New Orleans, ya heard me?
All the classy ones like to act like they a virgin
And the nasty ones like when I talk to'em dirty
But I'm breakin' the ice, got'em laughin' and flirtin'
They be, removin' they skirts when they hop in the 'burban
Once the flick start playin' and the ""E"" start kickin' in
Her girlfriend lickin' and she beggin' me to stick it in
That's why, I like chillin' with women who like women
Lightskinned... Asians, Jamaicans and white women
Indians, Italians, Haitians and Puerto Ricans
They be itchin' for they chance and waitin' in me to freak'em
They say...
(Chorus (T.I.))
[Girl] Hey, let's get away and a room on the other side of town
Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you

[Jazze Pha] Hey, let's get room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down
(Ay, listen to me)
Yeah baby, I was feenin' for you
(Was you feenin' for me?)
Excuse me shawty, but I been watchin' you now for a while
Yo whole style, from yo toes to the way that you smile
And I hope you ain't offended by the way that this sounds
But uh... all I keep thinkin' bout is layin' you down
And I'm, keepin' it pimpin', I ain't playin' around
Ain't got that kinda time 'cause this the only day I'm in town
So come and, chill in the cut if you willin' to cut
And when you, give me a hug I be feelin' yo butt
Now so while for while we talkin', I'm fillin' yo cup
We killin' the bottle, wake up in dirty linen tomorrow
But tell me would it trouble you if we ended up at the W-
Sippin' on a malibu pine apple juice and a blunt or two
Now whachu wanna do? Opportunity's right in front of you
Know you used to meetin' dudes, dodgin'em for a month or two
But young pimpin' spit linen to the young women
I'm T.I.P., known as pussy popper to some women
(Chorus (T.I.))
[Jazze Pha] Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town
Hey shawty, I was feenin' for you
(Was you feenin' for me... ay, ay...)
[Trina] Hey, let's get room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down
Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you
(Oh yeah... c'mon, tell'em)
[Trina] Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town
Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you

See so much potential, lost some reputation, you would think eventually we will get it
They say you got it, they don't even want it
It just hurt so much for them to see you with it

To rob and steal and kill off greatness in the making

It was hard to overwhelm a fat nigga with a eye patch, swingin' hard
Reppin' role tide Alabama
You can tell he was kickin' too much flavour on a country nigga made 'em wanna kill him
Still to see him smiling shawty, he be chillin'
Nigga wish him dead, he ain't even feel it
At your video, I could feel the [?]
We was at the club, nigga couldn't get it in, they was stuck outside
Start to look at you, and as you should you looked like ""fuck I 'posed to do?""
Asked you 'bout it then, said ""ay brah you cool?""
You said ""I ain't worry 'bout the lil dude""
Get they feelings hurt, got a attitude,
They'll come around in a year or two
Made you Hustle Gang, let you in the family
Said ""I get you rich"" you said ""you want a Grammy""
Showed you how to mix the Actavis
Candy, doin' 160 with me, he ain't panic
Called me yesterday, I say ""lil bro what's happening?
Working with Pharell, chillin' in Miami""
All you said was ""run it, book the flight I'm coming
'Fore I leave though, I gotta handle something""
I just said ""ok"" I hung up the phone
Couple hours later, damn my nigga gone

Supposed to be a living legend
Hating nigga sent you home

Ridin' out in a Hummer which I call a lunch box
Standin on 26s which I call 'em hightops

Hoe you couldn't wipe my pimpin' off if you had a rag
Yeah she knows her pops but I'm the one she calls dad
Straight swurvin in the whip passin blunts takin' drags
Watchin dvds in the truck while she out there sellin ass
Peanut butter, Royal Chocolate
Caramel Jazzebell

Now you ask a player
See me shining getting right
Finally coming up call me pimp tight
What you'll do for the limelight
Them bisexuals I call 'em klinedikes
Vanilla want a nut on Sunday
Fill hot fudge in the middle of her tummy
Butter pecan white chocolate love day
Niggas lookin' fly so remember where the hershay
Hoes at Davana of the scanna
Pussy split on my bannana
Take they pic on who they gone sample
To Michigan back down to Alabama
Poped hypontic be the flava
That water their jaws for the milk they shake up
Captain save em
A.K. just gone lace up the beat
To be a suckas favorite
Top it off for the celebration

Make her melt let it drip through her fangers
Sexy, Goregous, Beautiful
Would you do something real freaky tonight
Now I'm in the limelight
This rose gold bring plenty dikes
They come around to service me because they know I lay the pipe
I'm running wit the king we in different cities every night
Broads strippin out they clothes before the D.J. pass the mic
Puerto Rican mama citas, Asian bitches mixed wit white
They come to see the P$C in many skirts and see threw tops
I love this life

86,Live Your Life,2008,Paper Trail (2008),Hip Hop,T.I.,"(T.I.)
Ay, this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here
What you need to do is to be thankful for the life you got
You know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em, baby girl, hey
You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are 
So live your life 
 Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life 
 Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life

No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life 
 Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Nevermind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm West Side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make them put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You rather see me catch a case, then watch my future fade away
You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are
So live your life 
 Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper

'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life
(T.I.)
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagga of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate but still'd grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with they record sales, just holla T.I.P.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow T.I.P.
I got love for the game, but ay, I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comical
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
""Where you from? Who you know? What you makin'? What kind of car you in?""
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into ya bank account, and you've up out of poverty
Your values is in disarrayed, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss-poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?
You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are
So live your life 
 Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life 
 Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life 
 Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life 
 Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life, 
 my life, 
 my life 
Just livin' my life, 
 my life, 
 my life 
Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin,' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money, and I'm not goin' nowhere
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
And look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
'Til the game end, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, my life
In a brand new city, got my whole team wit' me
The life, my life, I do what I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life, I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life and I'm not stopping
So live your life"
87,Live in the Sky,2006,King (2006),Hip Hop,T.I.,"What's happenin', man
It's T.I.P., you know
I'd like to dedicate this song to anyone who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, or to the jail cell
I done been in situations when I had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin'?
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know
But it ain't how I live while I'm here
It's how I live when I leave, you dig?
Life's ups and downs, they come and go
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
It's true, what goes around comes back, you know
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky
My cousin Toot ain't have to die, right in front of his son
And his wife, he lost his life strugglin' over a gun
Give a damn what he done, it's my motherfuckin' fault
And I loved that nigga to death, no motherfuckin' joke
I can fell my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness
If I catch 'im, I'ma kill 'im, I made it my business
Back in the day, you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally, that's why today you're not with me
My cousin died over some yay and I miss him
Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eyewitness
But her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a light sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole 'partments, and still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that
Guess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that
Life's ups and downs, they come and go
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
It's true, what goes around comes back, you know
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky
You ain't never seen a nigga ago to jail and sleep till day 2?
Well, that's how sick I was when J-Rue
Found out the hard way that was powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on herion, died at 22
If ya ain't heard about your daughter, she smiles just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby mama loose, but ha, what can you do?
And I got for myself, yep, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani
Tell the Lord, they all I got, so please don't take them from me
From me standin' in the trap with Curran and Sir Cap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell 'em niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help
Me, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a li'l crack
Never could apologize 'cause you died, that's why they say that
Life's ups and downs, they come and go
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
It's true, what goes around comes back, you know
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky
I bet you niggas think I'm livin' it up
Till you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up
Went from seein' how many bitches I could fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot, is you kiddin' or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, feds rushin' my spot?
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
""But you is a seven time felon, what you doin' with that?""
It's a catch-22, either you lose or you lose
That's the way the game's structured, for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet
Like a man, prepared to take whatever comin' for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
I'm a G prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it from me
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's coming from me
O.G.'s say I need to learn to be patient
You tellin' me with these seven years of probation?
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'
I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked
Life's ups and downs, they come and go
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
It's true, what goes around comes back, you know
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky
Ay, man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot
Alejandro Tremell Morgan, man, I miss the shit out you, my nigga
I'd also like to dedicate this to my homeboy J-Rue
Jamal Hendrix, what's happenin'
Also my partner Bankhead, (??), what it is, nigga
P$C for life and death
And my li'l homeboy Poncho, and my li'l homeboy Rico
I shed tears writin' this song, homeboy, that was real talk, man
Ay, I wanna live in the sky
Hey, let me live in the sky
Pray to God that I live in the sky"

I'll catch a fair cake, go to prison then
Turn around, do the same shit again
Down back, countin' rack
A hundred kilo champagne, hey I drown that
Loud pack, burnt up
Do the iMAX bid, shorty turnt up
The American dream, I'm livin' in it
To Trayvon get some Jesses, I kill a bitch every minute
Yeah talk, give a damn about the sentence
You ain't down to die for something

Every summer kill shit, call me Son of Sam
Big chain, big car
I could buy a big house on my black card
Them other suckers only wanna act hard
Hustle Gang, we jump off, flow stunt hard
So respected, I don't even need a bodyguard
But if it fully automatic then it probably hours
Real talk, give a fuck about the sentence
If you ain't down to die for something your life ain't worth living
I'm on the road the day I die

Dis for all my niggaz who think dey hard...
(Laughing)
You wanna know what's hard (what's hard pimp?)
Goin' about yo day nigga losin yo life at the end of it
Now dats what's hard...(MINDING MY MUTHAFUCKING BUSINESS)
Let me tell y'all 'bout the last day I lived nigga
I'm in the 96 Impala with the gat in my lap
Annihilating any nigga tryin' to work in my trap
Now see the feds got me tap'd
So to keep 'em off of my bac
I got a crib in the trap and a crib to relax
Now my indictment was a secret and that's the way that they keep it
If I ain't have a hoe givin' head to the feds
Comin' bac tellin' me exactly what they said
I'm a dead man walkin'...
Waitin on time in jail
But I'll die before I let 'em stop my mail
Long as I got another ounce to sell
What the hell I'ma bail? a grap my scale
Get another key and I'ma slang my yayo
Niggaz on the westside can't re-up becuz it's a drought
So I check the crack house...
DAMN it sold out
So back to the crib so I can check this stash
Ain't sure about how much dope I had
Got a couple keyz in the safe right now
Weigh it up cook it up then chop it down
Now I'm ready to go and pick up my fetti
But before I leave the house I can't dip without grabbin my G'z
And my keyz to my brand new V put 'em in pocket with the gat to see
Niggaz pleeze nigga you holla bout freeze
Put this red dot to ya ass and squeeze
Now I'm dippin bac to the swats
With the 4-4 and a plastic glock
Turned around and I had to stop
Couldn't trap swarn it wuz cops
Standin there and I still ain't scared
Mac Boney nem must have fled
Only cops is I fear is the feds
On my car flashin blue and red
Damn there dey go now its time to dip
Got the 4-4 right my hip
9 millimeter wit a extra clip
Dats what y'all niggaz get fuckin' round wit TIP
Bustin' at 'em
N cussin at 'em but ain't no shakin 'em
Them bullets dat they wuz bustin' at me my vest wuz takin' 'em
Makin' dem pigs fall in pain
Turned around 'cause one call my name
Took a hot one to the brain
Yeah I died but LONG LIVE THA GAME..."
90,Look What I Got,2003,Trap Muzik (2003),Hip Hop,T.I.,"(Ad lib)
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
You think them niggaz is hot
Well shawty look what I got
(Nigga look what I got)
You think I'm lying nigga
Look what I got
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Shawty look what I got
Ay, pimpin' look what I got
Look what I got
My nigga look what I got
(Verse One)
Big wheels still spin when I stop
Presidential roll, gold rolex watch
With no rocks
I save them for the pinky
Keep you niggaz blinkin'
He ain't wearin' platinum, Naw
But I keep you niggaz thinking
Mink seats sure to keep a nigga sinkin'
Swear he ain't slangin'
But I know that nigga creepin'
Got a condo, in Orlando
For the weekend
Homes be so crunk in the club
We gotta sneak in
No more room in the V.I.P
They payin' just to peek in
When they leave
They be lookin' in a car
They can't even see in
And that's just the
Be-gin-ning
In the city that he in
He was rappin' in the cafeteria
But now that nigga serious
Heard he got a CL, a EXT on Spreewells
Several Chevy's on 24's
(Hold up), ""how many records he sell?""
Man I don't know
But he got a label now
Them boys, the PSC (hell)
I heard Atlantic gave 'em a deal for
2 or 3 mill. (ay, shawty)
(For real nigga?)
Look what I got
A old school, a truck and a drop
So next time you think them niggaz is hot
Shawty, look what I got
The respect of the niggaz and G's
So next time you say them niggaz is G's
You probably lookin' at me
A what, we ballin'
Bought the bar for the broads
So next time you think them niggaz is hard
Shawty, look at the squad
I'm buyin' yachts, have the streets on lock
So next time you think yo' peeps on top
Pimpin', look what I got
(Verse Two)
I'm well known in the hood
Like the dope man phone number
Roll anything I can throw some 24's under
Nigga talk bad 'bout the man
But I shole wonder
Why the dope boys fuck with 'em
And the hoes love 'em
Very little promotions on this album
Never heard of 'em
But it's jammin' like the fuck
Was jumpin' out the stores
'Cause I was born in the raid
And I'm made in the streets
I done played in the days
In the shade in the streets
I say I rapped in the trap
With the best in the streets
Shot craps in the back
You know the rest, nigga please
You doin' business with me
You best invest in some skills
I sell slopes of snow
I don't fuck with little blow nigga
Got 80 k's, it's gone take a little more (to what?)
To double up and bring it back
And make a little more (You movin' slow)
And movin slow, now what you take a nigga for?
I'ma cock hammers and 44's
And nail yo ass to the floor
And I ain't braggin', I'm just letting niggaz know
'Cause the media and radio can get a nigga so
Fucked up
Comparin' me to these niggaz little flow
I do a song
Fuck up they whole little show (so shawty)"

You know, You know (you know you love this)
You know you love this life
Don't nobody do you like me

You up take half, imma make it right back

Deal with them stacks know you gotta love that

I pop big shit, how good does it get
Ya leave me, where else you think you could get this?
Yeah, you could get another guy to beat that beat that for ya
Them busters cowards though, and I'll take a bullet for you
Mansions, jewelry all I need is for you and me to have some understanding
Have a couple candid conversations
Your frustrations I take in consideration
I'm rough around the edges, don't bat with me and be patient
And you're sadly mistaken if you think I'm into chasing
My heart is RSVP I've extended an invitation
And don't go wasting your time with what they saying online
Your positions divine, don't believe look around
I got a strong mind and kind heart
With a soft kiss but I love hard
Don't you love this life like I love you
Anything you could ask, do it for you
Drop Jags, Berkin bags, Louboutin heels
Summer homes in Miami, Hollywood hills
Vacation in Monaco, Ibiza
On the French Riviera with our feet up
Our lifestyles so rare, you know you ain't going nowhere"

Can't ya see I'm on fire, so quit hating on me pimpin', I'm just living my life
Think I ain't gone ride, on all you pussy niggas tryin' to put an end to my life
You can't do it, don't try... I know you sucker niggas wish that you was living my life
In white linen, I'm fly... top down in the spiderville, riding for the rest of my life
(T.I)
A-town veteran, started at eleven
When and bought an eight-ball, I was staying down every since
That's why its hard to find a young rap nigga better than
Bankhead resident, Westside represent, Pimp Squad mobster
Grand Hustle president, heart of a lion and the nuts of an elephant
Trap musik heaven sent, you hating and it's evident
You trying to stack presidents, I'm tryin' to set precedents
The comparison is insulting my intelligene
Cause real recognize real, and real you ain't never been
And never will, I catch ya where you chill, holla at ya where you live nigga, fuck a record deal (what's happenin')
I graduated out the yay, to stack a couple mill
Who would figure it would be a rap nigga I have to kill
My potnaz telling me shawty you have to chill (fuck that shit) but Ima end Up hating with steel, what is is, still dope boy trap niggas
Worldwide lovin' it, haters see the spider and they wanna put a slug in it
Fuck it, I'm a G, I been a rider, I ain't studding it
Better get ya mind of mind, and start hustling
(Chorus:with ad libs)
(Daz)
I should BG banging the stripes, ideas when I strike
Breaking my victims, lining them niggas all with the light
Get it right, hold it tight, blast with all your might
See we hustle for them grands till the early light
Follw my plan on command, leave'em dead where they stand
Ain't no stopping the man nigga with grands in my hands
Living the fast lane, grand hustle the gram when the cash came
(Grand hustle nigga)
The police book me, take my fingerprint and last name
If I'm stuck in a cell, how would I maintain
Lock up all these niggas, the penitentiary mind frame
I strive for perfection, my method is quite collective
Check out the fuckin' way I just rep it
This dog pound gangsta in the back take a licking
Rims shining, fresh paint, T.I. counting paper
Big moves stay on deck with the tools
All y'all niggas and bitches and niggas get sprayed with the tools... Brah
(Chorus: with ad libs)
(Daz)
This how we hustle for the paper, cause the hustle get harder
I'm dog pounded out, an Atlanta Brave starter
Money, weed, and bitches, 24 inches conversating
T.I. plotted on getting these niggas, now for my niggas
Murdering, killing, wheeling the spider, on a mission
All my niggas y'all know how the fuck we kick it
I'ma keep my eye on a meal to ya, hustle it up motherfucker better kick it
(T.I)
All eyes on me, with my westside homie
In a drop 65, on D's, wanna ride on me
I got a forty-five, on me
In a hurry to die homie, get live on me
You charged with tryin' to OG
And I'm creepin' through the crowd, low key, nigga
You don't know me
I learned from niggas before me
I got insomnia shawty, I don't sleep, I bomb, I don't creep
(Chorus: with ad libs)
(Talking: T.I & Daz)
Y'all niggas know how we do this shit

Hey what's happenin' e'erybody
I hope they get my good side
You know I gotta look good when I walk out the house
You know I know the camera's following
I know they taking pictures, right Drama
Ay man, you watch it I live it, you dig that
Y'all sit back relax get some popcorn man
I'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that
This goin' make a hell of a movie huh

I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement
The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave
E'erything in my possession for my seconds on the stage
For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales
I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself
When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect
Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it
I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it
Will I change, boy I doubt it
I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward
See the paparazzi crowded all around me now
Same niggas who was dissin' want a pound like I'm C now
Showered with support from my adoring fans
They hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again

You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement
You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes
It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show
You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it
Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies
That's why they whisper when they see me, point and stare at me
'Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously
Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rockstar
Get blown by a top model 'til she catch lockjaw
Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer
Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw
Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all
Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all
Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me
It's safer to watch it on T.V.

My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)

I guess I'm just here for your amusement
See I don't think it would even matter (to me)
Woking a nine to (five) would it be better
I mean be honest, would you care to gossip about me
Not likely
I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)
('Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool
(And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth
Y'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too
Easy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)
He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)
No not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)
Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)
I know better than to ever talk during the film...
In' and flashing lights can blind your eyesight
To when you can't see what's wrong from right
Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes
And understand this is who I am
Usher I completely concur
Life can be such a blur, obviously we prefer
Our privacy but instead we endure
Yes sir, don't expect nothin' less of me
'Cause this goin' probably be this way until the death of me
But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now
Plus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down
And yo, we doin' just fine, and the time's just flyin'
Live one headline at a time

I went to Japan, made a mil in a week, bra'
I visit king people when they see me in London or out in Ibiza

Maybe, see me in Haiti
With Wyclef Jean and a selection of ladies
My folk got that workin', like back in the 80's
See the money what move me, conversation don't phase me

'Cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas

Girls around the world

See I'm getting wet and this bitch in the same boat
Came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know
I wasn't gonna leave, til I got what I came for

Came a long way, but shawty ain't nothing change though
I still a in two though, don't get it confused, bro
Run up on me wrong, what you think I'm gon do, bro

I've been to Switzerland skiing, pimp I'm goin again
Ain't nothing to catch me in the south of France
Caught a show smoking dro in Amsterdam
Ain't nothing to fly, all the way to Dubai

96,My Type,2007,T.I. vs. T.I.P. (2007),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Lets go... Y'all gon wish for a nigga like me
When I ain't here you know what I'm sayin' (You think I'm lyin')
(Say goodbye to the bad guy)
(You don't appreciate a nigga my type,
Once I die there ain't no more niggas my type,
So just remember me right)
Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type,
But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type,
So just remember me right,
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight,
All them haters gon' be filled with delight,
God forgive me aight,
I sacrifice so they can live my life,
If necessary I'll give my life,
What you hear is my life,
Reputation decorated with stripes,
No need crying at the end of my life,
Just remember me right
When your back was against the wall remember where could you go,
Remember who helped you again like he helped you before,
Went out the way to let you know that you ain't never alone,
They disrespect, you come get who? they left you alone,
They taught you how to be weak, he taught you how to be strong,
Taught you not to accept defeat, you go all out or be gone,
But it ain't the same in the streets now that he's gone,
He now in heaven on the throne exactly where he belong,
He left millions devastated and his family mourned,
Sons turn to grown men since their daddy been gone,
Daughters grew, like him or not he left his family on,
Even prepaid the funeral service that he had in the dome,
And then they came to represent for a stand up gent,
Who walked it like he talked it, always said what he meant,
Impossible to stop him, had a head like cement,
Maybe now you'll appreciate the nigga like this...
Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type,
But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type,
So just remember me right,
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight,
All them haters gon' be filled with delight,
God forgive me aight,
I sacrifice so they can live my life,
If necessary I'll give my life,
What you hear is my life,
Reputation decorated with stripes,
No need crying at the end of my life,
Just remember me right
If they only knew the man outside of the hype,
No matter what the situation was, he alway try to do right,
Still they gossip and told lies, used to take him for granted,
Often found it hard to relate, somehow they couldn't understand it,
'Cause that respect he gon' demand it, there's a problem he handle it,
Looked adversity in the eye, he never ran from a challenge,
They try to knock him off balance when the FEDS came and got him,
Did the time on their head, came home, they ain't stop him,
While them niggas used to hate him, but they girl use to jock him,
Swear he had the type swagger that made the world stop and watch him,
Plus he possessed so much hustle, made it impossible to top him,
Got better every album, haters hated to see him drop em',
They just talk shit from a distance, when he around they playin' possum,
He use to scare the suckers shitless, probably why them niggas shot him,
Guess that's what it took, nothing else than what they could've ever did about him,
So go on talk shit about him, at least you ain't forgot about him... I see
Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type,
But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type,
So just remember me right,
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight,
All them haters gon' be filled with delight,
God forgive me aight,
I sacrifice so they can live my life,
If necessary I'll give my life,
What you hear is my life,
Reputation decorated with stripes,
No need crying at the end of my life,
Just remember me right
Wanna say sorry to my Momma,
King and Lil Mama,
See me go through so much drama,
You could stand a little thunder,
Never let em' see you sweat, stay cool as a cucumber,
Stay ready for whatever, make note I'ma do wonder,
How he died? On his feet, like a man with honor,
Showed you the sky was the limit, you can do whatever you wanna,
Dats for bubba and demani, deja, and neek neek,
Don't worry 'bout me, Uncle Phil and little Le is with me,
See me with your granddaddy,
I know you gon' miss daddy,
But life ain't always a dream, and horrible shit happens,
Hate I let them niggas kill me before I could quit rapping,
Wish I could've spent more time with ya, I know you woulda been happy,
But I had to take the chances, you would have been trappin',
Long as I could keep that from happening, ya Papi could die happy,
So keep the wind at your back and the sun at your face,
Remember winnin' in your blood you were born with what it take (okay)..
Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type,
But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type,
So just remember me right,
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight,
All them haters gon' be filled with delight,
God forgive me aight,
I sacrifice so they can live my life,
If necessary I'll give my life,

Home of the brave and free

Free just to murder me
(Land of the handgun)
Land of the beautiful
(Home of the shotgun)
Cursed by the hate we throw
(Ya dead if ya ain't got one)
Is this the new national anthem?
(It was like this before I got here, baby I ain't do it!)
(I ain't start it I'm just a part of it)
Is this the new national anthem?
Turn it!
You say this the home of the brave I guess
I say this the home of the K's and the vets
All alone with the J's smoking yay 'cause he stressed
On chrome with a Tec taught to spray for respect
I learned from the best used to stay in the ""'jects""
Bought work from the vets burning rubber in the 'Vettes
This as good as it gets used to play with the rats
Then I got older and learned stay away from the rats
God blessed this nigga, to hustle up and make eight figures
Turned from a goon to a great young nigga
No complaining just doing what it take young nigga
I was raised in a decade of hate young nigga
Always dodging polices because they hate young niggas
And we hate them too, 38 in him shoe
All the changes the system will take him through
He ain't a killer but he will if you make him do it
Homicide he'll ride, they'll put him on trial
Let him have a life sentence then do it with a smile
And he only 19, he ain't even had a child
As a child, told his mama he'll be gone for a while
And she cried, still they just put him inside
Now she all on her own because her other son died
Listen to the politician as he lied and he lied
He a snake in a suit, trying to hide in disguise
Home of the brave and free
Free just to murder me

And you wonder why we walk around with straps)
For the stars and the stripes prison bars and the pipe
Young nigga rolling weed in a cigar he can light
Bang red either blue selling hard and the white
Live by the gun, never run from a fight
Trayvon in a hoodie, walking through the neighborhood he
Didn't do shit to buddy, he didn't have to die did he?
I guess it's because his dad was a judge in the city
They didn't want him in the pen with the thugs that could get him
A jury of his peers said all was forgiven
But touch one of mine, right or wrong, I'mma kill them
Fill them with the lead like they put in Martin Luther King's head
Like they killed Malcolm X, Edgar Hoover did that
You can catch me in the hood where they shooting niggas at
They don't know if Neighborhood or the Hoovers did that
Whether Piru or VL's or GDs wit me we

Let me ask you something: if the kids are the future, tell me why you can get more for being C.O., than you can for being a teacher. Tell me why it means more to the government to pay the people who got to watch over the prisoners, more than the people who got to keep the children from becoming prisoners That make sense? Tell me why 9 ounces of crack will get you more time than a rape right now. Tell me why them crazy white boys can tote a gun but I can't right now. Yeah, I had felonies, I done did dirt in the streets, but I ain't ever gave it to anybody that didn't deserve it. You know what I mean? I ain't ever ran in no public place with no pistol shooting no innocent people. I ain't never ran in no school, killing no kids. Man this is the result of you refusing to deal with the issues at hand. We are a product of the environment you placed us in... we ain't do it... we just lived through it

Hey shorty here I am
Never have ya seen in ya lifetime
A more divine Southern rapper with a swagga like mine
Facin' all kind of time, but smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion and shine without tryin'
Believe me, pain's a small thing to a giant
I was born without a dime, out the gutter I climbed
Spoke my mind and didn't stutter one time
Ali say even the greatest gotta suffer sometime
So I huff and puff rhymes, lyrics so sick wit' it
Set the standard in Atlanta, how to get get get it
So you up-and-coming rappers wanna diss, just kill it
I'm officially the realest, point blank, period
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit
Whatever you can do in the hood, I done did it
That why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still the city long as Tip livin,' nigga
I ain't dead (Nah), I ain't done (Nah)
I ain't scared (Of what?), I ain't run (From who?)
But still I stand (Yeah)
No matter what, people, here I am (Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break (Never), I ain't fold (Never)
They hate me more (So?), and yeah, I know (Ha ha)
But here I go (Yeah)
No matter what, shorty, here I go (Ha)
No matter what, shorty
You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail till 2027
Rather see me in the cell than instead of this new McLaren
God will take you to hell just to get you to heaven
So even though it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin is still bear it, win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change your directions, even when ye ain't planned it
All you can do it handle it, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity, manage
To conquer every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning's illogical, losing's still far from optional
Ay, yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside 
 too long, I did a song
To make it known that the King lives on, pimpin'
I ain't dead (Nah), I ain't done (Nah)
I ain't scared (Of what?), I ain't run (From who?)
But still I stand (Yeah)
No matter what, people, here I am (Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break (Never), I ain't fold (Never)
They hate me more (So?), and yeah, I know (Ha ha)
But here I go (Yeah)
No matter what, shorty, here I go (Ha)
No matter what, shorty
Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do what you do, ya ain't got a clue
All you do is follow dudes, sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm, make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now when my hands tied
They take shots 'cause if I'm out there, it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served, nigga,
Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
But I don't quit, if ye ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say goodnight, shorty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shorty
Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shorty
'Fore you know it I'm back, what it look like, shorty?
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your heart filled with faith then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'?
Easy, let go and let God deal with it
I ain't dead (Nah), I ain't done (Nah)
I ain't scared (Of what?), I ain't run (From who?)
But still I stand (Yeah)
No matter what, people, here I am (Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break (Never), I ain't fold (Never)

Me fucking if you ain't a dime, just forget that
Pretty face fat ass, if she don't have
Have one of these, well I think I'll pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it I took it back

That's mediocre bitch
All I fuck is bad bitches
I don't want no mediocre hoe
Don't want no mediocre

Bad bitches only

Heard he want to lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice
Now he want a 3, Mike Bibby diva
But I need a bad boy
Rest in peace Whitney pardon me
But I don't think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get 'em a taste
I'm still Grand Hustle first lady fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby

I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out dem tennis shoes
Throw some heels on a bitch
I'm the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last go
Take her to my castle
Drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can write this shit
No further than a cab go
Said I got that don dick
She wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach
From Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes
But I'm looking for a cute bitch
You the shit
What she say when she got to sit
When I ain't around
Give a damn who you do it with
Super thick pretty face
Ménage à veinte
20 at the same time
Wanna get ya rent paid
All I fuck is bad bitches
I don't want no mediocre hoe
Don't want no mediocre
I don't want no mediocre no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre hoe
Don't want no mediocre

100,No Mercy,2010,No Mercy (2010),Hip Hop,T.I.,"There's No Mercy for me.
No crying myself to sleep.
No Mercy for me.
Nightmares have become my dreams.
No Mercy for me.
Good morning reality.
Will I wake? We'll never know.
I'm late for my date with destiny.
Let me go.
Let me go.
You've got to let me go.
Right or wrong.
Let me go.
I'm on my path.
Let me go.
(Verse 1: T.I.)
My mama loved me more than I do.
She said you pap was just like you.
Trapped in a vicious cycle.
Jesus youngest disciple.
Tell the judge if he throwed the book at me make it the bible.
Start callin' myself the king for lack of a better title.
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment.
It's so vital I change or blow opportunities like a choir recital.
Now while I do not care who tellin' meanwhile sellin' powder puts food in the bellies.
Well it's unfortunate.
The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages.
Kid go to school stupid they teachers ignorin' it.
Sort of just doomed, forced into bein' a goon, sell the kush in a jar.
Mix a guitar in a balloon.
Consumed with the same way of life I left.
Everything I know now learned by myself.
All you see are the whips.
The Maserati's Ferrari's.
So they don't sympathize.
Don't nobody feel sorry.
No Mercy.
There's No Mercy for me.
No crying myself to sleep.
No Mercy for me.
Nightmares have become my dreams.

Will I wake? We'll never know.
I'm late for my date with destiny.
Let me go.
(Verse 2: T.I.)
Everybody's standin' and waitin' ?? they're hatin'.
Gospels say they should forgive me.
They'd rather hand me to Satan.
Blatant displays the day of hypocrisy.
Boy you got to be kiddin'.
Could it be possibly second comin' to Pac is me?
Remember that when he was here?
And when he died you realized you need him here.
God with me partner.
Ain't no one for me to fear.
Hindsight 20/20.
Future not as clear.
But I'm a rider till I die.
Put bullets 'tween my eye.
I just ask that I can make my peace with God and say goodbye.
Fuck up the world like lady Di hone the day he died.
His wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried to be a person nah they wanted better verses.
They could market to the merchants.
But when they closed curtains, hey, you could be for certain ain't nobody perfect.
But when your rich, nobody gives a shit.
No Mercy.

101,No More Talk,2003,Trap Muzik (2003),Hip Hop,T.I.,"I'm either running for my life or I'm just waiting to die
I'm the supplier of the fire if you're chasing a high
It's never, when or why, it's the way that he die
Did he stand like a man till the day that he die
Or was he reaching for guns or trying to run
Or was he outside on the lawn in front of his son
And if ya, running your mouth you can die in the slum
'Cause in the, south where I'm from they dying for crumbs
You can die for your Patna's or die for ya moms
Or you could die 'cause your nigga just heard the alarm, just stealing
Or die in a plane they say it's a bomb
When they run it into a tower, they just say it's Saddam
Screaming Allah the moment that it's hitting the building
With total disregard for all men women and children
See niggaz get killed when, people mix they money with feelings
I'm filling my money up in the wall some in the ceiling
I'm just one of the millions of niggaz who?
It's a war going on and they killing for nothing
We were in denial all awhile they where flicking the buttons
I'd rather be dying for something instead of living for nothing
End of discussion
Hey, ain't no more talk
Just start killing niggaz off till ain't no more chalk
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' phenes
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting
And I know, so ain't no mo' talk
Just start killing niggaz off till ain't no mo' chalk
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' phenes
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting
And I know
Yeah they said it wasn't no mo' green for no mo' grind
No mo' room for no mo' kings and no more crown to be given but by no means
Am I any more conceited than this game needed
And if I say it believe it, I'm running the region, you see it
Popping and blowing, I'm stopping I'm going
I'm just, telling, you knowing, you sleeping, or hating
And I don't care what you niggaz is thinking or saying
About, you know who, the one who say you know what, do you know where
But you the best 'cause you goin' care
Now I ain't think so either, but we know greed'll make ya
Do strange thang's if we ain't people
And if ya, busting 'bout nothing, than we ain't equal
You just cussing for nothing and poisoning people
And it's embarrassing laughing at all of your songs
And you can hate me right now but you'll miss me 'fore long, when I'm gone"

104,On Top of the World,2008,Paper Trail (2008),Hip Hop,T.I.,"I used to dream (I used to dream), oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing), oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
Man I remember, before I say that, wait, let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaken for glorification
Now, I remember so vivid, me and my niggas was living
Sub-standard condition, still handling business
Still laughing and tripping, still having the bitches
I'm rapping now, reminiscing, and God damn it, we did it
From trapping, standing, and pitching with rich, we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways, flipping it eight days
Thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes
I ain't lying, the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move, but we served the small time
I always outshined the niggas with small minds
Who would have thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time?
Around here, we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel, it can only be found here
Only listen to G's, that other shit I don't hear
Shit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care
I'm too busy being a player, staring at niggas careers
But talk about it for years and now we finally here
I used to dream (I used to dream), oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing), oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
They say what goes up must come down, but I ain't reached my cruising altitude
Take a look at what I did, but can you imagine what I'm about to do?
The places I'm bout to go, and the money I'm bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said ""look out for me!""
Exceeded expectations, even at Def Jam
'Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
'Cause I'm a self-made, nappy-headed, rich nigga
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
'Cause I work for myself and no one else 'cause I'm too smart to
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef, so that bread he get it
Put them all in houses, cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Order in Singapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammys and rappers winning Oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act nah suckers
We see Samuel Jackson like what's up mother fucker?!
I used to dream (I used to dream), oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing), oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
I know them haters don't stop plotting and wish you would fall
'Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all
I see you down there to y'all, it seems like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough, I'm still trying to triple up
It's why we got StreetCred and a cool building up
Say I'm doing too much, shit, I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying ""Damn, if I could just get to a million plus""
And now I'm like ""Shit, what the fuck is a million bucks?""
Triple that on my bun thanks to bigs and run
But nevermind what I've been through, just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided, what I done for my sons
And daughters, and momma, just call her
I sold dope and dropped out of school seems it's all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle, now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals, but not when the judge sentence them
Cousins in college, where you think they get tuition from?
Jeffrey standing around wishing huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen, taking action over time, got damn good at it
I used to dream (I used to dream), oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing), oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world

ATL, Westside, that's the only home I know
In '85, me and Uncle Quint used to ride around in the big Bronco
Took me up to Charles' Disco
Daytime, set me down at the bar
Where I drank Shirley Temple
Till he walked out with a bag and we got back in the car
What you wanna be he asked? When you grow up big kid?
I just wanna be like you, ridin' round town gettin' bread
We shot a couple Lac, couple summer pass
Uncle Quint ain't nowhere to be found

And a pocket full of crack rock dimes
Time on my side, lift.45 in my jeans

Livin' on my own, peddlin'
Quarter ki, now and then sellin' weed
Tokin' too, cost my first felony
That's one of many, that were to follow
Drinkin' Henney up out the bottle
Told a child I think I'm bein' followed
Family don't think I'll live to see tomorrow
Plenty have a story like mine
Know many of you had a little nine
Know many of you did a little dirt
Too many of us did a little time

Came in that bitch with my ego and got cash

Pledge Allegiance To The Swag

A bitch'll disappear or the bitch will disappear

Push a button from the mansion, hit you with a hollow tip
We two different niggas, I'm servin', he sniffing his
And I love that new Bugatti, how that bitch be shifting gears
Movin' how I move, I fuck with a selected few
Aviators and Audemars, tha bezel fluorescent blue
Down south nigga, had to climb up out the barrel
Outfox these niggas, now we rock out on apparrel
Pledge allegiance to the swag cause this shit is top notch
Jumpin' in and outta bitches like I'm playin' hopscotch
Jumpin' in and outta sixes like I got a car lot
And I got the type of digits that your bitch'll dial by
Young niggas bow down to the kings
In the presence of a Don, pay respect, kiss my ring
The Enzo off set, neck, wrist frosty
Deal ain't hundred mil, you ain't talkin' bout shit
Nigga wanna beef, he get the whole cal quick
If you talking bout some paper step into my office
On some pimp house shit, written out chicks,
Fuck 'em from behind, they be spitting out dick
Excuse me now but if I may make an announcement
I smoke no more but when I did I was blowin' ounces of gas
Ask the feds what I had when they found me
We down with whatever, don't interrupt my countin'
Ballin' on a daily basis, call my accountant
Only time you make it rain when you throwin' change in a fountain
Flow sick, crazy, derranged, need counselin'
He say I ain't all that, she say I'm outstandin'
Them lames all cheesy, square's outta season
When you see my swag, nigga, pledge your allegiance
Ay my n-gga I'm the type of stars and stripes you know what I'm saying,
You come f-ck with me on that bullsh-t you'll be seeing Stars and Stripes n-gga, you understand that n-gga, say I'm lying, think it's a game if you want to partna

My section in the club, Remy, Rose
When you're all ready say go, okay
Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go pop
Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go pop
You see him standing on the furniture doing his thing
Tell the club owner, fuck yo' crouch, Rick James nigga
Pop a bottle, make that thing go blow
Let her drink it till she drown
Let a girl go wild, pop a bottle
Bow, bow, bow...
(T.I.)
Bring the 1738 Champagne the boss
Watch ya gettin' money make it rain buy a bottle
Pop a cork, dork
If I may retort
I ball just as hard tomorrow as the day before
I pop bottles but I don't pour
Save the glass for guys, we ballin' on a budget
Fuck it, let your glasses rise
I'm straight to the head with mine, why you acting surprised
Ask any hoe who know me, all I do is smash and ride
Buckets of bubbly, shake it up and let it splash in the eyes
No subtraction, only cash to divide
We gettin' money, bank roll, supersized
Whether rain, sleet, sunny
Let the good times roll and the bottles keep coming
(Drake)
Yeah, okay, bring that shit to poppa
I heard you talk bout other niggas
Them other nigga no matter
The tag team back bitch, boom shakalaka
Me and Weezy run this bitch so bring me one soda and vodka
And a fuji for my nigga cause the police probably watching
Man, probation is a bitch but going back is not an option
We be sunning all these niggas, put there ass up for adoption
And we start with straight shots, that get the bottle poppin'
We be working all night, telethon shit
Roll a super skinny once you you Ne Lemon shit
Ooh, that's that fire, that have you calm shit
You with a lot of dudes, that's that Elton John shit
Ah, to each his own, I like a fruit that's grown
I like a bad bitch from a decent home
Me and Tip, that's that pimpin' that we preachin' on
And everybody tryna listen nigga, speakerphone
(T.I.)
I know the sucker wish the judge threw the book at me
'Cause I show up to the club, super cool, look at me
Everything brand new, you get money like who?
Spent 150 on my car and my Audemar too
When I walk up in the spot, ain't nobody saw you
They see me like ""there he go""
Look at you like ""ah who?""
Bought every bottle at the bar
Shortie you know how I do
I take 'em all across your, I ain't finna argue
Still big shit poppin', nothing changed but my clothes
Triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll
Tell the bitch I take you places where your man can't go
Can't be, he ain't doing shit, if he ain't me
Can't you see the difference between us when I walkin' to the door
Your twenty thousand worth of ones, start letting money go
Let it fly, throw some twenty when my one running low
Fifty stack, I'mma show you how to ball, triple that"

With such a, pretty face big booty, little waistline...
I wanna grind from behind to the bass line.
Have a great time, pull yourself a shot girl
Chase it with the lime, now you feeling like a hot girl
I know you're probably used to deal with them wannabe's
But honestly I gotta say, I'm who they wanna be.
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me
And we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave
I could guarantee the ride of your life.
Any fantasies on your mind? We can try them tonight.
Oh yeah sittin' here

Oh girl I wonder
For real shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin' 'bout
It's the end of the night, and I'm thinkin' you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into porn star.
Yes, I'd love to hear about your interests
I gotta say, your intellect got me impressed
See your [...] through your dress like a silhouette.
Patrón got me thinkin' sex, is you feelin' that?
No disrespect, though
A simple yes/no
Hey let yourself let go, shawty let's go
Pull you to the crib, get you through the threshold
Kiss you from your pretty lips till your red toes
Time tickin' it's the end of the night
And you could leave with your friend if you like
But I'm saying no
Hey we could ride out
Back to my house
I wanna see you satisfied inside out
Once I'm in you ain't gon' want me to slide out
You tell your girlfriends they gon' wanna try out
A little more of this will loosen you up

Hey would you... stay?
Could you... play with it, with your tongue just a... little?
You such a sexy individual physical and mental
And if it's sentimental shouldn't rules bend a little
Hey let me start at the top stop in the middle use a popsicle
Make you shiver giggle when it tickle
I could talk to you dirty if you like that
I finish once, hit a blun, start right back
I know you told me you a good girl
But shawty you's grown woman not a little girl
You could blame it on the patron or the champagne
But sometimes being bad could be a good thing.
Oh yeah sittin' here

110,Prayin' for Help,2004,Urban Legend (2004),Hip Hop,T.I.,"(T.I. Prayin') Intro
Our Father
Who are in heaven
Hollowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us for our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory
For ever, and ever
Man I'm prayin' for help
While I'm lookin' at the life I left
It's kinda hard not to hate myself
But quiet is kept right or wrong
It's just the way I felt
I might be better of prayin' for death
On my knees I knelt
Still trying to find a way to accept
It ain't a way I can help nobody
Till I save myself
Technically I'm still a slave myself
I gotta climb out the grave myself
Man I played myself
But when I look at all the fans I touched
I ask how can a man that's done so much
Be treated so unjust
'Cause I'm tryin' to inspire da folks
Wanna condemn 'cause they sell dope
Well man show 'em the ropes
Be a father a football coach a role model or a symbol of hope
Take another approach
Instead of testifying against 'em in court
Handcuffin 'em and closin the door so they can be worse than before
Can't you see they only do what they know
Then you wonder why they don't care no more
Life ain't fair I know
But why I'm hated everywhere I go
Next time you wanna compare my flow just know
I'm prayin' for help...
Askin somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard but I'm only a man (man)
I'm prayin' for help
Hopin somebody else can see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me they got me
(Prayin' for help)
Hopin somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone with no kinda support
(While I) was prayin' for help
Realized I don't need nobody else
If God with me I can do it myself
(Tired of just prayin' for help)
I know it's only one king
One thing, one being, only something I believe
Without seein and with all my faith
I pray somehow, someway regardless of what anyone say
I believe one day that imma change my life
Get right, start livin' like Christ, till the end of my fight
Imma be defending my strife, till somebody come and shut off my lights
I ain't never gone quit
No matter how difficult is gone get
And you can bet whatever on this
I'm forever gone spit
Harder than niggaz hatin' on TIP
You can take the weight and place it on TIP
I'll double my load carry it as the trouble unfolds
Hold yos and I bet I don't fold
Put that on my soul
If it takez till I'm 100 years old
Bet I'm reachin' every one of my goals
You know I'm prayin' for help...
Askin somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard but I'm only a man (man)
I'm prayin' for help
Hopin somebody else can see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me they got me
(Prayin' for help)
Hopin somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone with no kinda support
(While I) was prayin' for help
Realized I don't need nobody else
If God with me I can do it myself
(Tired of just prayin' for help)
So many times I done wish that I could change my mind
Change my life and leave the game behind
And it's been so many days
I done prayed I could find a way
Find the heart and the time to say
Only so many are blessed with
So many chances, so many checks
So many fans with so many arrests
And it's been so many deaths
So many prisons with niggaz in there
And the system keep playin' them to the left
Man it's so many test so many haters love seein you stress
But tribulations come with being the best
Still there's so many reflects, singin' bout Tecs
Winnin', green and the trickz?
Sellin dreams that never seen in the jex?
That's why I'm seen as a threat
So many stripes off the streets in my vest
So many rappers get so little respect
Man niggaz faith on the shelf
Cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt
Or the hard that a nigga done dealt
So many niggaz that left
Out of the hood
Made a way for theyself
Instead of givin' back they stay for theyself
So many playin' theyself
Instead of reading educating theyselves
The ones who won't pray for theyself, they got me
Prayin' for help...
Askin somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard but I'm only a man (man)
I'm prayin' for help
Hopin somebody else can see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me the got me
(Prayin' for help)
Hopin somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone with no kinda support
(While I) was prayin' for help
Realized I don't need nobody else
If God with me I can do it myself
(Tired of just prayin' for help)
Askin somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard but I'm only a man (man)

Shawty let me see you take it off, toot it up
Back into me, pass it to me
Imagine hanging half way off the mattress while your ass is moving
Up and down, back and forth, so ratchet when you supposed to be
A lady to the naked eye, but a nasty lil' hold of me
If only the masses could see your ass when it's in action, I swear
Manhandle you and pullin' places, I make you take it right here
You got no idea, listen girl with this pole right here, ow
Beat it up, be grabbin' hair
Leavin' hand prints on your derrière
Now, can you, just kiss it for me while I'm doin' 'bout a hundred on the highway
Get it, slap it wet, get it bent, girl I bet you could finish before I pull up on the driveway
And this ain't no child play, this grown man B girl I'll say

Shawty you ain't gotta lie about it
Blackin' out in that pussy like a power outage
Got a man, well he gon' be sour about it
But I just wanna be on your team
Provide you with your protein
Leave wet dreams all in your face
Them tattoos all over your waist
Got me rock solid, can't touch that
I'm fuckin' you like I'm upset
Chokin' you, long stroking you
Say you came twice, not enough yet
Because a cat that phat is very rare
And my dick ought to be buried there

Man woman and child, no exception homeboy
No disrespect will be tolerated man come hell or high water
You understand that? You bitch!
Bankroll mafia, hustle gang ova everythang nigga

Sucka niggas in my rearview
Wonder why I'm even wasting my time
Even replying to let you know I don't feel you, fuck 'em!

I swear to God I'ma drop a gem like cookin' crack
And sell it hard, I'ma
Bankhead nigga to the heart, with
Tote tools on the boulevard
It's young niggas in a stolen car
With expensive ambition and exquisite pistols we showin' off
Caught that line and we goin' off
And let his mom give a damn, who you goin' call?
You violatin, we ain't lettin' nothin' go at all
We demonstrate and leave your brains on the fuckin' wall
Pussy, you disrespectful nigga, got that
I ain't never been shot at, and I ain't shot back
Bossed up in a cool whip with a hot gat
And still got stacks from back from ""What you know about that?""

On the balcony so they could get a clear view
Of the city with my dick up in it
But in the morning won't remember which bitch is it, shit
Ay I'm too rich for this shit but I'm too real to be tried nigga
Going against me just like goin' against God
And I ain't gotta make excuses, why
I don't fuck whoever, whatchu wanna do about it

You caught slippin' roll down on your ass, .45 start spittin'
Goin' be a long day nigga I start trippin'
Don't be stickin' to the script, drive-by audition, what's up?
Whatchu do for dough, guess you do it too slow
And by the looks of your stuff, you ain't doin' enough
I'm poppin' witnesses in the front, leave you in the dust
Kick in your door masked up like, ""Who in the fuck?""
Boy you is a ho ho, not just a little piece of pussy
Betta watch your ass talkin', you don't me nigga holdup

But I'll still check a bitch like 'Pac did Lauryn Hill
Hey, hey I ain't grow into it, I was born with it
Used to sell crack to the children of the corn
I'm the reason why your mama warned you
Pray you don't die before you make it to the street corner

Hell naw, give a damn who you go and get
Real niggas know it
We can notice that you niggas ain't raw
Even though that you suppose to be down wit so and so
You still the same lame from a year ago
I know you ain't raw
You ain't graduated with the gladiators
You're just practice for the young assassinators
Ey, you know you ain't raw.
Fuck The shit you tellin' them, I know he ain't shit as us
He ain't now competitor, That shit there ain't scarin' us
You bought yourself a slaughterin, a coffins what you headed for.
You didn't wanna die, well nigga what'd you pull a weapon for?
Just 'cause we the niggas all y'all ho bitches checkin' for
And ain't nobody real niggas would rather hear instead of us
Yeen out shinin us and yeen out selli us
Lot of niggas do it, don't nobody do as well as us
Hater wanna fuck wit us, let him get to vestin up
Hit 'em wit the chopper, chest and up, bet I wet ya up
Let ya partna get ya up, ain't nobody catchin up
But this some shit I'm down to receive a lethal injection for
King of the whole thing, Fuck whoever stepping up
Give a damn who is behind em, or care about who catchin up
Long as I'm alive, the second best you'll have to settle for
Come on now, you really think you better bro?
I got both friends blowin', on a boat just goin'
This bitch, his bitch, and yo bitch blowin'
Young pimpin' get dough in, like his last name Cohen
My fan base spread, and the shit kept growin'
And wat got me getting head in the vessel of the G4 again
Hook a hustle up wit investors and there he go again
20 million later and I'm guessin its finally soakin in
At best you just a hater who mad at me 'cause he broke again
Sellin all ya jewelry, considerin sellin dope again
'Cause he whos ballin outta control is suppose to be focusin
Wana be the king by default, they hopin for openings
Pray they see the day they hear me say I'll never flow again
But oh contrary I guarantee in one year
After another they'll suffer as long as I'm here
Fear no man alive, I don't care

How I'm walkin' 'round, people starin' in amazement
I play a lot of games, but well-being I ain't playing wit'
They so judgmental, man, but they don't understand
If ya life was in jeopardy everyday, is you tellin' me
You wouldn't need weaponry just because of ya felonies?
Consider this at least, I got everybody sweatin' me
On the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago, still, in my sleep they threaten me
Paranoia stressin' me, ain't nobody protectin' me
I'm dealing wit' the pressure from my partner dyin' next to me
Think 'cause no one's arrested, they comin' for me eventually
This was all the things that I was goin' through mentally
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary
Not mentionin' New Orleans, niggas comin' in the city
Killin' all summer long, ain't nobody pay attention
Now is it that hard to understand if ya listen?
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of decision
But I'm wrong and I know it, my excuse is unimportant
I'm just tryin' to let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real
I had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison
You waitin' on me to die, you gon' be waitin' for a minute
Boy, I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real
Can't afford the price of fame 'cause it cost too much
Plus these sucka niggas lame and they talk to much
That's why I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real
For real, ay, for real
I say, when everything settle for real
Ay, for real, ay, for real
I say, when everything settle for real
I'm a man, I ain't perfect, I admit it, I'm guilty
But understand, feel me, I was ridin' filthy
'Cause niggas out there plottin' to rob me and kill me
500,000 every year spent on security
My future was bright, but now its gettin' blurry
'Cause niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
But surely, God'll deliver me up out it
I'm a fighter to the heart, I'll forever be about it
I'm a father to my sons, asset to my community
Look all that I done done, my good outweigh the negativity
'Ay mentally, I was focused on not lettin' history repeat itself
That's why heat was kept in the vicinity
Yes, officially, I broke the law, but not maliciously
Through all of the publicity, was anyone considerin'
My position and the logic hid in my decision?
But they caught me wit 'em, now I'm off to prison, period
But is it that hard to understand if ya listen?
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of decision
But I'm wrong and I know it, my excuse is unimportant
I'm just tryin' to let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real
I had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison
You waitin' on me to die, you gon' be waitin' for a minute
Boy, I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real
Can't afford the price of fame 'cause it cost too much
Plus these sucka niggas lame and they talk to much
That's why I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real
For real, ay, for real
I say, when everything settle for real
Ay, for real, ay, for real (I be here)
I say, when everything settle for real
For real, ay, for real (Ay, I say listen, homeboy)
I say, when everything settle for real (You can talk all you want, man)
For real, ay, for real (You know what I'm sayin,' everybody talkin' to the King, you know what I'm sayin')
I say, when everything settle for real (They like yesterdays, everybody got one)
Ay, but the fact of the matter remains
If ye ain't walked a mile in my shoes, and ye ain't lived a day in my life
Ye ain't survived the shit I done survived
Ye ain't had to deal with the shit I done had to deal with, homeboy
You can't motherfuckin' judge me, partner
I mean, look at folk like Sean Taylor
You know what they said? They said had he had a strap
He'd have lived today, you know what I'm sayin'
Now true enough, I was dead wrong, I broke the law
I deserve to be punished, I understand that, a'ight, cool
But listen, man, I got a house full of kids
A mama and an old lady whose life is my responsibility, you dig that?
Now, for all of y'all who think I was just ridin' around on some dumb shit
Ay, you know I'm smarter than you, man
You know I'm smarter than you, dog
Ay, if you think I was just bein' stupid
Shorty, I got some motherfuckin' oceanfront property in Idaho for sale, homie
If you beleive that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you, partner
Ay, man, real talk
In order to understand my train of thought, you done have to put yourself in my position
you cant expect me to think like you, 'cause my life ain't like yours, you know what I'm sayin'?
If you don't understand that, you don't understand English, homeboy
I'm done talking"

But all these niggas speaking out whoever spoke before,
Don't take it personal people want to be close to folk,
What you think the television and the posters for?

Is that you? Rubber Band Man
Boy... is that T.I.? Whoooo...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Remix Playa, yeah, y'all already know what it is man
T.I.P, came from the south, Rubber Band man boy...
Connected with my folk from the West Mack
My folk from the Chi' Twista
And T Double D, from the bottom
(Hook - T.I.)
Rubber Band man, wild as the Taliban
Nine in my right, forty-five in my other hand
I'm in trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand
Chevy's all colors man, who I'm isss...?
(Verse One - T.I.)
I'm young pimpin', way out of ya vision
Don't set your sights on my position, I'm way out ya division
I was grindin' while you was tryin' to figure out your division
I'm sittin' on the block and watchin' hustlas makin' and killin'
Until I, jumped in the game without my uncle's permission
Makin', solvin' my family's wishes through whatever conditions
I'm workin' trappin' servin' kitchens with intentions to get in
My mittens under cover millions workin' off of commission
Everyday I'm on a mission with heavy haters so listen
Divide it, flip it, weigh and ship it, till you cook it and sniff it
When I talk, G's listen they can see I been livin' the same, life that I'm spittin'
I ain't frontin' and trippin'
I came, out of the trap I ain't come here to visit
I named the album Trap Muzik 'cause I'm being specific
To my niggaz still investin' in caine
I'm wearin' rubber bands just out of respect for the game
[Verse Two - Mack 10] (T.I.)
(Who I'm isss...) Mack the dope mayn
Who bang is the game and we 'bout heroine you jam in your fame
It's simple and plain my cocaine off the chain
My ballin' fatsbreak, you got that half-court game
Y'all just talkin' and ramblin' ain't really grindin' and gamblin'
But in my hood, the kids is all black like gramlin
Stay scramblin', hustle hard on the boulevard
Rob ya, leave ya scarred, and pull ya whole card
I got that wizerk, dawg I got them birdies that don't chizerp
Bought an X pill filthy green and the purple sizzurp
And no matter where I'm at, is west coast or up front
I'm low key I can't stunt and move a hundred bricks a month
In the east they like my swagger, them broads be up on me
In the south they love me, 'cause I'm down and dirty homie
And if you get it how you live as a gangsta then stand up
Mack10 a 'D boy', so my cash is rubberbanned up
[Verse Three - Trick Daddy] (T.I.)
(Who I'm isss...) I represent for the Tre-o-five
Down with the rubberband man, y'all call him young T.I.
See I been an O.G., far from O.D.'n and this is
T double D don't even call me Maurice, now listen
My description is tall, dark, skinny, and ill-mannered
A hood negro with a little bit of Spanish be like
Say yo papi, I got, yayo papi if your price is right come on down and y'all copy
Watch me, I'm gettin' money like it's 1984
Got so much cash Bill Gates could kiss my ass (yeah)
I'm such a player they call me Juan Pierre
Been ballin' since my younger years like ya boy Cabrera
I ain't no sentimental nigga, I'm sittin' on spinners nigga
And when I'm, draggin' my denim don't you bustas try to get 'em mmm...
I'm from the parts where the stars like them (??)
Stars quality sound beatin' down each and every car
[Verse Four - Twista] (T.I.)
(Who I'm isss...) I'm a windy city man, the one that take sip and run it to the brain
Love to get it crunk in the south where my cousins from, and shawty shake that thang
Take the hipno' to the dome, smokin' when I'm rollin', wood on chrome
Thump if it ain't Kamikaze or Trap Muzik then I don't put it on
When I'm on the court call my pacman, yell out that I got that dro', watchin for that po'
You can get that Jag for a hundred but I'm givin' out the ounces for fo', let a nigga know'
Call me the rain man from the place where they gang bang
Where them thangs bang, and the brains hang, where we gotta main-tain
Can I cutt and hit it girl, come on let me get it get it girl
I love the girls from New Orleans, to ATL, to St. Louis, and the ""the Windy City"" girls
Blow fire man, when that hoe slide down the pole like a fireman
Smoke dro so fire we could throw it at the wall it stick like spiderman
'Cause you messin with the 'icky, hit the tip up in the alley for the fifty
Steady ballin in the club sippin moet and crissy, come on y'all kick it with me
Why, cause it ain't no thang man, Twista gone chop that change man
'Cause I'm number one on Billboard with a bullet but I ain't gone change man

Just to get from the curse
Like shit to get you rich at first
So put your dick in the dirt
That's why I don't gotta be the greatest of all time
As long as I keep it real in my rhymes I'm fine
I ain't lying
Give me mine and I'm satisfied
I'm just happy I got to make before my daddy died
And all things considered
Everytime destiny calls I can deliver
Not illa a young heart wit a old soul
Some hot holes and a cold flow
And as far as keepin' it real go
Home when you need me
Don't forget the proper way to greet me
Ay when you see me, salute me like a general I'm leading the troops

Refuse to give up, your mistakes don't define you
They don't dictate where you headin', they remind you
That time keeps tickin', let your mind keep clickin'
Never stop thinkin', be aware of your decisions
And beware of the collisions
And the potholes hidden in the road that you travel on your lifelong mission
Just listen everyday like a snap shot is taken, if you live you could learn to be great, be patient
Chorus (John Legend)
'Cause life is like a slide show
All the places I go
And all the things that I know
Through all the highs and lows
'Cause life is like a slide show
And all the things that I've seen
And all the things that I dream
You can't take away from me
'Cause life is like a slide show
Verse 2 (T.I.)
'Cause when I look back at a fly young cat
Who could rap with a dream, look where I took that
Beginning on bankhead, then I spread out
Vision in my head, all I had to do is get it out
When I walked out of my house, and look at my street
All I see is the opportunity that led me to truancy
I ain't really have a role model to enforce me
Uncle (someone?) they said next its gunna be you in it
As a juvenile count cases so fluently look at my life and learn from it, don't do it
If I only knew back then what I know now, how much better life it would have been if I had slowed down
Maybe I'd have been Kanye, instead of seeing gunplay
But god got a plan, I'll understand one day,
One day of life like a snap shot is taken,
If you believe you could make it, have faith, be patient
Chorus (John Legend)
'Cause life is like a slide show
And all the places I go
And all the things that I know
Through all the highs and lows
'Cause life is like a slide show
And all the things that I've seen
And all the things that I dream
You can't take away from me
'Cause life is like a slide show
Bridge (John Legend)
Looking back on my life time
See the slides go by, trying to wonder why
Looking back on where I've been
I remember when, you remember
Chorus (John Legend)
'Cause life is like a slide show
All the places I go
And all the things that I know
Through all the highs and lows
'Cause life is like a slide show
And all the things that I've seen
And all the things that I dream
You can't take away from me
'Cause life is like a slide show (3x)
I see, I dream, life is like a slide show"
122,Sorry,2012,Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head (2012),Hip Hop,T.I.,"My cup runneth over with Pinot Grigio, hold up
You bogus in the lambo if you ain't lifting the door up
You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin' the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up
For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Ay, nevermind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say
My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot
Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it
Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet?
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude
While you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die
But find a nigga with more hustle than me I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemar
It's my time to shine so fuck y'all
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker
I get that why I don't trust a motherfucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother
Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her
I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over
It's nothing, you numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fuck it, justify your action by stacking your dough up
You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up
Switch the flow up, cause these niggas be snitchin' so much
I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee, and donut
Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100
Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50
'Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What it ain't, what it is?
Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche
Feeling like I'm going off a course
Cut these fuck niggas off
Nigga Tip in my life, scream that till I'm hoarse
Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles,
Bitch you ain't really got a choice
I'm living my life live yours
I don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the word come to me
Talk to me sideways nigga that's your ass
Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma
Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner
And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours
I hated all the attention so I ran from it
Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that I did
Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again
'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost
That's that dope, I mean, I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Her baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault
Too much pressure, I fell off, I'm sorry
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do
Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance
This, this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good
It's boring - boring?
Really?
When I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe and
Told so many lies, don't know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said
She said lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up
I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest
But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes
Ooh, you are so fucking fine
I woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind
Ooh, who pulls your ponytail
Who knows your body well
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?"
123,Stand Up,2004,Urban Legend (2004),Hip Hop,T.I.,"(Lil Jon)
Check this out my nigga (what's up) theirs a lot of niggas out here
That got a lot of shit to motherfuckin say (yeah)
But when a nigga bring it to them niggas (what's up)
They can't stand up for what they motherfuckin said
(Naw I ain't say that, he said that) Stand Up
If you got something to say my nigga, stand up for what you said... my nigga
Tell them niggas bring it to the square nigga
Stand up... If you don't like what I'm saying then buck
Swang when you see me, we can throw them hands sucker
Stand up... If you ain't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck
If I said it, then I meant it, and what fuck nigga
Stand up... You don't wanna see the triggerman man buss
Hit you and your man's up, make it hard for a nigga to... stand up
Tell your crew they don't want it with us dudes
And if the motherfucka do, bust a motherfuckin move... stand up
(T.I)
You got a alligator mouth and a hummingbird ass
Your mouth writin' checks that ya ass can't cash
One forty-five and I'm outta ya weight class
Wanna survive... better scramble like eggs and break fast
'Cause I know how to handle ya fake ass
I'm ride on ya, and hide ya in yesterday's trash
Pull up in the chevy spraying rounds through the glass
See you laying face down in the grass and I laugh
Ha... that's the end of the soga
The end of my problems, nigga mash the impala
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
And that's the end, checkmate, game over, I'll holla
Now I'm telling ya potna, you don't know whatcha doing
Don't recognize the trouble ya getting into, and ya ruined
Dig this man... I spent my childhod in a wild hood
And all that gangsta shit ya talking, yeah it sound good
But make it understood, you gonna have to show me
I'm a OG, you wanna overthrow me
(Trick Daddy)
Dearly beloved, we gathered here today to marry this young nigga
In his own special thug way
Do you promise to love and respect, all of the real niggas
And when the problem come, learn to deal with'em
Do you swear to turn the chopper on any motherfucker in ya path
Or any bitch, that's tryin' to stop ya
And do you promise to keep'em handy, and don't hand'em
To nobody, nobody except family and keep'em cocked and loaded
And don't expose'em to nobody unless somebody want'em in his body
To love and cherish'em from his trigger to his barrel
From the bottom of ya heart, to death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live the life by him, is to sell ya soul
And Lord knows you gonna die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Sheed... all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the wild wild west
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
'Cause they ain't never seen or cocked beamed a milli fourteen
Or tommy gun, with a hundred round fucking gun
(Lil Wayne)
Sheed... I'm talking about riding out tonight
Only way I die first, gotta kill me in this verse
Weezy F, middle finger to life
So nothing seem critical, in the hood I'm typical
Yeah I'm feeling good and spiritual
Healing hoods with shit up outta my kitchen
I'm pitching it, it's really good
Smoking, drinking I'm like a fish and I'll probably
Shit on ya bitch, probably piss on her lips
And she'll probably give you a kiss, nasty
Holly grove classic, parley with a nigga, prolly rob the same bastard
Ask him, we don't give a fuck about a casket
Nigga this the murder cappy, niggas just murder happy
Twelve years old, I jumped off the pot
I started selling rocks, right after I got shot
I had to hold my weight down
Pussy nigga stand up or lay down"
124,Stand Up Guy,2006,King (2006),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Ay, I know you done kicked it with a lot of niggas before
But ye ain't never kicked it with a nigga like me, though
(Hey, Hey)
I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because the rocks gon' glisten and the drop's on 20's
Bend it over, let it drop if you wanna roll wit me
I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because it don't get better, niggas don't gett cheddar
Like that fella in the yellow Purple Label silk sweater
Bitch, stones keep glowin' on my wrist like whoa
And she can't stop lookin,' I know ya bitch like those
And she chose, ain't no question if the bitch might blow
Just get her to the crib, get her whole back sore
I'ma blow my dro, I'ma pop my pill
Ask anybody, ""Wanna take a shot? I will""
Might see me in a different color drop hot wheel
With the top down low and the Glock concealed
I got mine high up, boostin,' racin' up the block, one mil
If the police try to chase me, you know they a done deal
I got skills, anybody wanna come test
Bet what's in this .45 be up in your chest
Yeah, I know ladies wanna kick it with a nigga so fresh
Who could spend 100k any day, no stress
The watch's insane, the chains is grotesque
Stay still if you wanna, like he ain't earn cash
I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because the rocks gon' glisten and the drop's on 20's
Bend it over, let it drop if you wanna roll wit me
I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because it don't get better, niggas don't get cheddar
Like that fella in the yellow Purple Label silk sweater
If you got a man and you're tired of being there
And done gave him too many chances and tired of being fair
I offer you the opportunity to ride with a playa
You, me and a couple of freaks in the ride with a playa
Nevermind those outside when they stare
'Cause the chrome 24's on the ride give a glare
Because it's one guy and you decided to share
As long as you having the time of your life, who cares?
Man, we all sinners, what matters is in the center
I know God see my heart and I'm a stand up nigga
You can't beat me 'cause ye ain't man enough nigga
I look him in the eye and tell him, ""Man up, nigga!""
You really getting money? Throw a grand up, nigga
Wanna fight? You should've hit me when you ran up, nigga
This Smith & Wesson hammer 'bout to slam, fuck niggas
Go and kick it with the hoes, throw ya hands up with 'em
I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because the rocks gon' glisten and the drop's on 20's
Bend it over, let it drop if you wanna roll wit me
I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because it don't get better, niggas don't get cheddar
Like that fella in the yellow Purple Label silk sweater
Niggas ain't know me 'cause I live so special
Try to stay low key but I'm still so special
Flat screen's in the floor, quarter mil' in the dresser
Jewelry box glowing like a long lost treasure
I'm chillin' with Vanessa, met a girl named Heather
Told her ""Hi, how ya doin'? Buy a drink? My pleasure""
Told her if she got a homegirl, go tell her
That I got a hard rug, I could go for whatever
She said that if Vanessa wanna touch it, just let her
She laughed out loud, shocked 'cause just met her
Bought the dro', get low, and its only one-fifth
And it's four pills left, do you wanna come with?
I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because the rocks gon' glisten and the drop's on 20's
Bend it over, let it drop if you wanna roll wit me
I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because it don't get better, niggas don't get cheddar

If I never fucked and I just fell in love
Or maybe if I never fell in love and I just fucked
I swear, man, shit was simpler when I was sellin' drugs
You ain't know me then though, ain't that what ya think
You was in the bed, I was trafficking the thing
Man after everything we will never be the same
Man I'm tired of tellin' lies, know you sick of playin' games
I remember you got a tattoo, put my name on it
Put you in a wedding dress with a train on it
I went and spent a whole mil just to go chill
In Miami, and I be damned if she don't know my love real
How dare you compare me to dude, girl chill
My piece so close up on it, you don't see what it is

And even if we end up here, I know it hard
I never love that way again, I swear to God
I be breaking down, you be playing hard
She chose to bid it all, watch how you play your cards
Now you runnin' 'round town with education hatin' broads
Going at me, got me hot, but hold up, how is they involved?
And you can't say that I ain't changed
Your whole life since we met that day
And when we get it right, God bless that day

126,Still Ain't Forgave Myself,2001,I'm Serious (2001),Hip Hop,T.I.,"(Singing)
[T.I. Talking:] Still ain't forgave myself... damn
It's a lotta fucked up shit that go down man...
You don't even know the half...
Man I been in and outta trouble since an adolescents
Spoiled rotten, dead fresh, wit no daddy present
I got two uncles, Quint and Man and they keep me straight
7 and 8, I'm countin' money while they movin weight
My daddy send me clothes and always tell me come and see him
I say aiight but still I feelin' like my momma need him
They sendin letters home from school, nobody read mines
And plus my uncles, doin' 10 years F.E.D. time
Then I started rebellin, began crack sellin
Tha littlest thang on the corner wit a Mac 11
After school I hear my momma holla homework
I say aiight ma, but look I got my own work
Started interactin wit fiends at the age of 13
Now my momma findin rocks in my socks, glocks in my toy box
Like damn, why do trouble come to me like this
But on the real, it ain't even have to be like this (fuck)
Mistakes made on this road to wealth
I still ain't forgave myself
Ay, what I am today
I made myself but I still ain't forgave myself
For runnin' to the grave getting closer to death
I still ain't forgave my self
For anyone who ever wondered how I felt
I still ain't forgave myself
At 14 man, thought I knew everything
I'm slangin slabs, trappin hard, movin heavy Cain
I bought an '85 cutlass on some dane-a-danes
Now I'm the shit, huh, the motor blew in 30 days
Hardheaded man I ain't listen to anything
I'm getting money so, I'm right and I got plenty game
Besides why I need school, I'm'ma be rappin' momma
If that don't work, then I guess I'm'ma be trappin momma
But hey I promise I'm'ma make it 'cause I'm damn good
I'm'ma get us out this hood and off these can goods
School just a white man game, and it's ran good
At 16, here's my introduction to manhood
Blue lights behind me, damn what I'm gonna do
'Cause I got 2 pounds of weed and a 3.80 too
I guess everything'll be aiight if I just keep it cool
How ya doin' officer, what ya mean why I ain't in school
Can you search the car?? Yeah but, I rather that you didn't
Besides it's just a waste of yo time cause ain't nutthin in it
[Laugh] I guess that's when I seen, that I ain't know shit
When stuck in a place wit freedom I ain't gone get... (Damn!)
Mistakes made on this road to wealth
I still ain't forgave myself
Ay, what I am today, I made myself
But I still ain't forgave myself
Guess these the chances ya take, when dealt the cards I was dealt
But I still ain't forgave myself
For anyone who ever wondered how I felt
I still ain't forgave myself
Outta all the niggaz I was wit when I was doin' wrong
3 in the fed, 1 doin' life, and 2 dead and gone
Knew there was more to life than sellin blow and chopper bustin'
But what's the good in knowin' better if I ain't tell 'em nutthin
I knew I coulda told Cap not to kill shawty
Put down the gun, get in the car let 'em live shawty
You'll probably get locked up, and I'll probably have a deal shawty
Naw, I ain't scared, I'm just telling ya like it is shawty
Coulda told Endae, Quint, and Kern, man ya covers blow
Leave that country town alone, y'all needa come back home
Bankhead and J-Rue, I just feel like if I was wit 'em
They woulda never got killed that night if I was 'em
Seem like I coulda done mo', said mo'
Why all my partners gotta be dead or in the fed fo'??
All the time, I just wish that y'all could ball wit me
Sometimes at night I close my eyes, and dream that y'all wit me (damn.)
And even though they say I can't blame myself
I still ain't forgave myself
For all the mistakes made on this road to wealth
I still ain't forgave myself
What I am today, I made myself
But I still ain't forgave myself
For anybody who ever wondered how I felt
I still ain't forgave myself
And yeah they say I can't blame myself
But I still ain't forgave myself
Fo the mistakes made on this road to wealth
I still ain't forgave myself
Guess this the chance that you take, when dealt the cards I was dealt
But I still ain't forgave myself
For anybody who ever wondered how I felt
I still ain't forgave myself (Ain't Forgave myself)

Yeah, for anybody who ever wondered how I felt
Anybody who ever wondered what's wrong wit me, here it is...

This song is dedicated to everybody who ain't here wit me

Ay yo, I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even gotta question?
Hermes Pastelle, I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess I should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on the track, I asthma attack it
Why he's so mad for, why he got a habit?
'Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master

Can't wear skinny jeans 'cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans cuz my knot's so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps, it's the road to success
Where the niggas know you thorough and the girls say yes (Yes)
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
School of Hard Knocks, I'm a grad

Dipping different rovers, whippin' with the soda (Hova)

Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
And when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than a swagger, dagger all metal
And my jewels, blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha, what the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?

Ay, you go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kan-yeezy for diversity and me for controversy
On my verses, picture perfect; on that spittin,' serve a purpose
Ye ain't livin' what you kickin,' then you worthless
Looking from the surface, it may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off 
Blast off and have outstanding qualities
Sell a lot of records, I respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats, I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

'Fore the rappin', they what trappin, tell y'all they be out there grindin

They probably tried to come in the hood and sell weed
Think it's all good till they run into some real G's
Holla, tell us where it is and I promise we'll leave
Hesitate to say and boy them Llama will squeeze
Please, pay attention to this part of the book
One time, got robbed, got shot, got shook
Got a job, start rhymin, came up with a hook
Got a chain and some tats, came up with a look
Went and made a hit record, talk tough in the book
Fuck the image and perception, they never tough as they look
They some motherfuckin suckas, put it on whatever

We can play it how you wanna play it
Better go 'head 'fore that pistol be aimed at yo' head
All the way down here where you gon' lay

Yeah, PSC nigga, Aye, Aye
All hail Atlanta's own, owner of Atlanta's throne
If he ain't want no trouble he just shoulda left the man alone
This the scene shown and evident Atlantas known
The king's been the one representing all of Atlantas zones
Back when niggas been representing Atlanta wrong
Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on
The big screen, then hit every trap and traveled on
Past, present to Texas to Alambama strong
Down in Miami, up to Louisiana homes,
From the Carolinas, Virginia, to David Banner's home
I'm well connected haters, best to mind ya manners homes
I got a nickel-plated 38, but hey the hammer chrome
And it shine like ya should set the phatom on
In it see me riding, getting blown like a saxphone
Hey shawty spitting shit it takes to put a candle on
If I ain't on ya tube dude, you must got ya channel wrong
I'm the king of the south, there's is none flyer
Sucker MC's outta call me sire, ya songs ok, but I'm on fire
24 inches on my rims and tires
I'm the king of the south, there is none flyer
Sucker MC's outta call me sire, you was on top
But I pass right by ya, I will not stop, I won't retire
I came, I saw, I conquered (ok) with no big names
No fame, no celebrity sponsors
Just the game and a flow that was bonkers
Nigga front if ya wanna, I dead niggas like the bitches from ""Monster""
Now you been told, so don't say I ain't warn ya and don't
Let it alarm ya, when ya leaking, and the reapers upon ya
See dopeman and I'm creepin' upon ya, say that I ain't the king
But you just sour, you ain't think of it aren't ya
All the hating, is no time to respond to, I miss tryin' to conjure up
A way to get experience and launder, hey I thought ya record company
Con ya in to signing a deal shy of a mill 'cause they really ain't want ya
Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own ta ya
So it's time to move on to real estate, and get cake selling bigger stakes
I'm king of the south now, but there's fifty states
'Cause I'ma spread out and I'll eliminate who in the way
I'm 24 today, give to I'm 28
I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state
See I bend just to win, but I ain't finna break

But still I ball like no tomorrow

I'm sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat, than with me they join
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishing it was this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone
High stepping prime time
Thought you niggas been on
Ain't no blocking my shine

Your staring straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah, you're late, your train left.
Mascara and egg smear on your face
Night's over, goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known I was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's coming up after I blindfold her,
She still comes back to my crib,
Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But I won't buy her a soda
Unless it's rock 'n' ride cola.
Buy you a bag of fritos, I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Try'na pull 5 bucks from me is like try'na pull 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch, you're already bi-polar...
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote
The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with
But don't get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Your life is sure a bitch
But she know I'm rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in
Peso, Euro, Yen, ah ha, I'm paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearing any chain
Never gon' see me toting anything
All you gon' see is BANG!
It's so nice where I kick it,
Hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level
But you niggas still can get it
It's all over 'fore you finish
Sorry bro, this road, we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business
Yeah I guess life is a bitcha, ain't it, TIP?
And this one can say this shit
Shirt off my back, I wouldn't give you the dirt of my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now,
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time in it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe-S on it, dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant, well, I guess I'm wrong
But if you gon' tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs
You can get the ""F"" on dawg
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I'm as strong as they came
They were gone 'fore they came
Now I don't wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty, that's why
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold

135,The Greatest,2004,Urban Legend (2004),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Diamonds in my bracelet shine like a Kodak flash
Just motivation for these freaky hoes to show that ass nigga
I pop tags on a throwback fast
Nigga please, I'm wearin' these when I cut my grass... freeze
All you niggaz wanna touch my cash
The 40 cal's in the stash, and when I touch I blast
Televison's in the dash, suede roof in the coupe
I'm the one nigga, young niggaz knew it's the truth
And the dumb niggaz I ain't done provin' it to
Come with a clique of guerillas like I hung at a zoo
I gotta bitch to pull bitches like she one of the crew
Now a buncha broads in the back bustin' it loose
Do it free for me and charge you a hundred or two
Top floor in the presidential with a wonderful view
Yeah I'm rich, but I ain't just talkin' I live like this
You couldn't get water out the faucet as clear as my Cris
(Hook {Mannie Fresh and TIP})
Pimpin' y'all ain't heard that latest?
Ay it's the best of the best
Young pimpin' on a record with Fresh
I drive Chevys, fuck Mercedes
Hopped out the new CL V12, got in the blue SS
And I'm leavin' witcha ladies
I got a beautiful bitch, pursuin' ya bitch
Next thing ya know, ya losin' ya bitch, pimp
Y'all niggaz give it up I'm the greatest
Ay, I'm the greatest, ay, I'm the greatest, ay
Pimpin' I'm the greatest
It's been a long time since you seen a nigga like me
In a pair of Gucci sneakers, jeans and a white tee
Extravagant and outa control, I might be
But I'm makin' 50k on the road a night G
Rocks in my ring, big as cubes in ya ice tea
I used to dream 'bout a Benz now I own like 3
I gotta wine-colored V, with the wine-colored V
And reclined leather seats, I ain't lyin' on my beats
You can tell I'm gettin' money how I shine in the streets
Blowin' on the best pine you can find in the streets
Rappers wastin' they time if they trying to compete
They records sales declinin' when mine hit the streets
I got the fine freaks starin', 'cause my time piece glarin'
When the light hit the carrats, got they eyes lookin' Chinese
You'll run yourself raggedy tryna out shine me
No matter whatcha do, you're 2 steps behind me

A smooth attitude enable me to ball outrageous
Nigga fuck you paid me, I'm all outta favors
What Grand Hustle got ain't a motherfucker gave us
A motherfuckin' thing, but ain't a motherfucker played us
You gotta mil' that's a small percentage
The way ya record deal structured, you only get a small percentage
I gotta Magnum with a magnum in it
Playstation and a plasma in it
Sittin' on 20 inches and it's tinted
Gotta hemi nothin' faster than it
The 50 Gs'll pass you in it, get real
Gotta Chevy more expensive than that Jag you rented
Excuse me, but let Young Pimpin' brag a minute
Gotta bottle of Louie and a flock of groupies hotter than Rudy
Lickin' me dry when I get out the jacuzzi
They eatin' pussy, suckin' dick until they mouth got gooey
Can't another young nigga in the south outdo me

Yo, ay, huh-ay
I gotta love my man here engineerin (okay)
It don't take me too long to write it (uh, huh-ay)
How long it take you to record me baby? HEY! (huh-ay)
Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it
(It's all good man, we gon' ride on these fuck niggaz anyway though)
Ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it
Don't play with yourself nigga (okay)
Play a lotto nigga (okay)
Hey - let's get it! (Yeah fuck nigga, AY!)
(Chorus: T.I.)
Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it
I keep it real - ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it
Ya ain't crunk, ya ain't buck, ya ain't hard, ya ain't G
You ain't got what I got pumpin in your heart, you ain't me
You do all that yellin', holla, ya ain't real and ya ain't 'bout it
Ya ain't serious, ya ain't crazy, you know you don't wanna die
Ya ain't hustle from the bottom, you don't got it like I got it
You can hate and you can lie but pussy nigga I'm the hottest.
(T.I.)
I'm the realer nigga in this shit, aside from all the business shit
I'm the nigga sucka niggas best to keep it pimpin' with
People say I start a lot of shit, I say I finish it
Thank God it wasn't no witnesses, I'd still be servin' sentences
Rap shit way more stressful that I love my other businesses
Thank God I'm a professional and scared I don't begin to get
Whether in a Phantom or the truck with all the kids in it
Still tote a hammer try me, man I hope you listenin
Your death gon' be elaborate, real fuckin' extravagant
I'm down to die myself to show you niggas I ain't havin' it
Had to kill your son and a few your mama had to get
And they were playin' dumb, we run in and ask where daddy at.
(Chorus w/ ad libs)
(Mac Boney)
I carry niggas on my back like a bookbag
Put the pistol in his hand and tell him shoot his ass
I pull a little file faster than them credit people
Yo' ass dead, that's why you probably seein dead people
The weapon with me's really lethal, yeah it scare people (oh my God)
I know off top that I'm gon' bust, that's why I dare people
And I won't dare cheat you, I fair-and-square beat you
Same time, same time's why I'm on that Grey Goose
Don't make me spray and let loose, 'cause I won't hesitate to
I heard one shot then heard two, jumped up out the truck like what it do
I got a fo'-5 on me and got a nine too
A nigga sayin' ""Mac Boney, we ain't shoot at you""
I say you sucker ass niggas better keep it movin
'Fore y'all boys be the ones I end up doin'

137,The Introduction,2012,Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head (2012),Hip Hop,T.I.,"I come apart babe, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sure, moving down the line
I come apart baby, but that's ok cause
Trouble man, don't get in my way
I'm just a hood nigga I ain't never had shit
Just a bad attitude and a bad bitch
Duffle back full of tools and a half brick
30, 40, 50 grand in the mattress
Living on the edge jus a habit dawg
I'm fucked up in the head I don't have it all
Ball like a dog push it to the limit
Bout my business trynna keep from letting pussy niggas in it
My priorities is follow, God first then the fam,
Then the hustle, then the money, failure ain't in the plan
Satan on my heel he don't want me to advance
I tell him go to hell sucka catch me if you can
Shit I am who I am, fresh up out of apologies
Sometimes I ain't get in trouble trouble got in me
Guess it follows me but I stays on my hustle man
Still the motherfuckin man you can call me, Trouble Man
Trouble man, I always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man
Trouble man, I always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man
Drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll, ho you know how I roll
Just left the crossroads, my soul, unsold
Frigerated console, the curtains on my car door
Raw ho, caviar, sushi and escargot
Everywhere I go fresh to death and clean as a bar of soap
Getting blowed like trumpets in the wind in Chicago
God knows I'm hot as El Diablo
Wrist rockier than Colorado off-road
Also my flows I'm taking back although
My art's so Leonardo Da Vinci Picasso
The rain gone come down on your head like tarp holes
I guess these other rappers that's cool as far as soft goes
Sorry Charlie party's over shorty shop closed
King home, bank roll on King Kong
Got these suckas in my scope with the beam on
Prayin' for my downfall you can dream on
Make sure I'm back in the Maybach gettin' my lean on
Trouble ain't changed me, role model ain't me
Don't be angry now if I'm on the same street
Make a U turn haven't you learned I'm, Trouble Man
Trouble man, I always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man
Weight on my shoulders chose to squat with it
Real niggas say I kick it the same way Pac did it
Tell all them sucka nigga what the bizz is
Upset 'cause they can't do they thang like he did here
Shit, another year another deal done
No chump change big bank millions
Ya, my money old but I'm still young
Them nigga lookin' for some drama I'm a give 'em some
No more beef a pimp will say goodbye to red meat
But cross a nigga path and your dead meat
Remain on my gang time, after time
'97 college bass head, 99 dime
'98 have provisions on 2-85 flyin
Skip where you meet KP and L.A Reid got signed
Cut to the present and the rap game mine
Some things never change it remains I'm, Trouble Man
Trouble man, I always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man"

139,Told You So,2006,King (2006),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Grand Hustle Pimp...
Hey, what's happenin' shorty?
Me being a true player and all
I mean you know as a stand up guy you know
I really hate to say I told you so
But, man I told you so
Back when we said we were goin' to run this shit man
When we said Pimp Squad Click, Grand Hustle was the business
When we said their was a whole 'nother side of Atlanta
Another bunch of muthafuckers in the trap, y'all didn't know
Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't supposed to blow
Because I was rappin' about movin' O's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
Nigga, I told you so
I said the future right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so
Way back when Kriss-Kross was hollerin' ""Jump"" on your tube
They was still gettin' jumped at school, we used to tote them tools
Don't get me wrong I'll give respect to them dudes
But approach us wrong, and we'll smoke them fools, ain't no joke it's the truth
Fuck a hater, let 'em do what it do
I'm busy now, but I'll be through in a few
And then I'm comin' for you
So keep shit talkin' like it's somethin' to do
I'll spend a 100 grand get a killer somethin' to do
I been hustlin' since 92' when I heard UGK
Hollerin' ""Pocket Full of Stones"" I was on my way
Had a history in the yay, before I started to trap
13, let me take you back farther than that
When my uncles was baggin' blocks, used to count the stacks
I was only 8, and my grand-daddy can vouch for that
And my pops had alot of work, alot of folk he got 'em work
And ran numbers, said if he ain't wanna, he ain't gotta work
Why I sold rocks, I guess I got from pops
My uncles ??? man ??? a chip off the old block
The nigga you hear now the same one from off the old block
Who used to stand on Front St. and get off the old block
Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't supposed to blow
Because I was rappin' about movin' O's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
Nigga, I told you so
I said the future right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so
I remember the P$C, Mr. Mike, David Banner and me and Young Bloods
Ran through Atlanta with heat, when even Atlanta was sleep
Nigga, back before you heard of me
I was middle man into servin' keys when KC was serving 3
I'm on top because I deserved to be
So simmer down, calm your nerves at least
Speak your words with peace
Before you lay out on the curb deceased
Think about it, it's absurd to beat
I took my songs to street
He told me dope boy was the bomb in the street
Since then, my name rang like alarms in the street
Who knew how long it would be
If only LA knew how wrong he could be
I told you ain't nobody stronger than me
Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't supposed to blow
Because I was rappin' about movin' O's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
Nigga, I told you so
I said the future right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so
This southern rap shit of the day is something I helped design
Puerto Rico of the mix show I'll let you know who the next in line
The Snowman, Paul Wall, the Thug?
Alot of other niggas shouldn't of even been signed
That's a opinion of mine
Because these niggas be neglectin' the grind
Ain't waitin' on nobody to let me shine, I'm a go get me mine
And then they wonder why they checks behind
Cause TIP was 20k? Back in the day, need me to press rewind
What be on these niggas mind? Man don't get me to lyin'
I seen your kind, dopeboy, and that ain't even you kind
Ain't never sold a gram of crack, and ain't no need of your tryin'
Back in the trap, pimp I don't see him survivin'
Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't supposed to blow
Because I was rappin' about movin' O's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
Nigga, I told you so
I said the future right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so"

141,Touchdown,2007,T.I. vs. T.I.P. (2007),Hip Hop,T.I.,"[E] When we touch down
(Chorus: E = Eminem; T = T.I.)
[T] In the midwest we okay
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass
[E] Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana
Mississippi, Ten-a-key, every mufuckin state, when we touch down
[T] Go right from the plane to the rave
[E] When we touch down
[T] On a private plane getting brains, till we
[E] Touch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady baby, we bout to incite a riot
When we touch down
(1st verse: T.I.)
When we get in town, you know how we getting down
Pull up clean, then hop on out, snatch all the freaks then walk on out
I'm living what they talking bout, shining if it dark or not
That one hundred E-X-double R, you'll find that in the parking lot
You barking up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three
Four, five and six as well as one, Atlanta I'm forever son
Still be on whatever coast, ridin' blowing heavy smoke
Ay Em you better tell them folk what hell it take to let 'em go
They know I put that green light on them haters
Keep on trying me I put that beam right on ya tater (pow)
Now you don't wanna see T.I.P. outrageous
Try to keep him in a cage but somehow he keep escaping
That's why I be on vacation, Virgin Island I be taking
Private planes out to Spain, I keep on flying I ain't faking
The money ain't a thang, think I'm lying, you're mistaken
You can find long lines of all kinds of bitches waiting when we touch down
(2nd verse: Eminem)
Welcome to the Midwest, yes
Where them Detroit playas ball like you have no idea
The more is here, got the whole place looking like it's candy painted
Ain't it like we left the kids at home and just let 'em loose with the crayons
Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people looking like Frogger
They hopping out of the way whenever they see Marshall's car coming
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
And let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumping but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flying through the air looking like they krumping
The way they tumbling, I gotta do something
But as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off
They just right back at it tomorrow
They're like, ""Dad this is in, so you're with the trends""
""This is for the pens, listening to mens, nail polish on the rims""
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show
So go on with ya bad self, just have it back to normal when I touch down
(3rd verse: T.I.)
From my arrival, un-till my departure
Gurantee I put this d-i-c-k in somebody's daughter
Ay, I still have my way with the ladies way cross the water
Flew to Paris from Haiti, did some shit that I thought of
It's erotic that the shit that we popping makes us psychotic
Threat the corpse for America, then why they running from me?
How could they be so ignorant? Look what hip-hop done brung us
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys
Got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here ain't no way you taking it from me
So excuse me Oprah honey, I'm sorry, really I promise
But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just being honest
For that am I being punished? Why is you so astonished?
Now I ain't got a degree, just intelligence in abundance
So you ain't gotta like me, I know billions of folks who love me
You can tell how they yelling and screaming and waiting for me when I touch down"

(Repeat 8x)
(1st Verse)
Welcome back to the trap
Niggas back in the trap
Wit another heavy chevy
Big dope boys and trap
All you rap niggas role out
I trap when it's cold out
Whack niggas flyin
But I stay down to I'm sold out
Cause down a hundred ground
Like a rapping in a dope house
Man wherever I be
The feds got me scoped out
Mother fucker let my nuts hang
Block out the duc canes
Cook it to it bubbles
Doulble fast as a mustang
I know you think you fuck man
But little showty tuff man
Been a long time
Since a nigg from Alanta
Spit this nuts game
That's a very few of real niggas
So how could they give nigga
The feelin' that a real nigga
Would get around a real nigga
All they do is still niggas ideas
And rhythm wit em
Holla sumthin similar
Talking 'bout the hood
Like they hung in em
I got a million rhythms
Want 'em come get em
What bitch you pussy nigga
I'm just havin' fun wit em
(Chorus repeat 8x)
Still telling niggas
I ain't wholing I ain't crolling
When the 12 hit the corner
I ain't brolling I ain't rolling
Keep the coat stretch out
Like Carl Louis Hamstring
Stepped on like I'm working
With the damn thing
Drible baby ain't seen
What I do to a ounce of doe
A whip man on my pager
Like I pay you folks
To whip somemoore
I'm doper than the fluid cellur
I flip it all up by myself
I give my niggas recipes
So they can turn to sumthin else
They love to work
That's why I keep 'em comin'
Like conlasions plate
We flip the cake
We move this shit from Georgia
Baby state to state
Attemadate
Niggas in the city
Who've been moving weight
Nobody losing weight
They fuck with us
'Cause you've been known to hate
Demonstrate
The way we turned the trout
Out in '98
Sarted out in '95
Started out with nicks and dimes
Niggas you done lost your mind
Thinking you could set up shop
Pimpin' I respect the game
Lets take this to another block
(Chorus repeat 8x)
(Outro talk)
(Outro verse)
Pimp squad
Showty still in the trap
When I spot a scene hot
With the man name Jon
And the collad green pot
On alot of straight hen
And alot of green pot
Compation in a range
Like he gotta be stop
Well maybe I will be
But probably not
Oh what the blood cloak
You try to knock 'em out and he sock
Listen to me I'm serious
Thinkin' how did he not
End up way up
On the top of Detroit
If come where I was
You gotta be pop
And if you really want to pop
And I rather be dropped
Listen pops
Want to know a little more
About rap
Firts rule this is real
It ain't just a record deal
It's a trap

My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin', wonder when it's gonna cease
Choppa hitchu on the side and create a slow leak
We can end the speculation 'cause today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I giva fuck about the feds investigation on me

Ready for the gun play, prepared for a fistfight
Run up on your bitch and ask her what that pussy hit like?
At first she actin' funny, but in a minute I knew she'd get right
Get down, got her fuckin' with another bitch now
I'm king of all ice so remember this tip town
And you ain't ready pussy nigga better set it down
We mag night and rock steady nigga spittin' rounds
Turn ur stomach to spaghetti when you hit the ground
Toss the choppas in the chevy now we mashin down
Camilton, countin' all your benjamins and hamiltons
As far as I'm concerned your just a job for the janitors
Don't disregard I'm a guard you're an amateur
Hidin' behind your body guards and your manager
I pimp hard through all the pages in the calendar
Bitch is Pimp Squad, it's all action no cameras
You know what it is, You know what it is
You know what it is, You know what is is

From the westside where they say I be
The way I be, the ruler of all I survery I be
Laid back, Yay's back, Triple Kiwi Maybach
Weed match the benz, Cush triple kiwi'd 80 pack
Old school baby crack, I'm tryin' to bring the 80's back
Haitians give me hated crack, 'cause my momma hated crack
Till we got evicted and I came through and done ate his ass
Playa back, we rhyme we I live, I'm a zone 3 hustla niggaz know what it is
May we all bow our heads, and pray for this nigga
The undertakers comin' any day for this nigga
They hate um' in the hood, from the dreams he been sellin'
I read the paperwork and it seems you was tellin'
You know what it is, and you know who I'm talkin' bout
When the feds came, I didn't open up my mouth
What you scared for ???, niggaz know you've been a hoe
It was like homie, shit was all good just a week ago
Get the goons ready start up your vehicle
And shoot at any fuckin' car you ain't seen before
Pick up the shells, and we use an automatic
They gave 50 years to my nigga lil' travis
See I'm movin trap, and let um trip over the wires
And then he'll be layin', right by the preacher and the choir
Catch um before I do, T.I. go and handle your biz

(1st verse: T.I.)
Got a tool in my pocket and the club just rockin'
Watching ey' nigga while they girlfriend jocking
They gotta let it go because niggas already know
I got that thing with me and anxious to let it go
I'm trying to mind my business though, tell I hear this nigga say yo
""They ain't nobody, fuck em"" I'm thinking I'm fitting to buss em
Wait, look up and see these polices is lookin' at me
I tell C, he tell Doug, they tell Jay-Z
We proceed to surround 'em and call a squirrel meeting
Pick a perfect spot and make sure that they girl see
My man offered dude a drink, he said ""what? wuchu think?""
Then call from then on all you couldn't see nothin' but bottles
Remy Martin to the noggin, bet it bust it wide open
His bitch standing there hollering while he lying on the floor, shit
Why you feeling sorry for him? He asked for it
Listen y'all, here come the moral of the story.

Rap music is something ain't it? The way these pictures is painted
You swear these niggas is dangerous, the gangsta shit they be saying
Lock 'em up in the booth with a half ounce of that cannabis
Sit back, and watch the outlandish shit they portraying
But, soon as you see 'em they freeze up like in museums
Them statues, you like, ""Is that the dude, that said he was gonna...""(puuhn)
Niggas get running before you finish ya sentence
And then they back to riffing, when they off at the safe distance
You like, you was just here, you disappear like magicians
In thin air, I'm like ""Damn, nigga at least keep it consistent""
I hear you baiting me lately, I been doing my best just to stay hater free
Still watch what you say to me
Sooner or later I take you up on your offer
And put you all in ya place like I'm replacing ya father
You talking, to the author, the architect of The Blueprint
My DNA in your music, muthafucker you stupid?

'Cause I ain't never been a sucker, been gangsta my whole life
So a nigga disrespect me and it's on on sight
I hear what you say in your song, some of that I don't like
Keep it up, I feel tried, I see you, we gon' fight
Be a man, say my name if you talking to me
You never say it, well I figure you ain't talking to me
Find out you is at the awards or whether caught in the streets
I swear I beat ya fuckin' ass like it ought to be beat
See all that whispering lame, I ain't one for the game
If I say fuck you nigga then, fuck you nigga, simple and plain
I say no problem, there's no problem, pimping you do the same
Now you just, swallow ya pride 'cause you know I'm off the chain
Try to refrain from being violent but you come out ya face
I got my lawyer paid up ready to catch me a case
When I feel you disrespected me, I'm a get me a K
But all this shit can be avoided one way...

Maybe find a piece of God
Seen my whole life flash before my eyes
And now it's getting dark body temp drop
Going in shock prying out of fear close my eyes
Take my last breath and I'm out here
In my life I smoked a lot of weed
Drunk a lot beer sold a lot of keys
But that shit don't even matter here
Somebody said walk toward the light
But I ain't not ready to go
Am I dead is it over you ain't ready to know

And I know I been hearing bout y'all my life

To the time you pick your folks
To put us on the boat and enslave us
Worker that never paid us

And everybody else tried to come down here us
Killed my father that raised us
Kidnapped us from our country
Take your distance in our religional way
Well now it's time for the cadet to busted

Pussy nigga lye it down I'm walkin'
Thought hell kicking the devil doors down
Spreading rounds waving cadet rounds

BGizzzy, let's do it homie
Grand Hustle, pimp, Chopper City in here

I can give you what you want (want), T.I.P. the hottest (hottest)
Game withcha ya need, I can tell ya all about it
You can come up in the streets, but it ain't no gettin' out it
When I tell ya I'm a ""G"", pimp, I'm really being modest
I can tell ya 'bout the dope boyz, hoes, and the ballers
The pimps and the macks, real niggas wouldn't call us
Hanging in the traps, cause that's what our daddy taught us
From 30's on the 'lac, to a benz on broddas
Standin' on the corners, slingin crack and stacking dollars
Till it's time to cop a brick, and I'm tired of moving quarters
My daddy won't a doctor and my momma won't a lawyer
I ain't never had shit, congratulations is in order
Tryin' to get a mill for my sons and my daughters
If I caught a bad bitch with connections down in Florida
Said her daddy and her uncle, still gettin' cross the water
I'm richer now, I'd be a motherfuckin fool, if I don't call her
What it is my nigga, what it do (what it do)
I got a brick or two, I'm finna to buss a move (buss a move)
What it is my nigga, what it do (what it do)

It's like that, I dun been through the struggle
I'm running Chopper City, and fucking with Grand Hustle
(T.I)
I got the... eye of a tiger, and the heart of a bear
I'm the king of the jungle you can follow me there
Now you can... hear it from these niggas, who hardly was there
Or take it from niggas, who fought, and make it a scar to get here
Several years ago, I told myself that I solemnly swear
Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare
One reason why me and the other cats is hard to compare
'Cause I'm fact, that's fiction, it hardly compares
Being hated, part of the game, yes it's hard but it's fair
Well I'ma be the best hating nigga, see if I care
But just know, I'm raising the bar and I'm keeping it there
And I'ma still ride clean, throwing weed in the air
With two or three bad bitches, got they feet in the air
Say they like when I smack on they ass, and skeet in they hair
Listen... I don't care if you got the song of the year
Ya whole show shut down, if the ""Don"" appears"

'Bout the time you get to the bottom of that bottle
Puttin' out the last blout of that set
You'll have a full understanding of why the say I'm serious."
157,Why U Mad at Me,2004,Urban Legend (2004),Hip Hop,T.I.,"(T.I. Talking)
I got a question fo you hatin' ass niggaz out there, Ay
Why you mad at me, Ay
Oh lame ass nigga why you mad at me
Sucka ass nigga why you mad at me
Remember late nights earn stripes servin' straight white
Talk shit slap box clear into the day light
Might fuss may fight but stay tight
Keep what the ""J"" need for the lighter hit the base pipe
If the trap was the ocean or the sea
You could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
Befo a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
'Cause they knew Cap would kill a nigga fo blink twice
Day right I'm recitein my life
Nigga I was there no matter what through sirens on a silent night
Cold sundays slow mondays hot Friday nights
Tuesday thursdays servin' whether or not they ride tonight
On peaceful days hostful evenings even violent nights
Chip on my sholder hold a grudge cause you can die tonight
I swear you niggaz had no idea what my life was like
Befo the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic
Is it 'cause I came from the bottom to the top
Why you mad at me
Maybe 'cause I Spent a hundred on a drop
Why you mad at me
Is it 'cause I kept it pimpin' and stayed down
Why you mad at me
Or is it 'cause I am the a town
Why you mad at me
Is cause you a lame and I'm a ""G""
Why you mad at me
Is it 'cause I got love in the streets
Why you mad at me
Is cause you know yo time runnin' out
Why you mad at me
Is it cause you know I'm king of the south
Niggaz mad 'cause I got it like this
Gold on my wrist hoes on my dick, my dick
But I could give a fuck about this industry
I'm a be the same tip till the end of me
That's something you know automatically if you a friend of me
Question that will think other wise now you offend me
I came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy
Found them both now that niggaz in to me
Got little rap niggaz liking into me
Major lables and police want to censor me
Feds on my ass 'cause I'm in the streets
Think I still slang listen to lame niggaz who lie to snitch on me
It ain't my fault that you can't piture me
Ridein in a phatom and I swear I never favthom
All the fame that a nigga can gain from atlanta
Now I'm just tryin' to maintain for atlanta
Befo niggaz would say in atlanta
I was rhode park doug high stayed in atlanta
Now true enough I sold yay in atlanta
But is that compared to contributions I made to atlanta
A pick a reason any reason all excuses would do
But man you lucky I ain't buckin like I used to do fool
While you was throwin' one's and two's
I was liftin up tools and then
Shoot at his shoes just to see if he move
Or either bust at his head to check if he dead man
Don't talk around 'cause I heard he the fed's man
They offer him time and they knowin' he scared and tell him
Give me they names or you doin' the stretch man
Or wear a wire go record what he said
And then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man
A rat I'm smellin blow I ain't sellin
Where you got that impressin ain't no tellin'
Yes I'm a felon why was that in question
What about all these records I'm sellin
I'm bankhead born and bankhead bread
And when a nigga die I'm gone be bankhead dead"
158,Why You Wanna,2006,King (2006),Hip Hop,T.I.,"Hey T.I.P pimpin'
Hey shorty why you gotta act like that? I'm sayin'...

Can't help but notice how you glowin' I can see in yo face
Now I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing that you need yo' space
Selling niggas is one thing you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between yo' knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you makin', get yo' knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I gotta mansion and a gate, you wit me you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck wit 23's the case
600 Gz in the safe. How much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word we can leave today, this somethin' special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing makin' you sad makin' you stay
Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?

Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that... hey-hey.
Can he touch you like that, and make you make you feel like this
Holla if you came back and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest
Take advantage of what you concealing in your dress
What, he think he to fresh to show you that you the best
Compliment you on your hair and legs and treat you wit respect
Give you sex till you sweat, tongue kissin' on yo neck
It's been awhile since she got it like this I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
No, you confused ain't decided which way you should go yet.
So how you keep sayin' no when your panties so wet?
Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that... hey-hey.
This nigga playin' mind games man

Life is like a chess move, you need to make yo next move
Yo' best move, keep it pimpin' you understand... hey

My uncle gave me a bunch of work
And that shit were gone by the near morning
You wild nigga runnin' with me
I'm a sigh when under her
Dear body with none to see
That pills to play, with Jeff under her
I were 19 with two felonies
One of my best friend have a life sentence
And my other friend, would you light me
Having bought your pot, we're no longer living
All about that cocaine deal
And no education, no pot to piss in
Old school, on chrome wheel
We entertain it, pills stay hidden
That's the shit that I come from
In my heart, fear ain't none
Stand tall, I can't run from

Never talk down when I get home
Nigga's the type of nigga you can shit on
Unexpose, brick chrome
Guard body, big bone
That's hard body, Jim Jones
Nigga's know the sound on how we switch on him
Spend a while out when the tips on
Better make a toast, nigga, tip home
First get the bread, then get going
From the land of the land where they spit chrome
With most kids never get to live long
Get their pistols, get pissed on
Pistolwhipped and shipped, homie
Left for a minute and they switched on me
Caught them talking down, tryna bitch on me
And they snitch on me
They got shit, on me
So my guess is death is what they wish, on me
Blowing on them candles"

Remembering all of our conversations, they be reminiscing you
The good the day they low, could tell they don't know who they listen to
Today I watch Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you
I swear it's so unfair that I'm right here and you up there
I miss you so much and after the point I call your name but you not there
Now I can't rest and I can't do shit
Off my mind, I'm so upset
It wasn't your time to beat me there
Broke my heart to see you there
Shot with bullets that were meant for me, families never forgiving me
I knew, but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for living, I had to grow up
Slinging crack on the corner ain't quite the future you wanted for me
Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it? This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything I've known
Owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me, didn't graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me,
So long, I had this problem dog
Till we meet in person let's keep speaking through my verses for life
And you can tell everybody

Damn, has it been that long? (haha)
Say what happens since I been gone
They got the game all wrong, it's too pretty in here
Let's say we take it back to the trap one time
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know,
Yeah you know, yeah you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,
And we go, and we go (go)
In the middle of a fight, I'm so cool
Everybody wonder how I go through
All of this half of which would have broke you
Came out smelling like a rose even more true
Worldwide, bi-coastal, global, nigga's I respect
'Cause they more more closer
'Cause I get it don't mean they do too
'Cause I ain't got a damn minute ain't no 'tude
You know we never not goin' all in
Kickin doors over just to let my dogs in
So many rides never catch a nigga walkin'
In a G-5 tryna put a bunch of broads in
Then we landin' laughin'. chicks with fantastic asses
Extravagent habitats, if you never seen tragic happen (hey)
Make magic happen with cash I'm actually catchin magic
In the market for lavish mansions 'n' NBA expansions
I was passin out Phantoms in 04 so no, dough ain't shit to me
Way past respect you see, but I neva as big as a nigga felt a beat ya see
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know,
Yeah you know, yeah you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,
And we go, and we go (go)
So fly why would I wanna land for
Everything you could ask for and more
Your choice, you could even be a fan or
Hate to see a nigga get a hundred grand more
Bein' a motherfuckin' man, won't stand for
The rap wars, always goin' back and forth
Livin' in a blood killing like cancer
But when it rains, then it pours give a damn sure
In France, bonjour, merci, oui
The same people on tour, on TV
They signed him shoulda kept your receipt
Get a refund cause you sure can't see me
Who keeps CD's on repeat, stuck in MP3's for 3 weeks
At the gates on the day I was released
The only time you will ever see me free
Big money J, much as you can get for it?
Atlantic records say just make another hit for me
I tell 'em cut a hundred million dollar check for me
Like it or not, don't lose no respect for me
Never mind what I did, cause the best commin'
I'm the king in a game like chess to me
So put the cash in tha bag,
Give the rest to the attendant puttin' gas in the jet for a homie friend
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know,
Yeah you know, yeah you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,
And we go, and we go (go)
I got a new swag and it's a new day
Here we go again too, what it do 'J?
If you recall, I was the one who used to move yay
Now I gotta new Audemar with a blue face
Hoppin' up in G4 jet no suitcase, whole new wardrobe in a new place
Change clothes if a stain on my shoelace
T.I. roll like sushi, touché
If the king ain't back, who the hell am I?
Bringin' homocide to the gang, no alibi
Can't tell a lie to the judge, I'm guilty
Your Honor do you mind the guy tried to kill me
I could still be, in a trap now
AK 'round, little yay 'round
100k downstairs by the trey pound.
But if they wonderin who runnin' the A now?
(Yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know,
Yeah you know, yeah you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,
And we go, and we go (go)
Yeah you know that we ride
In control we don't stop
We gon blow where we drop
Let you know we on top
Girl we ride, man we roll, then you stop
And we go, and we go
Say we roll and we ride
In control we don't stop
We gon' blow where we drop

Green, brown, or blow, got mo snow than Buffalo in the winter
Think these lyrics is comin' from a pretender
If I said it I done seen it or done it
So I mean it when I say you don't want it
Done came a long way from jumpin' the hunnids (hundreds)
To baggin them quarters, doin' shows from L.A. to Flawda (Florida)
In Atlanta, I'm the law and the order, the king of it
Got a throne and a brougham and a ? that's chrome
Callin houses on the water my home, wit no mortgage or loan
If I live in it I bought it and own it
If I'm wit a bitch I caught her and boned it
No question, no less than a week and she's in confession
And I bought no necklace unless I'm investin'
No exceptions, I'll open ya closed session.
You ain't hard till you cookin' like this
You ain't mob till you fucked wit the click

We hustle from 6 to 6 to 6 again
Sell fat nicks for 10 till the bricks get in

And Sam Goody just hit us on the hip again
Got hot shit under our fits that'll pierce ya skin
And the click I'm in some made men, know dat
Got a deal now, but I was the shit befo dat
Totin steel now, but hold my own wit no gat

The heat is catchin up to niggas runnin' 4 flat
At the club gettin' crunker than crackers on Prozac
Say you got some dubs on the Lac? Well shawty where the vogues at?
T.I.P. ain't the shit? come on shawty, don't act

Some niggas wonder how I made it, I do what it takes
At school I was cool wit the nigga who threw a 22 in ya face
Took ya starter coat and choked ya till you blue in the face
Or you might know me as the nigga who fucked ya bitch and bust 2 in her face
Either way, I'm a winner like the 4 and the trey
You probably never held mo dough than I can blow in a day
Sometimes I'm wearin gold, sometimes I'm ridin' on it
Between us, I doubled up off my signin bonus
K.P. and Jay say ""Shawty, aye you goin' legit.""
But I ignored shit, when I scored a brick
I bet you never knew how quick 36 O's'll flip
Yeah I cook it till it bubble up, see how quick it double up
Competition's in trouble I'm supplyin the hood
Born, bred, when I'm dead, I'ma die in the hood

The day you get locked up and the day you go home
I know it feels like the world passin' you by,
Like shit happenin' every day out there that you don't know 'bout
Everytime you call home your baby momma show out,
And your partners don't even send you flicks from when they go out
But don't worry 'bout it or stress it, cause shawty know what?
The time'll do itself, all you gotta do is show up
Keep layin' down wakin' up,
And thankin' the Lord
And 'fore you know it they gonna open the doors
True story, just prepare yourself for it,
If you ain't got a plan what you need was a second chance,
Shit, you gonna blow it!
Learn and visualize what you try to do,
And do the time homeboy, don't let the time do you
They say the time just flew on the street,
Hard to believe from me never but you'll see soon as you on the street
I know the times seem long,
Just try and keep strong
Put on your headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes,
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes
Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missin' nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes
Probably thinkin' it's easy for me to say from here in the booth,
But they showed ya, they'd put me in there with you
Right now, locked down in the state of the fed, lay in the bed
Prayin' it's over and over as you say in your head
Yeah, next time I'm a be straight
Just count down to my release date... peace of cake
My nigga Kap right now, servin' a life sentence for a murder he committed,
In self defense
And in such good spirits, shawty ain't even trippin'
And I could be right in there with him, no bull shittin'
He on his ninth year now, just waitin' to get out
Got me thinkin' my shit ain't even worth complainin' about
'Cause it could still be worse for sho'
So you waitin' on me to lose ho, you got to kill me first
I talked to my nigga Big Meedge, had to tell him the
Streets miss him just as much as he miss the streets
Had to let him know whenever he released,
We hittin' the club like '03, this time it's on me
Yeah we laugh, reminisce for a minute and then I tell him
Just nobody ever did it as big
It'll never be the same in this city again, closest
You'll get is me and Jeezy and them
So dog, if it seems like you left behind, ten steps
Behind, just know it only gets better with time
I know the times seem long,
Just try and keep strong
Put on your headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes,
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes
Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missin' nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes
On Everything"

When I'm walkin' up, I'm bossin' up
And not even on purpose bruh
You talk too much, you soft as fuck
Your type I've seen it all too much
You don't want no boss, uh, and we knew it
And life for you or we make you cough it up, and keep going
I welcome you to danger zone
Now you continue on at your own risk
And I ain't scary shit cause when it's on, it's on
And I ain't gonna be backing down for shit
I'm ridin' chrome, going home with Hawaiian chick
I ran a major operation, you shit minor a bit
I walk like [?] designer cool cat around this bitch

Who fuckin' with fat boy, I traffic my body weight
So much cake in the club damn near caught me a fair case
My old school is running Gatorade in my Chevy
My money is safe, I'm runnin' last [?]
We barricaded in front, the waterfalls in the back
Enough crack for a month, you smell it all in my raps
Niggas wanna be famous, I want the luxury tax
Not one of my checks like my company facts
I'm pumpin' my gas comin' down Cleveland Ave
How much a nigga worth? Ho don't even ask
Ten mill with Diddy, I'm getting money with Tip
When you see me in the city then it's money we get
You can tell how I walk I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
You can tell how I speak I'm a king (I'm a king)
You can tell how I walk, you can tell how I walk

He in more shit, sure get the call he know
He go too far, twenty west he better holla at them
A nigga catch [?], Hustle Gang at ho
Say Trae The Truth gon' cut the fool, give 'em fifty to go
You the [?], we don't mention it though
Told you before who about that action but you weren't listening though
I'm in the BM got you [?]
She fucked 3 ho bust in her throat then she one homie proposed
We in the Lambo raising the dough
Acting like an Atlanta nigga never made it before
We actin like we never made it before
In case I ain't say it before, 2014
Till I got a.40 Cal and 2000 in my jeans, nigga
You can tell how I walk I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
You can tell how I speak I'm a king (I'm a king)

Two revolvers in my pocket pitchin' handlin' rocks

167,You Know Who,2006,King (2006),Hip Hop,T.I.,"All right man, y'all win
I won't say it, at least for this song, hey
Said they lookin' for the realest, well I'm real as it get
Rap to the nigga dealin' hard who live in the jects
Till some better nigga wit her, ain't delivered 'em yet
My mouth big, but I got a pistol bigger than that
I live and die by my respect so I honor the code
Peep niggaz who be out here flexin, stuntin for hoes
And if you ain't never chose to remember nothin' before
Just know the game is some you win, some you don't
But you already begin again, start, it go
Learn to shoot a pistol, flip a O, how hard it go
Man if you ain't ever heard of Pimp Squad before
You better ask a real nigga or a broad you know
Cause you ain't ready for the pros, get it outta ya brain
You in over your head, way out of your lane
I been sayin' I'm filthy rich and got it from caine
So would you say them niggaz know if they done got it the same, right?
Cause you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, goin' against us, too unfair
Cause everywhere you do a show, we got kinfolk there
And now you know I ain't no more, not a tinfolk there
It's you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, beef now don't you go there
And if you do, don't use our copy producers, he won't care
If he leave the hood alone, pimpin' he won't share man
I know you think you out there gettin' it in
But whatcha doin', I done did it once and did it again
I had a choice between runnin' while living in sin
He done settlin down, turnin' nine millin or ten
I give a damn if I never sell a million again
I gotta thank you a million for just lettin me in
But now I'm settlin in, gettin' used to the view
On top, won't stop till I'm huger than you
Gon flop? Who? Me, pimp you losin your screws
We gotta dope if you lettin niggaz shoot into you
You ain't ready for the shit I'm introducin to you
The roof in the back of the park ain't translucent as you
So now your nigga dressin up, man do what you do
I got style, pimp, it's more than just the suit and the shoe
This been proven, I'm the truth, stamp government seal
I'm what it is, these other niggaz just Southern with deals, for real"
