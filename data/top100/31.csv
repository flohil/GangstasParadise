0,Adam Lives In Theory,2002,MTV Unplugged (2002),,Lauryn Hill,"Adam lives in theory
Trying to turn stone into bread
Masquerading like he got it figured out
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt
Left to his devices, those worthless sacrifices
Praying to the alter of himself
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light, and no one else
He takes the unsuspected
'Cause he knows they're not connected
And he shows them how to be just as he is
Virtually real, and commercially appealed
To the lust of all the people where he lives
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual
Caught up in emotion
Burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitaion in the field
She handed him her virtue
'Cause he told her ""I won't hurt you""
So she lay with him to see how good it feels
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication
She brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplying
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good bread
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment
'Cause everything appears to be the same
They entertain suggestion,
Next time just use protection
Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote to their dilemma
Burning in their lust,
Both of them adulterous
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion,
They can't even entertain the solution,
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution
Hiding from the truth,
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation
When confronted, blamed his wife
Giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he done
Now if we can't agree with who created us to be
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified
Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you
Line upon line, every step upon pre-step, say goodbye,
To this decaying social system
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go
If we love him like we say we do,
He will try us
Just don't regress,
Or slip into hopelessness
Once he's satisfied his love,
He won't deny us,
And then he'll tell us,
What, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
And then he'll tell us,
What, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now"
1,Can't Take My Eyes Off You,1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
I need you baby and if it's quite alright
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say: ok (It's ok)
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, oh baby, let me love you, oh baby
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
I need you baby and if it's quite alright
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say: it's ok
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, oh baby, let me love you, oh baby
I need you baby, if it's quite alright
I need you baby, you warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say: it's ok
Oh, oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray

2,Doo Wop (That Thing),1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"Yo, remember back on the bully when cats used to harmonize like 
Yo, yo, my men and my women, don't forget about the Deen
The Sirat al-Mustaqim, yo
It's about a thing
Yo, yo, yo, if you feel real good, lift your hands up in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you and him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you really goin' to pretend
Like you wasn't down when you called him again?
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably [fuck] again
Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending him
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because of sin
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans, come again
Yo! A-when when come again 
When when come again 
My friend come again 
Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only, about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, popping yin (Like you got Yen)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by the waist men
Cristal by the case men, still living in his mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids
But they face a court case when the child support's late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men, the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
Unh unh come again
Yo yo come again
Brethren come again
Sistren come again
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Girls you know you'd better, watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Girls you know you'd better, watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing"
3,"Every Ghetto, Every City",1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"I was just a little girl
Skinny legs, a press and curl
My mother always thought I'd be a star
But way before the record deal
The streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill
Made sure that I never go too far
Every ghetto, every city, and suburban place I've been
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem
Story starts at Hootaville
Grew up next to Ivy Hill
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
""Kill the guy"" in Carter Park
Rode a Mongoose till it's dark
Watching kids show off the stolen ones
Every ghetto, Every city, and suburban place I've been
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got
Looking Back
Looking back, looking back, looking back
(Repeat)
Looking back, looking back, looking back
A bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu
Main street roots tonic with the dreds
A beef patty and some coco bread
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoe
'Member Frelng-Huysen used to have the bomb leather
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick were together
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever
Drill teams on Munn Street
Remember when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef
Moving Records was on Central Ave.
I was there at dancing school
South Orange Ave. at Borlin Pool
Unaware of what we didn't have
Writing my friends names on my jeans with a marker
July 4th races outside Parker
Fireworks at Martin Stadium
The Untouchable PSP where all them crazy niggaz be
And car thieves got away through Irvington
Hillside brings beef with the cops
Self destruction record drops
And everybody's name was Muslim
Sensations and 88 attracted kids from out of state
And everybody used to do the Wop
Jack, Jack, Jack ya body
Nah the Biz Mark used to amp up the party
I wish those days they didn't stop
Every ghetto, every city, and suburban place I've been
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem
Lookin' back looking back looking back [fade]"

Everything (everything)
Is Everything (is everything)

After winter (after winter)
Must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
I wrote these words (I wrote these words)
For everyone who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception in
Instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? (Who made these rules?)
We're so confused (We're so confused)
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)
Everything is everything (everything)
After winter (after winter)
Must come spring
Everything is everything
I philosophy
Possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen
From the beginning
My practice extending across the atlas
I begat this
Flippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper-slash-actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty
L. Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
Now hear this mixture
Where hip hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture
Now everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
(What is meant to be, will be)
After winter (after winter)
Must come spring (Must come spring)
Change, it comes eventually
Sometimes it seems (sometimes it seems)
We'll touch that dream (we'll touch that dream)
But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top (the ones on top)
Won't make it stop
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves then we can't fail
To make a better situation
Tomorrow (Tomorrow)
Our seeds will grow (our seeds will grow)
All we need is dedication
Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)

5,Ex-Factor,1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"It could all be so simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me who I have to be
To gain some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay
Tell me who I have to be
To gain some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (it ain't working)
No, it ain't working
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy (this is crazy)
Oh, this is crazy (this is crazy)
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else
See, I know what we got to do
You let go and I'll let go too
Cause no one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (it ain't working)
It ain't working (it ain't working)
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy (this is crazy)
Oh, this is crazy (this is crazy)
Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me
Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me

6,Final Hour,1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"I treat this like my thesis
Well-written topic
Broken down into pieces
I introduce them produce
Words so profuse
It's abuse how I juice up this beat
Like I'm deuce
Two people both equal
Like I'm Gemini
Rather simeon
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it
You can't stop it
Drop it
Your whole crew's microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles
And on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother business
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness
First handed I'm candid
You can't stand it
Respect demanded
And get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel
And this is real
So I keep makin' the street's ballads
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad
You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour (2x)
I'm about to change the focus
From the richest to the brokest
I wrote this opus
To reserve the hypnosis
Whoever's closest
To the line's gonna win it
You gonna fall tryin' to ball
While my team win the pennant
I'm about to be in it
For a minute
Then run for senate
Make a slum lord to be the tenat
Give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it
Every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival
Documented in The Bible
Like Moses and Aaron
Things gon change, it's apparent
And all the transparent gonna
Be seen through
Let God redeem you
Keep your deen true
You could get the green too
Watch out what you cling to
Observe how a queen do
And I remain calm readin' the 73 Psalm
'Cause wit all this on I got the world in palm
You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour
You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour
Now I be breakin' bread sippin'
Manichevitz wine
Pay no mind party like it's 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind
Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockefeller
Still be int he chruch of Lalibela
Singin' hyms acapella
Whether posed in Maribella in Coutore
Or collectin' residuals from off 'The Score'
I'm makin' sure
I'm with the 144
I've been here before this ain't a battle this is war
Word to Boonie
I makes a lot like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from
Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop
It's about what you keep
And even if there are leaks
You can't capsize this ship
'Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip
You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour"
7,Forgive Them Father,1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us
Although them again we will never, never, never trust
Dem now, know weh dem do, dig out yuh yei while dem sticking like glue
Fling, skind, grin while dem plotting fah you
True, Ah Who???
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you, to you
They say all the right things to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Why every Indian wanna be the chief?
Feed a man till he's full and he still want beef
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?
If I treat you kindly does it meant that I'm weak?
You hear my speak an think I won't take it do the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik
And other African czars ovserving stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gonna idolize the missing?
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they comin' gunnin'
I stand position
L's known the mission since conception
Let's free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers
Then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go, my voice echoes through hate ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Gepetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle
March through these streets like Soweto
Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus, Jesus and Judas
Backstabbers do this
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
A friend once said, and I found to be true
That everyday people, they lie to God too
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them, forgive them
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them, forgive them
Gwan like dem love while dem rip yuh to shreds
Trample pon yuh heart and lef yuh fi dead
Dem a yuh fren who yuh depen pon from way back when
But if yuh gi dem yuh back den yuh mus meef yuh end
Dem noh know wey dem do
Dem no know, dem no know, dem no know
Dem no know, dem no know wey dem do"

Its Freedom
Said its Freedom Time now
Time to get free
Oh, give yourselves up now
Its Freedom
Said, its freedom time y'all
There's a war in the mind
For the territory over dominion
Who will dominate opinions
Schizims and isms
Keeping us in forms of religion
Conforming our vision
To the wolrd church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee elections
Moral infection
Epidemic Lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Distorting our tape recorders
From hearing like under water
Beyond the borders
Finding sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
And systemic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom
What's got 'em drunk off the spirit?
Truth comes and we can't hear it
And you've been programmed to fear it
I had a vision
I was falling in indecision
Appalling
Calling religion some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in a system
Of anti-christs and majority rules
Intelligent Fools
PhDs of ilusions
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors of Past illusions
Now, who you choosing?
The head or the tail?
The Bloodshed or the Male?
Or confidence in the veil?
Conferences at Yale
Discussing Doctrines at Baal (pronounced Bale)
Causing People to Fail
Keeping A third in jail
His word is nailed, everything to the tree
Severing all the me
From all I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoyed darkness as lord
Keeping me from the sword
Blocked from mercy
Bitter than Ceres
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat, we would eat
And still dine at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong to true enemy's defeat
Destitute a necessity
Causing desperation to get the best of me
Punishment till there was nothing left of me
Realizing the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only option supernatural circumcision
Inwardly
Only water can purge the hearts from words
The firey darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity
Shaping in
There's no escaping when
Your whole philosiphy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Can it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow
Making love with a whore
Aching in sores
Babylon the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social socercery
Our present condition needs serious recongnition
Where's there's no repentance there can be no remission
And that sentence more serious than Vietnam,
The atom bomb and Sudam and Minister Farakhan
What's going on
What's a priority to you
By what authority do we
Majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters check the verses
Recapture the land remove the mark off our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his commands
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand

Don't look at me that way like everything is all right
Cause my own eyes can see through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap and easy to be wasted
As history repeats so foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep to comfortable to face it
His life's so incomplete and nothing can replace it
And while the people sleep to comfortable to face it
Your life's so incomplete and nothing can replace it
Fret not thyself I say against these laws of man
Cause like the bible says his blood is on their hands
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say is rebel,
While today is still today, choose well
And what I got a say, is rebel
It can't go down this way, choose well, choose well,
Choose well, choose well, choose well, choose well
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it
Your life's so incomplete and nothing and no one can replace it
Oh no no no no no no no
And what I gotta say (x8) is rebel (x6)...
Repent, the day is far too spent,

Your stinking resolution is no type of solution
Preventing me from freedom maintaining your pollution
I won't support your lie no more I won't even try no more
If I have to die oh lord that's how I choose to live
I won't be compromised no more I can't be victimized no more
I just don't sympathize no more cause now I understand
You just wanna use me you say love and abuse me
You never thought you lose me but how quickly we forget
That nothing is for certain you thought I stay here hurting
You're guilt trips just not working repressing me to death
Cause now I'm choosing life yo, I take the sacrifice yo
If everything must go then go that's how I choose to live
No more compromises I see past your disguises
Blinded to your mind control stealing in my eternal soul
Appearing trough material, to keep my as your slave
But I get out, I get out of all your boxes
I get out you can't hold me in these chains
I get out
Knowing my condition is the reason I must change
See what you see is what you get
Oh and you ain't say nothing yet
Oh I don't care if you're upset
I could care less if your upset
See you don't change the truth
And your hurt feeling no excuse
To keep me in this box psychological locks
Repressing through expression sementing this repression
Promoting mass deception so that no one can be healed
I don't respect your system I won't protect your system
When you talk I don't listen oh let my father's will be done
Just get out, just get out of all these boundes
Just get out can't hold me in these chains
Just get out oh these tradition's killing freedom
Knowing my condition is the reason I must change
I just accepted what you say keeping me among the death
The only way to know is to walk then learn and grow
But faith is not your speed you oh have everyone believed
That you're the soul authority just follow the majority
Afraid to face reality the system is a joke
You be smart to save your soul
And escape this mind control
You spent your life in sacrifice to a system for thedead
Oh are you sure where's the passion of this living
Are you sure is god you're serving
Obligated to a system getting less that you're deserving
Who made up these schools I say
Who made up these rules I say
And no more conditioning, Just to keep us as your slaves
Just get out of this social purgatory,
Just get out these traditions are a lie
Just get out superstition's killing freedom
Knowing my condition is the reason I must die
Just get out (5)
Knowing my condition is the reason I must die
Just get out"

But I know its possible
He says there's no me without him
Please help me forget about him
He takes all my energy
Trapped in my memory
Constantly holding me, constantly holding me
I need to tell you all, all the pain he's caused mmmmmmmmm
I need to tell you I'm, I'm undone because mmmmmmmmm
To finally be in love and know the real meaning of a
Lasting relationship, not based on ownership
I trust every part of you
Cause all that i-- all that you say you do
You love me despite myself
Sometimes I, I fight myself
I just can't believe that you would have anything to do with someone so
Insecure, someone so immature
Oh you inspire me to be the higher me,
You make my desire pure
You make my desire pure
Just tell me what to say
I can't find the words to say
Please don't be mad with me
I have no identity
All that I've known is gone
All I was building on
I wanna walk with you,
How do I talk to you?
Touch my mouth with your hands
Touch my mouth with your hands
Oh I want to understand
The meaning of your embrace
I know now I have to face
The temptations of my past
Plaese don't let me disgrace
Will my devotion last
Now that I know the truth
Now that it's no excuse
Keeping me from your love
What was I thinking of,
Holding me from ya love,
What was I thinking of?
You are my peace of mind
That old me is left behind
You are my peace of mind
That old me is left behind
He says it's impossible, but I know its impossible
He says it's improbable, but I know its tangible
He says it's not grabable, but I know its haveable
'Cause anythings possible
Oh anything is possible
Please come free my mind
Please come feed my mind
Can you see my mind oh
Wont you come free my mind
Oh I know its possible
Anything anything anything anything anything yeah..."
12,I Remember,2002,MTV Unplugged (2002),,Lauryn Hill,"I remember
When you looked into my eyes
You saw
Right through me
And I could not hide
I was exposed 
Just like a child
All of my heart
You hold in your hands
I'm yours to command
I'm yours to command
I feel so humbled
With you in my life (2x)
I remember
When I looked into your eyes
I saw
A reflection of my myself
And I could not lie
Out of control
Too weak
To deny
All of myself
Is naked before you
But what can I do?
There's nothing I can do
I feel so beautiful
With you in my life (2x)
I remember...
With you in my life..."
13,I Used To Love Him,1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"Now I don't 
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray Father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurred my sight
(And I used to love him) 
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
I chose a road of passion and pain
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
Torn and confused wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated I waited debated
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no I just should have heeded
Misled I bled till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn
Now I don't 
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't 
I used to love him but now I don't
Father you saved me and showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets deeper than oceans
My soul was weary but now it's replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and I look in his eyes
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold I took back my soul
And totally let my creator control
The life which was his to begin with
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't"

And there's this voice inside of us that says ""don't do that,"" you know, ""Why you gonna get up there with that guitar? You're gonna like like a, a hip hop folk singer. What are you, you know, what are you?...""
(Laughter)
And I really went through, I mean, I'm serious, I mean I can laugh about it now, but it took a long time for me to understand that, you know, what I am is what I am and I can't be afraid to, you know, to expose that to the public. You know, always-get in trouble trying to make it, tryin' to dress it up, you know what I'm sayin'? Just tired of that, you know. Just tired of that. Tired of frontin', Tired of that... And until I find a group of people that are as passionate about it as I am, I'll just roll alone until such time, you know. It's all good, God is faithful. Y'all still get to hear it, so, you know? 'Cause see that enemy he would tell me, you know ""You don't have the 20 piece band, you can't do nothin'."" I said, ""Yeah, sure... Keep talkin'."" 'Cause somebody's gonna, they gonna see me and they gonna know ""Oh I, there's somethin' that God's been tellin' me to do. I can do it, too. I can do what I'm supposed to be doin', I don't need an entourage. What do I need a crew for?"" That doesn't validate you. Okay, let's see. Mmmm..."
18,Interlude 5,2002,MTV Unplugged (2002),,Lauryn Hill,"Interlude 5 lyrics: Lauryn Hill MTV Unplugged 2.0
You all doin' all right? You ok? I'm not screamin at ya, I'm just askin you a question. Y'all givin' me a clap. A yes is fine (laughing) ok? (voice from audience ""I love that song"") Thank you. Praise God. I tell you, I know everybody's in the same mess. I'm telling you. We all are. I know that, you know, and I'm just, you know, I'll be the first to tell you, you know, I'm a mess and God is dealing with me everyday. And everyday I'm trying, you know, how I can be less of a mess. 'cause you know, he showed me, Look Lauryn, you know, You're the problem, ok, I'm going to show you how you're causing the problem, and now I want you to be the solution. And that's what all of these songs are about, just, problem, cause and solution. Free your mind. It's like, we all think that the gospel is join and church building, and that's deception, you know. The real gospel is Repent, which means 'let go of all that crap,' that's killin' ya. Life was supposed to be a pleasurable experience, not this torment, you know. And when I realized that I was tormenting myself, it was about my lust. It wasn't about things that I needed it was just, you know, all these security blankets. I mean, the more I acquired I became more of a prisoner. I mean, you know, forty people on staff, and you can't do nothing, and now creativity is impossible because all you can think about is all these folks that you know, you're supporting and carryin' and you know, it's not good. You know, everybody... a friend of mine says that every tub has to stand on it's own bottom, you know. And in that respect, we all get to do what our passion is. See that's what praisin God is all about, is doing your passion. You know, it's not useless, worthless ritual, you know, monotonous ritual, where we just show up and can't wait to see the game, you know. It's doing your passion and fulfilling your passion. You know. That's how we're thankful. That's how we say we appreciate the opportunity to be alive. And I'm just glad that I, you know, I don't have to slave anymore. You know, 'cause I, music was my love, and because of everything I thought had to accompany my music it became my burden. It just got stolen from me. I said, What is this? How did this thing that I love so much so easily and so quickly turn to something I loath and hate? And so now, you know, I understand that it was because I was measuring myself or trying to compare myself to a standard that wasn't reality. It wasn't the standard at all, you know. There's a scripture in the Bible that we, what does it say, it says 'We compare ourselves amongst ourselves' you know. That's not the standard. You already are the standard. What are you trying to fit into a standard for? We were each created to be individual standards, you know. And we're trying to fit into a standard? It doesn't make any sense, you know. So now I'm just, you know, after all that, I'm just ready to be me. And it's a lot to work through, you know, because all of us have hidden in these little boxes purposely, because of parts of ourselves that we were unhappy about. And it's because we didn't understand, you know, because there's all this social doctrine that says, you know, that the infinite God, with all this expression, who created every single one of us, absolutely different, on purpose, wants everybody to fit into the same suit. But like, you know, that's deception. That's deception.
(Talking to someone offstage) Ok, let me just, I think this is the wrong one (laughing) I don't think this is the right one.
We took... we were in, um, Florida this weekend and we took the kids to Disneyworld, and um, you know we were going, they gave us a tour. They escorted us through the back. And when they escorted us through the back, we got to see how, you know, there all these people workin all hard, and it was like, real dirty back there, and of course, in the front it was all immaculately clean. And I said, I said, you know, People need to see the reality, they need to see, you know, how these people slave to maintain this illusion. And it felt like my life. I said, If people only knew what it was. It's like, you know, a bunch of musicians, listen, bustin' their 'mm' workin all hard to make it look easy. What's the point? You know, Oh, uh, I just threw this together, uh...(audience laughs). You know, it's like, you know what I'm sayin'? I mean, you know. Slaving. Slaving to act like, you know, I wake up like this. And none of us do, you know, none of us do. None of us do. And reality is good 'cause that means everybody could just exhale, let your belly out, you know, and chill. You know. But people get mad at me when I say, Look, let's stop frontin'. And I'm saying, you know, that's the blessing. Now we can go around and look at each other and say, Oh, you got one too?! And be free. And we want to defend the curse. I'll tell ya, that was not fun. Did it for a long time. Too long.
(Offstage) You didn't find it? It's another white one. But you see... in my purse. Or the, the other bag? Or the green one? Ghetto. You know, it's reality, ok (laughing)?
One time, it came to me, you know, I was just told very concretely. You know, it was like that voice, the right one, said to me, he said, Lauryn, You know the real you is more interesting than the fake somebody else. I just want you to know that. Because we always thought we could get, you know, we could get reality by just putting on the clothes and wearin' the face and you know, lookin' hard in the video. But, you know. Reality is... it's like I've always told to my husband, it's like, look, you know, we look at Bob Marley, you know, and we say Ok, let's just grow locks and wear the clothes and have the band and we have no many idea how many years of struggle and pain and suffering that made that content. You see what I'm saying? You can't get it from the outside in. Truth is from the inside out. You know, and the way we've been trying to heal and be healed is with these topical, surface, superficial, temporary solution. And I'm telling you, true healing is from the inside out. You know, we've been told to protect our outer man while our inner man is dying. (offstage) Oh, this is the one.
Boy I'll tell ya, God made him for me. I'm something to put up with. And to endure that is amazing. I'll be the first to tell you, trust me. Y'all could clap 'cause that's some real work (more clapping). I was in there in the room, you know, before we came out here, and he said to me, I said, Ro should I change? And he said, Yeah. So I looked at him, I said, Why did you tell me to change I was comfortable, man. But I asked him the question. So I went in the room and I tried on all these clothes and I was like, I feel like an idiot. So I pulled out all these clothes and I'm sayin', ok Ro, you know, Pack the bag neatly, you know, Could you put the clothes back in? And he's like, All right. So he's trying to do this but then I'm like, No! Now take this out! Now put that back and take that out! Put that back, hold that, take, that, put, The orange shoe! The orange shoe! So I'm like. And then after awhile I just said, Ro baby, could you leave? Please get out the room. And I just put back on the clothes I came in. Ok, I was like... I'm just not there anymore. Nah, I'm telling you. It's like, uh (laughing). Hey you know he's learned. Because before we used to just beef and now he's like, Okay... I'm out. It's real. God gave us a brand new relationship, man, I mean, one in truth, you know. It's like, we date people, like let's say, you know, we're interested in somebody and we put on the perfume and dress up and then we do things that we will never ever ever do again! You understand what I'm sayin'? It's like... And that's why so many marriages end up in divorce. It's because people wake up next to a stranger. They say, Who the hell are you? What are you doing in this bed? Where's that man that used to do 'du, dua, and du.' And I'm sayin' let's give them reality from the door because... you're going to attract love, and the one that really loves you. And then you don't have to pretend and falcify, and you know, keep that posture. You know, you know, I can't, I'm just like... I'll never forget when I first met him I said to him, it was like, he saw me eating in front of him, and he told me, he was like, You eat like a man, you must not like me. You know, because, women, usually they keep that posture. And I said, Nah. I said it's not even that, you know. It's but, this is reality. This is, you know, and that's it, man, I mean, I'm just telling you, it's so wonderful to finally find... And trust me, it's a work in progress, it's not something that happens overnight. We all have to be introduced to each other. I'm telling you, I know that I'm up here and you see, Lauryn Hill, you came to see Lauryn Hill. But this is the first time y'all meet me. You see what I'm saying? Don't think you met me before, ok. And as I grow, you're going to meet me a little bit more. You're gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more. I can tell you I had to reintroduce myself to everybody I know. My mother my father. Listen, y'all never knew me. I want to introduce you to me. I'm just getting to know me. And you know what, anything that's not growin' is dead, so we better be changing. You know, people would say to me, they would hold me hostage. And they, seriously, emotionally hostage, and they'd say, Uh, she's changing. The money's changing her. And I'd say Listen, the money's not changing me, God's changing me. I'm changing, because that's a natural part of life. We're all supposed to change. Who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that? Nobody is. Let the experience teach you and be real, man. And, um... there's gonna be warfare involved. Because there's some people who prefer deceptions, see. They say, uh, I don't like this new expression, and I say, what, you want two-thirds of me to stay outside? I'm a whole person. You can't say, you know, two-thirds of Lauryn, come in here. Only two-thirds is acceptable. I'm a whole person. You know. And that's everybody. You always talk about spiritual warfare and we did
N't realize that it was in relationships. It's emotional warfare. Being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves. And when they say, Hey that doesn't fit into our box for you, we say, Well, I ain't in no box. Don't try to put me in one. I'm going to play a little bit of guitar with this one, but I might stop it's 'cause I really want you to listen to the words, so if I stop, you understand why. I want you to really hear the words..."

I'll never forget when I first met him I said to him, it was like, he saw me eating in front of him, and he told me, he was like, You eat like a man, you must not like me. You know, because, women, usually they keep that posture. And I said, Nah. I said it's not even that, you know. It's but, this is reality. This is, you know, and that's it, man, I mean, I'm just telling you, it's so wonderful to finally findâ€¦And trust me, it's a work in progress, it's not something that happens overnight. We all have to be introduced to each other. I'm telling you, I know that I'm up here and you see, Lauryn Hill, you came to see Lauryn Hill. But this is the first time y'all meet me. You see what I'm saying? Don't think you met me before, ok. And as I grow, you're going to meet me a little bit more. You're gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more. I can tell you I had to reintroduce myself to everybody I know. My mother my father. Listen, y'all never knew me. I want to introduce you to me. I'm just getting to know me. And you know what, anything that's not growin' is dead, so we better be changing. You know, people would say to me, they would hold me hostage. And they, seriously, emotionally hostage, and they'd say, Uh, she's changing. The money's changing her. And I'd say Listen, the money's not changing me, God's changing me. I'm changing, because that's a natural part of life. We're all supposed to change. Who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that? Nobody is. Let the experience teach you and be real, man. And, um... there's gonna be warfare involved. Because there's some people who prefer deceptions, see. They say, uh, I don't like this new expression, and I say, what, you want two-thirds of me to stay outside? I'm a whole person. You can't say, you know, two-thirds of Lauryn, come in here. Only two-thirds is acceptable. I'm a whole person. You know. And that's everybody. You always talk about spiritual warfare and we did
N't realize that it was in relationships. It's emotional warfare. Being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves. And when they say, Hey that doesn't fit into our box for you, we say, Well, I ain't in no box. Don't try to put me in one. I'm going to play a little bit of guitar with this one, but I might stop it's 'cause I really want you to listen to the words, so if I stop, you understand why. I want you to really hear the words"

It's a new day, don't have the energy
You mind a joke
Okay so, these are brand new songs
And there are very few people who've heard
Very much about you know what I've heard
I've been going through and what I've been learning, lot of
Lot of wonderful life lessons, you know
They're not easy to come by but they're very blessed
After you realize why you had to go through
What you had to go through
It's just very important that you really listen to the words
You know and if you have a hard time hearin' what I'm sayin'
Please just raise your hand and you know or something
Object or you know whatever
You guys ready in there?
Okay and you know it's real intersting
Beacuse I used to, I used to be performer
And I, I really don't consider myself a performer so much any more
I really just, you know I'm, I'm sharing, you know
More or less the music that I've been given
But if I stop, if I start if I you know
Feel like saying baby baby baby for eighteen bar's
Whateverer, you know I just I do that
But I'm, all right, so you guys are cool
I'll talk to people on my head too, it's all right
Let's just warm up a little bit
Finish sucking my lozenge

Let me see
We're all tuned up now"

Pools of fascination in my sleep
Cooling off the fire of my longing
Warming up my cold with in his heat
Melting down the walls of inhibition
Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me to complete submission
Desolving my condition with his tears
It's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
It's just like the waters, the water
I ain't felt this way in years
Coursing through my senses he's prevailing
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me I find my inside sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind
Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you
It's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years, in years
It's just like the water, the water
I ain't felt this way in years
Bathing in the fountain of his essence
He causes my expression to remain
Humbled on the mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name
Sealing all the floodgates of his passion
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
In my imagination, oh no
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning, I'm so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land
It's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years, in years
It's just like the waters, the water
I ain't felt this way in years
Cleaning me, he's purging me, and moving me around
He's bathing and he's cleaning me, and moving me around
Around, and around and around... and around
Washing me, cleaning me, moving me around

And around ... and around"

I just want you around
I just want you around,
I just want you around
Thought that I had lost you
I could hardly make a sound
When I thought I couldn't hold you
Knew the world had let me down
Should have took the time and told you
You keep my feet on the ground
I hope that you can hear me
'Cause I know it's not profound
I just want you around,
I just need you around
I just want you around,
I just need you around
When I thought I was without you
I got used to being down
Was my fault I used to doubt you
But that ain't me next time around
Please believe me when I tell you
Cause all my words are bound
This is my cross so let me bear it
I was lost but now I am found, found, found
I just want you around,
I just need you around
I just want you around,
I just need you around
Took this love for granted
Kept my feelings under ground
Should have watered what I planted
Should have known what I had found
I'm not used to being lonely
I don't like the way it sounds
You're the only one I know yeah
Who don't turn my upside down
I just want you around,
I just need you around

24,Lost Ones,1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My thing done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand L. Boogie's non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for me gun
Can't take a threat to me newborn son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you wanna ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
Now, now how come your talk turn cold
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless now I'm on Hope road
Every man wants to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgement
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it's time for punishment
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come
When it's all done did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come
You just lost one
Now don't you understand man universal law
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long
The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have till it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come
When it's all done did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come

See the road to hell, is paved with good intentions
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention
How they helped you out, you're such a hopeless victim
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional
All their talk, it's seasoned to perfection
The road they walk, commanding your affection
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation
An opportunity, to further situation
Why they're so important, is without explanation
Please don't patronize me, Mr. Intentional
Oh, oh, oh oh
We give rise to ego, by being insecure
The advice that we go, desperately searching for
The subconscious effort, to support our paramour
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional
Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional
Stuck in a system, that seeks to suck your blood
Held emotionally hostage, by what everybody does
Counting all the money, that you give them just because
Exploiting ignorance, in the name of love
Stop before you drop because that's just the way it was
Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional
Oh one-dimensional, Mr. Intentional
Oh, oh don't you do me any favors
Oh, oh, oh oh
Wake up you've been sleeping
Take up your bed and walk
Stop blaming other people
Oh it's nobody else's fault
Accept the truth about you
You know that life goes on without you
And your expensive misinventions
Disguising your intentions
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional
Oh, oh oh oh
See I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional
The only help I need to live, is unprofessional
The only wealth I have to give, is not material
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available
Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional
Oh I don't need your sympathy, Mr. Intentional
Stay away from me, Mr. Intentional
So one-dimensional, Mr. Promotional, Mr. Emotional, Mr. Intentional

26,Mystery Of Iniquity,2002,MTV Unplugged (2002),,Lauryn Hill,"(Sing songy Chorus intro)
It's the mystery of Inequity...
Said it's the misery of Inequity...
Said it's the history of Inequity...
When it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down
Children...
Eat your bread
Little children...
Eat your bread
'Cause it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down
(First and only verse)
Yo!
Y'all can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
Perjures the jurors
Witness despised
Crooked lawyers
False Indictments publicized
Its entertainment... the arraignments
The subpoenas
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Enter the Dragon
Black-robe crooked-balance
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
Court reporter catch the circus on the paper
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that ""In God We Trust""
Cross-examined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator
Receiving the judge's favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to they neighbors
For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers
See the bailiff
Representing security
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury
The prosecution
Political prostitution
The more money you pay... the further away solution
Legal actors
Babylon's benefactors
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Hypocritical giants
Morally non-compliant
Orally armed to do bodily harm
Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm
And the defense isn't making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em'
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Framed by intentions
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing he's being used
To discredit, edit, headed for the alleged
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness (the paid authority)
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Of disinterested peers
Dodging duty for years
Hating the process
Waiting to return to their careers
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct?
Properly serve and protect?
Materially corrupt
Spiritually amuck
Oblivious to the cause
Prosperously bankrupt
Blind leading the blind
Guilty never defined
Filthy as swine
A generation purin it's own mind
Legal extortion
Blown out of proportion
In vein deceit
The truth is obsolete
Only two positions:
Victimizer or Victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma trying to own a piece
Of the ""American Corona""
The Revolving Door
Insanity every floor
Skyscraping, paper chasing
What are we working for?
Empty traditions
Reaching social positions
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief
The standard is Thief
Brethren can we candidly speak?
Woe to the men
Trusted in the chariots dem'
Leaning on horses
They run to intellectual sources
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak entombs them outwardly white
But Internally they absent of light
Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse
Evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first
Angelic being cast to the earth
It's time for rebirth
Burnin up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turn and be healed
Let him who stole, no longer steal
Oh it's real
Surrender for Jehovah is real
How long will you sleep
Troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep
The idols YOU heap
Causing the destruction you reap
Judgment has come
Find it and return to the One
Abandon the flesh
Self-interest: Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed
Hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Caused us to die
Let your emotions be crucified
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be re-taught
You'll find what you sought... was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught
Where the majority remains caught
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam,
(Sing songy Chorus Outro)

Say it's the history of Inequity
Say it's the misery of Inequity
When it all...
All falls down

It all falls down"
27,Nothing Even Matters,1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small
'Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
See I don't need no alcohol
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
Without it I'd go through withdrawal
'Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still there's no place I'd rather be
'Cause nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
You're part of my identity
I sometimes have the tendency
To look at you religiously
'Cause nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either or
'Cause nothing even matters no more
Nothing it don't matter
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Now my team could score
And make it to the Final Four
Just repossess my 4x4

28,Oh Jerusalem,2002,MTV Unplugged (2002),,Lauryn Hill,"Oh Jerusalem yeah, oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem...
Realizing that there's no place else to go
And there's nobody I know who can help me
Text book solutions are so improbable
'Cause everybody you know is just as empty
Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide
...Behind education and philosophy
But it's a hopeless explanation to describe the situation
I can't see because the world's on top of me
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect, 'cause I'm morally defect
By reason of the god inside my head
Causing me to see, only what pertains to me
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead
Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth
'Cause I... can't see past my own vanity
If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be in sanity
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way
What a paradox, having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending
God through my facade only material
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection
Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof, a generations so aloof
Only followin' the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord, with all thine heart
And lean not to thine own understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths
Be not wise in thine on eyes,
Or you can't follow Him
We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore
We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated 'cause he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss
Why still do evil, when we don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light, ey
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be all right
Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of monopoly
Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess
Will reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me
Oh Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
Oh Jerusalem providing you no protection.
Abide in Me and I in you, as the branch cannot bare
...Fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the Vine, ye are the branches,
He that live in Me and I in him,
The same bring forth much fruit
For without me, you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen Me
Do whatsoever, you asking My Name He may give to you
But in vain they call My Name
Teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know knoweth the heart,
What man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel
Just repent, turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
...For why would you die
Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why
I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth (sp?)
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and His word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou may be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
Oh Jerusalem, providing you no protection
Oh Jerusalem... (fade)"

On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality?
Now, who you know without any flaws
That lives above the spiritual laws
And does anything they feel just because
There's always someone there who'll applaud
Come on baby, light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
So, how come we ain't getting no higher?
I know you think that you've got it all
And by making other people feel small
Makes you think you're unable to fall
But when you do, who you gonna call?
See, what you give is just what you get
I know it hasn't hit you yet
Now I don't mean to get you upset
But every 'cause has an effect

So, how come we're not getting no higher?
I cross sands in distand lands, made plans with the sheiks
Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak?
All I wanted was to sell like 500
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album 'Blunted'
I used to work at Foot Locker, they fired me and fronted
Or I quit, now I spit it - however do you want it?
Now you get it!
Writing rhymes my range with the frames sightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemeented
And if your rhymes sound like mine, I'm taking a percentage
Unprecedented and still respected when it vintage
I'm serious, I'm taking over areas in Aquarius
Running red lights with my 10,000 chariotes
Just as Christ was a superstar, you stupid star
They'll hail you then they'll nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down
And make you face it, if you slit the bag open
And put your pinky in it, then taste it

Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be all right
Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love then I have nothing at all
I can give away everything I possess
But am without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect and not without sin
But now that I'm older all childish things end.
I'll never be jealous and I won't be too proud
Cause love is not boastful
Ooh and love is not loud
Tell him need him
Tell him I love him
Everything is gonna be all right
Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on earth

See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love I was shown when our lives were spared

33,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill,1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"My world it moves so fast today
The past it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe
And every time I try to be, what someone else has thought of me
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve
But deep in my heart, the answer it was in me,
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny
I look at my environment
And wonder when the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help searching outside of themselves
Now I know that his strength is within me
And deep in my heart the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny.
And deep in my heart
And deep in my heart the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own... destiny"
34,To Zion,1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"One day, you'll understand... Zion
Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe, this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
Look at your career they said
""Lauryn baby use your head""
But instead I choose to use my heart
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of his grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one god could create and
I'm reminded every time I see your face
That the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Marching, marching, marching, Zion
Marching, marching
Marching, marching marching to Zion
Beautiful, beautiful Zion."
35,When It Hurts So Bad,1998,The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill (1998),,Lauryn Hill,"When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad
Why's it feel so good?
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad
Why's it feel so good?
I loved real, real hard once
But the love wasn't returned
Found out the man I'd die for
He wasn't even concerned
I tried, and I tried, and I tried
To keep him in my life
I cried and I cried, and I cried
But I couldn't make it right
But I, I loved the young man
And if you've ever been in love
Then you'd understand
What you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it
If you don't catch it
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it
If you just let it
See, I thought this feeling
It was all that I had
But how could this be love
And make me feel so bad?
Gave up my power
I existed for you
But whoever knew the voodoo you'd do?
But I, I loved the young man
And if you've ever been in love you'd understand
What you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it
And what you need irconically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it
What you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it
If you just let it
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad
Why's it feel so good?
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad
Why's it feel so good?
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad"
