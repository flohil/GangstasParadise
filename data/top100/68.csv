0,48,2013,Wolf (2013),Hip Hop,"Tyler, the Creator","Crack fucked up the world, and I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, I come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit
I wonder if it fucked with their conscious
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that
But that's where the money came from
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow
I can get it for the low
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow
I can get it for the low
Shit is getting warmer on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 phoners
Your mother is a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shits getting harder
The only thing you wanna bump her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep, and the seashore ain't soil
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you're accustomed to what you're used to
So you bought two, nigga
They are coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind and it's all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent
I am the reason your family is using and shootin' up, it's my fault,
You can blame me motherfucker, for killin' your aunties and uncles,
The hustle and hunger, all I wanted was a cheeseburger,
And a little chain tuck, didn't realize this game fucked, up some lives
""Oh how's ma?"" my conscience eats it up all the time
But other than that I'm fine I got a little money in my pocket.
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow
I can get it for the low

They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow
I can get it for the low
Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop I sold that truck
And I sold that dope
Motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I'm sorry
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I'm sorry
Could have been a actor and won that Oscar, said, I'm sorry
I sold that soap and I killed black folk, I'm sorry
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my momma all cool, I'm sorry
I'm in too deep and I can't see the shore, I'm sorry
You get addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling
Even more than the money, it's just your job
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person, to do this and do that
You become the go to guy forever
And next thing you know you're in too deep, way too deep
Scare the shit out of you, you wind up with so much work
That you'll be scared to death
It's important for us to realize, man
We gotta get out of that, man
Ya know, dudes is buying choppers
To shoot down people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other
Nobody wins
Ya known what I mean?"

Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row

Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the night line
Work line
Dial nine
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...
Part II: Mr. Lonely
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911
Oh! Damn! Damn!"
2,Analog,2011,Goblin (2011),Hip Hop,"Tyler, the Creator","I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby could you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit is going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me
(Verse 1: Hodgy)
I'm give it to her, she wants that summer time
I'm give it like no other 'cause she knows I'm hers
Damn right she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse
Damn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga
Come for mines in summer time, I'mma bust that trigger, nigga
Catch us where the beach at, she wanna go shopping
Sun down after club 'cause she like to get it popping
Sangria on my feet ma, 'cause she likes to get it popping
No ecstasy for her but she wanna get it popping
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure
Then drop in when she get out of place I quantinize
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine
I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake
Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake
(Verse 2: Tyler)
I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine
(Brigde)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (There goes the rainbow)
Grab a drink, look in the sky, we never have to leave
We're here, all night, school is in session
Look, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep"

And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts
And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts
Phone ain't got no service this 3G is fucking worthless

You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a churches

Scrawny little fucker yeah I was that guy
And you was down for the weekend
I was down for the greeting
And your eyes the same color shit that jasper be chiefing
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck
But it was my first official date so I was stuck like
It was past curfew, and we was at the grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grabbed my hand, talking about trying to get home safe
All I remember, was your motherfucking face, your face
I play in your hair
As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I'm floating in air
Can't you believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a ziplock bag
You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I'm holding your hand
And making eye can-tact I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses
I'm insecure then I start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I could own 'em or lease it or clone it
Because holding your fingertips is golden.
I fucking love you, I treat my problems like a bowling ball &
I grip and keep holding on
Girl?
I play in your hair
As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I'm floating in air
Can't you believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a ziplock bag
You got a nigga sprung
Wait, don't think this is going to work
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
I haven't talked to you in a couple of days,
I got too comfortable and started to think we were really a couple
But hey at least it was time spent.
But by the time you will hear this you will know what these rhymes meant
But when you realize its awkward your names still my password
So I'm always fuckin' reminded
You're my Girlfriend... you're my Girl (Whether you like it or not!)
You're my girl... you're my girlfriend, you're my Girl Girlfriend
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my Girl (Shit I know that you're my)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend

Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC
And um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions, today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself
Well look, if you don't talk, I mean these sessions are going to go slower
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought, this food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son
My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck 'em
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs I never spark it
I used to be bullied for honor classes by those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school
Raquel treat me like my father like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares I caught
Go to sleep
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
""Fuck me,"" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal
Play this shit in church
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry), no bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton, wearing some fucking Heelys
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch eleven
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created OF 'cause I feel we're more talented
Than forty year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve 'em
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
'Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug hoy
I'm bad for you kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it
Well, um, it seems you had a lot to say
And uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mama will attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

What would you tell him?"

Met you at my school, departed at my house
Ended at your panties, started at your blouse
Pushed you down stairs, I took a nap up on the couch
If you wanted a date, don't come
Now you gotta make it easy for me don't run
You call this shit kids, well I call these kids cum
And you call this shit rape but I think that rape's fun
Wait now it's about eight somethin'
It's late and you stuck in my base-one
Come downstairs with nothin' but a shoe string

Dope as fuck so I would really shoot a group of guys up
Deep thought, I'm often lost (Fuck it) put me next to awesome
Still can't tell the difference, just like Asians with their eyes shut
Butt fuck a couple rocks, in the Wendy's parking lot
Barking at the sight of light from my bright sparkling
Cock-a-doodle, eatin' toaster strudel at a nude beach in Rome
In a black-pink spaghetti strap, made of Roman noodles
My bitch is bad, mixed with a thicky ass
Get my dicky rocky this will end up in a sticky blast
Chrissy Brown, mask on my face, now I'm kicking ass
Life's a bitch, fuck college, mommy I am ditching class
I rather be happy then fucking forty
So fuck the teacher's lecture I'm having Sydney record me
For the 2Dope... (They didn't like it)
Oh well, let's get XXL to write us a fucking story
(Hook: Hodgy)
It's sitting right in my lap I see it, scribbled across the lines I read it
I'm the fucking poet who knows it, you know it, you bogus
Comprehend the language, you scared of war?
I'm all anxious, we got the Angus if you want beef
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Slice the onions)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Put on the cheese)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Where's the barbeque sauce?)
Now have that burger eat it fast nigga
Fucking all, get you some, obviously intended pun
Same time it took, Jason Dill to get the stitching done
Custom made, one of one, sold out Roxy for some months
Ski mask color of a pickle just to perform Sandwitches
Started back in fucking London cracker children wanted something
They could bump and punch a bunch and fuck a face stumble
Now, moshing pits to breaking arms, Zombie Circus not a carn
Evil wolfs is on the farm and were all evil harmed?
Any sheep creep, quiet tendered sleep
Make a peep, fucking body will go missing in a week
Roam around the city with her titties like a fucking greek
God, Bastard was the fucking shit, explains why it never leaked
I am coming of my age with my Memphis Bleek
Shooting from the sky, the only problem is the missing beak
(Once I have my wings and my motherfucking chain)
Oh that's the black talk you give me, let me down a couple cups of bleach
Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree, lick a couple pimple covered clits
From some stripping lesbian dikes that fight niggas
That like to rap about those dikes that fight niggas
All right, enough with this shit, let's talk business
Acquire more currency, disregard bitches
Go to Shake house and play Goblin in his kitchen
Then force him and his mom to listen to track six then
If he doesn't like it I'll just slice his fucking dick and
Put it in the cabinet where the fucking cookies and chips is
Take a bunch of pictures and post them on my Twitters and
Go to Jimmy Fallon like faggot when we perfomin'
Then a bunch of Golf Wang niggas start stormin' on the stage
In a rage that will scare Zack Rocha
Better get ya tanks before this wolf wars over
History repeats itself, I'm a O.F. soldier"

Can we get a pic?"" I said no
And they said, ""Oh, it's Wolf Gang, 'Yonkers'
 is my shit though""
Now I'm like, ""Fuck, I don't want to be an asshole""
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there then they caused a riot
Now I'm surrounded by a twenty-five hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear 
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, ""Hey, Tyler, can I?""
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
""But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard 'Radicals,' the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My mama must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school, I was the one thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like, 'Fuck 'em'
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who like you just 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song 'Bastard' right in the moment of heat
Not in summer but of course I was holding a heat gun on the edge of my feet
I heard that first piano chord and it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, 'Fuck, is he speaking to me?'
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (That's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (Uh)
Tyler, I love you, I wanna be just like you (All right)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (No homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to 
 and eat donuts
Over conversating bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (Uh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you but me in your T-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like just I'm slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (Yeah, you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought 
 about five times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (All right)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like 'Fuck'
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (What the fuck?)
And I hit you on Twitter about ten minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a, 'Hey' (Sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play 'VCR'
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors""
All right my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
""Yonkers"" and ""Yonkers"" (I love that song), sick of hearing about ""Yonkers""
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
""Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a T-shirt from Sagan
The one that say, 'Sagan Lockhart' and when you came out to 'Sandwitches'
That's when my fucking boycrush got started""
Just take this fucking picture man, shit"

Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace align it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Trust my little dick is a'ight, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, ride bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang rascals for the night
Skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga fuck it though, going hard as riggalo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple crackers hit the show
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out Europe, had a Swedish bitch nigga hoes
That's how it goes; designing clothes, cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm about as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking with me I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car and write a song as I'm heading straight to the office
Pissed at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called ""Pink Dolphin""
See, I roll here on a mean unicorn
Green hat, Vans, Golf top with the team uniform
Tighten the kupris so I'm tying my bandana up
Sunk them like the Reds I forget it like Dan Manners cause
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
But when you're alone thoughts start coming in
Punching in that dark light box and they start rummaging
Shit you've got to battle with, wish that they could skedaddle
But it makes your shadow say none, fuck it grab the gun again
I needed to get out of the house, so I hit the dead sams and we were biking it out
In a black hoodie, with a Arizona and a bag of skittles
Just to see what all to see what all that fucking hype is about
Now every time you see a roach you think of me eh?
Because every time I see one I think what his parents would say
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day
I was with Whitney smoking Sitting at the dock in the Bay
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
Do you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of Cheese
While my friends can't afford little pizzas from little ceasers
And their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
So I don't feel bad when they not eating
(But you still treating us you punk bitch)
Wolf Haley got more methods than pink men
I'm never civil Fuck Lincoln
Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles
I'm okie dokie and loopy
And booboo nana and Caca

Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet

And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still, I'm sounding like a fucking newbie

And purchasing weapons naming them and aim them in One Direction

It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Every time you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
Instead of grunts from a God damn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook sucks my Peter

I drop a seed in her panties, if it smell like pansies
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga, ask your mammy
Never played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy
Whole squad slammin' like Onyx, you know Sticky Fingaz
Some drop science, I'm droppin' English
Even if Tyler named the song ""Flower""
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs

Droppin' seeds on these niggas

Cause last time I attempted this shit the judge ordered
Me to see a shrink
Started with a link
Intended her to meet me at the local
Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We be uniquely in sync
Already fucking and we only met last week
We're both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gas in her cheeks
Well, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a Greek that
Neighbors by the creek say that my house stinks
It reeks of a street girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seats which
Makes me swing my obvious feet
We get caught up, go splat, and we think
Now I get daughters and time in the clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just ride up, mine's caught in the sink
Yeah they get cut up, two cent, my physique
Critique my shit

Bitches running round down pussy take a trip
Make you strip, got my dick harder than the unzipped

Sea I was never into the beaches and all the sands
See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows and posies
Falling outta my pocket, but y'all want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?
How many fans can I have until I turn on the AC?
If the AC blows, well then I'm TNT, I'm gone
I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guessing nothing lasts forever
Yeah, nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out
Shout out to the girls that I lead on
For occasional head and always keeping my bed warm
And trying their hardest to keep my head on straight
And keeping me up enough till I had thought I was airborne
How many raps can I write till I get me a chain?
How many chains can I wear till I'm considered a slave?
How many slaves can it be till Nat Turner arise?
How many riots can it be till them Black lives matter?

Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull
'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool
'Cause I know what I'm driving is usually paid in full
And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one
Because I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
Them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views
Them views get some stares and my backyard does too
And if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool
You better not drown, keep them ten toes up
'Cause if those ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
And that's what I swim in
And if I drown and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)
And if I crash and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)

People excited thinking shit is so tight
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cock's blasting off?
Fuck that, these niggas ain't fucking with me
'Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech of the nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead of that real hip hop
That's bull of the sheet but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it (they don't, 'cause it's not made for) 'cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset, that same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him
(TC)
It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that ""faggot"" word
That's very... that's a bad word
(Tyler)
I'm not homophobic
(TC)
I mean, I don't think you are
(Tyler)
Faggot
(TC)
Fine. Well, since the last time we...
(Tyler)
The fuck is a good performance?
I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can
(TC)
I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun
But your Twitter posts, just...
I mean, they're really random
And it's ADD
(Tyler)
Who doesn't have ADD?
Well, I don't
(TC)
I mean, sometimes, you're just really out in the distance
And we just want to know, what's the problem for this?
(Tyler)
I wish Thebe was here
Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me 'cause I do not fuck with religion
You see that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)
When someone gets blamed (what?) cause some white kid had aimed his AK-47
At 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned
(TC)
I don't think anyone's going to mention
I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you
College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since 8
I can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
(TC)
Well, you explained to me that you were in school, but I...
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons nigga throw them at pedestrians
(TC)
So... what are you saying, take advantage?
I mean, you've been doing pretty good
I've seen that...
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout and shout loud
Inside, sometimes I just want to die
(TC)
No you don't
(Tyler)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies trynna stop 'em
All you fucking lames don't have to like me
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee
(TC)
Whoa... uhm... all right
Uh, she was telling me you went to New York"
20,Golden,2011,Goblin (2011),Hip Hop,"Tyler, the Creator","(Intro: Dr. TC)
Tyler you obviously have some fucking problems
And this is the end of this session, let's anything else you've gotta say?
Mom is getting jealous I see my manager more
Than I see her before, I go on tour and it hurts
I miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work
They getting legal, so now I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forget about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids that copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling till my mothafuckin' eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man
Fuck, I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
Niggas saying ""Free Earl"" without even knowin' him
See, they're missing the new album, I'm missing my only friend
When I say Odd, y'all say Future
Odd... uh-uh, that shit's corny as fuck
(Tyler, you have a cult following)
To these white kids?
Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Nashes with the Nazis but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see
Mommy was a living single queen with a lot tee
So while my wallet's piling with symbolic colored paper
I lace her, 'cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
20, why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
Into a Grammy winning schizophrenic fucking orphan
Oops I meant bastard, a skinny ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her masters
Son lies about, taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard
Start a fuckin' cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fuckin' shitty article in Thrasher
I'm not crazy, I'm a fucking table, I'm a fucking table!
I'm a grab the Nina and find a nice arena
'Cause I can't even choose between Ortega or Suprema
And I'm not even human, I'm a body shaped demon
With some semen in my sack and some problems in the back
And a life that's full of crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat that's filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one like a marriage in a church
But this marriage has a hearse and the parents of the one
That's getting married has a curse and it's made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse but, wait it gets worse
All the guests that's in the church, all decided to disperse
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse
So they tied the knot, now it's too late to reverse
This arrangement (Yes it is) and the nurse is amazed at the hurt
That he was painting but it was obvious in all the photos
He was paining, now a bunch of whispering immerse
And then the nurse blurts
(What the fuck is his problem, here, we have two doses to give him, here)
Why didn't anybody ask him first?
(I've been asking you this whole time)
Because nobody gave a fuck
(Someone gave a fuck Tyler
And, uh, the person that gave a fuck was me
See, you're not, going crazy, it's me, I'm your best friend Tyler
I know everything, I know everything about you
You've been helping yourself this whole time
Your friends, they're just figments of your imagination
Dr. TC, see Tyler, I'm your conscience
I'm Tron Cat, I'm Ace, I'm Wolf Haley, I'm...)

She lives next door
To the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text, I get pissed when I get no reply
(It's this girl)
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I ain't beating richard up
The mental images her face looked
The closest that I got was when I'm poking her on facebook
(This girl)
Video chats are so exciting,
'Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible, and I just wanna take it like a pirate (aargh)
(This girl)
I see her in class
Not really two doors down, but any time that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, aw my shit's getting hard
Some thoughts of dating this bitch
(It's this girl)
Her name is my password (...fuck)
(This girl)
All my niggas got they bitches and stuff
But all the bitches, they fuck
I know these bitches is sluts
But she's special, I know to y'all I come off as rough
But I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur
A relation, I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharin' straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holdin' hands walkin' home
I look past that, the fact she's fucking guys that I hate
But...
(This girl)
Things are looking great, cut copy
Last time that we talked, she said her relationship was rocky
Now that mr. faggot's gone, their's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the roxies
(This girl)
Next day, metro's taking me home
I see her in a cut at wendy's, but she's not alone
Who's that guy, wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her?
Come to find out she got back with her... nigga...
(Damn)
Damn...
Fuck...
(It's this girl) 
She's so pretty, fuck self pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage, but if she replied
Or say anything, I'mma smile, I know
What do I do with myself? sit in my room for some days
Play xbox with piles full of wet socks, fuck that
(This girl)
My nigga asked ""ace, what happened to such and such?""
I her name, and then, tell em' I probably fucked
Or I could tell 'em the truth and say she didn't like me much
But instead I lie and say she moved to nebraska...

Next line will have 'em like ""Woah""
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One me, two feet, three mmms
Four, five, six years ago sucked
Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized
'Cause Vans fucked up
I'ma read commas, you gon' leave comments
Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'ma keep sporting
All smiles over here
Shout out to The Garden
(Tick tock)
(And that's a fact boy!)
And I just handle all my business like a chess board
(Tick tock, tick, tock)
And at them Golf boys?
That's my motherfucking set, boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
I'm getting neck from a broad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And I break orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loaf of
Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa
What's that thick odor?
Young Millie T
A young, focused black boy, oh silly me

Better talk shit

Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down
I'm Lil Boosie, Lil Boosie, way I wipe down
(Boy I ain't got time!)
Yeah right now
'Cause niggas dying every day and I ain't light brown
And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no post
So I went and did a 12-page spread in Vogue

Turn around and remap route

Feelings could get thrown in the air.

I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fall back
For example, ten minutes can go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost latch, the fucking thought of you With somebody else
I don't like that cellular convo's getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts. (fuck)
I love you.
(Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good.)
I fucking hate you,

Girl you fucking with my emotions,
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking.
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house,
My bitch is the raddest,
Crazy who makes me the happiest,
Could make me the saddest.
Look Alice,
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me.
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving,
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing,
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you,
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude,
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like god damn vegans,
'Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing.
I love you so much that my heat stops beating when your leaving,
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding,
Life without you has no god damn meaning
Sorry I'm passive aggressive for no god damn reason,
It's that my mood change like these god damn seasons,
I'll fall for you, but I love you.

But I love you.

He loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he shake Junt
Bringin' pops to school today for twelve years I cheated
Told the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meeting and
Bring that dude to life then he wasn't at the meeting
Made a U-turn on the weather like the fuck am I thinking
Birthdays, Christmas my only fucking wishlish was CD's
And a new fitted instead I got some CD's
I hated, some Ritalin, some white socks
I was hyper 'cause I didn't get attention from my real pops
Cops say I'm supposed to be in jail but they don't know it's me

My squad bring terror, no intended pun
Merch booth made niggas extensive funds
Momma got the Rover with the Range
She don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again
And I put that on my dead grandmother's name... too soon
Grandmother died, didn't cry not a tear
I got a lot of fuckin' wind no water dripped out the eye
But when I got the news, yup it left your boy stuck
'Cause when my mom dipped out she was the one that gave me a fuck
Mom callin' and callin', I'm on my way to a show
I answer, she cryin' sayin' Sadie is dyin'
The doc said she only had a week for us to speak
Before she deceased, cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up
Fuck, nah this is really awkward for me bruh
I hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back
And started to think, like ""What the fuck just happened?""
I never had a death and I just seen her a week ago
Meet them at the hospital I should
In between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD
Lionel asked what happened I said it's bad bad, not good
Just take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood
Gettin' there, family sittin' center chair
Awkard in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air
Getting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there, there's a room
Open up the curtain, she's just sitting there, hello
Our conversations brief, couldn't even make eye contact when we speak
Lookin' at her you could tell all she had was weak
And I'm not talkin' days bruh, I'm talkin' 'bout her strife
I sat there 20 minutes tops, hopin' it was just a fuckin' plea that she could cop
She died that night
Oh that's heavy man, I'm sorry for your loss
Yeah whatever, don't worry about it...
Last time I seen Sammy he was lookin' for you
Fuck that nigga Sammy
Uh... Have you seen him?
Nah but if I seen that nigga I woulda killed 'em"

Well, first off
My only problem is death
Fuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing her neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked
My hands trembled, my finger's slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she sad now, her son is dead
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm getting older, getting bolder but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of the Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop but I listen like death drones
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me
Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, I'm kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, defend people for the hell of it
Because I am the devil, fucker get on my level
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Mo Unique Parker, but a little darker, I'll see you in a couple
Tyler, here's some water man
You seem a little tense... how is Thebe?
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
But fuck that, you're shitty parents, face it, suck it up
That's what you shoulda did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bro
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up
But I never had a drink, ""Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!""
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feeling I be feeling when I'm sobered up
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that I'm
As emotionally strained as Travis when he's... (Tyler, calm down)
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5"" about to fucking cry
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming ""O.F. is the best""
The other ear I got Tron Cat asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit
'Cause I don't know how to... (Whoa)
All I want is her support, whenever the fight's at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knives get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis pad with a backpack
For the whole week full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like this house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends at
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
""Message from GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat""
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, now I already want my life back
One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human
'Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
You niggas can't harm me cause you all know that
We at the fuckin' dirty lifer's laundry (Tyler, calm down) nigga get off me
Fuck off me man, fuck (What's got into you?)
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (Yeah, you..)
As though I got a fucking voice in my head
Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (Yeah, what's this?)
I don't fucking know, man (What's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)
He tells me to do this shit that I don't wanna fucking do (What's his name?)

Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics are
Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back

Step two: run to your radio, turn this shit off

On the wall, tall on excursions, I'm a virgin of swap meets

Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid but I'm growing up so they missin'
I didn't mean to hurt anybody I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the army
I'm hardly ever angry, roger rabbit framed me

Middle finger missing so I can not give a fuck
I can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck
So I'm chasing the dreams, no realities

Long as I can feel my heart tap like happy feet

So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted
I drive by piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
But all I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself than fuck with their fleece
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?
One day, ""Fuck no,"" the next day, ""Okay""
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four
I just want that garden and that Batmobile
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles
Now keep it pushin', nigga
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Fuck, okay, next one
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Gotta watch out for the potholes
Ooh, said watch out for the potholes

In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether or not they got one
Tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, ""Fuck shit""
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, till I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the B's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids like, ""Fuck it, start being yourself""
These fucking rappers got stylists 'cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Poseurs looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page sixty-four
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on ten of my songs
Look at that mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the nine and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, ""Hi,"" I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd, that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
Analog fans are getting sick of the rape
All the Tron Cat fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?

So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But mama, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I'm seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs

And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry)
Full of shit, like I ate that John
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
With nice homes, 41k's, and nice ass lawns
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
Like Ellen Degeneres clitoris is playing with dick
I'm jealous as shit, 'cause I ain't got no home meal to come to

Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery

You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr

It was hilarious, well it ain't fucking funny now
I'll push this fucking pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground
I step through the stomach, replace the baby with some fucking pounds
""My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds""
'Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks
I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank

Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went Down South but I ended up North
Uptown sittin' on Cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm tryna let the force, be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga's night turn day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello
I wanna eat you out like jello
And mess with your body like the base and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello, you wanna go to prom? (Nigga hell no!)
Fuck (Shit) and another one, and on another one
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss
I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me
But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's
I wanna tie her body up and throw her in my basement
Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went
(Tyler, what you doin'?) Shut the fuck up
You gon' fuckin' love me bitch
But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
In private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake I will eat and your toes

I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't gotta love me
I'm serious, I don't ask for much
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch
Now this shit is turnin' to a habit
I'm the Burger King, I gotta have it my way
And truthfully girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive
L-O-L laughin', you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'
And I want your sin in my hole, and have our kids play supportin' role
Climbin' up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold
And I was in loath, I would never get over you, ever, Sarah
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss
Half your body layin' on my chest
The rest is in my stomach, that's includin' your breast
And I'mma just take another guess
Now you probably wishin' that you woulda said yes
Am I crazy? Maybe, but fucked up is how I been lately
Shit, I don't give a fuck, your family lookin' for you, wish 'em good luck
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
Now you stuck up in my motherfuckin' basement all bloody
And I'm fuckin' your dead body, your coochie all cummy

And she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel
Light skinned women, all sex everything

Intimidated by niggas you can't be
I'm a G, and this is something you can't see

Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, Mac and Cheese

But I ate that whole plate like a fat bitch dinner
I'm never the winner, always the loser
I don't choose to win, but I will choose her
Her kitty-cat fish loves his tuna
I never use a fork I always spoon her
Go nuts, instrumental flow much
European model white bitch is eatin' donuts
Fuck you faggots, I'm with a fat bitch
Makin' shit come like I'm go-go gadget

Wake up, wash ass, go and eat some Rosco's
Head back to the studio and munch up on some tacos
When I was younger I was bitchin' in
Now I'm coming quicker than the shit that's swimmin' in my sock hole
When them teeny boppers ain't around so Johnson and Johnson baby lotion
Bead on my Johnson till my cock swole
Stop sayin' sick shit it's kinda old

Have you heard my brother verse on Llama?

Get a stainless steel AK and aim it
To the fucking referees head and put his lifeless body
In a choke hold, uh-oh, these niggas is loco
Best thing smokin' is all of the tobacco
Still hard to be black well
Malcolm X would be proud this white bitch is getting black mailed
Blue wide cracker named Ginny, and skinny
And Obama wanted change, I threw a couple fucking pennies at him
Just a chip off the old block
Chipped tooth got some dick off my swole cock
'Cause I bag bitches, she's a zip off the old lock
And that's just a logo on the center of that old box
Oh stop, tryna be me, kids will go cop anything
That I put on from the gold watch to the boxers that I put on

Oh shit, you're as hard as senior citizens dick
Oh fuck, don't slip break hips and pop backs
Show some respect to old chaps with my left fist
'Cause I'm the next best spitting wreck that's left here
That's my ex bitch, heard she's my next bitch
Have you met her mouth? No? Oh that's my bestest
Bestie, and she gets beastie
And she's my favorite babysitter cause the children never exit
I was taught to act my shoe size, I'm eleven and a half
Cock the umbrella 'cause when I spit Seven on your ass

Making red look like less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist

Put her in the lake, her body seems great
Now it's time to fish her, like Derrick
Satan's us, we're dangerous

They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex Mix, she's bleeding from her rectum

'Cause I'll kill if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch
Press my buttons baby, press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby, yeah
Press my buttons baby, press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby, yeah
Press my buttons baby, press my fucking buttons baby
Press it, stop
Danielle, Danielle, yeah you heard about Raquel
Well that didn't go well, let us try to make it swell
Put the beaver in the mail, we can take it slow like snail
Lock my heart up, this is jail, throw away the key
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um
We can kick it on the couch, blunt you can roll it up
But I'm on some shrooms if you really want to feel the room
I just want to kick it, kick it for the rest
I skated all day, I just need some rest and your breasts
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um
We can count the stars on the hood of your father's car
He's a buster anyway, I can take him any day
Look into your eyes I realize that I like you so much
That was corny, now I'm horny, can I have a kiss?
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um
We both teenagers with the same mind state
How about some ice cream and some South Park for this first date?
Your cat is waiting for that raw fish I can't wait, get it?
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um"

Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga, California
I ride to California
These frog oval goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simp-Sun shining on me
Slick circles floating
Out this world
Yeah yeah
Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)
Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that may just be my ego
But don't be too cool, you may freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton, water your garden my nigga and stunt
(Stunt on these niggas)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man, it feels like I'm winning
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
But they forget when I get in my car
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simp Sun shining on me
Slick circles floating
Vro we off this world
Run it, run it, run it, yeah
I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I grow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I-
(Let's go!)
Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a little while, nigga making leaves
Keep 'em in the branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is strong
Giving niggas life like birdies and the beez
Dropping them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk... tree
Ah, shit!
Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it"

Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T
Who dat boy? Who him is?

Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?

Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
(Yeah, let 'em know, nigga) And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so frío
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way, way, boy that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone
Call me, call me, call me, uh

(Intro: Dr. TC)
Tyler we ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you
(Verse 1: Domo)
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gonna make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world
(Verse 2: Frank)
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself and cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through
And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?
(Verse 3: Hodgy)
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we working, premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream till it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world
(Verse 4: Mike)
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world
(Interlude: Tyler)
Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?
(Verse 5: Tyler)
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet but when I do
Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages that
Could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout (Can we get backstage man?)
No, faggot, it's sold out (Come on why you holding out
I though we was boys, without me, you wouldn't be Tyler the Creator
You're from the Derby, I can tell whenever you perform
A leopard can't change it's spots) But I'm a fucking unicorn
(Whatever man) Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach ""Fuck age, live dreams, and have fun""
(Here's some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero
And they fear it when they hear it when that little fucker's reciting my lyrics
Yeah rebel nigga cheer it, dead parents everywhere
It's smelling like teen spirit... okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building"

And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver (oh)
Green paper, gold teeth and pregnant gold retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
