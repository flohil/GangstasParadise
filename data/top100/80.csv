0,All I Said,2000,"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3: Streetsoul (2000)",,Guru,"Yo my girl's heated
'Cause I told her I was busy workin and I couldn't talk
I told her I'd call her back later and she still got mad
That was all I said, word up
Why she buggin if I promised that I'd call her back
Of course I'm honest plus I'm keepin' things all intact
I be stressed out baby, sometimes on my grind
And on my mind, is a paperchase with minimal time
She should know how it goes - I'm, still into her
I got feelings for her, I been caring for her
But really though; I mean she ought to know the deally-yo
Especially if I'm in a meeting or out shooting a video
I love her yo, but I'm just doin' my job
Ain't no need for confusion what I'm doin' is hard
I'm the type of man, with a serious type of plan
I'm calmer no drama, no need for gettin' hyper
And upset with me, because I'm busy a lot
And if I could you know I would, bring her with me a lot
Ain't nuttin wrong word is bond, it's all in her head
I was handling some business, and that's all I said
All, I, said... I'll call you later
Sometimes, I forget
I love you baby don't be... so upset
I'll call you later is all, I said...
I'm confessin no question yeah I chill with my boys
Still she gotta keep it real, either build or destroy
This is deep right here, she completes my square
Without a doubt, if she needs, I'ma be right there
This world is crazy, she's supposed to help me stay sane
Supposed to help with the pain, supposed to help me maintain
And quote this, I'm focused on the dreams we share
I got her all up in my mix, so it means I care
This job of mine goes on and on, twenty-four hours a day
And with trust we can win, in a powerful way
When I get home, I'm gonna love her down
I'll be like Teddy, get some hot oils, and rub her down
I know she's bored, feels ignored, all by herself alone
And she hates it, when I turn off my cell phone
But it's all right don't wanna fight, it's all in her head
I was takin' care of business, and that's all I said
All, I, said... I'll call you later
Sometimes, I forget
I love you baby don't be... so upset
I'll call you later is all, I said...
(Baby when you're speakin' like that, it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine; I'll crush you
Baby when you're speakin' like that, it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine; I'll crush you)
I think we are ready
(We're ready as we'll ever be, girl your love is heavenly)
What we gonna do now
(We gon' do what we gotta do, I wanna see a lot of you)
Just you keep it steady
(I'm steady and secure you couldn't ask for more)
C'mon let's work it out
(Aight)
Just don't hurt me now
(Nah baby)
All, I, said... I'll call you later
Sometimes, I forget
I love you baby don't be... so upset
I'll call you later is all, I said...
(Baby when you're speakin' like that, it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine; I'll crush you
Baby when you're speakin' like that, it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine; I'll crush you)
I love you, baby
All, I, said... all I said... I forget
I love you baby don't be (so mad) so upset"

2,Cave In,2005,Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures (2005),,Guru,"(Guru)
Got games stirrin out my brain and thangs
With my 7 Grand style I remain the king
Now Poochie shot Derek for a diamong ring
While a player took his wife on an island fling
I desire to swing, take you under my wing
I run you rap kids; y'all my underlings
The G-U-R-U, kick many notes for you
I keep a local crew, we keep the toast for you
I'm a peaceful man, on a Godly quest
But don't ever disrespect 'cause I hardly jest
I got too many soldiers and get too much love
Still ride till it's over plus they bust slugs
I ain't overreactin I'm takin' over the action
It's my time nigga, you know what's happenin'
Try to play me, at this point in the game?
Must have a death wish, or an interesting pain
(Guru)
Let's see if you can hang and bang with this momentum
Heads turn, when my name gets mentioned
A lot of cats owe me for the game I lent 'em
Phony fuck, he just out for the fame, I straight check him
The black Paulie, comin' up the back hallway
Schemin on your contracts 'cause I'm that hoary
These days I can't afford to let shit ride
It ain't a phase, I'm stayin till we get shit right
You ain't supposed to mix business, with pleasure
But I do the one and overcome, I'm in this forever
They wonder if the God's still nice
That's like askin if this blowtorch here can kill lice
Can I try it on you? I tried to warn you
You in deep like these niggaz pulled out iron on you
I gave you instructions you failed to follow
Too late for tomorrow, time to taste these hollows~!
(Guru)
Late night get my grub on, the flavor big
Back in the hood get my love on, the cake looks big
I'm the O.G. you come to when you need advice
Leave this real shit alone boy you need a life
My persona was made from scars, mental and physical
You don't wanna violate kid, it'll be critical
I'm thirsty, and plus I'm built for this son
I'm 'bout to run through more cities than Atilla the Hun"

4,Choice Of Weapons,1995,"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality (1995)",,Guru,"(Feat. DC Lee, Gus Da Vigilante (Stikken Moov))
(Chorus x2: Guru and Stikken Moov)
What's the question? Why are you flexin
Here's the answer - choice of weapons
(Stikken Moov 1)
Yo +The ? Remainz+, kid why you flexin like a bicep
Heat on your hip, just to get a rep, it ain't worth it
Just because you pack a biscuit, doesn't mean you can't
Become another statistic, you figure it
Life's a gamble even for vandalz, I handle mine with minds
Only unless, my chest is under pressure in a contest
The fear of layin in wreck, causes the stress
I have to adjust to this mess and pull when it's best
(Guru)
Yo little big man, feelin' your oats, because you're strapped?
Bustin' a cap at another kid who's black?
It ain't all that when the shots are flyin back
You made a choice, and the choice you made was wack
Kinda tipsy with the liquid confidence
Pullin your pistol when it doesn't make sense
To be the bigger man you figure
But in the end it don't pay when you're livin' by the trigger
(Guru)
Yeah it's the master of the who what where and the why
But still I got a problem with seein my brothers die
I've been around and lived past the average age of us
In every obituary, a full page of us
The game is money, but what about inner wealth?
The mental, the spiritual, and physical health
But still everyday the city is a test
That's why some people feel a gun is the best
(Stikken Moov 2)
No doubt I pack protection, but every altercation
Or situation doesn't deserve blastin, I mastered precisions
Choice of weapon, should I peel or peel out?
My choice of routes may decide my whereabouts
(Stikken Moov 2)
I pack no weapons then the seargeant bargin in
Ready to bomb a rapper like Saddam, Stikken Moov swarm
Ready to bust off, like Ron Jeremy, but I chill G
Relax and consider lucky to live to see a quarter past three
(Guru)
That's why I, wield the steel, yes my microphone is crazy real
I'm not the one sellin out to get the mass appeal
But jail cells are filled with my peeps
While the rest are gettin' killed in these ill ass streets
(Guru)
So, pick your weapon, a mic or a gun
I make a sucker run when my tongue stuns, check it
Leavin' the spot, I seen some wild kids
One stepped to me asked me to freestyle kid
Meanwhile, he flexed a burner on his side
I looked him in the eye, smiled, and walked to my ride
He was actin' kinda hard on the surface
I said to myself that it really wasn't worth it
(Stikken Moov 1)
Yo you think you're all that, cause you pack heat?
Seein your own brother play the concrete, in defeat
Tryin' to prove yourself, while you put the next man down
But what goes around, comes back, black best believe that
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's all the real heads all over the world
That realize, that this music is real
That we keep it real like that
Peace to all my brothers on the third
And all the real brothers in hip-hop
It's like a rap's new generation thing baby
Peace to Guru
It's Panche, the wild comanche, suicide"
5,Collectin' Props,2001,Baldhead Slick & Da Click (2001),,Guru,"(Feat. Killa Kaine, Mr. Moe, Pete Powers)
(Guru)
Yeah, I'ma start collectin props, connectin plots
Networkin like a conference 'cause the nonsense it yet to stop
Police shake me down, which gangsta movie you like? This is real trife
Real life -- wanna get ya shot in the game, and earn some real stripes
Just like Feds magazine you couldn't imagine the battered scene
You get shot up by little niggaz wearin gabberdeans (?)
I'm tired of lookin' like Malcolm, in the window though
Unpack the strap, Baldhead Slick smokin' indo yo
I'm not gonna speak on the personal, street business
As long as Moe and King keep witness, it's Sunzu Part 2
Bring your guards too, never knew the depth of my crew
Although I'm God-body, Baldhead Slick used to be a nobody
Niggaz didn't know that my crew's thick
(Killa Kaine)
Aiyyo we killa hungry, I turn food back guerilla monkey
Once I do that, nobody ain't healin and comfy
I make niggaz come out the rugbies
Talk shit, I'll kill ya company
Your for that jake, take my head I'll fake my death
They wanna kill me 'cause they hate my strength
That's why they vote when I raise the M
And let go, hollow fights from Expo
Hear my tec blow, my tec blow electro
Thou which is set pose, these streets is Death Row
One through ya neckbone, jerk back ya headphone
Nigga pop to that, you talk heat, hope you got the gat
Who can amount to this? Sit back and pour a ounce of Cris'
Bump a ounce to this, watch the bouncer get
Testamentic, wild out, we gon' press ya district
Sign out, or pull ya nines out and test ya biscuits
Ain't no talkin' once ya head is twisted (son)
Ain't no talkin' once ya head is twisted
(Chorus x2: Guru)
I'ma start collectin props, connectin plots
Networkin like a conference, 'cause the nonsense it yet to stop
Jakes shake me down, haters wanna take me down
Break it down {*gunshot*} blaow, all they heard was the sound
(Mr. Moe)
Fuck rappin' bout hamburgers
I'ma rap about murders, flippin work, and thirty burners
The only thing cookin on the stove, is crack in the pot
We flip pies like Jack In The Box
My .44 be blastin the cops, I mastered the block
My cousin's a NARC, said sleep in the day, come out when it's dark
Niggaz'll test ya heart - Black Rhinos rip a vest apart
Anybody doubt, fuck it we knockin' 'em out
Trinidad style with a body-shot, loud like when a Rotti' bark
Cold John Gotti heart
Can't be broke, ain't no joke, yes I smoke, wooden 'dro
Five oh-oh, summer '99, I seen the snow
Fuck the DEA and CEO - it's sour dough nigga, Mr. Moe nigga...
[Guru] Collectin props, collectin props
(Pete Powers)
I throw punk niggaz through cement walls, and break sheetrock
Compound sound before the beat drop -- beat break
I shake shit like Japanese earthquakes
Thunderstorm, sweaty palms, grab firearms
Blisters on my soles, runnin' on hot coals from po-po
Ya faced-off, get scraped off my windshield, I been healed
Rapped up in my turban, green colored Suburban
Bleach fuck a detergent...
I whip ass and kick ass and clear paths with blowtorches
Burn down fortresses, and crack foreheads like porcelain
I got a habit for the beef
Put ya soul on a hole of the earth where it's mad deep
Don't let that coal burn ya back
My name is Pete Power, burn ya gat
The devil made me mad, tell him to send me a kite
And I'ma send one back with autographs from murder fans...
(Chorus fading out)"
6,Count Your Blessings,1995,"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality (1995)",,Guru,"Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had

Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(I say to thee well count your blessings)
I remember when I used to get depressed
Overwhelmed by the stress
Feeling my life was the illest mess
Always dwelling on the stuff that wasn't right
And staring at the four walls in my room all night
Searching for a way to cope
The situation shaky like I'm walkin' on a tightrope
But now I see it's time to get a handle
And take control of things
So for me, I'ma light a candle
And other people got it worse
I get a lot of love, so I ought give my thanks first
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(I said you better count your blessings)
Too many times I asked, ""Why me?""
And I recall when things weren't goin' how they 'sposed to be
Yeah I know you dig what I'm relayin
And now I find myself devoting more time to praying
I ain't saying that I don't do no wrong
I'm saying I ain't trying to sing no more sad songs
I got mad responsibilities
I'm building with my family, my loved ones depend on me
I've got no time for envy nor for hate
My inner power's too strong
To let such evil penetrate
The world around is in chaos
But I'd rather seek the truth to be found
Than to be lost
Experience is always the best teacher
Look at the signs, feel the vibes, I'm tryin' to reach ya
I see how much now that one should be grateful for
And we must help the others who can't find a open door
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Now as we head into the year 2000
And more and more people can't even get decent housing
Poor education in the schools
And poor employment structures, so some choose illegal tools
By all means, you know we must survive, but think
The energy we give always comes back to us in time
We must decide to make the proper choices
Or the only thing we'll hear is the cries and the screaming voices
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times I felt bad
Too many times I couldn't see what I really had
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had

Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had

Didn't I tell you not to come around here with that shit
Huh?! Get down!

Yo I keep my enemies close, now I'm ready to squeeze
Watch 'em all cry, and make 'em get on they knees
""Cry... cry..."" - ""I want you to cry!""
""Yes I want you to get on your knees and cry!""
Get on your knees and cry, you know the reason why
You ungrateful motherfucker, can't believe you lied
You tried to fake me, snake me 'cause my heart is good
I knew you would, you played the role as hard as you could
Revenge is my ammo - black whip, tinted windows
Relentless is my wrath, we in the mix like chemicals
Why I'm actin' that way? 'Cause this ain't back in the days
Still hold a grudge, old man thug about to blast you away
I'll straggle ya plot, effortlessly, with one thought
This is way past guntalk, so many blocks I done rocked
You didn't know that I was thorough, did you?
5 Boroughs of crews, I'm bout to bury you dudes

""Cry..."" - ""I want you to cry!""
""Yes I want you to get on your knees and cry!""

Yo, look me in the eye, and explain to me why
That I should let things slide, we used to be on the same side
Now it's all twisted, and we no longer kick it
You had your chance to advance with me bitch, you missed it
It's too late to beg or plead, too late for apologies
Stop leavin' messages, word stop calling me
See I got a nice little treat for you
I'ma make it crazy tough in these streets for you
I don't wanna hear nothin', 'cause I called your bluff
You call yourself buck, my click'll flip and fuck you up
Punks that don't know me think I'm mellow and calm
But my peeps they know, I'm wild, gully, and slightly gone
Yo stupid, you bout to catch the whole can of this
Whoop ass, you shook fast, you shit your pants on this
I'm never losin mine, I don't feel like doin' time
But I still ain't gonna have nobody foolin with mine

""Cry..."" - ""I want you to cry!""

Anger management -- yeah I probably need that
You feelin' my feedback, just stay down on your knees cat
You quiet, that's 'cause you afraid of dying
Afraid of losin yo' head when my lead start flying
You can't be serious, try to fuck with my career in this
100 soldiers every city, you suckers can't come near Da Click
I don't even got the time for the likes of you
So what I'd like to do, is finish with those like you
Just for schemin, boy you coulda made it, but you hated
So now you gon' find out that the pain is excrutiating
So fuck what you be sayin', 'cause nobody heard
This is a dirty game, I'm takin' all your chips, that's my word
(Samples] [x4)
""Cry..."" - ""I want you to cry!""

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
(I'm walkin' down the backstreets)
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
(I be walkin' down the backstreets)
Yo, here goes some info on my flow and how I move
To a def groove, I keep my rep smooth
On the down-low, I travel with my mind to the street
Concrete, like the gravel I'm in deep
So I gotta hit ya from a real perspective
Cause anyone who's talkin' that crap, will surely get his
I'm not the one to act flashy
Cause man where I be at, we don't have to be classy
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets

While you're out there, on the main streets frontin
Your game's week, so I'm huntin you down clown
Cause you need to learn somethin'
All that bluffin, won't get you nothin' but killed
No mission fulfilled, because there's others who will
Get jealous, hell if they can take clout from you, they'll do it
So that's what I'm about to do, I'll step to it
And strip you of your pride (your pride)
And then I'll stick and I'll rip you up from all sides
Or possibly I'll let you slide, slime
'Cause you'll set your own death in just a matter of time
Yeah, and I'll be somewhere on the sidelines, y'know
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets

So when you're lookin' for me, here's where I'll be
I'll be walkin' down the backstreets in your vicinity
'Cause I been out here for a few
So all that you're doin', ain't really nothin' new (nothin' new)
I peeped the way you always perpetrate
You're so phony, you make me wanna regurgitate
Since you're ridin' so high, you're bound to fall
While I stand tall, and you don't get no props at all out here
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
(Walkin' down the backstreets)
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
(I be walkin' down the backstreets)
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
(Walkin' down the backstreets)
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
(It's the backstreets)
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets
(In your backstreets)
Down the backstreets, is a mind state
'Cause I don't have to be a pop star to rhyme great
I've been out here observin things
So now all fake gangsters and pranksters I'm servin'
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm the king
Come down the backstreets where it's dark
I'ma snatch your heart
So get a handle on life and quit livin' so trife
Or else we're gonna have to run up, and SMACK all the weak
Comin' straight from the backstreets
And I'm out, ninety-three, it's all me"
9,False Prophets,2005,Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures (2005),,Guru,"Bars are sick, I spit phlegm in the form of gems
Listen how I kiss it, watch the storm begin
Harsh winds and never coming, down pouring
Cats be faking jacks, don't know what they're down for
The seven and a half combine over the front line
The ten percenters, promoting slander with the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins, heavenly praise and dues are paid
They placed him on pedestals, named him the hottest
A dawn with riches, women and gold objects
They spoke confederate and not to the people
Trying to numb off thought like shots from a needle
I peep these cocksuckas, their ways and actions
The center of attention, the main attraction
If they were authentic, you think the fame would trap 'em
Now cypher, they all up in the game just acting
The worst thing for them is when one does emerge
Who exposes that fake shit and rattles their nerves
A lot of niggaz switch sides 'cause it's convenient
They fronting like they down for the hood but they don't mean it
I seen it, suckas with their hidden agendas
Turning their backs to the streets while they're living in splendor
And this right here is no small topic
Trickery is in the air, so beware of the false prophets
Bars are sick, I spit flem in the form of gems
Listen how I kiss it, watch the storm begin
Harsh winds, and never coming, down pouring
Cats be faking jacks, don't know what they're down for
The seven and a half combine, over the front line
The ten percenters, promoting slander with the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins, heavenly praise and dues are paid
As they laugh and smile, and sip on their drinks
They disgust me, they can get spit on an ink
I sit and I think how determined they make me
Demonic rap clowns from the PJ's, they hate me
Greedy as hell, always showing fake love
Scared of the real ones, even worse, they fake thugs
Somebody gave 'em money and a platform to kick it from
They speak real well, but I still don't get it, son
Eventually they doomed to fall
And they should get no space to breathe, no room at all
From a long time ago up to this very moment
They been twisting the truth, now I'm their opponent
They take the people's trust and misuse it for power
I'm 'bout to pull the plug and refuse these cowards
And this right here is no small topic
Trickery is in the air, so beware of the false prophets
Bars are sick, I spit flem in the form of gems
Listen how I kiss it, watch the storm begin
Harsh winds, and never coming, down pouring
Cats be faking jacks, don't know what they're down for
The seven and a half combine, over the front line
The ten percenters, promoting slander with the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins, heavenly praise and dues are paid"
10,Feed The Hungry,2005,Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures (2005),,Guru,"Feed the hungry, and house the poor
We gotta save these babies and stop the wars. [x2]
What is success if we can't reach back
And drop a jewel, in today's schools, they don't teach that
Our ancestors were kings and queens, peep that
So called educators need to learn to teach facts
From the slum alleyways and the burned-down apartments
TO the drug infested buildings where the gun rounds be barking
I see promise in the eyes of the babies
Still the death toll and trauma, drive me crazy
I watch how they're making us, I spot where they're taking us
In every neighborhood, the block is hot and dangerous
And what's the point of a fist in the air
If the children are starving, and the men don't care
BUt niggaz don't care, and they don't realize
For us to have the chances we got, many have died
And hear the cries of the innocent ones, the victims of guns
And see how shits wickedly run
Though they might hate my kind, they can't incarcerate my mind
I control my own fate, watch me break these vines
Who else can enlighten the people and fight against evil
Comes against me, and your plight will be legal
You know they gonna start another war again
We got a few good men, but there's much more of them
And I doubt we'll see another Martin or Malcolm
'Cause the rims and the blimps, have distored the outcome
And how come, we'd rather floss than get our souls right
Still some stay up hustlin the whole night
I Guess that's why we got war in our own hoods
'Cause we can't even save ourselves, for our own good
And what don't kill you can make you stronger
Keep procrasinating, it'll take you longer
But in these trouble times, so many troubled minds
I see them rocking us to sleep like a lullaby
It's easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't get caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
It's easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't get caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
(Female singer)
WE gotta stop the war. Save the children. Yeah
Feed the hundry, house the poor. We gotta save
The babies and stop the war. [Voice fades out]"

Times like this make me clench my fist
Then I'm caught up in the midst of the musical bliss
Guru, blow a kiss to the ladies in my corner
Caress the mic and kick my game like I wanna
What? You never see the brother Guru falter
Respect is due, praise me like the altar
The crew we're as true as they come son, we come from
Ill life experience, and take rap serious

Make one false move and with the mic, I'll bust ya
Just lay back and feel the music
Music! [x3]
(Guru)
When I step into the club, I come to do work
No hesitation, because I'm fully alert
Like Max Julien, I'm an authentic Mack
Many others can't compare, I'll bet on that
Dialect and vocal tone, completely exact
I react, then I max in this mellow track
In fact, I'm knockin' MC's out the frame
'Cause I'm smooth like jazz, Guru is my name
Feel the music *echoes*
Music! [x1]
(Guru)
New reality... a higher level of consciousness
Don't play yourself; get out of line and get stomped with this
Negativity is a chronic disease
But I'm like the cure, causin infections to freeze
I'm not gonna let up, until you get the picture
My sound gets around so you know I'm always with ya
Feel the music *echoes*

For you, dedicated true
I'm doin' this one for you
For you, dedicated true
I'm doin' this one for you
(Guru)
To my moms and my pops, I'm glad you stayed together
I don't know too many people to demonstrate true love better
Nowadays kids don't have anyone
But you were there and determined, to make me get plenty done
Yes to achieve although a lot of times I hurt you
But I'm matured now, I'm showin you my true virtue
As I deliver to you, an oath of neverending love
Admiration and respect, for there is nothing above
A mother's strength and a father's concern
There was guidance, no matter which way I turned
Yo pops if I could be half the man you are I'd be a star
Moms thanks for pushin me real far
As I proceed through the tundra, and harsh winds
I think reviewin what you've instilled within
So I'm takin' time out to let you know
Once a boy now a man thanks for helpin me grow
(Guru)
Goin' out to my peoples, for all the times we've spent
Fifty deep up in the party gettin' crazy stupid bent
Around the block puffin lye, cruisin in the car
Whatever we was doin' I won't forget it Baby Pah
When I had no dough, you were there
You hooked me with some ends, to show me that you cared
You stood by me through the ups and downs
While the other fakin clowns tried to start hangin' around
See you were always genuine
That's why respect is due, and I got you on my mind
A lot of people might not understand the way we click
We're rollin' thick, hittin harder than a ton of bricks
With all the drama and the phony personas
I'd rather check my man so we can share some knowledge
If the streets were college, some MC's would flunk out
Sendin shouts to my peeps, crazy love no doubt
(Guru)
A true friend kid, is mad mad rare
Trustin others is a risk, a lot of things ain't fair
'Cause where I be at, a lot of strange things happen jack
You can know a kid for years and still he'll stab you in the back
But that's all right 'cause I'm a good judge of character
And me and my family, we maintain the balance to
Master the challenges of life
Like the chain and the star, we link up to shine mad bright
To all my boys way across the country
Dealin' with the struggle, the good the bad and the ugly
Yo under pressure we're the best
No matter what the circumstance no matter how much stress
Our force has the power, to bring forth change
I'd rather see us succeed than feel shame or go insane
Dedicated to my fam that supported
You shall always, I said always be applauded"
13,Guidance,2000,"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3: Streetsoul (2000)",,Guru,"Dedicated to my son, that's about to be born
So by the time you people hear this record, my son'll be born
And I gotta teach him about life
Listen
To my little man
You can never have too little plans
Always bring your game direct, cut out the middle man
Life is full of sacrifice, for truth you might have to fight
Someone'll bring you down
'Cause they ain't livin' right
Be sure to use your mind, though
Look for all the signs, yo
Don't want to make a move too quick and get left behind, yo
Be in command of whatever you encounter
Appreciate your blessings, son, you'll see what it amounts to
Obtaining your goals, maintainin control
Self-respect helps you to protect your soul
Never give up, always be ready to try
Walk your own walk, and keep your head to the sky
Little thing now here you are
Staring at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep, eat, and cry
But one day you're gonna be askin me why
Everything I know I'm gonna tell you about
Anything I don't you'll figure out
Cause living is learnin and learnin is livin'
And then you pass it on
And to my home boys, who clearly understand
What it really takes to be a man and what it means to be the head of fam
The ups and downs of life plus the choices we make
Causes to reevaluate directions we take
And being up in the club is mad fun till they act dumb
And everyone still packs guns whether nines or mac one-ones
It's time now for us to separate the mediocre from the great
Keep all the jokers from the game
I've played my position, so why don't you try to play yours
I've made my decision, plus you're in my prayers
My life is changed now, plus I got a shorty now
Mad responsibilities, it's like I'm almost forty now
All the young girls wanna swing, my wife says she wants a ring
I wonder what the next days, are gonna bring
We must live and fight for the right causes and be ready to die
I love you kid, so keep your head to the sky
Little thing now here you are
Staring at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep, eat, and cry
But one day you're gonna be askin me why
Everything I know I'm gonna tell you about
Anything I don't you'll figure out
Cause living is learnin and learnin is livin'
And then you pass it on
Baby child did you know
Every since you fell out of the heavens
You make me wanna grow
So I'll share with you everything
Make little girls and boys grow up to be kings and queens
Little thing now here you are
Staring at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep, eat, and cry
But one day you're gonna be askin me why
Everything I know I'm gonna tell you about
Anything I don't you'll figure out
Cause living is learnin and learnin is livin'
And then you pass it on
Little thing now here you are
Staring at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep, eat, and cry
But one day you're gonna be askin me why
Everything I know I'm gonna tell you about
Anything I don't you'll figure out

Dog ruizi, my man Solar on the track. I'm about
To hit one out the park baby. Peep this
You need to put me in the hall of fame
I'm worldwide, a legend in this game. Check the resume
You could put me in the hall of fame
I'm worldwide, a legend in this, Check the resume [x2]
Peep my groundwork, check how it's masterfully laid
Composition when written gets classically made
Start with a concept then collect the beat
Sit and write the bomb shit and rep the streets
Respect my state of mind, I never waste a line
Suckers are featherweight, while I'm heavyweight with mine
I caught more war scars than others profess to
Don't ask me to kick no rap, ask me to bless you
It's special, just like a brand new three-eighty
Have you thrash your CD, 'cause man your forgaize
Or you could catch me with the gods building
You can catch me on the mic, spitting juice to all the god's children
If I sold out, I could've sold millions
But in a minute, I'm about to hold billions
'Cause after the charade, and after the parade
Niggaz got to pay homage, to the master of this trade
My lineage is large, my pilgreamage was hard
But I held down my square, my images of God
I hit the corner like I'm real familiar
I get up on ya like a wise guy will be familiar
And all the haters want to throw me off, bitches want to blow me of
Got die-hard fans, like I'm holy cross
See I'ma put you in your place
Niggaz be shook when they see a crook With triggers in their face
The triple OG's is back in his rest
Scheming on the way, to kill a demon is his quest
I'm planning all the way, got cannons all the way
Got a boat load of artillery, landing on the bay
I never really cared about critical acclaim
Still I never let a punk, try to ridicule my name
And after all the hatin' and all of the debatin'
Niggaz will run to the stage, to see the master conversatin'
I'm like a one-man army, You little bums can't harm me
And don't try to send no little holocs to charm me
The hall of famer with my microphone flamer
The baller trainer with my monotone banger
I travel light years mentally
Essentially I'm wise, as if I've been here for centuries
And after the charade, and after the parade
Niggaz got to pay homage, to the master of this trade
Audience ovations"

Nigga, yo your pussy 'round my format bitch is mad masculine
I have to win, down in the basement with my clownies, I'm blastin it
Thoughts travel past you and,
I cock back, release the speech and travel faster than
A bullet in flight, I ignite the fight
What's the purpose of the black against black or black against white
But whatever color you are, we off you quick fast punk
If you ain't actin' right - so pay homage while we make the farmage
I mean far-mage - hungry like there's no food in my sto-mach

Admit it son, lemme find out you kinda timid son

If it's on you good as gone kid, I'm sayin' if it's me
I'll undress a nigga, to a lesser figga
Gotta press a trigga (BLAOW!) ain't messin witcha
Call shots and end the game early
At the end of the day, playa you blame-worthy
The method I use to freak it, I use it frequent
To ""Scare"" you ""Straight"" like first offenders and juvenile dilinquents
When I, talk that talk, I walk that walk amigo
It's confidence, you probably think it's a hell of an ego

Ricochet, watch it bounce off like kid-neys
The Y-chromosome, +Young God+ own a home
Picture my son _Home Alone_, I'm spittin' fome on a cordless phone
My valium's high, Dark Denim's on, you can ask Karl Kani
Attract urban cells, Colt .45 shells
Shotti shells, seashells in Fort Lauderdale
I love hella right, always smellin' right
Equester you my shit, fuck an express overnight
I'm from Poverty-ville, probably will
'Cause the prob' remain nothin', that's all, my revolver still
Kick fast, corporate thugs learn to kick back
Used to eat three-hundred thousands off a mis-pack
Of crills, who you know could back a deal
Quicker than you can say, ""Yo, crack can kill""?
Murder one, catch a body off of self-defence
My mic rinse be my evidence

Yo, poverty stricken, robbery, guns be clickin'
Forever burnin' in the furnace of afflication
Overdose and drug addictions, thugs who judged by the system
Will suck the blood of the victims
Sacreligious, savage trapped in prison
Adapt the wisdom, they sit back and listen
To the old-timers, the beast out the clothes liners
Bullets claim the lives of miners, and 9-to-5ers
The nine'll find ya, in the line of fire
Skies turn black, I could see your soul, touch a ghost
Drag you through the holes, spit out blue fire
My heart turns cold, never stay true to liars
Imprint marks in your robe, I see black smoke
Dark clouds, I talk to ghosts
I spaz out when my spirit recharge like a volt
Electric eyes open up, ya could see the ebony skies {*echoes*}
(Guru a/k/a Bald Head Slick)
From hot corners to hotter chicks, hoopties to hotter whips
Spit hollow-tip shit like Black Fist at the Olympics
For heartless cowards, time to meet your darkest hour
Allah reps power, one of these fours'll give you lead showers
Faint whispers of hoes schemin' to dis-robe your clothes
Catch you for your platinum, if not, for your white gold
It's all about the code that we were taught to behold
Although the world may be rugged, fuck it, we're thuggin' to soul
Whether it's straight rapin' a hoe to straight makin' the dough
It ain't worth it if you can interpret, yo
Understandin', calls for the best plannin'
Son just copped the best cannons, so y'all best throw ya hand in
Standin' on the mountain top like Martin Luther
Rap tutor, no doubt, tap you the fuck out like Zab Judah
The promised land, here, ain't nuttin' promised, man
Just know how to tell a thief from an honest man
(Black Jesus)
For the love of the link I spit in your face
Gimme some space, the Lord assure to be on your tape
See we kill for pleasure, you war veter's and I hate your guts
In any weather we can get it on and fuck you up
Livin' it up, you got big guns, enough jewels
Had ass before the cash, y'all niggas playin' the fool
Breakin' the rules, I put you where the sun don't shine
Buried alive, my nines make a walnut rhyme
Feelin' me, son? We all about revealin' the gun
Acknowledge the God and know this ain't no one-on-one
It's us on y'all, you posin' wit ya back on the wall
Ready to fall, no mercy when we cut off your balls
Can you picture bein' food for the worms, gaspin' for air?
You learned the hard way, not to come unprepared
See we sacrifice the weak, don't speak unless you spoken to
Evaluate your life, dog, 'cause your blood'll merk you

Yes, Ini Kamoze alongside the Guru
Baby, I got red eyes
What? I got red eyes
I got red eyes, what?
I got red eyes
Gimme the medicine, I am no leprechaun
It's the dealing of the nation
I used to understand, but now I over stand
I'm freaking herbs, man, yes, I am
My skills boom through the smoke filled room
Feeling the contact like the Mack, I then consume
All fools who blunder, so I take them underground
'Cause I got the crazy phat sounds I blend it with jazz
And mystify the masses, huh, we teach blunt rolling classes
My dialect reflects hip-hop at it's best
After I fat burn of cess and, yes, I guess
That you could call it habitual
(Why?)
'Cause everyday is a ritual
Hit from a Thai stick, not come from cocoa whip
My knee gonna never skip 'cause a man like me don't never slip
As we elevate, my ghetto mind state
Cooked like a dove plate but wait, but wait
Red eyes, what? I got red eyes
Huh, tell you what?
Red eyes, what? I got red eyes
Hey
Determined energetic, born to succeed
Independently minded
(Are you ambitious?)
Indeed, new breed and suckers can't compare
To the Master, the truth got you trapped in the square
You're restricted, while I'm unlimited, gifted
And I'm even iller when I'm lifted
Stimulated in the dome on the microphone
After a bone, Guru, why don't you take 'em home?
Yes, I bring heat, so feel the warmth from my free speech
Believe in Ja, the ganja helps me reach
My creative leaves of enlightenment and when I'm writing then
You know just who's on the mic again
Fools on the map, kid, you took a nap kid
Taking me out is an impossible task kid
I spark you up, lock you up, huh, now you gone
You should've paid attention way back when you were warned
You're too into business, I take gifts of my spliff
I change into what an expert will never quiz
The medicine, the medicine, the medicine
Lah will bring us back again
The medicine, the medicine, the medicine
Ja is coming back again
Now I'm coming up, so don't be running up
On my crew, big up, Guru pass the cup
Red eyes, what? I got red eyes
Pass the medicine, I am no leprechaun
It's the dealing of the nation
I used to understand, but now I over stand
I'm freaking herbs, man, yes, I am
Red eyes, I got red eyes
What? I got red eyes
Red, red, red, red eyes
What?"
20,Insert B (The Real Deal) - Nobody Knows,1995,"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality (1995)",,Guru,"So when you think you know the whole
You don't even know the half
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows the insides and out y'all)
What I'm going through
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
What I feel inside
(Nobody knows about the dreams, 'bout the dreams)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows the insides and out y'all)
What I'm going through
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
What I feel inside
(Nobody knows about the dreams, 'bout the dreams)
I'm catching a flashback of the days when
My pockets were dry, I only had a few friends
Those same brothers now my family
We've been through it all, in this industry
Mad frustrated, ready to flip because
The company was playing me like some dumb kid
Video out and I'm still riding the train
Working and hustling, no pain no gain
Now here comes the spotlight, still something's not right
I gotta pay my rent by five o'clock tonight
Living on fifty cent noodles but I'm playing the game
That the brothers know I'm true to
Can't let up, although the journey is rough
Focus on the goal like it's the Stanley Cup
I gotta play this thing for keeps
My only stress relief is the hip-hop beats
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows, the insides and out y'all)
When I close the door
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
They try to kill my dreams
(Nobody knows about the dreams, 'bout the dreams)
Skipping the turn styles, everyday lifestyle
Looking at this world with mad anger 'cause it's wild
People thinking that I'm blowing up
But they don't understand, the young man is growing up
Now who you think I should trust?
Better rely on self, no time for missing the bus
Fake people, phony characters
They begin to swarm, so I built up barriers
To block 'em out but they still dwelling
Makes me wanna just start yelling
But I play it cool though 'cause I'm no fool, yo
See chumps'll always try to break down your flow
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows the insides and out y'all)
What I'm going through
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
What I feel inside
(Nobody knows about the dreams, 'bout the dreams)
No time for misery, no time for empty wishing
'Fridgerator's bare, killing roaches in the kitchen
Just spent my last on a 40 to sip away my troubles
Now it's worse 'cause I'm hungry
I check my man for advice
He lent me 20 dollars and we lounged and got nice
I told him nobody knows about the wack side
I feel like a slave getting whipped on my backside
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows the insides and out y'all)
When I close the door
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
They try to kill my dreams
(Nobody knows about the dreams 'bout the dreams)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows the insides and out y'all)
What I'm going through
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
What I feel inside

Mad chips, right above my grip I'm, lettin 'em fall
Who said the G-O-D wasn't comin' to do his thing
Who said the industry, wasn't gonna bow to this king?
I paid dues stayed true so I, made it through
If you handle your B-I fly guy you can make it too

And I can do bad all by myself
Do me a favor - don't be concerned about my wealth
If you're one of my peeps, you're gonna know that
But if I ain't feelin' you player, huh
My face is gonna show that
So keep your eyes off my pockets
Don't be surprised if I cocked it
Can't outslick a can of oil, you never spoil my profits
See how I'm flippin this here?
Things are different this year
Ain't got no time to listen to niggaz
That be trippin' this year
Cause and effect, I always get, applause and respect
When I rhyme, universal laws, truth and righteousness connect
You see the knowledge that I'm kickin's for you
And there is nothin' that another can do
Try to stop me but I make it through
Recruitin angels as a warrior I'm true
People need people, it's true
True pride will sustain
In order to do what I do I can let you live
With me inside my brain
Keep your feet, out my shoes
A nigga like me done paid my dues
Keep my comb, out your hair
Unless you bout ready to take it there
Keep my name, out your mouth
Until you got somethin' worth talkin' bout
Keep your hands, to yourself
'Cause I belong to someone else
I've been tellin' you, that there's war out here
And I've been tellin' you, that there's more out here
So stop limitin your thoughts
Stop reconstructin your plots
It's more than luck it's an art
No more, duckin from NARC's
Haters stay at a distance, haters keep away from my fam
Haters stay in my business, haters still playin' this jam
Mad Wisdoms, reflect the light of this man
Some jealous rappers, tried to pick a fight with this man
But despite all the nonsense, and false pretense I bomb this
Peace to those I get along with, my real nigga I'm strong with
And never get me twisted with no wack shit
And all that foolishness you was kickin, heh
I know you wanna take it back kid

23,Kingpin,2005,Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures (2005),,Guru,"Taking off my jacket, my talk is classic
'Bout to elevate to kingpin in this racket
Taking off my jacket, my talk is classic
'Bout to elevate to kingpin
Here it is now, it's back to the best
Complete with hollow-tip vocals made to smack through your vest
First I drop on, then I'm going after the rest
You gon' need deacons and ushers, I have to confess
I spit flamous, live famous, no need for this glanous
You could point the finger at me, it was I who made this
I'm like *Hannibal* in Rome, I'll dismantle your dome
Leave your fresh carcass out, where the animals roam
Pull savages, could lose whole savages
I wreck whole spots, and I pay no damages
Remember the face but you can't place the scene
Set an incredible piece, while you chase your dream
I ain't worried about how many that come, we'll watch them go
They all want to stop my show and stop my dough
But I know that the people endorse me
This means that I'm the new boss, I got the streets to enforce me
Now the streets may show love but the po-po doesn't
They want to lock us all up like it's a local custom
Some people are frauds, yet you hope to trust 'em
Soon as you find they snitch, you ready to load and bust one
Not an advocate of violence, but I fight for truth
I like firing rhymes more than I like to shoot
I see the young ones, grabbing their guns for fun
Ain't nothing glamorous about slinging jums in the slums
The god came up hard, straight of the boulevard
Playin' to win, stay in your skins like a bullet scar
Authorized to rise just like baker's ease
Now those who come against me, want to make the peace
And all you knuckle-head, coward ass chumps get back
Rhymes spray, fools pay, as if I dump my mack
And of course you know the people endorse me
This means that I'm the new boss, I got the streets to enforce me"

(Guru)
Mmm, is this really the end, or is it a new beginning?
A new reality...
(Chorus x2: Guru + Baybe)
So many misconceptions (don't be misled)
So many evil deceptions (oh I am)
I've come to give direction
For I, am the lifesaver (the life)
(Guru)
Scooby doo wah, scooby doo wee
Like a jazz player, I improvise wisely
Free with the style, I flow like the Nile
But remember, don't mistake the smile
Deep rooted is my rhymin
Like ancient African griots, precise is my timing
But let me get to the essence of what I'm sayin' here
Too many blood red streets with bodies layin there
The systematic fanatics are at it again
Tryin' to kill me and all of us my friend
But don't bend to the mental strain
Against all odds, we must strive for essential gains
Be true to the life the Lord gave ya
And that's a message from the lifesaver
The lifesaver...
(Baybe)
Oh I am, the life (I... am the lifesaver)
I am, the life... yeah
(Guru)
It takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight
Than to set one off, knowledge I'll let some off
Cause nowadays, everybody's a killer
And as for me, no other MC is iller
But still a thorn scrapes my heart
When I see another life that's been torn apart
Over nonsense, no law, no order, it's evidence
That the money only takes precedence
Cause everybody wants power
While the innocent are born or die, during every hour
I scowl as I look upon evil
But I must have the strength, to spark awareness in my people
And we will learn to respect our neighbors
Another message from the lifesaver
The lifesaver...
(Guru)
People talk about the Armaggedeon
And nowadays everyone you know is packin lead son
Each day's another test
Aiyyo I better do my best, cause a lot's ridin' on my chest
So when I lead you to the water, you best know
How to swim across, so you can reach the border
It's international, the message and the flavor
So here's some more important words from the lifesaver
The lifesaver... (I am the life)
The lifesaver...
(Lucien)
Garçon fâché grandissant dans la violence et la peace, le mot ""peace""
C'est pour ceux qui périssent
Chaque jour aux alentours dans le monde et ses tours
En prison, ou retour en arrière dans les fours
Et les condés font leurs rondes
Les ville grondent
La terre chauffe les sommets des montagnes fondent
Pendant ça passe black ça casse
Telle est mon uniforme dans une guerre en crevasse
On me regarde, me met en garde-à-vue
Certains cafardent, d'autres bavardent et tuent
Dédicaces à ton quartier toute cité oh pas de chance à ceux
Qui sont tombés mais pas pour la France
Pays trop bidon
Vivement Armageddon
J'ai raison
Prie en Jéhovah pour mon pardon
Car si un flic me juge je le broie enfonçant mon doigt dans son oeil et le fond de son
Cerveau
Je gratte

So many misconceptions
So many evil deceptions
I've come to give direction
For I, am the lifesaver"

Seem like it ain't no peace, no justice
How you want it, the bullet or the microchip?
Either way you got to lift your fist
We get it down like this
To all my people, ball up your first
Seem like it ain't no peace, no justice
How you want it, the bullet or the microchip?
Either way you got to lift your fist
Yo, c'mon
We livin' life close to the edge, don't push
But this ain't eighty-three and it's not the Cold Crush
It's kids on the street strapped, huffin that kush
They eyein the next cat, livin' all plush
I guess frustration make a brother do what he must
What's the combination that can make a human erupt
Team leaders gettin' mutinied up, who couldn't read
The signs, thinkin' the day and times is...
Indeed, we blast, refuse to kiss ass
Quick fast, ready to mash cause of a bugged out past
Swallow the pain, follow the mental terrain
It takes a hell of a man, nowadays to maintain
Garments bloodstained, face bruised and battered
Our eyes reflect the agony, of dreams that were shattered
And they love it, when we wild out and kill our own
But the greater responsibility, yes, is still our own
To all my people, just lift your fist
Seem like it ain't no peace, no justice
How you want it, the bullet or the microchip?

How you want it, the bullet or the microchip?
Either way you got to lift your fist
Uh, worldwide famine, ghetto people demand
That somebody do somethin' soon, and let's examine
The facts, behind the violent attacks
Behind the daily gunplay the cocaine and the crack
Thug season - what's the reason for the treason?
Everybody's gotta eat, some gotta resort to thievin
Take money money make money money money
To all my people, just lift your fist
Seem like it ain't no peace, no justice
How you want it, the bullet or the microchip?
Either way you got to lift your fist
We get it down like this
To all my people, ball up your first
Seem like it ain't no peace, no justice
How you want it, the bullet or the microchip?
Either way you got to lift your fist
Yo - from the time they eyes open till the clock strike death
Brothers is stressed, walkin' 'round holdin' they chest
They got the government surveyin they steps and can't breathe
They dynamitin them projects to smithereens
Money comin' but them days too few and far between
You tryin' to taste just what the world's offering, ya'mean?
I seen enough to make a grown man scream
Brothers thirsty and hongry to get that thing
Too many tears of pain, too many years of struggle
Too many drops of blood, too many problems to juggle
Too few jobs available, too few schools equipped
Too few role models; just gangsters and pimps
Will you succumb, will your heart grow numb
Or will you save the world, and use your mind like a gun?
I'm the one - I turn a stick-up kid to a soldier
Me and The Roots, word up, we takin' over
To all my people, just lift your fist
Seem like it ain't no peace, no justice
How you want it, the bullet or the microchip?
Either way you got to lift your fist
We get it down like this
To all my people, ball up your first
Word up it ain't no peace, no justice
How you want it, the bullet or the microchip?
To all my people, just lift your fist
How you want it, there's no peace, no justice
From the bullet or even from the microchip?
Either way you got to lift your fist
We get it down like this
Lift your first

Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world
What's happening?
(Guru)
What's happening... check it out
It's critical, the situation is pitiful
Bear in mind, you gotta find somethin' spiritual
We never gain, 'cause we blame it on the system
You oughta listen whether Muslim or Christian
Or any other type religion or creed
'Cause what we need is less greed
We can't continue to kill ourselves
We gotta build and expand our wealth
So one more time I'll design a rhyme divine
To educate and elevate your mind
Nowadays we gotta fight to live
Human means we got a right to live
Without the homicide, without the genocide
Don't tell me let it slide, I'm feelin' ghettofied
So be a soldier of truth
Protect the lives of our youth
(Sweet Sable)
Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world
What's happening?
(Guru)
What's happening
In the land of the free, home of the brave
Too many of us reach such early graves
They tell us to behave, but they don't know
About the neighborhood drug flow
They don't know about the drama or about the guns
I ask how many politicians steal our funds
And how many officers will turn up corrupt
The governments don't care, they pass the buck
I'm growin' tired of the trickery
And the misery, it's makin' me kinda sick you see
But now I meditate, so I can get it straight
My thoughts penetrate, so I control my fate
So be advised by the wise and conscious one
We take the easy way out, too often son
We better get some kind of work ethic
Realize it and correct it
(Sweet Sable)
Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world
What's happening?
(Guru)
What's happening
From New York to L.A., dead children lay
Victims of an unfair socie-ty
But for those who are blessed
We must correct this mess, or disappear into nothingness
We're living in the age of doom
How many teachers reach all the kids in the classroom?
The beast is stalking us, but there's no stopping us
As long as we maintain the strength within us
'Cause we're winners, descendants of the kings
They try to hinder us from doin' our thing
So get the money, but spend it wisely
I get ill when the beats hypnotize me
Realize that the key
Is for each, to master, his own destiny
Deal with reality, and keep a tight focus
Cause there's a lot we got to cope with
(Sweet Sable)
Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world

You know sometimes I be lookin' through the darkness
Tryin' to find the light
Tryin' to do what's right, with all my might
(Mica Paris (Guru))
Lookin' through the darkness
(Yeah I'm lookin', lookin' at you)
Lookin' through the darkness
(I see you lookin' at me, whatcha wanna wanna do?)
Lookin' through the darkness
(Here we go... take a walk with me)
(Lookin' through the darkness...
Check it out... now now... now now, now now)
(Guru)
Now as I peer through the window of gloom, and everyday living
And all the hardships one faces, to make you give in
I dig more intensely, finding greater strength
A lot of heads is empty, I've got a greater rank
Than MC's not aware of situations
That'll force one to understand, true stipulations
Thou shalt not bite, thou shalt not front
Fake it if you want but for the battles I've come, 'cause I'm
(Mica Paris (Guru))
Lookin' through the darkness
(Yeah, I'm lookin' out... lookin' at you)
Lookin' through the darkness
(Lookin' at me, my style is free, do you wanna be?)
(Guru)
For me this rap life is real life, I don't have to create
Some false image, to make the crowd get hyped
Too many children get the wrong message, from clowns that walk around
Hopelessly lost, thinkin' that they're the boss
They're in a daze, while dope MC's don't get the front page
Me -- I try to channel my rage
As I travel through the city regularly
Turning the anger and frustration, straight into energy
Yes you will remember me; as the brother who cared
To dare to step up, with his soul bared
But never fearing 'cause I've got instructions
From Him, to go and fight the corruption so I'm
(Mica Paris (Guru))
Lookin' through the darkness
(I've got to look through it... try to try to find the light)
Lookin' through the darkness
(Uh, maintainin..)
(Guru)
My granddaddy always told me, to keep the light shining
So as my mic illuminates, you can feel the state that I'm in
Thoroughly immersed in a verse, way more than hardcore
I endure, cause in myself, I'm secure
Delivering syllables and selections with profound perfection
Comin' back like the resurrection
In this session, I'm professin, that those who don't
Hear and understand, never loved me, and so I planned
To take a stand, as one who is firmly focused
Plus I'm mad worthy with words
I rock from East New York, all the way to the suburbs
The lightkeeper, knowledge seeker
I switch the stress that's on my mind
Into the voice that rocks your speaker
And I get deeper than the ocean when I'm
(Mica Paris (Guru))
Lookin' through the darkness
(Yeah... I'm lookin' through it)
Lookin' through the darkness
(Ain't nothing to it but to do it...
Gotta freak it, now let me freak it check it out)
Lookin' through the darkness
(All my life)
(Lookin' through the darkness...
Yeah, oh yeah)
(Guru)
Yo I'm so ill, I go ill, when beats with jazz
Fill my need to express myself, like the blues I can't lose
Weak MC's, they're seekin' refuge
From my barrage, there's no rescue
Then I look through the madness, finding sanity
I'm crazy alert, I never swim in vanity
I do this rap stuff every year
Aiyyo peace to my fam especially my man Premier as I'm

Lookin' through the darkness

Lookin' through the darkness
(The jungle, uh, everybody's got to rumble)
Lookin' through the darkness

Lookin' through the darkness
Lookin' through the darkness

Got to find a way...
Got to get, got to get it on

29,Lost Souls,1995,"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality (1995)",,Guru,"(Feat. Jamiroquai)
(Intro: Guru)
Doing it in the house like this
Going out to the lost souls
Doing this for you and yours
Comin' straight to you from the Guru and the crew
(Chorus: Guru)
To the lost souls
I hope you find your way someday
That's why I sit and I pray
For the lost souls
I hope you find your way someday
That's why I sit and I pray
(Verse 1: Guru)
Sometimes I wonder why
Some people can't see what's beyond the naked eye
So therefore I must fortify
Techniques of communication
For beyond what is considered to be
Normal conversation
So I need some proper 'ticipation
Am I giving what you need
Yes true indeed
As greed grows like weed
Many bad seeds start to contaminate the crop
I think that needs to stop hops
Brothers are slain over respect and clout
While their mothers're trying to figure out
What's it all about
But when you give up on self that's when you lost
'Cause you're playing with your life
Like it's a coin toss
(Verse 2: Guru)
No doubt I release a form of speech
Relative to urban outreach
Transmitted messages to each true listener
Rhymes divine but rough
Like the skin on blisters
Cause the truth hurts
Plus I got no time for runnin' around chasin' skirts
So see my sound is a corrector
A profound lecture
Quality texture
That's because of what I see
Alot of MC's are gassed like hellium
Word up g
Alot of people in general are straight up no good
Makes me wanna shoot 'em
Aiyo maybe I should
But instead I parlay
Maintain self control
And say a prayer for the lost souls
(Verse 3: Guru)
Get up stand up
Come on
Stand up for your right
One two
I go to new heights with my insight
Whipping my mic tight
With the height of a scholar
Equipped with the gift to make crazy dollars
But that ain't the whole
See my heart is in it
That's the only way one could even attempt to win it
DJ spin it while others critique
But the science makes 'em weak
Check the words that I speak
See it's ridiculous for us
Not to discuss
The real issues
Like all you phonys
And why I dis you
Dismiss you as a lost soul
(Outro: Jason Kay of Jamiroquai/Guru)
If you don't watch where you step
You can become indirect
And you know that you will lose your soul
And if you truly want to lose
Until there's nothing to choose
Then you know that you will lose your soul
To the lost soul
I hope you find your way someday
So I sit and I pray
For the lost soul
I hope you find your way someday
Lose it
You can lose it
You can lose it
You can lose your soul
To the lost soul
Hope you find your way
I hope you find your way someday"
30,Loungin',1993,"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1 (1993)",,Guru,"Yeah, I'm loungin', I got my man Donald Byrd
I wanna give a big shout out to my little man, Miko, he's 2 years old
He's away visiting his grandmom but I miss him dearly
Check it out
If I rhyme this, you will find this situation shall advance
You could take a glance or dance
Elevator lyrics to arouse the crowd
Now tell me who's the man to show you how
Many legacies of brothers who get buzy
And I do it fluid till the suckers get dizzy
Saying peace to the blackbirds 125th street
And check the flow that's unique
For loungin', mellow out and just loungin'
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin'
Can't refuse this, never lose this, it's the choice this
'Cause my voice is the smoothest
Dominating to your boys 'cause I've been around doing work
And sold tons of others jerk
Donald Byrd word on the track, quite exact
Giving you the format, Jack
See we gotta pave the way and display
How to loungin', loungin'
Mellow out and just loungin'
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin'
Peace to the pioneers but I gotta try to clear
My throat, check out what I wrote
You can't tap into this unless you know the roots
Word shoe like light absolute
For real so now you gotta know the deal
For loungin', just loungin', mellow out and just loungin'
Loungin', loungin' mellow out, check it ou and loungin'
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin'
Loungin', loungin', peace to Brooklyn where I live
Realistic, kind of mystic when I kick this
You should witness the slickness
Of the hornplayer and the dope rhymesayer
Quite emotional and inspirational
Philisophical and yes very logical
Teaching you the method for loungin'
Everybody knows they have times when they wanna just lay back
Kick their feet up, y'know
Listen to some good music and just lounge
That's right, I said lounge"
31,Mashin' Up Da World,2000,"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3: Streetsoul (2000)",,Guru,"Sound your horn!
Stiggetty-yooour-higgety-horrron
Yeah! Sound your horn, boy!
You see
Dem want to kill de youths
Kill de youths and Kings
Dead first at eleven
Never tell de youths that Pokemon be the settin'
Never tell de youths
Send down to earth be the endin'
Now look what I did
Mashin' up da earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
But what peace must sanctify we if they use them guns for toys?
Do you ever spend a night in an Upstate prison before?
Not to mention Riker's Island to see dem youths dem sleepin' on the floor
Check the cycle God ended
What's the fate of this planet?
Black on black love and hate's got my people frantic
Peep the criminal mind
The subliminal line
Such difficult times
Automatic pistols and glock nines
I wish I could stop time
For the cat who drop dime
Thinkin' about his lifeline
A young man told me that my wise words saved his life
It made me feel good
Made me feel real good
Back in the day I used to steal goods
Dreams without means is like a lack of self-esteem or lack of cream
I go for delf or roll out for the team
Mashin' up da earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
Mashin' up da earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
Feel the pain of the ghetto through a teardrop
My peers stop and listen from eighteen years
Muslim and Christian We all face conviction
In this moment of oppression The world is like infection
On this block we confessin'
I use my mind as a weapon
Like I told my brothers Glock and Snub
Ain't No Half-Steppin' We gotta live Heaven
And watch our seeds taste the blessin'
I learned my lesson 'bout havin' snakes around my crew
Now I know the evil that men do and bitches too
We had thought by our riches
Some called thugs and snitches
Through the different timeframes
Kid, I watched crime change
In the time of fame
My man is like crack/cocaine
But through the black rain I seen many suffer in pain
We go for gain and pain
Now they rock some fat gold chains
Iced-out name perform a concert, sellin' out in Maine
Own the properties and all types of things
Some say the drug game and the music game is all the same
Ooh, Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry, Ooh-ooh-ooh
Mashin' up da earth
We can no longer put all the blame on the man
For those sellin' out I'm sayin', ""Shame on the man""
For those fallin' victim I'm sayin', ""Make a new plan""
And for those that need a way I'm sayin', ""Take my hand""
See this mental slavery causes rash behavior, G
And I have to say for me that I wish it would all stop
Before we become extinct before we all drop
And R.I.P. to the rappers that's been slain
And R.I.P. to the fine young men who've lost their lives
I feel the pain
And do you know what it's like to lose a loved one?
It makes you numb
Especially when it's over somethin' small but ain't no fun
I lost four friends in one year I could feel
Them watchin' over me see their faces still
Some clear and some fear what's out there
For me I have no time to and may I remind you
This is a corrupted world of our design, du'
Peep my discussion no one can changes these things but us, son
We didn't ask for the liquor, crack and guns
We didn't ask for the poor eduction and lack of funds
But I know one thing none of us wanna die
But still we're mashin' up this world and I don't know why
Mashin' up da earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
Mashin' up da earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
But what peace must sanctify we if they use them guns for toys?
Do you ever spend a night in an Upstate prison before?
Not to mention Riker's Island to see dem youths dem sleepin' on the floor
Ooh, pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry, ooh-ooh-ooh
Mom and Dad wipe the tears from ya eyes
Ooh, pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, riot in the prison
Riker's Island
When a gust of G-P-E Babylon will stand to see
So the sentence can't be free
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Mashin' up da earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
Mashin' up da earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
But what peace must sanctify we if they use them guns for toys?
Do you ever spend a night in an Upstate prison before?
Not to mention Riker's Island to see dem youths dem sleepin' on the floor
Ooh, pray for the youths

32,Never Ending Saga,2001,Baldhead Slick & Da Click (2001),,Guru,"(Feat. Lae-D Trigga, Bless)
Yeah... ain't nuttin sweet in these streets...
Everyday it's a never-ending saga...
(Chorus x2: Guru)
It's a never-ending saga, the drama, the block's hotter than lava
See the stress in the eyes of my mama
She don't wanna hear about me gettin' put in a cage
Still I keep so much heat, have you shook and amazed
(Guru)
It's like this everyday hustle got me stifled
It's like all I think about is cocking pistols and rifles
All I do all day is smoke weed and drink
Look at my icey grill in the mirror and then I spit in the sink
Got to flip more dough, got to pull another heist
May not have the biggest rep, but you could say this brother's nice
Twice the cops came by my crib, askin questions
About some shit that happened, that nobody wants to mention
I'd rather take my own life then live as a snitch
I pray to God but sometimes, he don't grant my wish
I wanna get out of here, and lace my chick with some Prada gear
Push a fat whip and own a big house somewhere
I can't sleep, I'm thinkin' about my next caper
I gotta figure out a way that I can make the best paper
I got a son, and yo I'm still mad young
Everyday I'm on the Ave. with my niggaz totin mad guns
(Lae-D Trigga)
Everyday's a different struggle, different sets and tecs
Tryna make my dollars double, so who's next to flex
Hollow points wet like sets, got the Ill-X connect
Niggaz be hatin' when you takin', tryna hold ya breath
They wanna mold ya death and lay you where the seas rest
For a chain and ya watch, you bound to get yourself popped
Have ya brains lookin' ""Sloppy"" like ""Joe""
Runnin' and breathin like whoa
This game the illest if ya know when to fold
Dramatic incidence, keep the witnesses, bickerin
Chickens is sickenin, fuckin' cats that own businesses
Voices and visions leave a stain in my mind
So I explain it in rhymes
Bullets and slums keep this dame in her prime
Undercovers wanna lock me up, niggaz wanna knock me up
Spend my cheddar like they got me stuck
I change ya frame from weak to dust, after I heat ya up
Automatics, skee that meat and trucks
Livin' is crazy if you got no luck, worse if you got no bucks
You gotta take, all you can or get fucked
You gotta space all ya man's and get buck
The hood you live in is tough
Feels like the whole damn world gone corrupt
That's why I drink the veins, anything to ease the fuckin' pain
Let it reign in my heart on this dirt stain, it hurt mayne
[Guru] Ghetto dreams... callin mad schemes... that's right
(Bless)
I heard life was a test, learned life was a mess
Ya blaze cess, escape stress from one day to the next
Right or left, in this maze that ends in death
I'm alive but need rest, progress in three steps
With every step or breath, I seem to digest so much shit
To get off my chest, born and restless
I, sit at my desk, 9 to 5 at best
The rest collect checks to waste on lotto bets
Forty bottles wet and cigarettes, address to ad-ress
Places, faces with sadness, cats depressed
Through all the madness, I managed
To be blessed with a sense to know dough don't measure success
'Cause even though money is power, it ain't always respect
Live my life with no regrets, all these heads know the deal
I re-fuse to move, unless I'm doin' what I feel
The true meaning of real, not the gat that you conceal
Cracks ya sell, bitches ya mack, and caps ya peel
Try to match my skill, attack ya grill, perhaps I will
Sit back and chill, you shoulda known that I'm ill..."
33,Night Vision,2000,"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3: Streetsoul (2000)",,Guru,"When the sun goes down and the moon comes up
You can see a lot of things if you look deep enough
It's all around
The city skyline, in the nighttime, be the right time, to ball out (Yeah)
Who's the real pimp, gangster hustler, you call out
Is it him, is it him or is it, Dukes over there?
Real recognizes real, so yo, no one cares
The chief executive mack, in so deep you can't imagine
I've seen the beatdowns, the gunfights, plus the paddywagon
See daddy with his pants saggin, pushin whips that's too fly
Switchin up to a suit and tie, ladies say he's too cute to lie (Forget about it)
And none of my girls, wanna, talk to you
Plus, none of my boys, gotta, talk to you
'Cause when you see me, they'll be somewhere in the cut
And you can't be me, so nip that weak talk in the butt
The party's crowded, and everyone, is showin love
Whassup, what's the deal, how's things holdin' up? (Whassup young blood?)
The smooth dude, that moves through, with the utmost precision
Truly a wiseguy, seein life with my night vision
See that young blood, comin' down the street
Don't be hypnotized by the stride of his feet
Pickpockets, streetwalkers, number runners, hustlers
Lots of ladies, wanna, check me out
And lots of haters, wanna, X me out
I got more style than Gucci, Louis or Prada
Drop more jewels on you, than your uncle or father
Once this envious kid, was temptin me kid
To stoop down to his level and cold empty his wig
He was mad cause his girl wanted up in my world (hahahaha)
I looked the other way, and she was still, stuck in my world
Aiyyo; baby wants to run with me, come with me, have fun with me
I be the man when I'm dipped, or in a t-shirt, and dungarees
I overheard her man, that was screamin in her ear
While I nodded to my peeps, who was schemin in the rear
If he's gon' flip, he's gonna, find out quick
That I stroll with a click, and we roll mad thick
He shook my hand and laughed it off, that was his best decision
We keep it tight aight? Hangin' out, with that night vision
I bust into this night club
I can see you perpetraters
Passin out your BID'ness cards
Wearin your knockoff gators
Pimps, heartbreakers, dumb-ass Johns
You got to make a decision, to go witcha instincts
And rely on your night vision"

Calm down man, can we talk like civilised people?

I don't love you
'Cause I don't love you no more
I don't love you no more
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
'Cause I don't love you no more
I'm out the door, I can't take it no more
Things have really changed, it's not like before
I mean the vibes between us nowadays are quite shaky
And lately, I ain't been feelin' you baby
Somehow you left my interest wander
And now I'm fond of someone else who's diggin me for me
It's what I longed for
About our current arrangement I ain't sure
'Cause I don't think I love you no more
And yo I had a major effect on you I know
But sure you be showin disrespect to me, so I gotta go
You never gonna see it how I do
And I don't like your attitude and I don't like being lied to
I'm not a door you can't push my buttons
We tried to make it work still we've come up with nothing
So now my patience is thin, the fighting is a bore
And I don't think I love you no more
I don't love you no more
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you

Girlfriend I'm walking to the door
Ain't gonna see me no more
All you seem to do is bore
Me, since I came back off tour
See if I can take your ways
I'm walkin' away from only bad days
I know there is no easy way
But there's nothing you can say
To change my mind, yeah
I wish I didn't feel this way, wish I was kidding
But another girl has stepped on the scene to put her bid in
I never would have looked in another direction
But you got a strange way of showing love and affection
So I told myself that I deserved better
You only came my way because you heard I had cheddar
And now you seem to me to be so immature
And I don't think I love you no more
And plus I know about that stuff you told your crew when we met
I gotta go somewhere so please let me jet
See you forget about my generous ways and my good heart
You never wanna admit you're wrong, but you should start
Let's put our differences away and end this peacefully
We haven't been getting along at all recently
I've been thinking about this since I came home from tour
And I'm sure, I don't love you no more
Now I gotta explain that I'm loving and feeding you no more
Everything keeps sticking around since I came back off tour
So tell me why do I have to explain myself baby, ey
'Cause girl you gotta admit that there's nothing more for me to say
Ooh yeay
I don't love you no more
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
'Cause I don't love you no more
I don't love you no more
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you

Against my team, I run with some of the best dudes,
That's done it, did it, plus niggaz got kids and shit
Put you under pressure, make you forfeit

'Bout to go legit, flip quick on these fools
I look at hustle, in the long term sense
I ain't tryna be stuck with a long term sentence
Calculate my moves like I'm Bumpy Johnson
Bring it to 'em by surprise, straight dumpin on 'em
Mentally I could chalk out your physical
Way before you even taught of ever grabbin your pistol
I can't wait to get the drop first, and watch it drop first
'Cause you swine like knock words
I hit your face, turn your head when I come through
My man wanna get at you with the gun fool
We maneuver through the hood quicker than light speed
The god always hook me up with the tight weed
I hit your stance, you pollutin my cypher
I'm all in your way 'cause it's my duty to slice ya
Your poor fee is with you
Divine justice when the niners hit you
Didn't know the half, so I split you
It's the righteous don, when I write my songs
It's like the quiet storm, till my mic is on
And once I got ya, it's too bad, too late
It's two of y'all, they'll find your bodyparts in two lakes
There's more of y'all, well I'm well prepared
To stab you where you bleedin, wipe your lung in my sleeve
From the hood to the office, I'm good for a profit
Like Kareem with the sky hook, how could you stop it
If I got to, I'll send a son or two at you
Straight pit, them dogs will turn you to cat food
I'm that dude, the one that's callin the shots
Went away and came back, niggaz was all in my spot
Sheisty niggaz even had their hands all in my pot
Gave 'em a group raid and buried them all in one plot"

To the game, I'm a hustler
Shellshocked from lettin the shells pop from the muffler
Get knocked, get bailed, with the bell heart just to touch ya
Fuck ya, I done paid all my dues in spades
And know the tools of the trade
Nigga fuck the police, I done spent life up in the streets
Ain't got plans for comin' up in this piece
To give a nigga, every side of my struggle
To show why'all mothafuckas all the real ill shit they put a thug through
And they wonder why I let my pants hang, fuck with hoodrats
Cheap nigga and won't give up a God-damn thang
(Guru)
I sat by the door, but never call me a spoof
Go head and, call on ya troops, we'll have you callin a truce
I got here on pure guts, carve diamonds with pure cuts
Still the king of underground, you toilet tissue, pure butt
And just in case you want to spread rumors
Me and Tef'll give you lead to the head tumors
Used to rock blue and red Pumas
I went to Farrakhan speak when I was 12 years old
He said, ""Create your own job, know yourself, don't fold""
My uncle Clarence, rest in pe"

Sex, teks, checks, give me all of that
Cribs, chicks, whips, I got all of that
If you want to know just how I feel
Then fall back boy, while I'm adjusting my steel
I'm a semi short nigga but my game is tall
I like money, clothes, cars just the same as y'all
Been down in the dirt and it was hard to come up
Had to grind like a motherfucker, sun down to sun up
Me and my niggaz used to dream of this
Now it's all on me, I do my thing with this
Blast at you rapper cats, slash past your battle raps
You're in the hospital, body cast after that
One of the realest you could ever meet
Get love in every hood 'cause I rep the streets with clever speech
You'll never reach, my legendary status
MY presence is alarming, my chicks be the baddest
So nigga just close your mouth
I close you down and take everything like open house
Y'all fools don't want it, word to my moms
I can see it in your eyes that you scurred to be harmed
And I don't give a damn if you, came with your man or crew
Still gon' have to dismantle you and hammer you
Don't let me catch you, after dark
I'll snatch your heart when the desert E sparks
I'm nice with a two, might fight with a fool
Why I'm spazing, 'cause I don't be liking y'all fools
And niggaz front 'cause I could bag they broad
I don't want they bitch, they could have their broad
I'm on some businesses, a mansion, a yacht
See I'm a winner girl, that man ain't got what I got
I work for the riches baby, hurt from the stitches baby
Stay alert and go beserk just to get the gravy
So nigga just close your mouth
I close you down and take everything like open house"

Watchin her drivin' by, in her new whip so fly
Wish she could sing me a lullaby, to scoop her I've got to try
In her eyes, there's a flame that burns right through my soul
Can't pretend to be cool, about to lose my control
Yeah I know she's got plenty; admirers, she's got many
Like an exotic fantasy, into a frenzy she sends me
Wow I have to sit down, and gather my wits now
I wanna caress those hips now, wanna kiss those lips now
Hello? Hey baby
I know you called and I didn't answer twice
But baby that's oh-kay it's nice
For you to call anyway see, okay, see uh
Hey baby
You know it's okay if you don't call me

When she wants plenty, she gets plenty

Yup
And every day is her day, and every year is her year
Anyone tried to violate, they could straight disappear
She don't care if you play yourself, tryin' to step to her
The illest of gangsters, I show and respect to her
Truly glamorous, she ain't impressed and it shows
She don't like your new clothes, she don't care about your playa pose
Do you suppose I could hook up and spend time with her?
She's just how I dreamed - I'll bust my nine for her

When she gets plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
Any damn thang she wants, uh
Uh
Surgeon General - I provide vitamins and minerals
The charge that she's got on me, should be federal
I was told never put the two before the one son
But always cultivate your Wisdom, to help you build your kingdom
I wanna be the answer to every question she has
So when I wish to enter, she'll be lettin me pass
I know she wants to be with G-O-D eventually, but still
She got everything; yeah the girl's got plenty
Flowers in her bedroom
Perfume on her neck
Nectar from a mason jar
Seven dollar dress; she's
Super cute, and plenty bad
Thirty twenty-two thirty-six and a half
I, hope the dude will realize
She got the silky sexy bedroom eyes
Baby baby please don't break yo' neck
Cause you gon' have a wreck
'Cause when it comes to love I get plenty, degrees one-twenty

Power, money and influence
I had a taste of it, now I'm all into it
The game ain't over till I get my share
Till I have my run, this here is my year
(Jean Grae)
Man, I'm a tycon, whether in person or slick right on
Crisp Nikes on, six niggaz with sick pythons
Right around your area, face close like a scared
Straight playin' your host, you get bitched out
This ain't fluffin a rang, this clip ain't bang
You sittin' lame duck, shittin on the names stuck
I vow this year, power's mine
If I gotta sketch up my name, empowering rhymes
If I gotta attend jail just to boost up the sales
I know a laber owner that I'd love to bruise up for bail
I know my family got it, they pull together but it's amniotic
I mean baby like askin for a name spot it
The talent, the influental and erotic
Put on the back burner but potential as a parent
Every track is a murder but could treat it like lobonic
The play that graze here, now MC's in a daze mind
(Guru)
In one second flat I tear your whole frame
Plus we pack like a stadium does, at a pro game
Got so many ways to end yo glory
Rub you out, shut you down, then it's end of story
I'm like Robert Horry with a clutch three
You can't touch me, the black double oh-seven, nigga trust me
Modern day Ali when it comes to the rhyme
Know how to hold the fort down when they comin' for mine
I'm crafty, I move swift and changeable
Plus I'm aware, of what jealousy and anger do
You can't help yourself then you can't help me
Can't smell what the truth is then you can't smell me
You can tell a million stories about how gully you are
Then as soon as you finish, I'm be pullin your card
I step so courageously, I rap so amazingly
I guess you could say, that niggaz slept on me basically
(Talib Kweli)
Jean Grae, Kweli, Guru, for the first time
Let the games begin like Jaceson Taylor wrote his first rhyme
Technology make niggaz lazy, with the pro tools
Even you could write your verse in the booth like you were Jay-Z
A Hollywood between reality TV and rap
Is there ain't no more use for the classically trained actor
First light bulb ever made is still burnin
They sell the ones that burn out to take the money you earnin
Word that marijuana grow too natural to be a cash crop
We have cops at bars, smokin' squares, throwin' back shots
They walk the street and bring the heat to the apshalts
Servin', protectin the half, beatin' on the half not
Niggaz talk greasy in the magazines
Till they track down and you hear the sounds of loaded magazines
Havin' dreams till they ribs got a gat in between
Passion for cream, make a nigga wanna splatter your spleen
That shit is mean"

I'm mystical, don't be deceived by the visual
Visible preference is pure, patent it back to metaphors
Greetin 'em Illa-del-style wild
Analyze my memoirs, runnin' on 8/4, poetic, me-ter
Soarin way beyond
Iambic pentameter, or juvenile flam
Unsyncopated soul piercin earlobes and egos
My vocals read these thoughts - am I hardcore?
To the grain
(Guru)
Lame game plain Jane MC's can't approach these
I shake chumps like fleas, I hold the keys
To drive you, guide you, provide you
With the real joints, ahem I clear my throat of phlegm
The architect, selecting the blueprints
To rid the game of nuisance
Sucker reducin with the fusion
Rhymes solid like cement in my musical solution
Stackin concrete flows, look out below
[Cut x2: BizMarkie] ""So respect the architect""
[Cut x3: BizMarkie] ""So respect the architect... as I begin to build""
(Guru)
Floor to ceiling, constantly building
With power to construct, towers of rap CREAM kid, what?
Dreamin' you're lyrical physical mystical?
Your concept's mediocre plus your way too typical withcha
Corny delivery and crazy wack voice
Mad corny image, that's why I give you jitters
It figures, I'd have to dust you off the scene
Like a wiseguy, with my New York lean
(Bahamadia)
Lines that I supply fortify the nuclei of mindstate
From state to state, universal, be the orals that I create
Top notch and on lock like Sentry, opponents could never tempt me
Samplin my style like an Akai S-950 and still can't get with me
While I spread this verbal plague like bubonic
Conductin phonics like the Philharmonics
I make in measured melody, kids praise me like the crucifix
So place Bahamad', amongst your top ten of emcees

Any pomp I can romp and stomp at will

Been dwelling with the muggers and the murderers talk
Your shocked by the way I regulate ya' obliterate ya'
Erase your obsolete weak cheap data

It's this hip-hop art I stay true to, crack brew to
I fuck your girl a lot better than you do
The type of lyrics I spit will never fail you
Battle you online, type a letter forward it then email you
Take you off the track and de-rail you
Get the hell out my face don't want to be near you
Don't want your snippets hate your album or your headshots
It's ED O.G. in the black-fitted Red Sox
Thuggin' the streets but you soft at home
You got skills off the dome?
I'm a off your dome
This is a battlefield, no time for screaming and yelling
You get smacked in the face use your ice for the swelling
Besides the records I'm selling
My momma' raised no felon
On the hunt like Helen
For whack rappers who's jellin'
This is drama not a kitty show
You want to get fucked up

I know a lot of time's passed

The seven-thirty, know I'm more than a sick man
The streets raised this wild ass nigga from ""Murderpan""
The real rapper the pimp-slapper
The put on the socks with your suit and stay dapper
Whoa, the chump-choker the backwood tree smoker
Stash the gats in the sofa it's all over
One life to live and that's that
I keep my lyrics heavily packed and cocked back
I'll smash you right in your fucking face black
I'm the realest nigga what you know about that
I'm a let my skills shine like brand new chrome
And tell them son-niggas you run with that daddy's home

No holds barred I'm going all out
I don't think your for real I think your all mouth
So bust one for my dogs locked down
And for my real rap lovers know I got it locked down
Until your blocked down, punks get beat down
You can't rock a party take a seat you clown

Commit atrocities upon MC's who think they heart is mean

Smokey gray Lexus, diamond necklace
We livin' wreckless and die for these inspectors
The four pounders, cock the name on you out-of-towners
And what, henne' filled cups peep the diamond cut
Ice, paradise, living in the thug life
Married to the game fuck a lame diggin' out your wife
Loving all these block wars do shit that's uncalled for
Make money in your spot get it locked, shoot down four
For all your ghetto revenues
Spraying through any avenue
Running I'll be grabbing you
Hog-tied and smacking you
With heaters on purpose
Hold you hostage like you was Turkish
And your pussy ass elevated gut it down your worthless
These thoughts is vivid and we talk if you live it
Rappers brag about a town but don't get respect in it
Ain't a damn shame, what's that's man's name
That got a flame to his nut
Clearing out his spot with a rusted hook
Trust me it's not this entertainment
Ask the judges that face me on the arrangement
Plus I came with, hundreds of niggas that think the same
The plastic hotter than acid to melt the brain

You say he's fly, mmm? I gotta see him""

It's a small little shop, the children call him Pop
But of course he keeps a shotgun
Just for protection, 'cause he's got a little grandson
On Sunday, while he was there cleanin
He heard the front door slam, a lady screamin
He grabbed the shottie and walked out from the back
All he saw was two kids, wearin black ski masks
He fired, they fired, all at the same time
Now there's a funeral on Wednesay, a quarter to nine

Coming with the realness, lyrics of life
Some people need to watch what they say
(Chorus: Chaka Khan)
Watch what you're saying,
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said,
Soon you'll be paying,
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run,
While you were laying,
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head,
No kind of praying,
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come
(Guru)
Warning, rappers be like boring
They're sleeping, it's deep man
So peep in closely when I'm speaking
Weaklings, it's obvious you can't like up to
Your pety pointless words, yet and still you love to
Run off your jibs, now there come a time for judgement
Punishment, what if we take away your ornaments
And strip you down to the raw deal
Then I'd reveal the evidence
Cause you don't really represent
(Chaka Kahn)
Listen here
I'm getting tired of you shooting lip
You better tighten up
Or you will really slip up
And say something that you mean to do
Turn around and it'll be on you
To save yourself from your call and blunder
And bury your ??? like the world it's under
And like a fool you'll sit and wonder
What, who do you wanna know, wish
No water, no magic spell
Can save you from your self made hell
You've made your bed and you know darn well
You got a lay it in the ???
And there's no magic potion
To save you from the wheels you've set in motion
The stone is cut, the die is cast
What were you thinking
(Guru)
I can't understand it, they should ban it, can it
Too much weak talk and not enough real hip-hop
I sense a purpose is filling me
To display credibility and show responsibility, willingly
I'll take on any Johnny Dangerous
Pull his file, for he knows he cannot hang with this
The illest king, I smack the jokers
No hocus pocus, a real MC when I kick vocals"

Wreakin havoc, it's tragic, heated, yung'uns

Too many droppin', like leaves off trees, fall it's like
All for none, none for all
In this land of the damned, everybody down to be the man
Nuff scams are ran, not only fiends scheme it seems
Dreams unruly obstructed
Innocent minds corrupted
Brothers and sisters scufflin for dimes and nickels

And fickle minds can't find what lurks behind
The propaganda, and the subliminal seduction
So wake up and renew
Even if you only do this for you
True, I'd do a killing in self-defense

I connect the spots from the lots of production
Buildin on the function of the unit
Hit ya in tunes switched before you freak MC's scatter

It matters not, if the weather's hot, or cold
Circumstances, make a sucker act bold
I don't fear the threat of violence
I'm just examinin the reason behind it
I find it's like a paradox, sorrow or glory
But everybody's got a story
Like when you pulled out, because they made you mad
You weren't quick on the draw, so too bad
Out here there's many things to see associated with pain

Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize... it's something in the past
Now I'm livin' the life, of a true mack
Devoted to my music, tryin' hard not to look back
But on occasion I can see your face
The memories, they got me driftin a little taste
But now you're doin' your thing, I'm takin' care of mine
And so we're movin on, leavin' the past behind
I guess relationships they ain't for me
That's why I had to set you free
I haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize... it's something in the past
Haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain, sunshine and rain
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize... it's something in the past
My personality is magnanimous
That's why the ladies always cause a fuss
It's in the past what we had
Aiyyo respect to your moms and peace to your dad
I'm glad, that we've been through this
Because you know what? I've noticed
A lot about myself, see I wanna gain wealth
They say, that chasin women is bad for your health
I haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame
We have the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize... it's something in the past
Haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize... it's something in the past
Somethin' in the past
Somethin' in the past
These moments never last
Somethin' in the past
Dedicated to all the ex girls
You know I'm on with the next girl

(Guru)
Let's see if you can hang and bang with this momentum
Competition sniffin on the flowers that I sent them
Put 'em all... in intensive care, send 'em fare
While I lounge round town in expensive gear
Twinkle in my eye, lace the track, Cognac mack
B-Boy pose, knock you right off your toes
While you push it up your nose, I'm with your chick in LaMontrose
On 40 deuce in the double-tree suites
Showin her exactly, what she's gonna be on for me
And truly you'll she, how stupid you'll be
Fuckin' with the B.H.S., really, feel me
I unload, and explode, I reload, it echoes
I'm a thunderous clap, 'dro tucked under my cap
Make you wonder where I hid my gat
Don't worry 'bout that, better worry 'bout your own situation
I lead whole nations, take over whole radio stations
Stay outta my face son
In my world... you ain't got no place son
Stay out of my face son
Stay out of my face son
In my world... you ain't got no place son
Stay out of my face son
Stay out of my face
(Big Shug)
I, choke out promoters who be short on the dough
Slap up haters, who diss the flow
Gold-diggers only get the toe...
Up they booty hole when they outta control
For sho', and naysayers, I crash in they face
In Shug world, them motherfuckers got no place
Wannabe rappers, who label cassettes
I break them shits when they sound weak in my deck
I seen your last beat, so you pose no threat
I got fag niggaz like you doin' the thug ballet
Sucka nigga park my car valet
And get yourself two dollars, from my wallet
I'ma catch passes from chicks like Wayne Chrebet
And they sweat like I play for the Jets
Am I the best? It's hard to tell
Remember the blueprints were made in a lonely cell
To get the cream, and get the fame
Spit the lyrical slugs, that leave most niggaz lame
What's the game? To win this shit at all costs
I got what it takes to be the underground boss
(Hannibal Stax)
Up and comin', but you, you think you truck runnin' on diesel
You just a selfish lil' bitch, me, I'm all for my peoples
You gon' fuck around and let yourself deceive you
I'ma hunt you down and see you when you least expect
I'm heat, you wet
I'm famished and you beef, I guess I'll eat you next
I'm just as rock as my dick, you just the opposite
Can't stand to see me bubbilate on top of it
Lyrical, it all becomes clearer when it's visual
We maximize, congregatin with alibies
From righteous to criminal,
Just to make your life a tidbit more miserable
So keep playin' me close like I ain't tryna get rid of you
I feel for you, and this is all in your mind
If ya dare get physical, I'ma make ya every fear
Real for you, splash my drool, gather my screws
And get to drillin you just because
You thought it wasn't when it was love
Back the fuck up out my shit before I hurt you"

Once you step in the arena, cheater
YOu gon' see what the fuck I said Listen up, I said
A whole lot of things on the minds of most of my mens
But they shy, so may I
Say things that currently, common thugs wondering
Like If I made a hot beat, could I fuck Lil' Kim
Why did Ron Artest flip on the fans
But ain't do shit to Ben Wallace, knowledge
Do the one son, who is son
Ay yo Guru Peace Wop stop playing
There's a certain sucker, imposter, rocking your name
It's kind of lame, it's kind of strange
When they know GangStarr, go back far
Rap's throwback, splat, hold that dawg
Engineer that ass back to ass-cap dawg
So you could fine-tune your membership card
(Guru)
Why don't you step in the arena, cheater
You gon' see what the fuck I said listen up I said
Got a whole lot of things on my mind I want to spit, I ain't shy
*I said*, so may I *I said*
Does this idiot here, have any fucking idea
How many mics I've touched in my illustrious career
Got mass appeal, to get a rep, I grab the steel
Code of the street, and not they have to kneel
Before the bling era, NYC had it locked
Have we forgot I said, I'll blow your spot I said
I'm from the days of when Big and Pac used to be tight
Known to get loose with a mic, I'm used to the fight
Listen, I ain't your average meat-rapper
I'm well acquanted with beats
So of course we keep clappers
Forget the politics and who's supposed to be nice
I represent what a MC's supposed to be like
(Doo Wop)
Hennessy was a popular drink and it still is
My name is Wop, considered one of the illest
Mixtape inovador, spit plus kill a fader
Never did a bid, but the kid know how to spit a razor
Born in east LA, but the Bronx raised me up
What you want I said I said
We could get it crunk, cracking or popping
This is Wop, and what, the hole locked
(Guru)
I could see clearly now, the rain is gone
Solar supplying tracks we getting famous on
Bodies got laid out once the bangers rung
But they still want to play, knowing the game is done
One over, we bring the slaughter like fluff waters
Boy it's deadly I said You not ready I said
I put in work like a factory
Have you losing your faculties
You heard me I said you not worthy"

I get at you, I'm that dude, my style could you
GURU, the keeper of the gate, lead you to your faith
Righteously I stand with my heat around my waist
They said I couldn't do it, I succeed with ease
Others bleed over greed, I'm smoking trees overseas
Listen fucker, you don't want to tussle and muscle
You don't want to end up on the wrong side of my hustle
I could walk on any block in any continent
MAke MC's step their game up and fuck up their confidence
A true definition of a season vet
I ain't expose you, 'cause I ain't have a reason yet
ANd If I seem upset, or maybe even vexed
It's 'cause somebody owes me dought and yo I need my check
Still I'm a daring, dash it, tearing their dome
Said you was a gangsta, found out you was wearing a thong
It's them loud-mouth cats that get you into trouble
Keep your nose clean, that way you could slowly bubble
I created a man and created supply
If I had a school, rappers coudln't wait to apply
I'm tremendously tight, when defending my right
I'll throw a combo, and then I'm ending the fight
The G U R U with SOlar on the track
Pop shit and run away and catch a hole in your back
The streets been mine and I ain't never left
I ain't never forfeit and I ain't never forget
The hallways, the alleyways, the cornerstore action
Straight gullyness, I generate pure attraction
New York talk without a pacid to walk
Better reach motherfucker, that's your last resort

You cats wanna dance I'll let the heat sing for ya
Then beat the murder case with first string lawyer
I'm the worst thing for ya - a thug in the flesh
If youse a nigga but you bitch, I'll put a slug in ya dress
If you think you got wiz, put your luck to the test
But you could catch somethin' hot, tryna fuck with the S
I got dimes to suck me off and let me nut on they breast
Can you say that... no wait, hold up, lemme repeat it
Can you cats say that shit and really mean it?
I'm at the spot gettin' treated, while you vets gettin' heated
Like the scrub that you are, little fuck that you are
Before the deal, I still had dubs like a star
My crew recognized at the clubs and the bar
Son of y'all and you still gotta love who we are

See I'm finished makin' papi rich, coppin his coke
Next time he see me, I'm like ""He better savor ya throat""
Sorry amigo, but a nigga like me, need dough
Fuck it, I'll burn the bridge and come back on a yacht
Y'all the type of cats think shit's sweet when it's not
Bring the heat when it's cool, bring the ice when it's hot
Niggaz confused, I'm just tryna help you tally ya dues
And rally ya crews, and end up in a alley with goons
See when it come to the cash, I be on the worst shit
Roll up on you in a hoop, bumpin Biggie first shit
""Gimme loot, gimme loot"" and don't try to get cute
Nobody keep cash in they pocket nigga, empty ya boots
Too many niggaz got the game twist, poppin' they Cris'
And rockin' they wrist, and end up gettin' robbed in the Bricks
I'm stoppin' this shit, Gunn's on the top of ya list

Your Willy status, and success and fame's over
Stone and Two Gunns came over, to bless some shit with the god
Geuss what, my dogs just pissed on your lawn
Flipped on you pawns, just 'cause you was kickin it wrong
And don't ask me for advice 'cause I ain't diggin ya song
Time to straighten it out, we takin' the clout
Fuck a short career, listen y'all I'm spacin it out
Tri-state niggaz, some of the illest y'all hear
Illest ya meet, yeah some of the realest ya fear
Fuck the truth, I'm concealin y'all and stealin all queers
Since y'all niggaz slept on me, I ain't feelin' your tears
I like to pinpoint a sucka, like a country on a map of the globe
Get it to some gangsta shit, watch 'em clap then he fold
Enter my zone, soon get smothered with mase
I'm on the block, who run the streets is watchin, I cover my face
I'm bubblin papes, my son grew to smugglin nape's
So we jugglin cakes, and from ya shorty I'm lovin' the face
I'm huggin the block, my big dogs, they thuggin' the block
In my hood, fuck runnin' nigga 'cause we tustle with cops
Real Picasso, write rhymes, visualize
Spit raps on how to survive on family ties
Rock a no-name sweater, with a Iceberg tee-shirt under it
Leather seats in my Nova, and fifty G's I'm comin' wit
Next day I come through, I'm dipped in the Armani jumpsuit

58,Too Dark See,2005,Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures (2005),,Guru,"It's yo man Guru, building right now in the lab with the God Solar
Tuning you in like so not tracking you down
Niggaz tried to dome my shine
But now my shit is crazy bucked up
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Too dark to see, what I need to be and you know
I can't use it any more
We need the streets to peace
Fake friends tried to keep me down, life tried to beat me down
I bounced back nigga and nothing can defeat me now
The game had me twisted, angry and upset
About to take it all risk it, crash and burn like a jet
But I live for this, yes I was made for this
I sacrificed for this and there is nothing I would trade for this
So every ghetto I walk through, every person I talk to
Could feel me, bringing life like I ought to
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Too dark to see, what I need to be and you know
I can't use it any more
We need the streets to peace
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Too dark to see, what I need to be and you know
I can't use it any more
The fights, the mic, my life
See I'm a strong man, you try to play me I'm the wrong man
And when I spit, it's like smacking you with long hands
You can't bury me with jealousy
I got soul, watch me move the crowd, check my melody
Misery loves company, that's what they say
So all you lame ass niggaz, stay the fuck away
Mad rooms filled with snakes waiting to suck my energy
They explode at the dust, just another bad memory
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Too dark to see, what I need to be and you know
I can't use it any more
We need the streets to peace
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Too dark to see, what I need to be and you know
I can't use it any more
The fights, the mic, my life
I heard it all son, from threats to straight lies
Any problems, I'm rolling with vex to take life's
I ain't want it like that, but I be damn If I don't
Preserve and protect and what's a man if he won't
That's why right now I'm on the next page boy
You don't really want to take it to the next phase boy
My struggle prepared me, that's why you all leary
You thought you was Bruce Almighty like Jim Carrey
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Too dark to see, what I need to be and you know
I can't use it any more
We need the streets to peace
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Too dark to see, what I need to be and you know
I can't use it any more

Right now I'm gonna take you for a ride
Hold on tight, so you don't slip or slide
This train is packed, you don't get no seat, yup
You gotta stand on your tired feet
Where we goin' don't worry, you'll be there in a hurry
But you better watch you pockets cause the thieves work quickly
This is a New York transit thing
Don't wear too much gold and hide your diamond rings
And don't smile at anyone
Cause people out here, they like to travel with handguns
You say you like this trip, well are you sure?
You better step lively, and watch the
Watch the closing doors
""Watch the closing doors!"" [cut and scratched x3]
(Guru)
Here we go, as we ride, through the underground
Coming from Uptown, taking you downtown
Headed for Brooklyn, Brooklyn the planet
Somebody stinks in here - I hope you can stand it!
Homeless people everywhere holdin' cups for change
And if you don't have none, they may look at you strange
But this is all part of the scene
And yo check those kids 'cause they're startin to scheme
See them lookin' at you up and down?
Oh yeah they can tell, that you're somebody from out of town
Think they won't harm you? Well they might
And that ain't right, but everyday is like a fight
""Watch the closing doors!"" [cut and scratched x6]
(Guru)
Ah ah, ah ah ah
I can't quit, I gotta do what I must
'Cause I can take you on a ride with the lyrics I bust
'Cause I'm a master, try to diss and I'll blast ya
Any wack MC that steps up, is gettin' plastered
Straight against the wall, 'cause I don't stall
I give 'em drama and trauma, till they all fall
And for those who don't know, about the city life
It's where we take no pity, and the kiddies are trife
Takin' the train is just part of it
The next stop is Brooklyn, you're comin' to the heart of it
You never know what will occur
So just keep to yourself and watch the closing doors

Come test son, you'll get done
So don't be stickin out your chest son

So many thugs niggaz rappin' bout they saw me sellin crack again
Catch me at the Hard Rock, ballin at the MGM
Fuckin' it all, I blow a million on craps
Done spent a million on straps, so I'm heavily heated
Never had a bitch on yo' dick kid, though I know you need it
Mia keeps the mega hoes and hookers, you can't count the amount
And kid them extra bitches in your video don't count
I never lied on a record, I put that on my son
If my niggaz caught me frontin, they've cut out my tongue
Well connected baby bitch nigga, ya can't run far
My riders know where the little and the big cribs are
It ain't the funds ya got, but how long ya got it
It ain't the guns ya got, but how much ya shot it
I'll look you deep in your eyes like I ain't never done a record
Step up all on ya bitch and have the hooker butt-nekkid
With the ""knock-the-tooth-out-nigga"", ""blow-the-roof-out-nigga""
""Fuck-the-cops-with-thirty-men-and-shootout-nigga""

Still when I mobs in the club, I have ya tuckin ya gold

Spittin' thirty-thirty, pushin J30's, you niggaz ain't worthy
Across the county, my Suspect niggaz surround me
Come off it - fuckin' ya bitch, whoever's closest
I know about the dru-dugs, safe behind the portrait
Crazy bank, livin' it up, to make an estate
You ballin now, face down on the fuckin' floor now
Sonny Blade got this hits locked down for days
I got the guns up, ready to run up startin my blaze
(Older Don)
Yo, Suspectz, lock down blocks, run up in spots
Fuck the cops, swervin on a belt in the drop
Bad bitch, rubbin my cock, one hand on the glock
And I can't stop, won't stop, until I get it get it
Done shitted, called beef and dealt wit it
So forget it homes, Older Don is fully blown
Southbeach, buggy-eyed Jag, sittin' on chrome
Freaked off, like the illest porn

Flows hot, your's lukewarm - Flex gonna drop the bomb
See the tattoos ingraved in the arm, this shit is gangsta...

Potential victims know my rep, they fear the pain
Emcees think they runnin' things 'cause they wear the chains
Still get third degree burns from the severe flames
Ain't nuttin changed kid, I still walk with a bop
While you wanna be punks, be lookin' awkward a lot
'Cause I make the spot hotter than the cops on your block
'Cause some of y'all are worse than bitches, and be talkin' a lot
'Cause you still don't understand that I'm iller than y'all
And it ain't just because I know more killers than y'all
But because I know that half of y'all ain't willin' to brawl
See me, I'm quick to start it with you chicken-hearted
Fake hustlers, phony gangsters, where'd you get your part at?
Some flick that you watched, or some legend you swept
Let's talk about some real shit, 'cause there's paper to get
Time to turn this respect into cash and major checks
From NYC to Cali, flip the dough and invest
With my Underground Connect, Iceberg pass the tec
Only run with street soldiers and no pussy cadets
Cop millinneum jewels and you still shop for bagettes
Straight like that... ha

But does this worker know what kind of jobs that there are?
Degrading things like cleaning up people's vomit
For a little bit of dough, and plus your brain gets nothing from it
I'm smarter than that this girl thinks to herself
I'm worth more than that, she thinks to herself
She pours a drink for herself while she stares out the window
This guy says he got work for her, maybe she should go to him yo
The money's good, and plus he'll dress her up nice
She left her baby's daddy 'cause he beat her up twice
She don't really like sex
But she hates welfare checks
And where there's money, that's where she thinks there's respect
And what's this girl's purpose? Will she self-destruct?
When this sisters about to go down, who's there to help her up?
These distraught thoughts of a young man in a rooming house
This messed up life, this poverty, he could do without
But what options does he have when all hope is gone?
A brother gotta eat, plus all the Henny and all the smoke is gone
All it takes is one quick stick
Gotta fill his belly now, which vic should he pick?
He does his dirt all by his lonely, forget his homies
He doesn't fell like splitting any loot, them suckas be acting phony
So much potential but all gone to waste
Now he lurks in night, with a loaded gun on his waist
Too late for this lost soul, his life's in a chokehold
Mentality is weak, and doing crime is all he knows
Never caring who he hurts, as long as he's taking money
Forget an education, and legal ways of making money
And what's this kid's purpose? Will he self-destruct?
When a brother's about to go down, who's there to help him up?
Who's there for my people on the streets? (Who's there? Who's there?)
Who's there for my people who got nothing to eat? (Who's there? Who's there?)
They build more prisons, and close down schools
Who's there to teach the children the golden rules?(Who's there? Who's there?)
Who's there for my people in the streets?(Who's there? Who's there?)
Who's there for my people who got nothing to eat?(Who's there? Who's there?)
They break our family, neglect the elderly
Who's there to bring a cure? Where's the remedy?(Who's there? Who's there?)"

Yah this is the real vibes OK?
To all the man and the 'oman dem out there
This the word
The original jazz and the reggae vibe
Yah watch this
([Shug] Young ladies, fly ladies, young ladies in the house)
Yah this is Patra the Queen of the Dancehall
Teamin up with Guru, of course
([Shug] Young ladies, fly ladies, young ladies in the house)
Bad bad by law, you know say you're da numba won
Trust me... watch dis!
(Guru)
Come on take a ride with the lyrical five foot eight
And three-quarter warrior; I saw you pass me in the corridor
POW -- the eye to eye contact was all that (AY)
I dug your little steelo, fine, you dug mine
You want my digits? I'm with it (take it)
You could ring me up whenever, whatever's clever (ONE time)
(Big Shug)
Stroll your way, you know you want me (BO!)
So bring your game over here to the bar
You know you wanna sit and hang with the star
Maybe get a new house -- and a BRAND, NEW, CAR! (a-hah-HAH)
But +The Price Ain't Right+
'Cause I ain't your size baby, and I ain't your type
(Kool Keith)
Check it
Your honey's fly, but she wants me, I'm all that
She's perpetratin like she never even heard the record
Or saw the video, or heard the loudspeakers
You got the TV, your whole family did see me
([Shug] Young ladies, fly ladies, young ladies in the house)
Kool Keith in the house with Shug and Guru
Primetime jazz and limousines gettin' to you
([Shug] Young ladies, fly ladies, young ladies in the house)
(Patra)
Okay... check dis baby... way up top 'bove
(Guru)
Baby you look good in that dress
Let's get out of here and take it back to my rest
I don't think I'm bein too forward
Would I like to break out right now? Yeah I sure would (ah-hah)
I dig the way you be lookin' at me
I dig your confidence, you want me, it's evident (trust me)
(Big Shug)
My man told me that you like me
You wanna write me, cause you heard I have a wifey
But I'm on some mo' straight up stuff
I get witchu and probably spend a little while
Somewhere in the park after dark
Incognito, that's how I flow
(Kool Keith)
Well I'm here for you, are you there, where?
Takin' peeks, and sneakin winks, whatever brotherman thinks
You on a mission, for famous people in position
Holdin' in your love, admirin what I'm doin'
Gettin' through in, time and time
She follows us backstage... yeah...
(Patra)
First day, guess what Guru said to me
Dark and lovely, how could you be
It is right for me
Because, whiny whiny, me whiny sexy
All de man dem, just-a rush me...
(Guru)
Check it out
The time is right, you hold me tight (my love)
In the twilight, away from the spotlight
We can explore mysteries that last all night (trust me)
Nobody has to know but us
Honey you know I'm the man
Baby for you I got big plans (eh eh)
(Big Shug)
You say I'm just a lonely man (no more)
But tomorrow I'll be your King, the ruffneck swing
You know me from my name on the streets
You wanna be with me, it's easy to see
Since you kissed me on the cheek
Now you wanna be my everyday freak (hah hah!)
(Kool Keith)
Lookin' at me, my man and him, my man and him
Champagne pop, don't waste time, you can get with him (MEOW)
We got some drinks, you lookin' at the fine wine
Eye contact is on, all I see is sihlouette
Sheer plastic, freaky so fantastic (it's like dat)
I wanna touch it, see if it's real
True at heart, I wanna see how you really feel
Take off your mask and reveal
(Patra)
Tell dem come wind
Only if you can make her feel fine
Y'know... because...
Eyes are watchin me
Every single step I take
Eyes are watchin me
They are countin' my mistake, JUMP
Him up and now dey flip the script pon cha chill
Steppin to you like medicated thrills
Dey can not wait come in from it his eyes
ANYthing not lay ya to smile ya analyze, BO!
I was born inna ruff neighborhood
Steppin up in light, now it feels good
No one is gonna stop me, no matta what dem say
An' if I'm da rockin', then I must DJ, cause
Eyes are watchin me
Every single step I take
Eyes are watchin me
They are countin' Guru mista-ake
Eyes are watchin me
True me nice and me love come wind
And me both love mashin
Eyes are watchin me
They love Queen Patra, 'cause I earn it an'
Guru and all-stars, ya large, inna dance
And the stars of reggae music, they LARGE
The original niceness
And Patra never the one to front, okay?
