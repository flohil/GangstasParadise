0,6 Feet Underground,2012,Psycho White (2012),,Yelawolf,"You can't push us around
(You can't push us around!)
You can't push us around

You can't push us around
(You can't push us around!)
If you try, going to lie
6 feet underground
Papa's in the closet, loading up that buckshot
Little sister hide behind the grandfather clock
I've seen that old blood money get washed
I watched the shotgun shell go pop
Got a couple rounds in the Chevy ashtray
I don't know why I was made this way
Sec-ur-ity don't want to get me
If we can;t get in, the fuck you say?
Too much billy is in this cup
Too many people are in this club
You keep looking at me like you want to jump
If we let loose homie, you won't get up
You can't push us around
(You can't push us around!)
You can't push us around

If you try, going to lie
6 feet underground
Little brother plays in the front yard gym
He only thinks, Jim's too quick
Stands 5 foot 2, nickname Slim
Motherfucker thinks he's 6 foot 10
Never seen a young man act so tough
Never see a frown till you seen that drown
Put another pit back in his cup
You know it's a fucking party when they coaster down
I know a little something about getting high
I know a little something about getting drunk
You fuck with the Wolfpack and everybody cries
So go jump in the pit if you feeling lucky fuck!
You can't push us around

You can't push us around
(You can't push us around!)
If you try, going to lie
6 feet underground
I don't really know what's wrong with me lately
I don't really feel like myself
Everybody's reaching for money
Sorry I can't help
Guess I could I throw you a bone
But if you were my dog, I wouldn't throw you a bone
I'd throw you a log
With, both of my knees
Both of my knees, on the ground
(I'm dropping famous shit)
People that are close to me know that god damn
You famous quick
Row with the boat, roll with it
With the bottle, I'm heinous kid
Jump, when I say, jump
You've got to jump from the clip
You gotta take a wiz
Stand up with team
Stand up on the ball!
Like a fucking animal
Eat, if I got to eat
I'm a eat you alive!
Yeah I know I said that twice
And don't make me say it again motherfucker!

1,Alabama Gotdamn,2011,Friday The 13th (2011),,Yelawolf,"You're just plain rotten
You're too damn lazy
You thinkin' he's crazy
Where am I goin'?
What am I doin'?
I don't know, I don't know!
Ye, so I got this personal mission
I'mma take this Crimson Tide banner
From the great state of Alabama that is
And I'mma take it to all 50 States
All 50 States in one song
Just so I can hear 'em say
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
I started my journey down in Alabama
Then my mama threw me in a swamp when I was five out in Louisiana
She told me to take my state everywhere with me
Then we moved to Oklahoma with her boyfriend from Mississippi
Her boyfriend was in the country music industry
So we hopped on a tour bus from Texas and went to Tennessee
Met a dude from New York at a rest stop in Arkansas he said, (Gotdamn!)
""You really do say howdy y'all!"" (Howdy y'all)
I'm a nomad, yeah, kinda sorta
I got stranded in Georgia
But I was headed to Florida
I hitchhiked the rest of the way down to Palm Beach
And I one-nighted a girl with black hair from Hawaii
I don't know how I landed in Indiana
But I got this Crimson Tide banner
And I ain't gonna stop until
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
That's 12 states down!
Yeah, put the Jack in the backpack
And I won't stop till I hear 'em sayin' that
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
Let's go!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
Well I stopped in Michigan with Eminem and popped some No-Doze
I took a plane to Maine and ran down the East Coast like
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, now down to Jersey
Pennsylvania, Maryland, to Virginia, the Carolinas; back to the dirty
I bucked to Ohio
And swam through Kentucky
Grabbed a bottle of Jim Beam
Got drunk and was feeling lucky
Met a girl who met a boy from Illinois who just dropped him (Gotdamn!)
Because he moved to Wisconsin
Well, I took her over to Minnesota
I tip-toed out of the room with her purse and now, Iowa!
I hurried to Missouri, from there I went to Kansas
Rode a twister to Nebraska, drove the Dakotas with Candice
Stopped in Montana to refill my bottle
I went roamin' in Wyoming and snowboarded through Colorado yellin'
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
28 states down, I'm on a roll!
Yeah, put the Jack in the backpack
And I won't stop till I hear 'em sayin' that
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
Let's go!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
Moving on!
I hit the Texaco in New Mexico
Hopped in the back of a truck that was carryin' vegetables
He took me to Arizona, to a trading post
I was headed for Utah so he offered me a sack of potatoes
I told him thank you for the ride up the road but I'm fine though
There's plenty of those up in Idaho
But Arizona's got some beautiful women though like (Gotdamn!)
She's fine but I gotta go!
30 pack, now I'm Oregon
I hit a couple of divin' boys when I stumbled into Washington
And I still got Alabama with me
Met an Eskimo from Alaska, bought him a beer and told him ""keep it Dixie!""
Lost my money in Nevada, security said ""I warned ya,""
Took my car so I had to skateboard to California, now
Everybody knows about Alabama got damn!
That's 50 states 'Bama!
Yeah, put the Jack in the backpack
And I won't stop till I hear 'em sayin' that
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
Let's go!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Everybody knows about Alabama
Everybody knows about Alabama
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!"
2,American You,2015,Love Story (2015),,Yelawolf,"Man, you got it all worked out, don't you? Old pair of shoes
Never wear your heart on your sleeve cause it don't go with the suit
You got a bad, bad woman with a young little pretty face
They told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Fuck you too
Mama said steer clear of the devil so you never played in the road
Always lookin' on the bright side, so you never see the potholes
You got a house on a hill, big news, that's a big deal
Big party with your big time friends, man, imagine how that feels
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Fuck you too
I believe in the modest dream, ain't lookin' for a pot of gold
A 6 pack and some good marijuana, I can watch my mama roll
I believe I can buy a few things like a house with a nice pool
Invite my nobody friends to the party and we'll be in it, fuck you
You got a blue collar father who drinks Budweiser out the bottle
20 dollars, an old Impala, a baby's mama
You work hard, you don't beg, you don't borrow
Night at the factory, daytime job at McDonald's
Your daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem
But you fell in love cause to you she was like a supermodel
And they told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway
It ain't no problem
You make somethin' out of nothin', you make money for a livin'
Pushin' buttons, stickin' digits, flippin' burgers in the kitchen
With the vision, you've been dreamin', you've been savin'
You've been given nothin' but shit
But you take it 'cause you're patient in this prison
Fuck everybody visitin', it ain't them who gotta live in this skin
With all these tattoos that you got, it fuckin' offends them
If it's you that I'm speakin' to, you must be my extension
I take my drink up and sip it, take my hat off and tip it
Slumerican
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Fuck you too
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Fuck you too"
3,Animal,2011,Radioactive (2011),,Yelawolf,"They should've never ever let you out
Going down, 'em all with the mouth from the south
What you gonna say, what you gonna do?
As you know they're coming, coming after you
Watch out for the D-Boys
Watch out for the boys in blue
You better keep it moving
(Big Boy)
You know they're taking shots at you
'Cause you're an animal, oh
Here we go
Alabama's own buddy promenade
And I'm in the zone now everybody
Bringing 'em home, baby, tour da stage
Slick Rick E. Bobby in a Nascar
Running up on motherfuckers like I'm in a bar
Sentimental motherfuckers in a cookie jar
Be the late night snack, I'm Santa Clause
Down to Panama beach, drunk in my underalls
Playing underwear volleyball with ya bra
I ain't bothered by your triple D's, not at all
Let me hold 'em up for ya, baby, while you walk
Wanna get the party bumping, let me do my thing
Get the marijuana, plant need watering
Throw it in a bong, let it start bubbling
Know what I mean, Butterbean bada-bada-bing
Trashy white, pass the mic, yeah, I'm doing 'em dirty
Fists start pumping when I'm in the lights like I'm rapping in Jersey
Never get elegant in elementary, never learned to write in cursive
Raised by the country B-Boys, I'm elegantly perfect
Rack it in, pack 'em in to the back again
Rap it up, rap it in, sicker than a pack of 10 mini thins
You'll get when I win but I won't lose
In fact I'm gonna win, win again with another hand
Here's another hand, here's another hand
Dealer, can I get another hand?
Here's a hand, king, king, king, king, king
Bitch, Yelavision and the dirty south
And you know we getting green, bitch, eh
They should've never ever let you out
Going down, 'em all with the mouth from the south

Watch out for the D-Boys
Watch out for the boys in blue
You better keep it moving
(Big Boy)
You know they're taking shots at you
'Cause you're an animal, oh
Candy coated whip running over candy coated rappers
(Vroom)
Panties on my drip
Do a back flip for me, baby
Be an acrobatic actor
(Action)
Do a cartwheel on the wall, will you?
Do a cartwheel while I chill on a bar stool
When I throw a dart at a wet seal, well
I can see ya well, I'm gonna throw a fucking harpoon
Go Looney Tunes and lose ya for the lose
To prove you're in a room, you're shrooming to the moon
But in the morning you're waking up like a broom
Swept off ya feet 'cause Yelawolf ain't a groom
I ain't popping the cherry, I'm popping berry
Moonshine, hop in the bedroom, let's move
If ya wanna compare me, compare me to a legend
Don't compare me to a young fool
Go get a gun, go get a gun, now get a cinna' bun
Now sit upon your fucking roof
I live a ton, I get it done, fuck anyone
You fuck anybody, you ain't fucking with the crew
Yeah, throw another bucket in the pool
Dry it out, now everybody skate
'Cause I'm a lord of a Doggytown
(Woof)
A.L.A.B.A.M.A, my state
My state of my mind, 1985, wide body
Looking for the little small tail gate party
Wanna get drunk, wanna fall up in a hottie
Get shitty like a porta-potty so
Jump on the paddy wagon
Like a Pakistani and packing a mack 11
With a pack of maniacs, 11:30 back at it again
I'm ready for the battle when and where
Motherfucker, they let another cracker in, yeah
They should've never ever let you out
Going down, 'em all with the mouth from the south
What you gonna say, what you gonna do?
As you know they're coming, coming after you
Watch out for the D-Boys
Watch out for the boys in blue
You better keep it moving

You know they're taking shots at you
'Cause you're an animal, oh"
4,Ball And Chain,2015,Love Story (2015),,Yelawolf,"You made me
Everything that I am
You called me names till I became a name
Now that's all that I understand
Now the joke's on you cause the whole damn world's at the palm of the fool's hand
Now the fool's got to choose
And the joker's in the smoker with his palm on the hot pan
'Cause I'm that boy with the ball and chain
Floating through the sky, looking down from my jet plane
Looking down from my jet plane, oh
Yeah, I'm that boy with the ball and chain
The boy with the ball and chain
Now I'm looking down from my jet plane"
5,Best Friend,2015,Love Story (2015),,Yelawolf,"(Verse 1: Yelawolf)
Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way
(Hook: Yelawolf)
To the father son and holy spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah
(Verse 2: Yelawolf)
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believing in
But if you spit on my fucking grave
And wish me Hell then I wish you well
I'mma send you straight up to my best friend
To the father son and holy spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah
(Verse 3: Eminem)
God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the lama
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace
Though maybe not fit to enter
The priesthood, but at least should
Make an attempt to show some remorse
Than to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I get attacked
So I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or
What I have to say on the mic then you
Might wanna act, just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause I'm a sinner
(I got a best friend, best friend)
Blood balls and intestines
They ain't never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever giving it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming
Cause failure's something I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my guts
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talking 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend)
Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power
Now when I blackout, power outage, stop
They powerless but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds to black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You be D-O-A, then announced
They pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shigy-shock you back to life
It's I'm-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the digy-Doc
Stigy-stopping and that's not an option
Something I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in the suit
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock and I shoot
Who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And they be waiting at the gate
When you get sprayed up, sending you hoes straight up
To deal with my (best friend)
To the father son and holy spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah"

He'll take your house down, off of them pillars.
And take your mom to sizzler, and feed her chicken liver.
That's cold blooded love, billy's a chiller.
4: 30 in the a.m., billy ain't slept for days.
Gotta keep up with the profit, gotta keep up with the craze.
It's a heavy shade, gotta walk through the maze.
Down where the sun don't shine, and the palm trees swade.
And when the wind blew, and the cradle fell.
Down come baby billy, and up come an able mil.
Mama stayed at work, daddy stayed in jail.
That's a full deck, but you gotta play what your dealt.
So billy dealt the joker, put the sheriff in the choker.
He drank himself sober, and pissed in a SuperSoaker.
And he wet 'em all up, and left his snow yellow.
That's hard life boi, for the ello."

9,Box Chevy Pt. 4,2013,Trunk Muzik Returns (2013),,Yelawolf,"I just popped some pills,
And all I want to do is not to feel,
Like a fucking ball on a soccer field,
'Cause everybody seems so not for real.
While this moon is up,
I want to ride around with you in the trunk.
I hope you don't mind I assumed you was,
'Cause I went and got a room for us.
So let's drink some drinks,
Until we get so drunk we can't wait,
To pull each other's clothes off and get naked,
And make the motherfucking Chevy shake.
Now I'm feeling fine,
In my 1979,
Trunk full of knock and the cup with the lime,
And I think that it's about that time.
So give me a shot.
I'ma take it up to the mountain top,
Or we could make it bounce in the parking lot,
Straight up in the police parking spot, fuck the cops.
We can roll,
All over the city we can go,
Everywhere you want to creeping low,
Baby I just want to beat the show.
So fuck that room,
'Cause I got the Chevy engine tuned,
And I'll keep it running just for you,
While we illegally screw."

That's A for Alabama, I'll be damned if I say Georgia
Tennessee in this bitch, I got some Hennessy that's paid for
Give me the big bottle, fuck it, if I break it, I'll pay for it
My ladies laying in the Chevrolet and I say ""Lord
Thank you for giving me this baby girl on a suede horse""
Yeah, this ain't no gay Ford
I'm pushing bowties till I die and I'm gonna ride till my legs sore
Vogues I got a set ""4"", plus a Beretta sitting in the floor
Better protect yours

Got that Glock laid in my lap
In case you want to play

And ride around all day

(Still) I'm an American Rock N Roll grand baby
Five generations of taking pictures with Grand-Am
The Chevrolet Slim Shady, there's no way you can save me
Bass boat flakes, you never seen such
Roll down my window like ""Who I am doesn't mean much""
Burning tread off a thousand-dollar tires with a clean touch
Six hundred horses running behind the mean clutch

Glaze on the dash, leather is smelling like Ralph Lauren
Feels like I'm watching television on a couch snorin'
I must be dreaming leaning back inside this chariot
Hitch on the back of this truck, my Harley I carry it
A chalice in wonderland, fill up my cup with
Jack D and take my fucking keys so that I don't, wreck it
Let me come sit on the passenger side and check it
How does it feel from over here? Oh, bless it
This is for all the Chevy's that I collected
Big trucks, low riders, whatever the best is
To you man I just want to give you a message
Uh', I used to sit on sidewalks like everyday
Watching punks and chumps in donks get hella paid
But I just focused on my vision and never quit n'
Now man I'm sittin' in my vision with a reason to celebrate
I'm

I'm the one who got that sloppy hooker holding my doe
I'm the king of the strip if strip means I get down
I'll pull trick and make em' put a dick in the fucking ground
I'm as smooth as it gets
I'ma move into this, Double-wide with a pouch and pay 200 of rent
When you run into this might as well run into bricks

Put a dollar on the table and stand up on your bitch
Holler if your able and let me see how dirty you get
If your feeling like a fighter put a plug in your clip
'Cause if you empty ammo at me you got more to deal with
More relatives then a cat with kitty litter and piles
With motherfuckers born to give a cop quotas and files
Should I show you the style or should I show you door
I could show you how'da hide a pound of weed in the floor cause...

Doesn't matter, I don't want Pa to skin me alive like he's gonna do to you if he finds out
Pa said not to bother him, and if he's not gonna be home, how can I bother him?
It'd be better if you just forget about it
Well I'm going to do it, and I'm gonna take Jack with me, 'cause Pa didn't say anything to him
Way down this country road and I holler
Where they make that moon shine still
There's an old man on the porch on a shack
And the shack is where he lives
Round the town they call him Paul
It's Paul from on the hill
And every time Paul does slay a hog
You can hear that hoggy squeal
I'm from the valley of the bible belt
That motherfucker preacher's daughter's son
Where they can't find no woman, no man, no cousin, no friend without a gun
Alabama that is my home
Fucking trailer park has got my heart
Off in the hood, I make home when I play in the woods after dark,
You won't find me sober much
Always got a bottle of Jacky O
I take my sips, I talk my shit
And I fight anybody that wants to go
Tall and slim, walk with a limp
'Cause my nuts are oversized
Fuck your dope and your alcohol
Because your shit is overpriced
Hit the bootleg for twenty-four before I'm 21 (mathematics)
Going to jail 'cause I'm drunk at Piggly-Wiggly (dagnabbit)
'Cause I be here and I do my time
'Cause I can't make bail on minimum wage
Nothing to do in the country but get
Drunk and watch that pendulum sway
Back in the saddle again
Throw my middle finger up to the law
I ain't gotta rob nobody tonight
But I might do it just because
I am a nut, I get bored
Did some pills but I want more
Fuck this world, fuck this town
If I fuck you once I fuck you sore
Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit goddamn
Pussy cunt bitch suck a cock
If you want some of this rock'n'roll
Take this pipe, suck this rock
Just a flock, super-hot
Clean 'em up, grab a mop

Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy yea yea
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy yea yea
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy
You don't want it with me motherfucker
I promise I put you with the piranhas inside of a shallow swamp
And then make you follow a boat full of drinking water
And sing to you lullabies
While I sip on nas under umbrellas.
Got a propeller sharp enough to eat through a two footed
Root of a tree, if it's onto me then it's cool like it's moving
So why do you think I fucking hate it
Or lay a log in front of my boat and put a stop to what I do buddy whatever
When I get up in the morning I think about
When it's all over they can put my body up in the river
With everything I did for the culture
Inside of a book and light a candle for my mama who got sick on the fucking fame
Immediately media will follow me to the end of the river
While the people around my body deliver rhythms and syllables, relevant to my scripture
I'm a sick son of a bitch, do you get the picture?
My fucking name is Catfish, really though
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy yea yea
Catfish Billy, Catfish Billy yea yea

Had to walks hours before I found this new kind of road
Had to spend months inside a dark room with my candles blown
But I came out with a light that blind at then end though
Oh I mean a book, cause a book of Neanderthals
Could it be what it what they though it was, well it's kinda known
And it's kinda yes when they dress up my talents [?]
This ain't a star but I got life like a planet though
I was just a bud and would knew that the plant would grow
Flowers and I got flower power like Abbey Road
I caught the sun shower drenched in a pot of gold
Bless you with this twinkling pile of smoke
The wind got in my sails in the creek, water no paddle boat
Nobody picking me off the ground when my saddle broke
It don't matter though, a horse is a horse
Plus I needed the workout, I'm kinda glad it broke
I'm ecstatic, better yet, I'm in that kinda mode
That classics are made from
I done felt myself change
(Where will you go now, what will it take)
I done felt myself change
(Is it true now, or just play)
Yeah that's me, with a fifth of that Jack D
Still ridin' dirty to 8-ball MJG
Still got the house in the little hood that raised me
Still know dope boys, I talk to 'em daily
Still got that red neck family who loves me
Still hop out of trucks in the heart of Dixie
Don't try to put me back, I'm apart of my history
Because I'm creative, smart and thrifty
'Cause I take the shotgun, a PBR no sippin'
Jump in the Chevy through some Catfish Billy trippin'
Hop on the 808, when I'm pimpin' you know I'm pimpin'
Never gave a fuck about the lines I crossed when I'm playing chicken
Raised on the Bible Belt with the cross I was made a Christian
What's up world? I'm in Alabama chillin'
And I just stuck a shot for the ones who stop and they hit the ceiling
Drop the top on the 65 in Nash, I can still here em, they're saying

(Is it true now, or just play)
I done felt myself change
(Where will you go now, don't turn around)
Do not succumb to the masses ideas
Or the ridicule and the judgement
Of those who follow the ideas of the weak
Will perish and they did fall of enlightenment
Become the vision of the minds eye
And carry your flame to the fire
Do not wait for the fire to carry the flame to you
Build, work, build, work, build, work, fall down
Fall down, fail, learn, learn, earn, earn and conquer
Money is the tool for a creation of the creative space
Do not squander the value of a gift from a friend
Family, strangers, enemies, Atheists, partisans, peddlers, people
People in this ocean of hungry minds
Feed, do no starve
Start now, wake up now
A trillion more lives will live happy before one of those trillion care a lot about your happiness
Love yourself and hate only you
If you don't..."

And so Drama beats.

Hold up
Damn rich, peanut butter guts in a Lamorghini, whoa
You must have white bread, lets make a sandwich
I ain't never seen money you got
Nobody got that kind of money in the Boondocks
So if you take me up show me the Balcony lookin' over
The Hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop
Popstars like you, you need a dude like me
To appreciate your wealth
I know you got an elevator in your house
But with me you'll appreciate the steps
Act like you don't wanna see how much of this Jack Daniels you can handle
You wanna drink and get cut like Rambo
And let me drive your Daddy's Lambo
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
(Yelawolf - Verse 2)
Your young and reckless, nice little diamond necklace
Got a pint sized vodka drink and your pretty in pink
Wanna go get breakfast
Though you ain't never been to waffle house
Always hanging in guys and dolls
If you came to the shop, I'll put you in the Chevrolet
And we'd slide to the mall
Yeah I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and DTA hoody
But I'm off to the party with rogue status looking for Beverly Hills goody's
Yelawolf and I'm an Alabama boy
Got more bounce than a salamander boy
Need a rich girl like I need a headache
But I can take it if I can drive your Daddy's toy
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel
One thing I gotta know

Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?

What you got in that tote bag
That one of a kind Prada
That beautiful behind inspires me
Makes one of my rhymes harder
Your daddy made a fine daughter
Make me wanna turn this wine from water
Keep the party going in and keep an 808 bumping cause Drama made a beat that'll climb the charta
Money, money, money, money, money
Ain't it funny what a hunny in a Lambourghini will do
Some will run into a hundred dollar bill
And drill a dick in any Tom and Harry with a 24 inch shoe
But come and explore this dude
Analyze my swing
It's Slick Rick E. Bobby baby
Gotta let me drop that thing, come on
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?

Whiskey, whoa whiskey
Whiskey, my only friend
Got me a bottle, lookin' out at my El Dorado
Smokin' a barro, whip up an egg and avocado
I'm on the porch like a slummy Ralph Lauren model
Flannel shirt like a lumberjack choppin' a log-o
Pistol next to the ashtray, no bow and arrow
Got blah blah though, knock the beef outcha top nacho
I'm livin' life like there is a tomorrow
I'm slow motion, I'm slow cookin'
The crock pot holds potatoes
I smell the storm comin', I like watching a sorrow
I like watching that muddy water fillin' up the potholes
I like hearing the woods cry, moan, whisper and sing songs
So I can think long; an aficionado
Raindrops on the string hit: a pizzicato
I'm free-fallin', the airplane pilot's on idle
Freezer lookin' like I hit the lotto
And I got beer colder than a Colorado hollow
Do you follow?
And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
'Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down

To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Drinkin' till I'm heavily faded
All the sudden the suds I'm sippin' got me feelin' edumacated
I complicate the uncomplicated
My drinkin' partners are the greatest
Me and my buddy, Jack Davis
Daniels, whatever, we Jimmy Beamin', if we get lucky, maybe
We get a visit from the baby King 13 and go fuckin' crazy
Ten racks for a crystal chandelier full of liquid swazy
Now Patsy Cline got me walkin' after midnight
I'm tippin' the neck, gotta make sure to keep the lid tight
Was sittin' up with attention and now I just sit like
Slump down in my chair like a pimp, pondering this life
I'm the great grandson of Otis Williams
Part of me's Cherokee, the other part is a pilgrim
So me and firewater's like splittin' me up the middle
One's tryin' to love him, the other one's tryin' to kill a man
And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do

The more I feel at home, the further I'm away
And all that I feel is pain
Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out the chain
Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins
The morning's across I've been when I wake
Am I asleep? Have I broken my faith?
Down on my knees, can you hear me when I pray?
Or am I a little too late to...

I took my Buck night
Stuck it in my bag
In a black Jansport that I've had since 2000 class
And some duct tape, the last of a roll I used
The first of it I used to patch a hole in my bedroom window glass
I broke into my trailer because this bitch locked me out
She took my keys and threw them into the yard, but I haven't cut my grass
Plus it was dark when I got home, I was driving fast
But the made it hard to see the road and I drove right past
Had to turn around in a cul de sac, dead end
And I barely made into my dirt drive, running out of gas
A late night at work, another tailspin
Got fired so I hit the bar and I got trashed
I stumbled in to find a note, ""I'm gone""
""No shit, bitch""
I crumble the note, and threw it on the ground, and picked up the phone
""Fuck"", she cut the wire, busted the jack with a hammer
I know, 'cause I can see that the plastic got bashed
I was so mad, that I went sober
With a forced laugh, I reached for the last thing that I need in my sack
(Haha) A picture of us in a cab, the night we said it would work out
That didn't last, a couple dollars short, or maybe just the wrong path
The reason was irrelevant to me, 'cause I just wanted payback
So I jumped in my truck, put the dash, spitted gas
And a bag packed up tape and buck knife, and that was that, thinking
This must be a movie
'Cause I'm about to roll tape again
I'm about to make a movie

Michael Myers and Superman
I pulled out the driveway, took a right on Rainbow Drive
While I tried to keep my truck alive, pumping down the street
I believe it was 55 outside, cold, and the window was frosted
Truck died and then I crawled into the pump station
Barely making it to the pump
I walked in, put my last 10 dollar bills on the desk
Snuck a pack of cigarettes in my pocket
As he reached for the register, the thought sparked in my head
To leave him dead, but no, fuck it
I'll save his life, and put 10 in the bucket
I ain't killing in public
It ain't in my budget
The door, I budged it
Slid through to the pump my gas as the thought
Of all the shit she put me through, but I was glad
I had a reason to go see her now
Other than to lay her down
I got a reason to treat her like a voodoo doll with this bait I found
I made the sound of screeching tires as I pulled out of the station
Mind racing for the placement of my rage, I was impatient
Movie in the making
So I punched the dash and my front windshield cracked
Me it harder to see what was in front of me
But I mashed on the pedal, stomping through the floor
With a leak in the door
The wind whistled like a whistle in a war, or a bullet from a pistols bore
Reached under my seat for a bottle of whiskey and took a shot
While my stomach was in a know, nerves shot
I mulled over the plot
""When I find this bitch, I'll put her in a ?lock, with a rope and a sock
Duct taped on her mouth and make her look at a clock
And every second, I'm going to pop one of her boyfriend's fingers
With a vise grip, while he's screaming at me, ""No! Stop!""
When I make it to his knees
While he's tied to a metal chair, with radio wires hooked to a live battery
I'm going to grab his head and make him stare at you
While you drill holes in his kneecaps with a screw
And this is only preview to scene 2!

18,Disappear,2015,Love Story (2015),,Yelawolf,"Daddy I've been thinkin' about you lately
Mama's never here and step daddy hates me
He drinks a lot, it makes him so mean
Mama always screams and it gives me bad dreams
Today I dropped my bowl of s'ghetti on the floor
I didn't mean to make a mess, I tripped on one of my toys
I tried to clean it up, really I tried
But I just made it worse so I went to my room to hide
I knew if Benny saw it I'd be in so much trouble
I didn't want to, but I did
And the thought of gettin' hit scared me so I didn't tell him
Benny saw it, he took off his belt and
You know... he hit me with it
Then he pushed my face in to the carpet where the s'ghetti spilted
But I forgive him though
I love you daddy, I guess I gotta go
There's a moth on my window seal
And it came to die alone
Through the pain of the pouring rain
I gaze into the storm
And I imagine I'm the son of a man
Who will hold me close and near
With these bruises on my face I cry
While I pray to disappear
Daddy are you there?
I know you're probably busy off working somewhere
Helpin' somebody, build a house or somethin' neat
You told me what you did, carpentry, right?
Man, that's so cool, daddy
I really miss you, so much that I would kiss you
Yeah even front of my friends
I guess you know I'm gettin' sick again
I've been throwin' up, I haven't been playin' much
I missed a lot of school this week, but I'm tough
I'll make it, you know me, daddy
I don't get what I want most of the time but I'm patient
Hey if you get a second
Maybe tomorrow you could come by just to check in
Because my babysitter's crazy
Mama don't believe me but she makes me get naked
And I'm embarrassed so I hide it
I'm tellin' you because you know my heart and what's inside it
I gotta go to sleep but don't turn off the lights
I love you daddy, or should I say Christ?
There's a moth on my window seal
And it came to die alone
Through the pain of the pouring rain
I gaze into the storm
And I imagine I'm the son of a man
Who will hold me close and near
With these bruises on my face I cry
While I pray to disappear
When the weeping willow tree sways from the breeze
I float away
To the end of the world, to the moon, to the stars
To the heavens where I'm safe
I'm a child, not a prey. I'm an angel, enslaved
I'm a life, I'm a world, I'm a rose, put to waste
Wake me up, let me live, let me breathe, let me breathe
Give me love, give me soul, give me guidance, give me peace"

Babies are hungry and mommy is bitchin'
'Bout bills that he need to go pay while he sittin'
Not even five minutes to drink a cold beer before hearing about what was left in the kitchen
Walk out the door for a walk to the store, bread was five dollars he only had four
Won't get a check till the first of next week and he said to himself I can't take anymore
With no heat in the house and no gas in the truck, and his four-year-old's birthday about to come up
It's gun, mask, duct-tape, gloves, now
What would you do for love? (ooh)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooh)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooh)
She's a single mother livin' in a hotel in the south side of the city
And she works at a bar in the strip to get tips savin' up for a place that is pretty
A twelve-year-old son to support, still in school with a father that's never around
He took her virginity, promised infinity
Then he took off and he hasn't been found
Most of the people she already knows
Have trouble survivin' and keepin' a home
That side of town ain't the place to raise a child
But she's doing her best and there's no where to go
Puts on a skirt, picks up her purse
He knows just what she does
His mama can't work at the bar every night
So his mama is hustlin' and sellin' drugs
What would you do for love? (ooh)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooh)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooh)
(Woohoo, woohoo)
(Woohoo, woohoo)

20,Empty Bottles,2015,Love Story (2015),,Yelawolf,"Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger, can I call you a friend?
My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Brown bottle sits with the permanent bliss
Razor sharp glass lips, give me a kiss
Eyes fixated with the familiar shape
Black label, white letters, they integrate
Cupid's in the bar room with harpoons
I bloom in the night fog like mushrooms
See every bullet hole in the window of my past
Now that's what I call a shot glass (2, 3, 4)
Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger, can I call you a friend?
My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Count the cracks on the sidewalk
Pack the cigarette box in my left palm
Flame on the tip of a smoke
I don't know where the light came from
Legs like a ghost, I still walk
Whole world mushed concrete, feels soft
Blinded by the cameras pop flash
I'm a big fan, shot glass? (2, 3, 4)
Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger, can I call you a friend?
My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Oh, what a life it's been
What about my life in there? What about the would and when's?
If's, maybe's, could-have-been's? You didn't know shit about me, man
You didn't go to school in the clothes that I had to wear back then
Look at you, fucking faggot, what you looking at, punk?
What, bitch? Give me another shot, hey, what you want?
Make it a double, fuck it, a triple, fuck it, give me the bottle
And then it's bottoms-up, what a positive role model
Hey wolf, wolf!
Come on man, time to go
Wake up in the morning feeling like I'm not awake at all, take a Tylenol, shake it off
Wanna take another shot of Jack but Jack D shot me with a sawed-off
Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing

21,Everything I Love the Most,2011,Radioactive (2011),,Yelawolf,"Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I'm holding close, is so far away from me?
They don't want me to love it, they don't wanna hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why is everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!
Yeah! Problematic, I'm so problematic
That I'm probably a problem addict
Pop an aspirin cause my head is hurting
Hotel bedroom, missing curtains
Sheets everywhere like a storm has passed
In fact it looks like I got into a wrestlin' match
Empty bottle of Jack, I could tell after that
I could smell it in fact, it's like death and ass
Think for a minute if I look over and look
To my left is an opened book, a Bible
To my right is a guilty conscience and her name is Brooke, my rival
At least I think her name was Brook
She's asleep, and I'm givin' her the lamest look
Move her hair back so that I could see your face
Cause it was dark and I met her at the game it took
About five minutes to get her inside the whip
Another five minutes to get up inside the lips
Never try really, man not tryna slip, ah! But it was just thighs and hips
OK, I was high, shit
On alcohol and the Yelawolf ego trip
And it's the walk of shame again!
Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I'm holding close, is so far away from me?
They don't want me to love it, they don't wanna hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!
Smokin' out, throwin' up
Keep a fifth off in my cup
Trying not to be a simp
But every time I take a sip
I think I'm gonna fall in lust
I'm back and forth like I'm packing a truck
In a house that never runs out of boxes
Knowing that if I put on my tennis shoes
And a fresh fit, I'll end up sockless
By the end of the night, flip flopping
I'll B-Boy if you let me Hip Hop in
Alligator skin cowgirl boots only means let's get it crockin'
That mini skirt makes any man a flirt
Manicures animal furs and a purse
What could a little bit a smoke and Henny hurt?
You make any jerk make a penny work
Sinister with sin in her
She can leave a devil sitting in the church
On another level not in the earth
Jessica Alba had twins at birth
Trippin' sure, piles of E, ménage-a-trois, piles of three
Waking up again not proud of me
Yeah, I'm a lousy fiend
Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I'm holding close, is so far away from me?
They don't want me to love it, they don't wanna hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!
Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I'm holding close, is so far away from me?
They don't want me to love it, they don't wanna hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!"

Mullet hawk, what?
Country folks don't talk much
They just get to work: sawdust
Chainsaw, axe, knife, cut firewood, burn, logs, heat
Sleepin' bag by the bricks: call me the fly, I'm on some shit
Drum this out with two sticks
Soup a high school Coupe for new kicks
Zoom, raps make mummies jealous from a tomb
Knock twice if you feel it
Born to rip, I should've been
Perforated by the rings like a Mead notebook
Squares want an artery blocked when I'm around
Circulated, nerds are in, Urkel made it
I'll slap Urkel, take his lunch money
Punks they run from me, drunk and upset
But I don't run clumsy, punch a perp'
A one, two, three: I'm at the Chelsea Hotel
Like Sid and Nancy with the knife, and two grams of candy
Give me the dizzies, fee, fee, fuck me
Please oh please don't leave
Just give me the keys and crank that beat
'Cause I might double up and straight dry heave
But believe, oh believe I'm cold, I'mma freeze this beat

Relax in a 1985 box train, perhaps I'm playin' Relapse
Boss, Eminem saw the gem in him
Oh, me? Yeah, who thought?
Just toss the white trash out the window
Now I'm in a ditch like broken pencils
Empty bottles and stolen rentals
This one is for all my kinfolk
Yeah, bring 'em in, though
Out the rain, what's a friend for?
Word, oh for sure, yours truly, at the door
Had to add a syllable to that word
Country, but, oh, of course
Bitches go berserk for certainly, no need to be coerced
Odd economy, don't need no nine-nine-nine-nine-nine and I know
Just the na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye, and hey, let's roll
These hoes are no good, pills are okay
I just wanna get high, fuck what you say
Wild, the pen-play kind of like a samurai sword
With a big bitch, bow to sensei
Motherfuckin' bitch, it's pay your rent day

One glove and a fuckin' pair of penny loafers

Faces change
But this place'll stay the same
And I'll know when I'll go
Home
Yeah
And I'm pickin' up another bag
And I pack another knapsack
The airport's like a stoplight to me
Sittin' on red, green light go
Can't see my family
My family grew into a globe of friends and fans
Or some may call 'em
And it's on the stage I stand
To jam, rock, sing
No wakin' up to stop the dream
I lived the life, signed a picture
'Cause no dam could stop the stream
Or floodgates, I'm in a fucked race
And a pocket fulla culture condoms
They put you on the podium for first place
But on the block, they judge you on 'em, so
Who got the South in a six-pack, and a shotgun just for show
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth
Put the hood in mossy oak, I'm the
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life
Beat me down with criticism
But at least the critic's write with a broken pen
There they go again
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' gem
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in
I'm goin' home, I'm home again
Bring it back up in the U.K.
With a Dixie flag and a sixty sack
Catfish Billy, hell you say
I'm just bein' blunt, homie, keep the grass
(Now bumper sticker that, drop a rap and change me)
And you changed me
Into what I am now
Oh, you made me
Into something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie, ooh
And so now my broken wings won't fly
Yeah, take one look
Better yet, take two
But if I take that break, as a move you made
This dude you shape will come take you back
Back to the roots I've been
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in
Or a spot to sleep in
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season
'Cause I am not the reason
That the image you're used to seein'
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless
Meaning yes, I'm different
Differently made
And me screamin' the A
Is not the difference in grades
It's the place I stayed
'Cause the schools were underpaid
The teachers taught, but to me they fought
The star that was underway
It was under Wayne, it was in my name
Michael, M.W.A
Atha, and in trouble I stayed
Breakin' out of this bubble they made
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand
Committed to the words I say
A bloodline's not a family tree
It's a needle in my skin for all to see
I ain't never got a spring break, tattooed drunk
But I drink and take the ink
(Shirts off, you can't, you can't change me)

Into what I am now

Gotta be on time, gotta go do show phase
Kinky lick, gotta go for cold tape
Man they sure want me to do a song for the whole place
Without a microphone, DJ and no stage
Someone put my products on my pockets of jose
Knowin' inside of my heart these people are so fake
Pictures of New York, skyliners are back dropped
23 floor up, pound lookin' at cap tops
I'm so fuckin' nervous that I can't even act now
Thinkin' jumpin' out this window ain't such a bad drop
Smakin the black top 'cause I'm on the have a lot
I'm just a have not
This in my time and am I lookin' at that watch
It could be the end of it all, maybe my last shot
But I got a funny feeling it ain't right
I tell my manager but he just thinkin' it's stage fright
Minus the fuckin' sweat that's drippin off of my face
I realize if I do it then it's only for a price
Doin' my cookin, add a ho with a big bite
Em other be kitchen, dealin' for late night
Do they realize I'm in terrible shape right?
Can't even afford to get my little boy a bike
I sit down in front of LA Lee

Then fuck it, pull the umbrella out, haters entertaining
I'mma ball for them focused
Got a lot of shows I gotta go hit
In the back of my mind I'm thinkin' did I blow it?
But you notice all the people you roll with are losing their focus because of my ego
'Cause I'm hopeless, won't listen to nobody
They sit and go on about how I won't make it
You won't make it
I keep fuckin' up relationships with executive folks
With these checks to cut for deals, I'd be broke and
Stuck in the south with nothing but my old shit
And no new whips, new house, new clothes
New dough, you know you gotta go face it
Look er in the eye, say I'm sorry for fucking up
These rappers are coming up
What you gonna do about it?
Just sit back and watch 'em and get up and make a move about it, be about it
See it's about the way you committed, now you gotta go and get it
I got a question
Are fuckin' up? Answer
Fuck yeah
I ain't about to be another white boy stuck here
Hit the road, do any fuckin' show that I could get overseas
Let's go Canada, let's go south by south-west
Yelawolf expo, kill that, made it mine
Focus, let's roll
Never lay when the mama tryin' to get a hold
None of 'em have me, and here come Interscope
Yeah
Then I got a deal
You know?
I don't know
I guess integrity goes a long way man
Gotta know when to hold em, know when to fold em
Shady Records
So American
Just give me some place that I can hang
Somewhere way back in the back to drink a drink
You ain't gotta tell me that I ain't the same old same
I've seen some things
We won't change

For all the stress that went into my songs

The most honest I could be with you to date
Is to say thank thank you Shady
For lettin' me be me with no holds barred
Thank you for the chance to enhance this old car
This old jar of moonshine is but two lines on a blank sheet but so far
These two lines point directed to my home on the mothership sonar
Valet UFOs, I go park
The dirty south needs a soap bar
In the mouth of these MCs but
But who am I to judge on what they love?
I guess they enjoy being broke and co-stars
And I'm soakin' so hard
From the sweat that I could take my clothes off
I done fucked and raped the whole yard
Should sit back and shake the gold off
But I'm already gone
I got a vision like Teller, sons
In an envelope like letters
Lettuce, green, money, long
Wolfpacks in a calzone
I'll keep makin' these albums
Yeah you might have heard a dial tone
But I was on the other line when I hung up the phone
I'll send a postcard when I leave
I think about you when I dream
And when I'm up under the high beams
I reflect that shining
So you can feel the heat of light
A life of violence till I die in
Yeah I've done come a long way
From Dixie Land, take my hand
I'm talkin' lowriders, 77 Devilles
L-Dogs, nothin' but them 'Lacs
Sittin' on boxes in the front yard of the trailer park
Hell, one time for the single wives and the little cribs
Two times if you know what it's like to fuckin' live
Three times in a row you've been late on the rent
Four times before you did the same old shit
Baby done grown up, workin' that bid like a grown up
Fuckin' toned up, let the Glock talk, I'ma gon' hush
Just like daddy taught me, wait I didn't have one
Fuck it, I'm happy for him, 'cause he got a bad one
I popped outta that Easy Bake, land of the 'Bama, clean and safe
Dropped outta high school, reason, hey, I'm already high from a seedless egg

I don't know what it is about my soul that's got me hot and bothered
Somebody find me water, somebody find me water
'Cause I'm hotter than a preacher starter,
Hotter than dry leaves in August
Yeah, I'm a firestarter!
Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm a firestarter,
Uh, uh, uh, uh yeah, I'm a problem!
Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm a firestarter,
Uh, uh, uh, uh yeah, I'm a problem!
And I'm dialing
Better pick the telephone, me calling
Cat fish, really got the drill up on calling
Act to the wall and run for the office
In the back window steel, where the ball get?
AK clappin, no nigga pow that
Choppers always, coppers all get
Young, we barely to live in the morning
Death to my haters, say bitch to your coffin
Death to them coffin, ten toes down motherfucker I'm owling
Y'all play too much, get to pause it
Remind yourself that the Wolf is a auction
Going once, going twice, 25-35-50-50-55, balling!
Better take it in mind partner
Trunk music is a piece of gold
Uh, yeay! Take you to the truck and throw it in the day
What you got here? Now better give Denzel the white boy's redneck
With all due respect
So run it back till you go this leg
See? Long wings like dead
See city girls, bathroom nightmare
Seats back in the line
You already know who make these!
I'm a firestarter, sweet dream, sweet dreams
Bitch, I'm a firestarter, sweet dream, sweet dreams
Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm a firestarter,
Uh, uh, uh, uh yeah, I'm a problem!
Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm a firestarter,
But this fire's out of control and bitch you can't put me out"

S-Sitting the back (f-f-f-funky shit)
Peanut jelly box, sitting in the carport
808 crack, and I'm open like a barndoor
Beer bottle cap, put 'em in the floor
Set 'em in the floor, what a metaphor is this?
Kind of like newer beat with Travis
Eat it up, beat it up look at the atlas
Where should I go? Put 'em in a cereal bowl
In Alabama, then I holler out ""Cheerio""
Look at that shit, hit the drum back like elastic
And let it go like a mac?
S-Sipping on the green, feeling like I'm seeing Patrick
Got beans in the mattress, magic
Make you want to jump on a fat bitch
Ooh got to have it
(Boss) Send the wolf, pick a thing
On a pekingese bitch, go go gadget
(Owh) I'm all the way from the gutter
Flick a cigarette butt from a Chevrolet pickup
Geeked up on 7 Up
Got a centimeter? Wall up on a run like a cheetah
Want a better beat ah well, that'd be the day
Put you up shit creek
Paddle be away, hat to the side
Holler at you homie
What's the matter with you babe?
Sitting in the back with the bass on boom
Trunk gon' shake, and the wheels on zoom
American classic, trashy tunes
L.A. to Alabama, from noon to noon
They saying, (oh my god, that's some funky shit)
(Oh my god, that's some funky shit)
(Oh my god, that's some funky shit)
Oh my god, that's some funky shit
And I'm a Beastie Boy
Airwalks and a bowl cut
Skater when a skater wasn't cool
When it was just, ""so what? Fuck you dude""
Well fuck you too
To the crack with a backpack
I'll bust your fruit
I'm all about constructing my paper
Kind of like a pocket full of Elmer's Glue
Squeeze the bottle, turn the milk
Churn the butter, get the cheese tomorrow
I got a lock on my profit
No exits, no keys tomorrow
But I got steeze to borrow
Some Famous kicks to match
If I got a big sign, I'll rap
As long as TV got sticks to crack
So hit a drumroll, I'll jump in like a jump rope
Watch
Acapella like an elevator operate
While the operator labeled my fucking high tops
Rhythm like a clock, I'm scotch
You would've thought, it was written
But it's not
Rag hanging out them look at them jeans
Not a gangbanger but a banger who sings
And momma don't you worry about a single thing
Really though, cause daddy brought charcoal, and gasoline
And we cooking up tonight, t-bones, pinto beans
Sitting in the back with the bass on boom
Trunk gon' shake, and the wheels on zoom
American classic, trashy tunes
L.A. to Alabama, from noon to noon
They saying, (oh my god, that's some funky shit)
(Oh my god, that's some funky shit)
(Oh my god, that's some funky shit)
Oh my god, that's some funky shit
Yeah, why stop now?
Put 'em in the trunk
Let 'em feel the sound
That they don't pop it
Let 'em feel the rhyme till he finds the locket
808 weighs a ton, so drop it
Watch your feet, while I rock the beat
Going all out, no private seat
I don't walk if I can ride the beat
But wouldn't you though? Don't lie to me
Of course you would, catapult syllables
Got up on my horse in the woods, whoa
Magical, sorcerer goods
Steal from the rich put more in the hood
Natural, born with a wood
Fuck 'em all, I'm right above 'em all
But you could butt talk, if a ? fall
Out with a motherfucker with a sluggish crawl
Chug till I can't chug at all
Not a frat boy, I'm a rap boy
In Hollywood, like Aykroyd
But I read my script with a southern drawl
I run home when mother calls
Cause mother's got a switch
Yeah, she's a wolf too
That makes me a son of a bitch
Sitting in the back with the bass on boom
Trunk gon' shake, and the wheels on zoom
American classic, trashy tunes
L.A. to Alabama, from noon to noon

30,Gangster,2013,Trunk Muzik Returns (2013),,Yelawolf,"(Verse 1: Yelawolf)
There must've been something about my careless upbringing
That got me into so much trouble at school and shit
Could've been the drugs at home, maybe I was just a foolish kid
I soaked up everything that I could from the people that stayed at my house
Biker gangs, waking up to people that I didn't know crashed out on my couch
Really didn't know at the time, that I didn't have a normal life
And when I took that attitude to a new neighborhood I had to learn to fight
And respect from the kids like me was immediately minority
I guess it must've been that ""I don't give a fuck about none of y'all"" shit that sorted me
Out from the rest of the haves, and the have-nots took me in as kin
Outcast, poor white trash, and that's where I learned to make my friends
But I've always been a weirdo to my homie 'cause I wanted to go be an entertainer
He was selling rock out his window
I was the rapper and my best friend was a...
(Hook: Yelawolf)
Gangster, gangster, gangster
Aye, what we gettin' into tonight?
Step into the ride, lookin' through the eyes of a motherfuckin'
Gangster, gangster
So, am I gonna risk my life, to ride?
You're motherfuckin' right
When your best friend is a gangster
(Verse 2: A$AP Rocky)
Danger, we pistol banging, another homicide
Rollin' in the Chevy, motherfucker, ride or die
Ridin' in the scraper low, it shake from side to side
If the paper low, his burner on his side, murder on his mind
Only 21 and still he strives to stay alive
Feelin' paranoia, too much pride to stay inside
Ain't no time to wait around, find the safest place to hide
Drop a chopper, lay you down, it's the fastest way to God
Grandmama tell him ""Son, you gotta pray to God""
Gamble with your life and then you gotta pay the price
Place your bet and roll the die, thank the Lord and pray to Christ
'Cause you almost spent your life livin' as a young motherfuckin'...
(Verse 3: Big Henry)
Ever look in the eyes of a G?
Cold, cold world that's what you gon' see
When the cash slow up, masks go on
Chevy slow up, that's what it's gon' be
Game so hot that a nigga might melt
OG stripes up under my belt
Do it by myself, I don't need no help
5-9 Hoover, nigga, hat to the left
Big Henry, bitch - nobody else
Ten toes down, march nigga, step!
If I pop that trunk I'm a pop me a chump
Leave a nigga slumped with his chin in his chest
Bang, bang, bang, nigga, real G shit
Half of these rappers ain't live like this
On behalf of the streets I live like this
Nobody really knows why it is like this
When it comes to a buck, I'm a mathematician
Go and hit the block like a car collision
Niggas talkin' money, you ain't starvin', is ya?
You start to lose weight like they pausing in ya
So go and idle down, my nigga, pardon a nigga
Fuck around and I'm a put a part in a nigga
Fuck around, I'm a pull apart the nigga
Applaud a nigga, straight from the block

Not a single solitary thing is missin' from my southern roots
I'm liable just to take a Chevrolet and run it through the mud for giggles
Huh, what? A son of a bitch my momma raised into a rapper
Who could tell story like my uncle when he's drinkin'
Product of a workin' environment, fuck is y'all thinkin'?
Meanin' I'm workin', workin' harder
Than any artist can ever do it simply 'cause I'm made that way
I build a house around your ass before you could realize
That you were in the neighborhood that Yelawolf made
So call me a redneck and tell your boys about it
Tell 'em I'm an Alabama wanna-be, I be that
I'll just take it to the studio and drop a bomb on you
From a motherfuckin' beanbag, I need that
Get away, tell my folks roll up the J's

On the road with Wolf, why did you come back?""
'Cause them up there don't wanna play fair
Got me pinned to the wall like a fucking thumb tack

Like you could give a shit if a nigga eat well
Or eat at all, wanna see me fall

Still piss on your porch and still shit in your house
Then put my dick in your mouth
Take it back out, put it back in
Fuck on the floor, skeet on the couch
Which one of you ugly motherfuckers
Think you thug enough or rugg enough
Or gutter enough, fast enough to keep up with me
The most retarded motherfucker in the whole wide world
Ain't stupid or dumb enough to fuck with me
If you in, say you in
And if you is handle your motherfuckin' business
Knuckle up, buckle up, hustle up, huddle up
What we gonna do? Win
Not a nan' 'nother nigga out of there can compare
To what I do to these boys on these bars and these scales
In these clubs in these bars on these tables and chairs

And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl
Like I could, girl, like my good girl
Here I go again, on my shit again
Walking through the mall, acting like a prick again
You had a halter-top, I had my Famous socks
You came to shop, I came to ho hop
You had your girl witcha, both looking great
I wanted both of y'all, how about a double take
She was hating, looking at me like a scumbag
But something made you want to turn around and come back
Probably 'cause I just don't give a fuck
I just want to see one of these hookas in my truck
So tell your girlfriend, tough luck
She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up
Well, I really ain't into that type of shit
I'm into tattoos and drinking 'til six
Fucking 'til nine, sleeping 'til twelve

How could someone like me so bad get such a good girl?

And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl
Like I could, girl, like my good girl

I'm as surprised as you are that you still let me in it
But you continue to text message me
Right after saying that we should both move separately
But you don't want to see me go
Even though I've only given you dick and cold cereal
So you must have a thing for lucky charms
Or the bad girl in you just fell into my lucky arms
You love to cuss me out and call me crazy
Say I'm no good and all of your friends hate me
Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me
And then it goes from fuck you, to fuck me, baby
You leave early so nobody sees you at the spot
Now you're stuck between a hard place and a rock
You call me a player but I have lied to you not

Called you in the morning and you just fucking laugh
You think it's cute, you love my crazy ass

I tell you that I'm bad but you never ask why
'Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy
You want to rock, let's rock and roll, just know
I'm only good at one thing and it's not control

37,Growin' Up in the Gutter,2011,Radioactive (2011),,Yelawolf,"Once upon a time in an apartment home
Lived a little girl with a heart of stone
'Cause part of her heart was partly gone
Rarely seen and hardly known
Treated like a mat on a boxing ring
Blood drop stains on the twin box springs
Daddy came to visit, it's not a dream
She thought to herself, what is happenin'?
Above her head is a crucifix
But Lucifer loosens up his wrist
Lays her down with an open fist
And all that was left was hopelessness
Little girl, where's your lovin' mother?
Under the covers, under the covers
Little girl what have you discovered
She stuttered
Growin' up in the gutter, no more, fairytales
And so no place like hell, no place like home
Growin' up in the gutter, black and white in a frame
There we are, safe and sound, stray guns, no aim, yea
Growin' up in the gutter
And you ain't gotta be from the Projects
To deal with this nonsense, Rittz
'Cause even in suburbia somebody will murder ya
Over nothin', leave your body slumpin'
In the parking lot of your complex
Violence is a hard pill to swallow and digest
My town is full of drug dealers
Most of them get shot in the process
Hustlin' and stackin' up profits
They robbin' motherfuckers like they havin' a contest
Shit, he took a bitch to his apartment to brag
A week later he tied up on the carpet and gagged
'Cause he showed her all the pills he had for sale
For the low
She told her cousin
Then her cousin grabbed a glock and a mask
Kicked in his door laid him down
Then he shot him and dashed
Ran off with all that he had
He used to be ballin' now he got a colostomy bag
What you know about that
Middle class white bitch slangin' her body for crack
Mexican drug cartels, you hear the buck shot shells
And then the blood clot fails, there ain't no healin' the wounds
Biggest meth bust on the east coast right here in Duluth
My lyrics are proof of growin' up in the gutter
You think you can define how hard you got it?
By what neighborhood you live in motherfucker
Wake up in the gutter
Growin' up in the gutter, no more, fairytales
And so no place like hell, no place like home
Growin' up in the gutter, black and white in a frame
There we are, safe and sound, stray guns, no aim, yea
Growin' up in the gutter
Slumerican indeed, I am
Drug through the mud like a weed, what I am
Was child who was beat, I am
Leather belts that made me, I am
Home alone again at 8, I am
Somebody's life to rate, I am
Given to the beast by fate, I am
The one who did escape, I am
A voice for the cold in the dark, I am
The one who sold his heart, I am
From a family torn apart, I am
A target for your dart, I am
Sick again from the whips, I am
Head to the gun and click, I am
A soul that don't run from shit, I am
Exposed to the g.o.a.t.s. of sin, I am
Met a ghost and he said, ""I am""
In the basement in red, I am
Dead cause the Ouija board said
I-a-m
Growin' up in the gutter, no more, fairytales
And so no place like hell, no place like home
Growin' up in the gutter, black and white in a frame
There we are, safe and sound, stray guns, no aim, yea
Growin' up in the gutter"
38,Hard White (Up in the Club),2011,Radioactive (2011),,Yelawolf,"(Verse 1 - Yelawolf)
You ain't gotta lay down on your bed
You know you already fucked up
Letting me in the muthafuckin' game is like
Letting me drunk drive in ya truck
When Yelawolf arrived in this club, already had 5 in my cup
Then I took another hit and I run into a bitch
That's looking lifeless and stuff
Baby, what's wrong with you now?
What, you ain't happy with red bottoms?
Mad 'cause I'm in VIP with a fuckin' Jack bottle?
With Tom, Dick and Harry
I got up in this bitch with a tank top 'cause I spit so very, darn quick and scary
That's why they're so quick to compare me
Fuck my critics with a spiked dick
When it can fit barely. They probably think I'm a Limp Bizkit
That spits jelly, when I put them in the woods I'm a redneck
I'm a hick? Tell me: go ahead, yeah!
What the fuck does it matter to me?
Cause after me there'll only be wannabes
And mostly ain't never gonnabes
Yeah in this forest I'm a lonely tree
My limbs are covered in tattoos -and my roots they run deep
I'm 2 bottle shawty, 2 bitches waiting
Two 10's: that's a ""win-win situation""..
Happy birthday, I'm feelin' brand-new
Drinks on me! For ME: not you
Up in the club, don't give a fuck
Up in the club, don't give a fuck
Up in the club, don't give a fuck
Up in the club, still don't give a fuck
(Verse 2 - Yelawolf)
I don't know what to say after that first verse
I mean like damn, I just killed it
What the fuck am I supposed to do with this cow?
I done already milked it
Smoke another cigarette unfiltered
Let go of anything that I'm feelin'
Broke me down so many times before
That I'm no longer rapping I'm building
With one brick, two brick, three brick, four
Underneath the steps of my single wide door
Raised by them dope boys, so I know how them thangs look
Thanks for the recipe: rest in peace, Wayne Bush
I don't cook my shit, I don't break it down for you muthafuckas
Out there waiting around for some rap savior
You better look up at what it is that you facing now
Cause Jesus drives a Harley, the Devil wears Prada
If God was one of us, he'd prolly drink vodka
I still kick it at the party when I get rich
Cause rich or broke, I'm still as dope
The realest ain't as real as this
Dead or alive, I'll put a stamp in this bitch
You'll never seen rock and roll do hip-hop like I did

39,Have A Great Flight,2015,Love Story (2015),,Yelawolf,"Where's my calling angel?
At the coffin
Where's my blue sky?
At the coffin
A pretty bouquet and a red rose
At the coffin
Darling, don't cry
At the coffin
Over my soul
I will take your favorite books, and put them in a row
I remember how you like them, I know where they go
Your mama will be waiting there, for you to hold
I know that she misses you, misses you so
So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose
You have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose
I will keep your memories, they always make me smile
But letting you go honestly, I'm having a tough time
I promise I'll be strong for you, like you said, and hold it in the road
But, I'll be down here missing you, missing you so
So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose
You have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose
And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I'm in the next room but is it gonna be long
Until I see you again"
40,Heartbreak,2015,Love Story (2015),,Yelawolf,"You used to be so cool, what the fuck happened to you?
Look at what all this rapping and money-stacking will do
I could've been stuck out in 'Bama, had I not flew the coop
And my babies would suffer Christmas cause Santa ain't got no loot
Uh, money ain't the issue, you say, that's funny now
Cause money's all I could give you to shut your motherfucking mouth
Here, take 20 grand and buy yourself a lawyer
Shit, here's a whip so my kids ain't gotta walk to the store for ya, fuck
Momma told me I should keep it real
My record ain't selling, momma, I'm trying hard enough to keep a deal
Meanwhile I'm throwing paper down into an empty pit
I got a business I'm trying to run, man, fuck this bitch
I should've seen it coming, she never pulled away
I'm carrying her like an elephant on a dinner plate
You gassed em, Yelawolf, you better pump your fucking brakes, asshole
You got the nerve to
Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out 'cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down
You got some nerve to be mad at me for, fuck, anything
What have I done besides give you what I could not afford?
The kids are happy 'cause they really don't know anything
If they only knew what toys that their momma could afford
The vacation they could be taking when daddy's on tour
Wait, you are on vacation, that's what this shit is for
I get it, I'm like the fountain of youth
You're in the bed with your boo and you two are sipping courvoisier, true?
This song ain't no diss, it's a living proof
Skit of skin and tooth, the witch in you bit, left me with cracked roofs
I ain't done, bitch, put this shit in loop
Here's a melody so it sticks in your head like your tracks do, ooh
You wanna walk around like it's all good
'Cause I'm the golden ticket to get out of the hood
You better hope somebody cares more than I do
Cause my will don't include you
Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out 'cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down
There ain't no fucking way I'mma let you take this hard-earned money, bitch
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out 'cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down
There'll always be a special place
For you in my bank account
You fucking bitch
Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out 'cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down
There ain't no fucking way I'mma let you take this hard-earned money, bitch
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown

41,Hustle,2013,Trunk Muzik Returns (2013),,Yelawolf,"(Verse 1: Paul Wall)
Rolling with the top down, on peanut butter guts
Trolling, I'm about to climb
Load the gun, turn the base up, turn it up
Holding that Glock nine in case a hater run up
Callin, I'm the shit now, so your bitch on my nuts
I got my car smoking, but it ain't the motor
It's just me and that dodo
These (?) strolling, I stop and poke 'em
But I'm trying to get that dojo
Ridin' dirty, ain't no hobo
It's just me strapped up like a GoPro
And I one deep; Han Solo
Hoes trying to capture me like a photo, hustle
All I need is two cups of drank
With the system crank and a fifth of (?)
See me pulling pranks in my candy paint
Pull broads around me in crowds
Both tires when I hit the breaks
My hustle skills you can't debate
Money don't wait, I'll be stacking up bank
Till I'm dead and up in them clouds
Getting to the cake, man, fuck your faith
Riding outta state with a Texas plate
Speakers in the back be like an eighth
415 rock up (?) skate
Crawl like a snake, boys gonna hate
But it's money to make, don't fall for the bait
Save the bullshit, I ain't gotta cape
All I got till I'm in the grave
Is a whole lot of hustle, hustle
(Hook: Yelawolf)
Pack it up and send it all away 9 to 5
I could do it all day, boy you know I gotta (hustle)
Broom and a mop, I clean 'em up from outer space
Gotta beam 'em up got an universal (hustle)
Had a premonition of me in the front seat of 2013
Boy, we gotta (hustle)
We gotta, we gotta (hustle)
You wanna go follow your dream then (hustle)
(Verse 2: Yelawolf)
Yeah, couldn't tell me not to believe
In the people that I was put in front of
And told that I had an opportunity to become a part of a situation
That put me in a position to maybe
Some day break out of a small town
I guess I fell for the okey doke
I suppose I couldn't turn around in the hokey poke game
To see lames and other folks
Who thought joke was being played on me
Oh, where the story goes again
Here we go again, I'll again frown while the motherfuckers grin
I can hear the sound of the gate closing in
And I can feel the breeze of the hate blowing in
'Cause they all wanna go sightseeing
Up in the Chevy and ride further in the wild
And they kinda wanna drive, even make a turn off a road
You ain't familiar with, enough to pay for the gas for a little bit then
Before you know it, you got a best friend
But when he started off he was just hitchhiking
Should have heard when he said wolf for real
If you're chill, you'll find another one just like him
But it's hard as a motherfucker to say no
When you're a rookie talking to a veteran playing pro
And everything that he's saying
He's saying to pay him close attention
So you put your hand low
Palms, out, opened, hoping
And you can even see that engine smoking
Plus all the money that he gave you owe him
Rearview mirrors all of them broken
Black boys, white boys, just a token
For the slot machine, and the gambling notion
Scamming and scoping, the animal inside
The cannibal chose him, me
I fell for another man's hustle

43,I See You,2011,Radioactive (2011),,Yelawolf,"Once upon a time not long ago my grandmother told me I'd change
I felt like she was coming down on me so I told her no I'd be the same
Not knowing she was only trying to help motivate me to excel and climb
I was thinking she was the one trapped while I was stuck in a cage of my mind
Man if I would've known what I know now
I would've brought my head down under the cloud
Told her thank you and that I loved her but I was too cool and too damn proud
What a fool I was in fact I've changed so much now looking back
I wish somebody I thought was cool was as cool as she was when she told me that
I see you the real you
Trying to cover up what's inside of you
But everything you do was make believe
Yeah you're hot but you're too cool
I see you
I see you
I see you
Baby girl don't know much about what it would take to become a star
Hollywood is so far-fetched too long of a drive in an old car
Work everyday but you barely eat going over lines from a script you read
Your boyfriend says it's a silly dream but how can you dream when you never sleep
You looking the mirror and you picturing a light show
A glimpse in the lens of a camera behind the scenes of life is a type role
Yeah you walk a thin line, but a thin line is all you need
A thin line and an indy movie, just to break for somebody to see the
Talent inside, the ballad of the diary you write
The by and by is just another day for a normal girl but for you it's another day that you try
Aside from the fact that you ride on the back of a bus sometimes cause your car won't work
But maybe you should take that bus to L.A. and put your dreams first because
I see you the real you
Trying to cover up what's inside of you
But everything you do was make believe
Yeah you're hot but you're too cool
I see you
I see you
I see you
Black and white, everything is black and white broke down simple and plain
Most of us lost with the curious brain
Curiosity is looked at as strange
Stuck in that lane but you can't complain
While you look at another passing train
Wondering how, where is it going
Wishing you were inside, packed and rolling
To another place but your time is chosen
To live low key cause your dream is stolen
They don't understand, they believe in loathing
Lounge and loafing, waiting hoping
Homie if the grass is greener; look, the gate is open
You waiting for God to release the ocean
Sitting on the beach, 2 feet from floating
I see you the real you
Trying to cover up what's inside of you
But everything you do was make believe
Yeah you're hot but you're too cool
I see you
I see you
I see you"

I wish a motherfucker would
Au contraire mon frere one pure pain giver
Don't ingest this, it might cause corrosion of the liver
Yeah toxic, dropkick opponents on arrival
This ain't hip hop, this is the manual to survival
Take notes fake folks, imitators and lovers
A true to life Jesus risen up from the gutter
I'm awesome, different from the rest of you rappers
And that's real shit, Pill spits exactly what happened
This is chemistry diminish thee ???
Please explain the vivid scenes of what occurred on streets
And I doubt if you know what it really means
Cultural differences divide us and our nemesis
When music is the food for living I think we all forgetting this
Born into poverty, hard torn obviously
That ain't going so we trying to figure out how to eat
Older brother hustling, momma working overtime
Now I'm standing in the kitchen whipping bank it's soda time
I wish a motherfucker would T
Ell me this ain't straight drop yams fresh out the pot
I wish a motherfucker would
Tell me this ain't a trout spot serving it to a block
I wish a motherfucker would
Tell me this ain't a yam shop, come and order your rocks
I wish a motherfucker would
Okay
I wish a motherfucker would"

Stereotypical beanpole, slim, tall, tatted, let me add
That I gotta green glow from all the Mountain Dew that I consume
From a mason jar, in a racing, chase it with a tall ice brew
Let me not leave you confused, what I represent culturally
Trash bag full of Freon, I'm huffin' puffin' on potpourri

About ten bodies on a fishing line with baby clothes on consignment
Came to the game so broke that I still find one-dollar bills and get a thrill
That's the kind of shit that leaves my pickle dill'd
Siding on the single wide got icicle steel, too cold
Gotta kerosene heater to heat up the grill, meatloaf?
Daddy's in jail again for shuffling pills, we know
Man, I've only come to give you a peep show

I run across the South like a wild stream, smiling
I've seen more colorful mushrooms than a child's dream

What a sight, put a vice grip lock on my right to fight despite
The way you may feel about sights and sounds that I might put down
About prices found on a sack of that white heaven is a place in a 7/11
I can never get away from hell, found hell in the bible-belt
And found love in a 6-pack up on the shelf
Went to the seashore to see more but Leroy didn't seem sure to me
So I took Leroy to Alabama, he bought the hat and bought the Tee
Converted him, y'all, I gave him convertible thoughts
When he saw that big buck hangin' on the wall

My cigarettes in the ash tray
The engines off and the radio's down
So nervous my whole body shakes
The parking lot's full of people and
They ready to see the preacher man
Time to open up for the main act
I guess that makes me a deacon
I promise that I won't let me down
And check myself in the mirror one time
Say my prayer and then I shook the ground
Light another smoke and step outside
Walk inside and take a look around
As I try to remember all of my lines
Guess it's time for me to face the crowd
And give the people my time
Johnny Cash
Johnny Cash
Johnny Cash
Johnny Cash
Johnny Cash
These people standing on front row
Tryna see through me like a window
I'm wearing my soul on my sleeve
But they look at me through a pin hole
All I see is this opportunity
To see at least one of you in me
But I can't seem to win 'em over so
I swallow the humility
Fifteen minutes to hold 'em down
And I'm just wishing that it would fly by
It's like my whole world hits the ground
All I wanted to do is have a good time
Hold me under but I will not drown
All I really know how to do is survive
Next time that I come to your town
I'll be the fuckin' headline

I'm not supposed to be this person, I suppose
I'm not supposed to be this rapper poking holes at stereotypes
Or to write this juxtaposing flow to beats it chose
I hope the microphone and out me goes this songs and quotables
Call me nasty, say I stink, well hit the sink and hold your nose
'Cause I'm about as convinceable as a bum in stolen clothes till they go at those
I got dreams like fish got gills
I can't survive in this lake water without a deal
But I can build Noah's Ark without a power drill
Look at this crowd like it's a battlefield
Tell 'em my travels, my triumphs, my failures, my family loud and clear
Let 'em off, judge, I don't care how they feel
Fuck it what do I care? I'm my personal shrink
Throw my heart down on the ground, stomp it, use the blood for the ink
I'm used to purple and pink bruises so thanks for the tools
That's just a brick from the mansion
Another stitch in the pants of a Johnny Cash

51,Keeps Me Alive,2017,Trial by Fire (2017),,Yelawolf,"Way back in Alabama where the dirt roads cut through the woods
And when it rains you can smell the steam off the grass
Even dew on the hood of my paw paw's 1985 Chevrolet Silverado
I must have been about six
Life was so easy back in the sticks
16 year old mother fought for the life she wanted for her son
Lookin' for love in the world of rock and roll is where it begun
It was Alabama, Ted Nugent
Alice Cooper, Randy Travis
Aerosmith kept my stepdaddy on the road
And life, it was madness
Cocaine and alcohol filled up the house party to be frank
It wasn't long before I tried it myself and then started to drink
School became boring and doing my homework became rollin' joints
Now I'm sixteen like my mama was when she had a little boy
Can't imagine that now as I look back 'cause I got three kids of my own
And I respect what she went through to pay for food and clothes
And a home
'Cause it ain't what she did, it's what she didn't do for me
That brought me to this moment
And made me who I am on this recording
And this is my story
This is my story
This is my glory
This is what keeps me alive
This is me flying
This is me trying
This is what keeps me alive
20 years old in the streets and I'm rollin' with gangsters now
Hip-hop is takin' over me, my language, my clothes, my lifestyle
Antioch, Tennessee put me through the school of hard knocks
And I carry that attitude with me to this day, more or not
And I'm young and hot-headed
Always running from police and skateboardin'
Graffiti, loiterin', I sorta got my peace from the chaos
Was no ""mother-may-I's,"" surrounded by have-nots
And maybe some day I's well
I was against the grain, even when I was growin' wheat
Got back into rock and roll, and then got into poetry
Started expressin' everything I could through the medium of pen and pad
Playin' instrumentals off a tape and then over-dubbin' what I had
It was everything, because I had nothin'
And man that was alright, 'cause now I had somethin'
Little did I know that would be the hardest thing to do God ever put before me
So I took a look at what I've been through
And I made it my glory, and this is...
This is my story
This is my glory
This is what keeps me alive
This is me flying
This is me trying
This is what keeps me alive
It's a 2 AM bus 'craw; from me at the parkin' lot of Wal-Mart
Leavin' Nashville, Tennessee for a nationwide tour
My bags are all packed and I'm loadin' my truck to go meet the crew
And I'm excited to get on the road, already one foot out the door
Turn around and it's my daughter, she's cryin'
'Cause daddy is leavin'
Knows that I'll be gone for months and it hurts and I hate to see it
Kneel down and tell her, ""Look, baby, I promise I'll call you everyday
And daddy will send you a present from everywhere that we go play""
But that's not enough, and it's breakin' my heart in two
Just knowin' I can't stay, not even to see it through
And that I can't tuck her in, to say goodbye with a grin
Now she's bein' left behind, this is me all over again, man
I picked her up in my arms and held her tight
And said, ""Hey you know what? Daddy used to be just like you
When I would walk up to the bus
And I'd do anything in the world for you, so chase your dreams
One day you'll use everything you've been through to be anything, baby girl
This is my story
This is my story
This is my glory
This is what keeps me alive
This is me flying
This is me trying
This is what keeps me alive"

Muthafuckers
Go to sleep little boy don't cry
Like shadows on the wall
Don't look under your bed
Hear footsteps in the hall
Somebody's gonna come get me
And take me to the woods in the fall
Don't look under your bed
Crucifix on the wall
Could it be in my mind
My time has gone by
Slayed in the field, left here to die
What if momma finds me like this
Wonder this dirts still alive
I don't know how to resist
All of these thoughts that are running through my little mind
Trouble I'm sure, scared for my life
Still I want war
In a world that could feel like a fucking cage
I just sit in silence
Instead of tryna to escape I became crazy and started smiling
Took a knife to the back when I turned around I helped somebody close
But I bled just enough to live, half man, half ghost
And the dream is dark, fuck it, into the dark I go
You want me to be a monster and kill em?
You want me to be the one with the blade?
You want me to stand up and scream!
You begged for me to go into a rage
Well, hand me the machete then right now
I'll walk into the house and lay 'em down
Bring you the head of every victim man, woman, child
I will not deceive you
God said I'll never leave you
And since I can't see you
Then I'll have to believe you
Yeah I got a dream and I've seen many many nightmares unfold
But fear has no hold, on this dream that I control
I control
I control
I control
Goodbye nightmare
Bye bye nightmare
Goodbye nightmare
Kill my nightmare"

Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall, country folks all around

With a fold out chair, a thirty pack on the back of that tailgate

Split you in my overalls

I'm just a boy with a dream
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks
Used to keep a twenty two in a shoebox
Now I bang Beretta
She's 22 and I keep her in a tube top
White trash and all, take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off
Like how the fuck did I get a catalog with more hits than a fucking jackhammer dog
'Cause I planned it all, Crimson tide standing tall
Shit, I'm another lit cannon ball
Fuck around and I'm going off and I'm getting throwed off
Yeah, I'm throwed off

55,London Bridge,2012,The Slumdon Bridge (2012),,Yelawolf,"There wasn't much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last check
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette
Feeling half dead, whiskey on my mind
Then came the dead
Sheriff in the yard, here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye
Baby in her arms
She took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave
Nonchalant about it
Maybe she'll come back
This time I doubt it
Act like I care, but I really don't
Wanted to change
But somehow I knew I really won't
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand
God's not going to land another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock and be late again
One gun and a Harley in the driveway
One way out, dirt road, pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk, half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention
In fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away
And he started singing
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again
I didn't see it coming
I didn't see the wall
And I went from running, to a slow crawl
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie
I speak no evil, but hear no angels
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door
Knock knock
I'm on the salt road non stop
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot
And the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap
I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven, Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge
But I can't forget the sound
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
And we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down

Running from the law but I can't be found

Both of us was in the same class
In 02 in Antioch Nash-Ville
I wanted you so bad
That I forgot to mind my manners
Everybody wanted them panties
Every guy was hopin to land it
We would flirt around and touch hands
Until we fucked around and took Xanax
And that's when you began to drive me bananas
I was in denial its apparent
You began to lie to your parents
You should know that I can't live without you holdin' my name
Now my hearts in control of my brain
And I can't hold it in the lanes
Rollin' down 20 main
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin' 120 main
Maybe I'm givin' up, Baby I'm givin' up
Baby what is happenin'?
Don't you believe in us, Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough...
Used to fuck so much we missed school
You was there when I needed you
I was there when you needed me
We were Inseparable
When I was broke with no fuckin' food
You was tough enough to be cool
Skate holes all in my shoes
Dope boys had me confused
I was in love with hip hop
You was in love with that too
What made it come to a stop
Had to have been the money issue
Bitch! And I really miss the rain
I gave you all of my soul and all I got left is a key chain
Who the fuck are you fuckin' now?
Bet hes always taken you out
College educated and proud
Me, Well I'm just a drop out
Can't really blame you for buggin
Ain't I the dirt on your rug and
Just a place to wipe your shoes and
Give me all your throw away lovin'
Back to my buzzin and druggin
Back to my gutter with nothin'
Back to the rut all the sudden
Cracks in the covenant trustin me
You ain't gotta worry bout sharin this success with Wayne

Both of us was in the same class
In 02 in Antioch Nash-Ville
I wanted you so bad
That I forgot to mind my manners
Everybody wanted them panties
Every guy was hopin to land it
We would flirt around and touch hands
Until we fucked around and took Xanax
And that's when you began to drive me bananas
I was in denial its apparent
You began to lie to your parents
You should know that I can't live without you holdin' my name
Now my hearts in control of my brain
And I can't hold it in the lanes
Rollin' down 20 main
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin' 120 main
Maybe I'm givin' up, Baby I'm givin' up
Baby what is happenin'?
Don't you believe in us, Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough...
Used to fuck so much we missed school
You was there when I needed you
I was there when you needed me
We were Inseparable
When I was broke with no fuckin' food
You was tough enough to be cool
Skate holes all in my shoes
Dope boys had me confused
I was in love with hip hop
You was in love with that too
What made it come to a stop
Had to have been the money issue
Bitch! And I really miss the rain
I gave you all of my soul and all I got left is a key chain
Who the fuck are you fuckin' now?
Bet hes always taken you out
College educated and proud
Me, Well I'm just a drop out
Can't really blame you for buggin
Ain't I the dirt on your rug and
Just a place to wipe your shoes and
Give me all your throw away lovin'
Back to my buzzin and druggin
Back to my gutter with nothin'
Back to the rut all the sudden
Cracks in the covenant trustin me
You ain't gotta worry bout sharin this success with Wayne
And that was just petty change
But I still feel the pain"
58,Love Story,2015,Love Story (2015),,Yelawolf,"(Pre-Hook)
When this well runs dry
I guess you'll find another well
When I say goodbye
There'll be another breeze to sail
When my boat goes down
I guess you'll learn how to swim
If I don't come home
Just know you've been a good friend
Don't forget me
I love you so
Don't forget me
I've never let you go
Don't forget me
Love is the story I wrote
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
If God is my angel, the fucking devil's the pistol
Better put your face behind safety glass when I load up this missile
Whistling past this infinite path, I limp when I drag
My footprints like a giant, look at this mountain
Bounce on my boots and then climb it
Mount up my troupes and defiantly
Go against what they trying, teach 'em to shoot when I'm rhyming
Be living proof of my word, meaning I'm Bible designing
Jesus I'm rival, decapitating put the bait on my line and
Throw the hook to the open water, fish till I catch that motherfucker
Looking for Megalodon, Goliath, Leviathan, I have been dying to find him and tie him to my boat and chop him up and dine with him on a plate with a steak and a coke
Rely on patience and hope, speak to a nation, it shows
Reach through these speakers and grab you, turn the bass up and then choke
And I earned my place on this road, ain't nobody moving me, no way
No, how, OK, go, pow
When I was born they said ""exorcise"" and the hospital set on fire
The preacher got goosebumps when he saw me and said ""Messiah""
Here from the heavens, I have arose from the ashes of hell
Brought here to be poor white trash and excel
Stuck in the woods of 'Bama, wood like [?] on the shelf
A scientist under development with nines and twelves and threes
And things like pyramids and fuck it you'll see
How I made a pot of gold from a bucket of beans
How I made it back to dry land, stuck in the sea
From crippled ships to triple dip Z's 71's
Yeah it's already begun and I ain't even had a hit but I'm fuckin' ready for one
I got my weight up like I'm carrying fat people
I planned it, I landed
Touch down, that Seagull
But above all the guts glory it's more than just blood for me
My heart is half open for the ones that never gave a fuck for me
My love story
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)

Home of the tough, survivors
We some gun toting, church going, 18-wheel rolling
Bag slanging, flag waving, at the dinner table praying
Old school yard fighting, beer drinking, hell raising
Hard working, blue collar, earn it all due paying
Illegal weed smoking, dope cooking, dirt dealers
On the corner Bible preachers, Hollywood dream seekers
Muddy water swimming in rock an' roll all the time
Straight from the assembly line and that's how it's made
That's how it's made in the U.S.A., the U.S.A.
A manufactured dream, a fraction of a thing
We got it made, in the U.S.A., the U.S.A.
Isn't it great? How we got it made
We some 9 to 5 back breaking, food Stamp line waiting
Convict time giving, underage time taking
Neighborhood gang banging, subway graffiti painting
Big cars, street stars, young dirty money making
Old money home taking, clothes in the yard throwing
Late on the rent paying, foul mouth word saying
One-way street paving
Road to success but you gotta do some concrete laying
That's how it's made
That's how it's made in the U.S.A., the U.S.A.
A manufactured dream, a fraction of a thing
We got it made, in the U.S.A., the U.S.A.
Isn't it great? How we got it made
She's been eating lies we fed her
Shoulda been full but nothing's helping
Knew she wanted something better
Still she took the second helping
Now she's well known, broke and cold
Fendi jackets, full of holes, no one knows
Single mother child raising from the stripper poll swinging
Daughter in the red light, coals for the cold season
She don't speak, no reason, why? 'Cause no one will ever know
That's what? That's how it's made
That's how it's made, in the U.S.A. the U.S.A.
It's every mother's dream to see her daughter on her knees

Rollin' through town with a boatload
I'm feelin' like a trailer park mogul
Sweat can't roll down the windows
'Cause the doors jammed up with the elbows
I think I see cops, I can't tell though
If I ride too close, they'll smell dope

Pen and paper, this one's for the books
Pack it, wrap it, seal it, send it
To the corner in a Travis Caddy
Everybody in this motherfucker jumpin', footprints on the wall
Gimme the losers, the ones who don't fit in
And with this shit we're gonna have a ball
Swing around the mosh pit, do-si-do
Catfish Billy and a Dobro

I'm a chili pepper in an Oldsmobile
Comin' out for the kill

I don't deal with these whose whose in this mass appeal

Then get drunk and run amuck
With every single one of my misfits

With them lowriders on the west side
Lift kits from the south
Jump in the passenger seat of my '69 and hit the bootleg house

A public nuisance

Got a lock in the pocket, a rock in the sock
With a cop I'm a nervous wreck
I never could keep a job 'cause I rob and I take
And I leave you with nothing left
But mama tried
Mama tried to harvest early and the pot died
If she ever said I was a good boy, trust me, mama lied
Leave these haters with a cane to walk
Take these lames with a grain of salt
All I wanna do is take aim, assault, tell my story
Paint the wall from Alabama to Atlanta
From Atlanta I began to build a plan, a panoramic view
To center who my friends, the men around me was
The culture is that slum, and I'm not alone
I put a flag in Nashville, and I'm feelin' right at home

Turn on the station and I'm still facin' you and

Come on inside if you're sick of the rain
Turn the radio off and don't complain
It's all a replay, it's all the same
Got one track on a runaway train
On a one way street better pick your lane
Yeah but you can let me pick your brain
And we could be that rolling stone
Mix 'em up with Janice Joplin
And let 'em harmonize like Bone
Or we can just leave it alone
And let it take a life on its own
Or we could be that world class wreckin' crew
And tell 'em turn the lights back on, come on

Three nuclear bombs have been launched from North Korea and will hit
Orlando, Florida, Las Vegas, Nevada, and New York City, New York
This will expire at five o'clock A.M. Eastern Standard Time
Please get to an underground shelter or a fallout shelter at this time
Once again, three nuclear bombs have been launched by North Korea
And will hit Orlando, Florida, Las Vegas, Nevada, and New York city, new york
This warning will expire at five o'clock am eastern standard time
I am
I am the American Eagle, eyes of a sparrow
Right hand branch, left hand arrow
Chasing a dollar, in an Impala
White trash heart throb, mellow yellow
Drinking hard liquor, brauds get on my level
I'm hotter than the bottom side of a whistlin' kettle
They threw a mountain at me, I got hit with a pebble
Sent me to hell, and I shit on the Devil
Try to bury my Chevy box but I won't buckle
And that's a deep hole bitch, bring your own shovel
Long gone, I'm grown up, and I'm gone cut you
With a chrome blade, if you want a play then holmes fuck you
Fuck you till you can't take a shit
Yeah I'm a fucking a tsunami, better anchor the ship
Aim for the ankles and wrist, I came for the dangerous shit
I claimed to be named for the hits, the game is a chain that I grip
Slang from the pain of a trip it took to see Wayne in the whip
I became what I came to get the chains for the chain I give
A quarter for your thought, appreciate the contribution
Slumerican, I'd appreciate the Constitution
Alleviate the crew when, I leave a page in ruins
To each is own, I guess I own each and every room in
The house I built is full of hopes, no ifs
So I stand with a giant like a king, no stilts
If I'm Generation X, I'm sellin' Ex, no pills
Dopeman chopping up lines you don't sniff
Read 'em, I'm bringin' back booklets and hookless, lyrics
So you can be certain just in case you didn't hear it
But what he says, come again? What is that?
Come to Earth, touchdown, I might be your running back
Because you hot then run it back, stay cool enough to wear
Toboggans as a summer hat
Steady on the throne I rap, hope there's no one under that
Rock that I roll, mosh pit flow
Girls on your shoulders get topless at the show
Fuck your mop and glow, can't mop a dirt road
It only makes mud, raised around a deer
I know how to chase bucks
Babysitter, sixteen, taught me how to make fuck
At seven, I've been raising hell
So I can make it to Heaven
Pick up a two-Liter but I only need the plastic
I know how to make bombs with aluminum and acid
Butterfly effect over hurricane's magic
Tornado pathin', rear view mirror of my eighty seven classic
I'm talking about Gadsden
Look mama no hands, I'm radioactive"
69,Rhyme Room,2013,Trunk Muzik Returns (2013),,Yelawolf,"Yo, I had this dude come up to me on the street, talkin' bou,
""Can I get down? How can I get down? Put me down, put me on, put me on""
Man, I felt like tellin' that mother fucker,
""You can never get down, you'll NEVER be down, this is some shit you'll NEVER understand""
I'm not the one
That you'll be shootin for
I'm not the one
Who's coming back for more
You and I
Been through this too many times
You and I
See never clear, come to mind
Going round and round
'Cause you can't get on your feet
Going round and round
Still takin' up all the heat
Going round and round
Never lookin' down
Cigarette lit in a golden grill
Envelope blocked in a golden seal
Wait a minute buddy let me hold a beer
Then get behind a rollin' wheel
Put 'em in the 5 'cause they sold me hell
Now they can't get me back 'cause they broke a deal
Told me green and sold me teal
And I'm outta place 'cause I'm outer space with mind
Yeah I'm outta my crazy mind
Clean up the woods and make 'em taste the pine-
Saw, snap like dry pine-straw
Hold my nuts on ur bitch and make her play combed fine ball
Magnificient, dirty
Smack critics with a backpack of physics
Hip hop knee deep in a swamp
By make leaped? frogs ""ribbit""
They talk alot but they don't 'rip-it'
Oh, that's that new shit, I get it
Well let me talk about shit I don't do
Let me reverse the vision
I got 10 mil-lion in the bank and I'm always in V-I-P
I got a bottle of - ""Dom""
A bottle of ""Don""
And a bottle of ""Henn-esy""
Fuckin' liars got the audacity to say they want me pound for pound, but first you need a pound
Bitch, you keep on going...
Hold on to my bumper, and bare-foot skid across the road
Till you can't walk without gullet? pillows up under ur toes
A country trap pass to you is like a freak show
But, I've seen scales up close like an iguana through a peephole
Fuck wit it ya midget
U comin' up very short
But, fuckin' wit cha head is just a vocabulary sport, see
My sword swings in the form of the lord's beat
I record this war scene to the ba? the dirt like a boar's feet, I
Chop and I drop on the beat with a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
If you wanna run, motherfuckin run
If you wanna come then you better not hesitant, 'cause
""I'm not the one"" - N'ah
See me in a magazine
You haters dream, creams peg a magazine and
That you'll be shootin for
'Cause I'm that crutch you suckas lean on
Ya think I'm goin' to budge
Ya fucked, just dream on, yah"
70,Ride or Die,2017,Trial by Fire (2017),,Yelawolf,"We was thick as thieves growing up
Both of us raising hell
Chasing liquor with liquor
Racing and chasing tail
You got caught with a nickel bag and then went to jail
You sat it out for a week because your mama didn't have bail
I rode my bike to your house as soon as you got out
Remember laughing at the cops and then I took you straight to the spot
I moved away for some years to Atlanta, Georgia but stayed the same
My troublesome attitude got me locked in an ugly chain
We kept in touch every week and I noticed the change
You wanted to clean up and go to school some day do the family thing
And I was too wild to get it, admittedly so
But I supported your move no matter which way that you rolled
I guess you made a good choice, graduated with honors
Got a good job at the factory making that legal dollar
And as for me I got worse
I found myself in a curse
Dropped out of school for a dream
A dream I didn't rehearse
You hit me up 'cause you knew when you saw me I was bad off
But I was too proud to ask for the help 'cause I knew the cost
But you offered a place to stay
Until I could find my way
You helped me go find a gig
Clean up and get it straight
Never once did you tell me to stop rapping and give it up
As we sat talking on the bed of your lifted truck
You had it all and I had nothing
I'm just saying that meant something brother
If you ever need me around I'll be on the next train headed southbound
I'll never let you down, I can't let you down
Because when I couldn't get my feet on the ground
You'd do anything to help me out
You never let me down
What goes around comes around
I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
It's been a while since I seen my friends, family and such
Six months a year on the road, I never get to visit that much
Even though it took me ten years to break a crack in this rock
Now that I started this movement, I got no plans to stop
Now you may see me in publications and radio placements
A new truck, a new Harley, and think I forgot how I made it
But ain't a day that goes by that I don't recall the struggle
Scared to death to go back to it, I constantly hustle
I thank you for my ambition
For the strength to condition
Anyone who helped me along the way and believed in my vision
It takes a village to raise a child
For me it took small towns
Everything that I learned from it
The ups and the downs
My Uncle Buddy, he gave me a thousand dollars to make a tape
Back in '02, when I could barely afford a plate
And he couldn't afford it either, but he did it anyhow
And now he wears a thousand dollar smile, Uncle Bud
If you ever need me around I'll be on the next train headed southbound
I'll never let you down, I can't let you down
Because when I couldn't get my feet on the ground
You'd do anything to help me out
You never let me down
What goes around comes around

71,Row Your Boat,2017,Trial by Fire (2017),,Yelawolf,"You said you don't wanna die but still you want to go to heaven
Heaven's not a place that you can scare me into changing everything that I believe in
Leavin' what is keeping you from walkin' out the door and livin' life like there's a reason
Reason is the fear of change will leave a person locked inside a dark and mental prison
Prisoners of war, the war is media, they feed to you graffiti up your vision
Visionary super scary future they will shoot ya' they will loot ya' they are killin'
Killin' power of the power that exists above us is a problem - it's a sentence
Sentence you to pull and push and jump, when they say jump you say how high
There is no limit
Limit what they sell and what they're givin'
Even if the whole world knows
I don't give a damn about what they think
I don't have to stand up to your gun
I don't have to sit down when you say
Tell me I'm overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there's any room left on that ship
You don't have to save any room for me
'Cause I've got my own boat (even when it rains)
I'm doing my own thing (even when it rains)
And I will stay afloat - even when it rains
'Cause I've got my own boat
Row, row your boat
Row, row your boat
Row your boat
They marchin' up the street they wanna fight they don't want peace
Peace of what you have they snatch and grab
They steal and run
They pullin' guns out on police
Police they shoot and kill - they shoot at will
They will at you - they'll execute if you don't leave
Leavin' the impression no one's safe inside this dungeon in the city of the beast
Beasts are on the corner, slingin' poison to the junkies - to a junkie it's a feast
Feast or famine, come examine, take a look into that alleyway that's on your street
Streets are not the only place that you can find yourself laying up under white sheets
Sheets in Alabama cockin' hammers, ridin' horses, wanna handle who is free
Free yourself from anything they preach
Even if the whole world knows
I don't give a damn about what they think
I don't have to stand up to your gun
I don't have to sit down when you say
Tell me I'm overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there's any room left on that ship

72,Sabrina,2017,Trial by Fire (2017),,Yelawolf,"I woke up from a deep sleep
I must have had a nightmare
But I really cannot remember
My heart was beating out of my chest
And I was cold, I must of let the window crack
Funny, 5th of September and the winter's coming back
The house is unusually quiet
And I'm wondering where Sabrina's at
By this time at eight o'clock
She would have been pullin' on my blanket
Saying daddy ""I want some cereal""
Wondering where her mommy's at
My door is wide open I can hear the breeze hit the curtains
Wind chime hangin' on the front porch singing
Sabrina must be asleep
I pull back the sheets
Get up and walk to her room in the hall
Not a peep not a sound not at all
The anxiety of a father is settin' in
As I turn the corner to her room
Her Mickey Mouse blanket's on the floor
She isn't in the bed
I take a deep breath, put my hand on my head
Relax
It's a game of hide and seek
She's in the closet I know it
I open the door
Gotcha!
She isn't there
The faint sound of the television from downstairs is playing some cartoons she's on the couch of course
How did I oversleep?
Baby girl why didn't you come wake up daddy?
Not a response
Fear turned to frustration
Sabrina, answer me
'Brina, this isn't funny
I ran to the couch, she's not there
I'm startin' to panic and I'm lookin' up everywhere
Guest rooms, bath rooms, cabinets
Under the tables, the attic
Wait a minute oh god no
I know she wouldn't go outside
We live so far back in the woods
She wouldn't dare
It's too scary for a little girl just to go bye-bye
I'm trying to escape my mind's eye
But my imagination is runnin' wild
At this point I'm talkin' to god
""Please lord, please I'm scared help me find my child""
I run to the basement (Sabrina!)
Sweat beads on my hands
Pacin', thinkin', pacin', thinkin'
Turn my face in
The screen door to the backyard's ajar
I run to the swingset
Swingset? No
Sandbox? No
God dammit Sabrina where'd you go?
There's a trail to a pond that I take her to everyday
Maybe she's down there
I run down the trail it's about 100 yards
We usually hang out on the pier
And as I get close in
Everything moves slow motion
Her little white shirt on the surface of the water
She was there, lifeless floating (Oh my god)
The pain I can't explain I couldn't see anything
I ran to the water
God is this really my daughter?
I picked her up, she was heavy
I held her tight in my arms
I took her out of the pond
I laid her down on the grass
I couldn't breath I gasped
Givin' her CPR, she wasn't respondin' to it
My phone in my pocket
My hands are shakin'
My vision's blurry
9-1-1, send an ambulance in a hurry
But it was too late
No tellin' how long she wasn't breathing
Her skin was the color purple
Her lips were ice cold
She must have fell of the pier reachin' for her teddy bear
She tried to get out she got wood under her nails
God what did you do to us?
What have we done? I say my prayers at night
Haven't I been a good son?
What did you to do my baby?
She's mine now give her back
You don't deserve her if you let her die like that!"
73,Shadows,2017,Trial by Fire (2017),,Yelawolf,"Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become
There's a dark moon in the clouds
Misty fog in the swamp
Crickets chirpin' outside my window
The water it thumps in the bathroom sink down the hall
The lights flicker sometimes
The wind is howling, the dogs are growling way deep in the pines
A passin' car on the distant road, the only thing running
Nightmares in my sleep, the Sandman is coming
I see the ghost in the red cloak, the shadows are taking shape
The sound of a faint voice, lost and full of hate
Dry leaves crumble under the feet of the reaper
The limbs tap on my window, like the nails of a creature
Tales of goblins and fairies, a sacrifice on the prairie
A murderer that escaped, I'm disillusioned and weary
Lightning strikes on the hill, illuminating the cabin
The old man on the porch, evil and quietly laughing
Surrounded by demons
I'm an angel and they all want me
And to this day ...
Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become
Cigarette buds, and oil stains on the dying grass
The smell of the liquor, rising up from the broken glass
The crowds of black leather, the heat from the engines
Motorcycles and goons, bearded men and loud women
The cracklin' paint, the old shack with the swingin' light
The heroin needles passin', open in plain sight
Ozzy and Black Sabbath, the vinyl is skippin'
From the fight in the kitchen
Blood screamin' and kickin'
Smoke fills up the sky, gasoline on the trash heap
The mattress is burnin', I hear it poppin' and snapping
The rain soaked teddy bear, so heavy I can't lift it
The flask for the moonshine, I watch as they all sip it
The Halloween pumpkin candle, lit with a Pentagram
The Grandfather clock, with a broken minute hand
Surrounded by thieves, killers, thugs and some junkies
And to this day ...
Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become
I throw on my leather jacket, a collection of biker patches
One of them says savage, the other one Black Sabbath
Heavily tatted, barely any skin left
Whiskey bent after twelve, I'm always playing with death
Bullet shells in my yard, loaded gun on the shelf
Run the roads like a wolf, through the whole Bible Belt
Rattlesnake skin boots, toes up on the chopper
Fifty Harleys behind me, they all ready to slaughter
Drunk in front of my sons, drunk in front of my daughter
Spit, cuss, and I yell, it's like a one-sided quarter
'Cause I'm only heads up, no matter which way you flip it
No brake lights in my life, I'm either rich or evicted
Committed to my convictions, committed crimes with the quitters
Connected to my religion, the religion of sinners
Send a prayer to God, exhaling smoke off the meth pipe
Like puddles reflecting the ripples echo to next life
So here I am standing just like the ashes that fell from the fire
A seed that fell off that poisonous and forgotten flower
Became my own nightmare, but now I think it's charming
Especially when ...
Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become
Bloody bone gon' get you
Bloody bone gon' get you
Bloody bone gon' get you"

Ain't seen a gangsta ain't seen a brick
And then they wonder why when the OG's come around
Yelawolf get the respect I get
'Cause I never walked into another man's house
And tell 'em what I think about the way he lives
I done a little dirt of my own and I won't throw stones
So I get back what I give
Reach for the two homeboy go ahead
You wanna be dead, homie be dead
Who am I to be thinking that I won't pop a trunk
If you feeling like a punk from the he said she said
Life's not a choice, it's a win or lose
So what's it gonna be, him or you
Daddy lie on ya bed, is she lying to your head
Well it depends on the truth, huh
See I'm realistic and everyday can't be terrific
I just seen one of my boys get ticked off
And put one of his hands his?
Lifted up in the air and somebody carry him
Into the club I know they wanted to bury him
Haha
My crew is laughing, I was scared as f-ck and they thought it was hilarious
Damn really, that's how y'all do it
Shit
The shit I've seen has changed me
What used to be strange to me,
Just ain't strange to me no more
Yeah, I done seen this sh-t before
Its just another day, outside my door
Outside my door
The shit I've seen the shit I've seen has changed me

Just ain't strange to me no more
Yelawolf and Trae The Truth bitch hit the floor
Its just another day, outside my door
(Trae The Truth)
I let you take a second to introduce you to pain
Where everybody going through it and going insane
The inner struggle but they focused on making they change
Anybody get it away and they making it rain
If it go to me and then I probably do the same
If I ever could I'll forever be repping the same game
Rapping off thinking I promise I'll get the same thing
In the back of the Maybach somebody?
Getting brain like I was only here to learn something
When I'm done here trying to earn something?
One thing 'bout me I guarantee I'll probably return something
Raise some drama then show up and try to burn something
I'll do my dirt and when I ? never pay it back
I'm dealing with it and never take it
The candys back the city never?
? Take a nap
Wanna hit the block ? dreaming to get away
?
Yelawolf go get the whip I go this
Open the gate no way they could stop this
When I'm with us they can tell us about this
So pretty you can tell 'em it's not this
(Yelawolf)
? I believe it's too hard
Don't reach for the dogs who believe the facades
Don't reach too far to compete with the dog
Because deep in the heart they wanna ? this all
I wish I could be the one to say I warned ya
Don't pay any attention
Man I wanna ignore the haters
But I can't afford to leave them alone
They say yelawolf ain't never been in the dark
And trailerparks and made their mark
I gotta make it hot 'cause I was given a pardon
I gotta play the role
Serial killing rap, 'cause I had a serial code
In every city with a serial?
When I rap, peer in my soul
I'm in the light like a deer in the road
Clear in control, my spirit is old
I'm hearing the Gold I'm hearing the foes, hoes
And falls like a rock don't mean you hard like one
You want the credit for getting gutter forget it
You muthaf-ckers forgot the credit card and run
Street credit won't put bullets in ya gun
But it might put a stray bullet in your son
Daughters, uncles, aunts, friends and nusiance
Become tangled up when it comes undone"

Okay you got criminals everywhere, right?
Criminals smugglin' dope across borders to feed America's high appetite
Kis, pounds, ounces, grams, whatever the weight of substance is gettin' towed
Cause drugs got a price
Home hydroponics, LSD chemist
Spoon cookin' heroine, junkies fill up methadone clinics
Get caught for crack and catch a long sentence
You ask me how I feel about that, maybe you got the wrong witness
I heard Jay Z's cool with Obama
Obama must be cool with me then I guess if I'm packin' up this Honda
I highly doubt it but fuck it, it's worth a shout out
At least that's what I tell the judge before I gracefully bowed out
Meanwhile I'm gettin' taken to the county for receive

You might as well be a rapper cause you signed and get booked
All the same to a suit

If you ain't a Justin Leave It to Beaver with that look
Then just drop the egg in the skillet, let it cook
Who y'all bein' took
No I'm not a crook, son but this one ain't shook

My grandparents retired from 9 to 5s
Then paid for my hospital bills when mama was doin' lines
I wasn't raised up like the model American
But I love what it made me, life is all about where and whens
Whos and how's that ultimately create my heritage
My great grandaddy Otis would sit down in his chair and then
Smoke a cigarette while he sipped on Muscatine moonshine
Homemade, and reminisce about the old days
He died of cancer when I was 5
I wasn't allowed to go see him in his casket 'cause I would've cried
I got so much value off life in such a short time
Memories stick to my heart and today they still apply
They used to share crops when they were poor
He worked his ass off at the mill and then he opened up a store
Both of my granddaddies fought a war
So I can say what I'm sayin' in this record for you and yours
For you and yours, true

Along with Jon Newport's beer bottle caps and the Roaches of Will Power's blunts
So what'a ya say?
People is why shit is so wrong
Why they won't let all our soldiers come home
Why them boys who get caught with such small amounts of dope on the Ave do bids so long
They bids so long by the time they get to come home
Mamas is gone and babies is grown
And baby mama that was tight in that thong
Fat as a fuck and her body all gone
Pay for it cash her ass is gone
She never worked so the stash is gone
Government rations she gets on
Year after year she get check after check
A gangster come home already in debt
The government say you owe fifty K
For all the free lunches that yo baby ate
Do you go legit, and never have shit?
Or G' up and re-up and get you a brick? (yeah)
Get you a brick (yeah)
See what you suckas don't understand is
This ain't even about race
This is about who got it and who ain't got it
So if I'm on the bottom
And you on the bottom
We're the same color
Dirty fuckin' Poor!"
77,Son of a Gun,2017,Trial by Fire (2017),,Yelawolf,"I look in the mirror sometimes and think about how it all started
Small town Alabama, from city life we departed
Not a single light in the street, morning was scary and dark
To a little boy catching the bus to school, 5:30 sharp
I used to make up songs to keep my mind from wondering
What was in the woods waiting for me, my stomach still rumbling
From the cereal diet
Even though mama was trying to do the best that she could
Alcohol made her violent
Her boyfriend was a prick, probably 26
Barely looked my direction and really didn't do shit
My animosity grew along with my anger
And impatience, disaster in school
My teachers knew I was trouble waiting
And I did too, admittedly but I liked it
Maybe I had to accept I'd always be uninvited to church events, football and family oriented stuff
But I never thought I had it rough
I embraced it, honestly, 'cause I knew how different I was
It made me a rebel and rebels made me feel welcomed and loved
I never knew my daddy, but they said that I was the same and what a shame, get your umbrella Wayne
Here comes the heavy rain
'Cause I'm the lighting to your storm
The bloodstain after a dogfight
The tornado to your alarm
Your hangover after a long night
I'm the snake outta your barn
That one mistake you ever did right
The gunpowder to your drum
I'm your son
The son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun
If life is but a dream
I'm up the creek in a paddle boat
Streams full of snakes, demons, not even a ladder goes
Up high and over the Mississippi to see the ocean, so here I go floatin', yeah
But I made it a habit though
19 and tattooed, hell raisin', the neighborhood was the place and I made it home with the favorites
Quarter pound of that seeded Mexican trash slinging nickles
Making nothing and breaking even, just do it for tickles
Nashville's under icicles, the Methadone's penetratin'
Ecstasy-hungry, baited as an experimentation
No more chocolate-chip cookies, and porcelain jars
Morbid and dark are my role models, and old-school cars
Sickening and I'm lovin' it
I'm basking in half of it
Backstrokin' in sinnin' ways, a dagger to pastors
I never knew my daddy, but they said that I was the same and what a shame
Here come the cocaine in the heavy rain
'Cause I'm the lighting to your storm
The bloodstain after a dogfight
The tornado to your alarm
Your hangover after a long night
I'm the snake outta your barn
That one mistake you ever did right
The gunpowder to your drum
I'm your son
The son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun
And you can tell that I still don't give a fuck
Still drinking whiskey I'm half-a-bottle already down
Slumerican-made man, Criminals all around
Seventy-thousand dollars a night isn't good luck
Livin' a story usin' my war as my shield
The truth, examined and recreated
The following's real:
Plenty of fatherless children fill up the pit in the buildin'
Usin' the mind for the feelin', it's just like poppin' a pill
And I'm takin' it in
Lost, and makin' a win
Thanks for the poems that you inspired, I'm rakin' it in
Never heard you say ""give me five,"" so make it a ten
Keep the change 'cause I'm ballin', look at the bastard of him
When I went to jail for the first time, I thought about you
Son of a bitch, I admit it, I guess the rumours are true
'Cause when I look in the mirror, I see from what I 'came
Trial by fire, pain, heavy rain
'Cause I'm the lighting to your storm
The bloodstain after a dogfight
The tornado to your alarm
Your hangover after a long night
I'm the snake outta your barn
That one mistake you ever did right
The gunpowder to your drum
I'm your son
The son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun"

Wanna spank that ass and get booty loud

I rode that bitch around Walnut park,
Put a stack in my pocket and then blew it at Wal-Mart.
On a jacket, a pistol, and a packet of blow darts.
If you enter my skull, you gonna need a strong heart.
Strong art, the heart of Dixie got history.
You sittin' on 32's we sittin' on 60's.

Jimmy crack corn, then he threw a bar stool.
Mother goose broke a wing and still flew the coup.

Hard knock country boys fuck a new suit.
Fuck a new coop when you need a new roof,

You know what?
You're like the hardest thing I've ever seen
And I'm from the gutter so believe me I've seen some hard things
You come from where the black flower grows
I wanted to cut you down and take you home call me Axl Rose
I could see you in a 1976 Camaro
Me and you, sippin' whiskey getting drunker than Jack Sparrow
It's Black Sabbath, how you get mellow
Well, put your feet on Harley Davidson pedals and rock and roll, girl
Like a diamond cuts through a pearl
This the hardest love song in the world
(Hardest love song, in the world)
You could get it in with your girl
Yeah, the hardest love song in the world
(Hardest love song, in the world)
You don't got to drive a Fleetwood Cadillac
You just got to know some of words to Fleetwood Mac
Horror movies turn you on, pull the sheets back
Fuck it, I role play, do it to you in a Jason mask
You switch walkers like a switch blade
You walk into the room and it's like
These other bitches get hit with a grenade
With that said, let me pull them spandex pants off
You with my teeth like Ozzy did a bat head
I like rock and roll, let's go
Like a diamond cuts through a pearl
This the hardest love song in the world
(Hardest love song, in the world)
You could get it in with your girl
Yeah, the hardest love song in the world
(Hardest love song, in the world)
You ain't concerned with new clothes or salaries
You would rather run across the country like Mickey and Mallory
Be the natural born killer that you are
We'll hang out the window with a pistol and I drive the car
We'll rob a dollar general for nothing but snack food
Shooting anything that moves, dogs and cats too
Re-enact the hardest movie scenes, bloody shirts and holy jeans
We the hardest you and me, rock and roll, baby
Like a diamond cuts through a pearl
This the hardest love song in the world
(Hardest love song, in the world)
You could get it in with your girl
Yeah, the hardest love song in the world

Click bang like magic

84,The Last Song,2011,Radioactive (2011),,Yelawolf,"(Verse 1: Yelawolf)
Everybody's askin' me lately where I'm from
They wanna know what I've been through and what dirt I've done
But man if I told you what I've seen and been through then you probably run off
That your scared of the truth so its dead and secret lined in chalk
See I've been lost ever since I could walk
Looking for my daddy and anyone of mamma's boyfriends who would talk
Or listen to me when I spoke instead of lookin' at me like a joke
Or leavin' me behind leavin' me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho
But I learned quick that my daddy wasn't ever gonna come around
And I didn't give a shit cause me and my momma we held it down
No new kicks first day of school I'm goodwill bound
But when you come from the trench that's how you learn to walk around
So I don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey
I just wanted you to know I didn't need a dollar from you I got 'em myself
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking yourself lonely
Then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelf turn the page
Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show
In the magazines hear me on the radio
So what do you think huh?
(I hope that your proud now
To watch it all go down)
I'm sorry daddy you didn't get to watch me grow
Now I'm always on the road no time to say hello
Bye (and I hope that your proud now
To watch it all go down)
(Verse 2: Yelawolf)
Yeah mamma you look great... perfect
Be safe on your first date... for certain
If he brings you home too late... I'll hurt him
Don't worry 'bout me I'm safe, I'll close the curtains
And I feel like I'm raisin' you but what do I know baby blue
All I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you
Yeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go
All I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl
So I turned into an asshole young and dumb smokin' weed
Vandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars, that was me
But everything I did I had to see, feel the pain, had to grieve
To become who I am and I'm proud of the man I came to be
What I've learned cannot be taught, what I've earned cannot be bought
Justified deserve it all, so don't be concerned it's not your fault
I never counted sheep I count my blessings
So if you see him now momma don't give him the cold shoulder just give him my message
Just tell him"

Oh! This is ugly boy swag, puttin' toe tags on you motherfuckin' ho bags

This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride, you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Like the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
Because I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
That your scheming to check out
Unless your looking to check out (Shot, shot, shot)
What a mess now (C'mon)
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till its gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
But what can I do if I do till its gone
I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around and telling me I changed
Dam right I fucking changed
When there's fuckin' change in my pocket
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
I went from shoppin' without nothin'
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin'
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say ""I'm a fan""
Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till its gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
But what can I do if I do till its gone"

Got my man yellow ... in the house
Set it off quick ... anywhere I'm in the house

Some of ... are bad, some of them got that hard ...
Mister clever on the wheels with (?) your ass too,
But if it's war between the crews but they hang it up the proof
Time to time I get ...it's like tic- tac tic-tac

88,Tone,2012,The Slumdon Bridge (2012),,Yelawolf,"Yeah, Slumdon Bridge
Mr. Red, Catfish
Back me up
Let's go
I'm out to bark again, ball cracked on the target, demolish it
Don't jump, I just see, nah, took a swattin', then
Think while I jump back on the beat, like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech, needs to retrieve blood
Should I creep into these ambient sounds with the speech? Obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's several pauses
You might need a coffin with holes on the top of these tubes to receive oxygen
You buried alive like a freak, six feet
Clawing and snatching and clawin' like a cat
And a dog and a rat
And a hog in a pen
With a frog and all there is to eat
Is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth and jaws and then
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of them
See that you back to bars again, he's all asleep in coffin, man
I'm all, they all that's been, ever was at the start of it
You mention the squad and then
You mention the god of pens
Not of it, but I'm harder then
Flesh I'm harder than titanium brass plates that are polished in
Sticking emcees off like a fly trap, or a bobby pin
When I rap I'm astonishing
I attack tracks like a train track strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave's that's what I made, got this bastard popping then
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shih tzus
Pisses on igloos
Throw it up to the whole fucking world, it's sick too
Vomitin' stomach fluid like you just ate shit stew
Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?
Neither does ? or they ?
Swimming in this ocean no, he just moves
What I'm trying to say is, it's my motherfucking ocean
And I crossed it
Built a bridge, the Slumdon Bridge, holla!"

This is Trial By Fire
Uh
Back in 1979 it was a cold day in December
Mamma peeled the paint off the wall, screamin'
Babie's on the way
They rushed her to the hospital in that old Chevy truck
Running 90 miles an hour down them back roads
Blowing past the sheriff, hid in the woods, smoke bellowing off the engine
Running hot, must have been a sign
They rushed her to the emergency room
And barely made it to the bed
A few minutes later I was screaming for my first breath
""A little devil,"" the doctor said
He's got that look in his eye, ya know?
Reminds me of mischief
Yeah this ones gonna be trouble I can tell it
And then the lights went
Then mamma said doctor something's burning, I can smell it
And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around
Damn right, uh
You could hear lightning for miles around
And oak trees hitting the ground
The wind tore holes on that old Dixie flag on the capitol steps
Change is coming, my great grand mamma said
Quietly clutching her Bible, sitting in a rocking chair, smoking a cigarette
And the wood creaked beneath the porch and the old dog moaned and cried
As the sirens passing by
And Mr. Williams brought a mean batch of that moonshine to the wake
You know one comes and one goes as they say
And they laid a flower on the grave
Buried on December 29th for robbing a bank
And killed by the police, see you in the next life old friend
Little did he know, his old friend was back again
As the son of Sheila Diane
And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around
You know how the story goes, c'mon
See me, I'm a curious soul
A stray bullet to some a chatter and whisper at night and the head of a following storm, a rebel at heart, a devilish grin
A leader of men, a preacher at ten
I was already in to spiritual sin
Back in the saddle again
12s in the back of the trunk, making it rattle again
Giving them nothing but punk
Living, the baby, the babie's got powers, the baby is haunted
Fuck a church, I'm a confession
Professional, public anointed
Came from the wrong side of the tracks
Bring the wrong crowds out the back
Keeping these gutter dogs raised
With these alley way cats
Seen what these others can't see
My poetry is a reflection of ? up from the bottom
And climbing that fucking tree, but I brought a chainsaw
I come to build a house up out of it, chopping
Limbs off this culture, and putting soldiers up inside of it
Nails, brick, mortar, board up the windows
For the tornado, I'm a fatal blow to these honorable foes
Bag up the hot potato
And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around"
90,True to Yourself,2017,Trial by Fire (2017),,Yelawolf,"Here we go to church on Sunday mornin'
Hangovers on 'em
Whiskey pourin' out of skin, it's like a poison
Beer-soaked boots from the barroom floor
It's perfume to a sinner, it's allurin'
Prophet for the slums, prayer for the dark
Barber straight razor blade, pocket watch
Rings on every finger, sacrificial skin
Story written in his blood, he's akin
To animals and criminals alike
Hood, project, trailer park, Backwoods
Sprinkles of the cocaine in his nails
Tank full of propane on the shelf
Fire's in the soul, the child is now a man
The enemies of good now become a friend
Watchin' God play his life violin
Happily, an instrumental in the wind
You will never fit, you're a misfit
You're a quiet voice no matter how loud you get
Despite the effort, you remain reckless
You remain helpless in the same outfit
As your father did before, you're a song
Better sing the praises of the written wrongs
Only time will kill your spirit if you let it fall
And that's why there's...
No time at all
No time like now
To get on the road
If you wanna get out
You got to be true
True to yourself
Or you'll be a fool
To somebody else
The rifle's in the corner, money on the table
Cellophane sacks, baby's in the cradle
Chevy's in the drive, cranked and ready for him
Lights a cigarette, ashes on the floor
And takes another toke, smoke fills the room
Sun sets behind the clouds, heavy gloom
Cops on the run, sirens in the distance
Wild small town, violent and resistant
In the street, they rage and fight
Any given night, it's just another reason for a killin'
Brave the cold and lock the door 'cause it's war
Storm filled with crime, only safe in buildings
Made of brick and mortar, brick of thick morals
Ain't got brick and mortar? Steel will support 'em
Steel with the trigger finger, take your life
Billy in the basement, wasted, makin' pipe
Bombs take it light, wrong take it real
Take a quarter pound of dope and make a deal
Take the front, son, run for the hills
Cowards under power make sonic seals
Cast a shadow over underprivileged minds
While they're chasin' money, hit some basic rhymes
If the world gives you pen and paper, draw the line
Because there's no time
There's no time at all
No time like now
To get on the road
If you wanna get out
You got to be true
True to yourself
Or you'll be a fool
To somebody else
No time at all
No time like now
To get on the road
If you wanna get out
You got to be true
True to yourself
Or you'll be a fool
To somebody else"

I'm down on my knees again
A call for my repentance
The war has taken over me
I beg for the forgiveness
The bullets ricochet, uh
I hear 'em when I sleep now
The blood is on my hands Lord
From man, woman, and child (A soldier from my country)
I'm a soldier from my country (A slave unto my gun)
But a slave unto my gun (The screams to echo louder)
The screams to echo louder (Kill, kill)
God, what have I become? (Whoa)
I pledge my allegiance
I left my family, a new born baby
To slay the enemy, the struggle for power
The lust, the vanity
I trusted America, she took my sanity
:
Winds of change rollin' in
Take your love back again
I'm your fool, Amen
Just a bow for your violin
You played me
You made me your violin
:
She looks at her reflection
Eyes black and blue
She told them she would leave him
She says she was through
He took her from a small town
Showed her the big city life
He promised her the world
Then he made her his wife (He runs around town)
But he runs around town (Lies, lies)
He's a cheater and a beater (She's sleepin' with the enemy)
She's sleepin' with the enemy (No one believes her)
But no one believes her (Whoa)
A diamond ring, a glass of whiskey
The bottle of pain pills open and empty
She left a letter ""to hell I send thee""
He brought home flowers, ashamed and guilty
Too late

Take your love back again

Uh, used like a rag
I've been washed up, I've dragged
Through the mud like a thief
My beliefs and my loves
Take it up, take it down
Took a left, took a right
It's the one to be found
To explain to me why
Why it was me that was brought to the edge of the cliff
'Cause see this is not fair but why should you care?
The choices I've made are mine
But I swear that all can not be the fault of just me
I've tried to maintain my wants and my needs
To work and not see the changes I've strived for
A better life for my family I would die for
Take away everything from me
And ask why more?
Tell me to make a decision in front of five doors
There's a prayer I'm saying 'Why lord?'
Send me to a war without a sword
I'll fight and fight more
I'll travel along road
'Cause I'm just a violin

My world was a little bitty spot in the universe outside of Earth
Tennessee loud, Alabama born, I came down in a meteor storm
Media wrong, media right, righting my wrong, lean to get long
Don't come to get this, children go - this building is about to blow
I don't know what I'mma do with this feeling inside of my mind and soul
I'm a one-in-a-million human show
Shoulda been the motherfucking Truman Show
But if you seen me getting raped as a child
You probably wouldn't give me room to grow
Heavy blow, take a heavy sigh
Like a runner on the dailies, high oh my
You'll be good, baby boy, don't cry
I can make a boat with the broke up rhymes
God made me the Cherokee like no
I can't let the world off the hook this time
And if you didn't want this catfish shit
In fact, you should've never shook that line
Readied that hook, took this time, to press play, then rewind
I would rather be drunk than be blind
To the space age pimp shit that I combine
With what I know, rock and roll, I'm so famous, country fresh
That I can't take one step in the fuckin' street when I'm in public

One, my last album flopped
Two, it wasn't my time
Three, my fuckin' mama's selling my pajamas online
But guess what?
(I'm whiskey in a bottle now)
Fuckin' right, I'm aged
I'm Dirty Three, I'm not a child who plays with rap to get a piece
Don't clap, for no MC who's wack
Then get a free slap
Fuck out my car and I'm smashed in a Caprice
I'm Jack sippin' still
Whippin' wood wheels
Truck on steroids
Illegal to play ball
But dammit how good it feels
Drop that black card
Park in the backyard
Baby fire up the grill
It's party time
Put your hands to the sky
I'm a bullet in the barrel with a hairpin trigger now
Yeah I'm a landslide
I'm a head case train wreck avalanche comin' down
Put your hands to the sky
I'm a ready made party
I'm whiskey in a bottle now
I'm whiskey in a bottle now"
97,Whistle Dixie,2012,Psycho White (2012),,Yelawolf,"With a full of trash straight to the ocean
All black Benz is slowly rolling
Head light's off don't be the chosen
Thinks it's a game then drop the token
Up shits creek without a paddle
That's just life I'm in the saddle
No rest no bitch we don't tattle
Snake's don't always shake the rattle
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All these cops they want the qouta
Too much hypo coca cola
Lucy smoke oh yeah you know her
She's that bitch who rest in nova
Took that bite to bit the apple
You know me I'm hard to tackle
Break me down homie you wish
You couldn't catch that fish with golden tackle
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Give me give me till it's empty
Too much money isn't plenty
It's not enough it's not any
Come come on just choose the jimmy
They all want to bust a nut in
Drop the bomb push the button
Be the king, be the sultan
Some of this shit is so insulting
Break the broken make the chosen
Choose the loose then roll the tie get down and soak with
Gas the gap and light the match and leave you smoking
Choking on the fuse the latest news, life's a wicked
Life's a mystery and please don't be the witness
To the sickness they'll just end it with it
Something death and warm from the step of country fresh
Yeah
Yeah
Country fresh
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Country fresh"
98,Write Your Name,2011,Radioactive (2011),,Yelawolf,"I'll write your name, across the sky
And take away the stars, cause you light up the night
Feel as high as the moon
When you're here with me
That's why I'm gonna write your name
For the world to see
Another old man on the porch with the bottle
Wind blows and the old rockin' chair wobbles
He's just the wavin', everybody's welcome
All he can say about the youth is Lord help 'em
Got a couple grand babies, but they never call though
Left him in the south and they moved to Chicago
Wife's in heaven and, hes saying ever since
Vietnam life's been hard as a veteran
Simple life, just a six pack, yeah ice cold
Across the Georgia line for a ticket for the lotto
Probably never see his name in the headlines
But if I had a plane, I'd put it in the sky
Alabama
She's in love, yeah, Friends call her crazy
Met him at a party, they started dating
Daddy's little angel, Momma's little lady
Only 16 now Brenda's got a baby
She can't afford to, drop out of high school
Jimmy's not a man and he can't provide you
He doesn't want to, but you keep it anyhow
Nine months down the road, what you gonna' do now
Go to the food stamp office and apply
You can find a job, it'll help you get by
And you made it when you didn't know how
Now that's a real star put her name in the clouds
Alabama
You may never be on television or be the one
Your boss at work loves givin' you employee of the month
May never be the first string on a championship team
You may be the star the world just hasn't seen
But that don't make you any less of a star to God
Being rich is only realising it's all a facade
You're richer than you think in that old small town
Cause people like you make the world go round
Alabama"
99,XXL Freshman,2011,Friday The 13th (2011),,Yelawolf,"Hell of a day to load a 22 and take it to the woods
And then bring it to a body
And somebody muthaf-cka not in solitary thinks it missin' from my
Manage to take a Cheverolet run up through the muthaf-cking mud, forget it
Hell of son of a bitch my momma raised into a rapper who could tell a story like my uncle when he's drinking
Product of a working environment, f-ck is y'all thinking
Meaning I'm working working harder than any artist could ever do it, simply 'cause I'm made that way
I run a house around ya ass before you could realise that you in a neighbourhood that Yelawolf made
So call me a relic and tell ya boys 'bout it tell 'em I'm an Alabama wanabe
I be there, I just take it to the studio and just drop a bomb on it from a muthaf-cking beanie bag. I need that
Shady!"
100,You Don't Know (For Fuck's Sake),2012,The Slumdon Bridge (2012),,Yelawolf,"For fuck's sake
Living the life of a student
Yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind
And they say that I've been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight, never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines
Sit on the side, with a rhyme pad
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
'Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five, eh
It's kinda like I took a train
To the left side of my brain, oh, mayne
Toddle some mud, under my door
You know I'm stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology, psychologically insane
Part of me wanna get down, down, down
Making you go low, inside
You don't know, if you don't know by now
You better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him 'bout it?
Yeah, yeah
Ten toes to the dirt
Pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink-drink ya pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels I'm a ridah
Steering your Prada
Only closed in my Ada-di-das
I'm a fetus in my boom sake nana
Daddy's home, on the mic, hey papa
Back with my bang yo, straight loop on my pedal no band though
But every single one of my fans know that
Every damn show, I'm taking their ears on a journey
Like I'm flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin' so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics 'cause they think I've been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes rocking a Kangol
I'm riding round with Yelawolf in your daddy's Lambo
Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You're probably sipping sweet tee's, you still huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
Fact, what you used to steal from
You been playing fools, like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game, when you know the meal's done
Yelawolf is kicking back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still son
Whoa, this old rock, it heals been rolled
Still shocking when I see 'em go
Bananas and they hammer the?
Living the life of a student
Yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind
And they say that I've been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight, never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines
Sit on the side, with a rhyme pad
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
'Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five, eh
I'm not the average half wit
After this hour gets out of this
60 seconds I'm going in any directions
And chasing this jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
It's probably the better idea you move the direction in
Fact it's a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blowing his fucking mics like the winds
I caught this cardigan
Hooligans, hooligans, hooligans
But really who's a friend?
Jump in this little fire jump right back in the pool again
Know I be new again
A student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers, I'm tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4, minus war
You don't want it
Shady records I'm already better, fuck it, doggonnit
Dog don't gotta lead
Dog's already home
Jack, dog I'm a beast, I'm a wolf
Bring your dogs back
A melody man in a melancholic mellow yellow can
Sh', tell him how we gonna sell 'em man
Been working hard all week
(So if you wonder if we earned it, well it's not a probably)
So won't you bring that back to me
(And holla when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween)
I got blisters on my feet
(To walk in night with you is not the shoes to be borrowing)
So won't you bring that back to me
('Cause all the sole of my pin is what all the sorrow brings)
If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no
If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no
If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no
If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no"
