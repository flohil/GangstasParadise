Yeah nigga! It's D12 up in this motherfucker!
You know how we get nigga we wild in the club
Motherfuckers, everybody get crunk in Detroit too nigga!
So wile the fuck out!
Pour your 40 out. (Guzzle It) (8x)
Bitch!
(Verse 1: Bizarre)
We fucked up,
Let us in the club.
One of y'all niggas gon' catch a slug, (Yeah)
I'm so drunk I could hurl for a month.
Any nigga pop shit, go to the trunk.
D12 start shit, nigga come get us,
7 Mile Runyan, wild niggas wit us,
Cause all my niggas is talkin' that shit.
Ain't got no problem, with smackin no bitch.
I'll have my wife, cut your throat.
Blunts, gans, that's all we smoke
Wild the fuck out, stab you with a knife,
It's D12 nigga, we ready to fuckin' fight.
(Verse 2: Eminem)
Who tryin' to be the first one to catch this blade in the throat!
You know the po-po don't let me hold them toasters no mo'
I just cut three people, you gon' be number four
If you don't back the fuck up, and get the fuck up off the flo'.
My crew is takin' over as soon as we hit the do'
You hit the door 'n' we comin' in and you goin' home.
Security that can't even stop us because they know,
Runyan Avenue soldiers hold it down wherever we go.
Chuggin' on our 40's and holdin' up .44's.
We come with toasters like we just opened saving's and loans.
And we don't need your brew tonight homie we brought our own.
So grab whatever you sippin' on and let's get it on!
(Verse 3: Kuniva)
We deep as a motherfuck, we 'bout to get it crunk
You just another punk in the club about to get jumped
I settle my vendettas with AK's, Berettas
We don't supposed to be in here with our weapons but still they let us.
Switchblade, brass knuckles, nickel plated belt buckle.
Broken beer bottles, when we walk in you can smell trouble.
Elbows flying, niggas crying, niggas bleeding, you retreating.
Run into your car and skatin off, We G'ing
We make example out of you haters runnin' your mouth.
You the reason why your peoples is pourin' they 40z out.
Dirty Dozen whiling, beat niggas bloodied.
And you gon' have to pour out a keg for all your homies.
(Verse 4: Proof)
I was raised by drunks, so I became a drunk.
80 Proof for this rocker, that's the name I want.
I'm in the club to beef, you gotta murder me then
Only talk to a bitch with burgundy hair.
Or the aisle in the back, bump a seven deuce.
See that top on that 40, you know it's comin' loose.
See me on the Av. daily, we runnin' this shit.
If your chick get loud, I g-money that bitch.
Packin mags and clips, I'll smash your clique.
Because of Proof they put the G in the alphabet.
Smoking weed, drinking henny, remy, in that jimmy
Don't worry if we run out the corner store got plenty."
1,6 In The Morning,2004,D12 World (2004),Hip Hop,D12,"(Eminem)
Good mornin
Haha, wake your mother fuckin' asses up
You with us or what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleepin' on my roof bitch!
For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
'Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't crap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion
Is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' a slappin
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now your not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a pit bull you get bit B
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me 'cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!)
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy and Proof are you with me?
(Chorus: Eminem)
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
'Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an
Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawnin
'Cause we ain't leavin' till 6 in the mornin
So have sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckin join in
Everybody come on an
(Swifty)
Its in the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs I'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit,
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin free when
You niggaz need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a botique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?
(Chorus: Eminem)
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers come on an
'Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an
Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawnin
'Cause we ain't leavin' till 6 in the mornin
So have sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckin join in
Everybody come on an
(Kuniva)
Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
'What the fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggaz squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seein them white I emtpy out them white to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!""
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life
(Kon Artis)
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin' off-a the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you comin'
(Chorus: Eminem)
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers come on an
'Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an
Wake your ass up mother fuckers quit yawnin
'Cause we ain't leavin' till 6 in the mornin
So have sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckin join in
Everybody come on an"
2,6 Reasons,1997,The Underground EP (1997),Hip Hop,D12,"Proof)
You wish that you could bear me black
D12 standing back
No planning that
Def methods, we got a hand in that
Whoever run this shit
You get a jammed knee cap
Make the healthy get sick
And your fam handicapped
You a fan of rap
My clan attack
Your school, home, your bitch house
Pull my nine milli
You gon' die with your fist out
Him an his
It's over with
Venom is this
Cobra spit
Aggressive dialect with aggressive
Sober bitch
My bionic fires demonish atlonics
Demonic is tainted chronic
Impossible to hold down like vomit
Mics I palm it
You stay to bomb it
Like tourists that's Islamic
I enter your atmosphere like a comet
The new god of rap
Call me nigga Thor
Snap your back
When I slap your ass in a figure four
From miles around they can feel it's lethal
I make hardcore groups like Wu Tang
Look like the Village People (fags)
No sequel
The general let the senistal
Abort your mind state and kill your inner child
(Bizarre)
It's been a while
Since you bitch niggas heard of me
'Cause the last six months
I been doing R&B
But now I'm on some sick shit
Niggas better duck quick
You don't know who you're fucking with
I'll leave you niggas breathless
Seeing me and Bugz rolling in the blue hummer
You a bitch, scared to shoot like Lindsay Hunter
Don't need to be a father
'Cause I'm just to illmatic
I'll probably poison my kids
Like flowers in the alley
Fuck your anorexic neglects it
Fuck a Lexus
I'm doing drivebys on XXX BMX's
(Bugz)
I know a girl who said she's prio
And her sign is a Leo
Bugzy fucked her in a Regal
And then she took me to my P.O.
Fuck rollin' ceelo
I'm down to a c-note
Lost a g' rollin' dice at that punk ass casino
But fuck it (shit) 'cause when times get bad
See me and drag with the mags
On unsuspecting fags (bitch)
I gotta shoot
Bitch you got the boot
And hurry up with it
I'm trying to catch this prostitute (I got ten)
(Kuniva)
I'm the nigga that spotted ya
Spit something hot at ya
Rip your Nautica
Saw you backstage and shot at ya
And kill subliminally
You can go on
And spin your group name 25 times in one song
I'll still write about you
Hip hop is better off without you
Blowing niggas outta they bathrobes
And funky house shoes
For the hell of it
I fuck Missy Elliott
Don't give a fuck if her belly gets
In my way, I'm still nailing it
Got this verbal tech nine
Spitting at you for telling shit
Get this dead body off the mic
I'm fuckin' smelling it
(Kon Artis)
Fuck it
Let's have a scrub out
Fuck around with us and see what happen
We all got them guns blappin
Got y'all niggas back tracking
Ya, we dump bodies in seashores
Busting DJs over they backs with keyboards
Turn up my levels
Your crew is fruitier than pebbles
Changin you razor back MCs to running trebles
Bust up
Kon Artis, quick to smack your slut up
Keep a pack of rubbers
Just in case I gotta nutt up
Brigade style hold 'em out down
That's how it's meant to be
You kick the same shit
Your whole tape sound like a symphony
Don't say shit to me
It's DP carry your daughter
Talking bitches outta they panties
Dollars and last quarters
Like that horsemen
I'll leave your whack crowns hutless
Watch Defarius come to my show
And leave dreadless
Whoever said this slash rapper and producer
Wouldn't make your head twist
Guard your grill and your necklace
I got 6 reasons why we keep shit coming
Dirty Dozen left niggas running for cover
Hiding behind your lovers
Skirting off peeling rubber
As we shout
""Don't fuck with dirty dozen""
6 reasons why keep shit coming
Dirty Dozen left niggas running for cover
Hiding behind your lovers
Skirting off peeling rubber
As we shout
""Don't fuck with dirty dozen""

Lie to your pops and moms
Tell 'em I'm a good kid

Knowin' I went to public school
And sweared and got blazed
Even weed when I got a whole two
And that bitch I did do it
Steal cars I've been through it
Done that
Played buddy buddy and rob ya like nigga run that
Bum cat, and bone hood rats till they bleed on my floor mat
Nasty nigga, make ya believe that I'm a classy nigga
But I'm far from that average joe that you know
Use people for sheilds at shoot outs
That I started, cold hearted
Runnin' reckless peep out your shorty till my neck twistin
Infectionist, poisonus bug we all ruff
Showed your daddy love or slugs
Could have tortured him, told me that he didn't wanna die
We still forced him
Fuckin' peeps has his bat, when we brawled they fled
Now we layin dead with his chicked head like Dirty Fihed
Come battle us with your heat and stabbed, nabbed and gagged
Jabbed and dragged and thrown inside of a bag
Your fans been had, bamboozle, run 'em up
But you losing credibility the miniute and up
So fuck that stank bitch with the saggy ass titties
Fuck all the niggas that don't represent our city
Fuck JLB they don't play none of my shit
Fuck all them niggas that be suckin our dicks
(Kuniva)
Sicker the tuburculosis
Pack a cannon with a focus
That's killin' all the players and the coaches
Embarrass you in front of company like dirty roaches
Approach this and get served the situation, hopeless
Wrote this, jot it down 'cause Kuniva wrote this
The wild animal rhyme colprut
Ferocious, closest
Nigga walkin' behind you with a dosage
Of teffifyin tales that be stompin small soldiers
The grim reaper dipped in all black like folgers
Packing four heaters and carrying five holsters
Suppose if I was to let you put up all your posters
Let everybody think you was the dopest
I'd rather strike you quicker then the cobra
Box you up and sold ya
Take you underwater and hold you until it's over
I told you once you dumb with a blunt
That be pullin off the dope fiends selllin tha
Get your ass kicked quicker then punts
I'm sick of you punks
Cock it back now I'm upset
Yo' niggas next
I'm blowing smoke outta ya chest when it connect
Creepin' like insects and ridin' with ten techs
Ah fuck any D.J that don't play Bizarre's shit
Fuck your sister I don't like her she don't suck dick
Fuck that nigga that talk shit to my crew
Fuck all y'all niggas who say I don't like you
(Bugz)
I'm a brand named guy
Who loves to stay high
Got a ten inch dick and the gun the same size
A bitch named bitch
Whos thick with grey eyes
Who loves to suck dick and get hit by eight guys
Its Bugz bitch, you the fuck you thunk it was?
Gettin' drunk with drunken thug
Too fucken numb to feel the buzz
Y'all niggas know the image
No gimmicks, No timids, no manners, and no limits
This time, bitch, I'm goin' all out
Whippin the four out
Like get the dough out
I'm miss crime, sick individual
Ask my peers in middle school
If you walk my way home gettin' robbed is like a ritual
Lyrical giant, tyrant who lies
Just to get you to do what I want
And bitch you will
Sit you still, tie you up
Begin to ill
And destroy you face, I'm with some shit that you can feel
Fuck all y'all niggas who say dirty dozen's dead
Fuckin' your new wife in your brand new bed
Fuck your chicken head she suck dick anyway
Fuck anybody who say crime don't pay
(Proof)
Heard enough garbage to make a glad bust
Add just my magnum beef I had enuff
Snuff the sweetest MC in this camp tribe rivulry
To be as live as me keep 'em quiet like a library
My rhymes are virgin tight
And not fuck-with-able
You find the mic suckable
Without chicked pox, untouchable
Peep my ain't to be tested
Ill test the globe and rip through your domestic
Majestic warrior to rap to win
Knock the, and slap the chin of the aggresor
Thinkin' that they fresher
Wanted conquest holdin' down the one sided contest
That explosive rappin' nigga
The fans wear a bomb vest
Style be a eliquit
A fellow pimp to mant with clips
Fuck kicks and being skinny with zits
I'm the shhhhh,
Like cane in a crack pot
I thinks its best you act right
Ill confirm your death, left the morgue
D-12 is blowin' up like the fourth
I whisper far well to my granny
Till I push her down the stairwell
And I'm sendin her care mail
Like get well you old hag
Ill bring the pain like a blow fag
Staplin one his gonads to his sock
Doin' jumping jacks
Once we put you down bitch their ain't no comin' back
Remember that
(Bizarre)
It's the big guy, quick to get on you
Battle? I'll be glad to shit on you
Come against my crew and see who gets destroyed
Fuck I'll let you bring bats and brawl some of my boyz
Shady ass niggas wether drunk or sober
Bizarre that was demo tape you just recorded over
I don't give a dam bitch I'm just to ill
Gimme ten pills y'all run across the Lambo Field
Like bitches, think of the illest line know
And I bet you I already said it
Just forget it, 'cause you niggas pathetic
Pop shit, y'all niggas go and get it
Beat your ass hang ya with this fuckin' mic cord
Fuck the sword, I quote my raps in billboard
Suck my dick while I laugh like its funny

It's shit like this, I kick to these rich white kids
Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is
Whoops I did it again didn't I, my shit's
Harder to figure out, than what Britneys' tit size is (Woo)
I probably pissed you off again, didn't I bitch? (So what)
You and Christina Gaguilera, kiss my grits
You know how many shits I give, I wish I did
So I could quit givin' these twisted little kids ideas
This just in, Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit fucked and dick sucked him
If Affleck can get his ass licked, how come I can't, shit
God damn bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this
Are those pictures I made of us, together on the internet
As close as I'm ever gonna get, to hittin' it from the back
Shit, when it comes to that, I hit it harder from the back
Than Everlast, when he's pluggin' Lethal in his fuckin' ass
Just gimme one more chance, Britney hit me one more time
Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line
To sniff, you fuckers know what time it is
Fuck your jewelery, my records almost diamond bitch
What's goin' on in the world today
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's OK
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre (It ain't nuttin' but music)

Eminem doesn't like *NSYNC, well I do
So fuck him, and the Backstreet Boys too (Yeah I said it)
Whatever happened to the cast of Diff'rent Strokes
Gary'sbroke, Toddsnorted coke, and Danaoverdosed (Aww)
I got two little boys with me
Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me (Hee-hee)
I'm up early with my hair curly
Me and Mr. Furley, fuckin' Lavern and Shirley
:
A lot of rappers are livin' in la la land
That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha Men *woof woof woof*
As bad as the life I had, I'm not mad
And I don't need to be a jackass, to beat up my dad *punch punch punch*
My whole family's country
My grandmothers old-fashioned, she keeps askin' me why I rap with a honky
But granny I'm a flunky, I could be a junkie
I could be hangin' with the hoochies out at the club scene
So all the independent women in the house (house)
Show us your tits and shut your motherfuckin' mouths
Robert Downey, Bobby Brownie, Whitney Houston, the shit she's usin'
Jesse Jackson, reverend scandals, got George Michael, Tevin Campbell
Pee-wee Hermans, peep show places, public restrooms, beat those cases

Your mom and dad probably mad at us (for what?)
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers
They like where I'm from (uh huh), we don't bite our tongue (yeah)
Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns (blah blah blah)
It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme
When you work, you ain't gettin' paid for that overtime (damn)
It's only music, media know it, but they blind (that's right)
I ain't in your life so stay the hell up outta mine (nigga)
And you'rethe reason why Princess Dianaended up dyin'
You people get offended, I don't care, stop cryin'
Tryin' to get us to leave, 'cause what we say just ain't playin'
But holdin' back from what I say just ain't me
Now what's these parents so mad for (Your music is bad for)
For teenage kids who drink more
Than Ted Dansonof Cheers, Carson drinks beers
We all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch (shut up)
Poor or rich, I still do the same old shit
I don't jump in front of a camera and say no shit
So when they ask me about my sarcastic-ness
I just slap them, turn around and ask them this

Look for that new D12 R&B Album coming soon
Straight R&B, Straight R&B, Straight R&B"
5,American Psycho II,2004,D12 World (2004),Hip Hop,D12,"(Intro - B-Real)
Yeah Homie
I thought we told you
We been fuckin' loco
Cypress Hill, D12 Bitch!
(Chorus - B-Real)
I'm a little bit off the chain, you can call me insane, but the fact remains
That I'm a pyscho
Better get it through your brain, when you say my name, never say it in vain
'Cause I'm a pyscho
(Verse 1 - Swift)
I'm a motherfucking omen, I bow down to no man
Split a nigga open, killing folks compulsive
A soldier with a motive, scrotum big as boulders
I hold 'em then unload on you, put it on a poster
So everyone can notice who was focused on us
Poking they nose in our business, hoping that I don't come smoke 'em
No one knows my notions or emotions, I'm a vulture
You niggas close to croaking any moment and I know when
I could fuck the culture up, probably rap
A maniac with anxiety attacks, I don't wanna chat
Speak when you spoken to and I don't have to read a fucking
Magazine or quotable to notice what you hoes will do
(Verse 2 - Kuniva)
We all soldiers, we move as a unit, we all roll up
And show up at your residence, light your front door up
Get scared, life ain't fair
And I'm prepared to blast you just as fast as Dre can say ""Hell yeah!""
So watch what you say cause it can happen either today or the next minute
I can draw the heater and spray and I'm dead serious
You could be dead period, end of story
I'm on your porch with a gun and your son, sipping a forty
Nobody can hold me, I does it all by my lonely
I stomp your head when you awake, you be looking like Gumby
Aftermath and Shady, bitch, you can read it and weep
You see my poster in the 'hood for ""the G of the Week""
(Chorus - B-Real)
I'm a little bit off the chain, you can call me insane, but the fact remains
That I'm a pyscho
Better get it through your brain, when you say my name, never say it in vain
'Cause I'm a pyscho
(Verse 3 - Bizarre)
They found Saddam, but they ain't gon' find me
I'll be under a tree in Buttfuck, Tennessee
And I don't know too much about my daddy
Except he spit in my face and fucked me in my fanny
I ain't a racist, I just hate whites
Fags and dykes, blacks and transvestites
Thirteen years old and joined a fucking gang
Hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fucking pain
Am I insane? Who really knows?
Cause any second my temper can fucking blow
I get colder than December
Black the fuck out, tomorrow won't even remember
See Bizarre can show you what violence is all about
And this Dr. Dre beat done brought it the fuck out
Run in your house and put a gun in your mouth
And blow your brains the fuck out!
(Verse 4 - Eminem)
I probably got a screw loose or two, or maybe three or four of 'em
Some fell out and hit the floor
All I know is ever since my fucking head hit the snowbank
I been a little neanderthalish, no thanks to my man D'Angelo Bailey
But I just take it slow daily, my biggest dilemma's
Trying to figure whether to use the flat head or the Phillips
Or just go to the Home Depot and pick the new power drill up
Gives me two hours and six days and I'm still up
I feel like I'm about to snap any minute
There's a new Tower Records about to stop and get a fill-up
Pick the new Cypress Hill up
And go find who did that shit to Xzibit
And go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
And shatter his fucking lips with it
(Chorus - B-Real)
I'm a little bit off the chain, you can call me insane, but the fact remains
That I'm a pyscho
Better get it through your brain, when you say my name, never say it in vain
'Cause I'm a pyscho

6,American Pyscho,2001,Devil's Night (2001),Hip Hop,D12,"(Verse 1: Eminem)
I'm the devil - if ever there was such a thing
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
I'm a mindfuck, completely dis-(gu-uh-uh)-sting
I'm (what?!), a human mutt, fuck a being
I'm a dog - fuck ""lambs,"" I'm ""silencing"" 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walking, talking, Ouija board
Speaking in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before
... Hhem-delle-la, ennich-me-noughh-mi-niche-mick-norrf
Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em
Till you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em?
Well if so, get ready for some shit, yo
""Is this some kind of sick joke?"" Shit no, motherfucking schizo
So disturbed, he just goes so berserk, he tiptoes
This verse was his urge to slit throats of just hoes
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with
So-someone this disturbed, sa-sippin on si-zzurp
So - lock your doors, drop to the floors
Get your shotguns drawn - here comes another ""Clockwork Orange""
Look at Bizarre; you really think he's right in his mind?
What the fuck you think's going through it when he's writing his rhyme?
(Hook: Eminem)
You bout to - journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his silent screams
You bout to - journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his violent screams
(Verse 2: Bizarre)
It's Friday night, I'm at a rave again
Picking up transvestites on my Harley-Davidson (hey hop on)
My girlfriend's a crackhead whore
She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor
And take your bottles to the store (Nigga, I'm takin' these!)
Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and suck another nigga's meat?
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay (Dad, it's me!)
I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage (I'm sorry!) I had to eat it (oh)
My dick is burning, it ain't because of disease:
It's because I'm jacking off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze! (Ah!)
I'm living in Waco Texas, me and my girl
Fuck David Koresh, I'm starting my own world
It's called Bizarre Cemetery, it's scary
Eating a virgin's cherry
""They're all gonna laugh at you, Carrie!""
(Verse 3: Kon Artis)
I was born feet first, smoke 40's and drink weed
The Lord rehearsed my birth, I'm the worst breed
A nigga you ever set sight on, my right arm's
Got more power than 5 a iontons Dragon's python so
""Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer""
Light yo' ass like a liquid nitro-gas spiller
Psycho slash Michael Myers, Michael Jack's ""Thriller""
Rifle slash knife faggot that's your ""Cop Killer""
As a yung'un, I was beat where I was living (aight)
Crossdressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed caused the stress that caused the Ritalin
Pressed stressed and Ritalin caused the cop's feelings
To be hurt after they seen what I did to those children
I'm vulgaric
You Bo Derek
I throw you face flat off the terrace
So you can have somethin' to stare at"

8,Art Of War,1997,The Underground EP (1997),Hip Hop,D12,"(Proof)
Tired of niggas rapping the same
Talking the same, ya, hah
Living in the same place
What style is Proof gonna do this time?
Ya really wanna know, huh?
What is he gonna do?
You got niggas who said,
""I'm out, I'm out the door this year""
Fuck, all them niggas
Fuck *Einstein*
Nigga said me and Bizarre hate each other
Fuck you
Fuck Low Key
Fuck that nigga
Talking 'bout he battled me and beat me
Fuck you
And when I see you on the streets
I'm in your grill
Ya know what I'm saying?
Listen
By the age of aquarius
My mind state was gugarious
Various opponents whose stature was hilarious
Like you
Throwing fairy dust
Then frowning hard on whack chorus
Proof was on the scene before Nat Morris
Cold as a black forest in these starving streets
A garbage heap that was brought
Stars could eat
The nerve of haters
Diss us perging gators
So I spit venom at you through your serve in vegas
The primitive fool again
None can match that
Blast at your rib cage
Making your spine hatch back
You lack fat tactics
And thoughts of Dexatrim
Whippin' my dick out on nuns
If they say sex is sin
Next to Slim
I'm Shady as a Tetris win
Dirty Dozen solo are respected men
Get known for craft
Irritate me like infected skin
The future ain't lookin' the same
Like a neglected twin
Some test the scary
That's unnecessary
To kill your crew, family, your friends
Your tech can carry
Knock your paws off sync
Left you flat like a soft drink
Got more styles than Diana Ross swing
Zone like Rick James when he smoke crack
You and Charli Baltimore
Got something in common
Y'all both whack
Proof the king P-I-N
If I ain't the best this year
The motherfucker be my twin
(Bizarre)
Who's the bitch ass nigga
That's mentioning my name?
No one to blame
I just cock back your name
None of y'all bitch ass niggas wanna test
'Cause five minutes or less
I'll be at your assets
You're just a bitch
And I wanna test you
And the niggas you was with
They already left you
So duck down 'cause Bizarre Kid's comin' here
Shootin' at you and your peers
And cousins you ain't seen in years
Hope you believe in God
'Cause nigga you better pray
Pull your kids from the window
And duck from this AK
And already done called the Proof and Denaun
And even if I want to
I can't change my nigga's lines
'Cause you on the shit list
These bullets are relentless
And ain't no way in hell that you avoidin' this
Ain't no apologies
Yo I see your number on my caller ID
Bitch, stop callin' me
Fuck the truce
Nigga I pull the deuce deuce
And my niggas go wild
Like a bunch of rats that got loose
I'm comin' for you nigga
So hide behind your door
'Cause all my niggas believe in the Art Of War
What you startin' for?
Is you on for war?
Trife assassins
Bringing you the art of war
(Kuniva)
Straight wylin'
Burying bodies right on top of each other
So when somebody ask
I just say you under the weather (Killer Eel)
No matter what the problem
Revolvers can solve 'em
Keep a nigga breathless
The tech whips regardless
Heartless
Walking you punks right to the edge of darkness
We're way beyond that
When I pull me out a cartridge
I bank shots
Wettin' up your white tank top
While my nigga Bugz is stickin' up
Your nearest gang spot
Just another scarred liar retired
We make niggas pass out like fliers
Flossin' my teeth with barbed wire
Leavin' a bloody mess
Then harass kids
And buy 'em a candy bar
So they can tell me where you live
(Kon Artist)
Highly dangerous
Spraining my wrist
Lickin' off this black tech
With my eyes flossed bitch
Look up the Art of War
In the ghetto dictionary
And see Bizarre holding your kids
Hostage for their Crunch Berries
My pump stay hot
Coat stomachs like Malox
Run away spots
Setting it off with the guns that Dre got
Ghetto séance
But ass backwards
Fuck bringing you back to life
Nigga we putting you in your caskets
Running off with the mop like you got somethin'
But in my mind I'm thinking
Blast soon as I spot somethin'
And when you fall
I know damn well I done shot somethin'
And I'm cleaning your brains
Off my windshield for frontin'
D-12 is
Your local weed sellers
Throwing pipe bombs in your church
To kill your elders
The men on bitches like tracks
You notice these
Banging clits and ovaries
Till they drop the sheets
Niggas'll die from these
Blows we inflict
You supposed to be in some shit
'Cause you the underdog bitch
(Bugz)
Bugz'll murder you
In less than a word or two
Bring the art of war to your door
Call me Sonny Zoo
Nigga don't be mad 'cause your broad is a trick
Always dialing 976-need-a-dick (bitch)
Niggas like you
I'm known to smack, stab, and spit on
Kick at, hit on, you hear me bitch? It's still on
Calling through my crib
Like your 'bout it with your shouts
Ain't you the same nigga
Who was crying on his couch
Apologize on site boy
If you like your life boy
(Yo Bugz, leave that nigga alone
You know he just a white boy)
Fuck that
I smack him off the wheels
And take his bleel
Or bought a royal mope
And destroy him with my steal
You pussy ass
How you figure it will linger
Take your bitch on Jenny Jones
Then beat your ass on Jerry Springer
Don't fuck with it
Or get your head split and mouth bruised
That's a promise
Fuck *Hal Shoes*
Chorus till fade"

Mysterious neighbor
Cuttin' throats with broke Coke
Bottles and rusty razors
I ain't the one to save you in a crisis
I kick you while you're down
Snatch you up and ask you who's the nicest
Better say me
Or I'll put your next to some vice crips
And squeeze until they lifeless
I stayin confidence with my mind
About being good or evil
I'm deceitful
Lethal when I leave you
Dead inside your blood brother
When your hand for help reaches out
We just chuckle
Now where the fuck of how we is as individuals
We raise wrong
Politics and poverty got us head strong
You dead wrong
If you think you'll make it out with all your limbs
Grab your camera
So we can put this on film

Hey
Don't get cut into hundreds over some dumb shit
I advise you to run quick 'cause we run this
Guns click on the reg reg
Put MCs on they death beads
Either that or leavin' 'em walking on peg legs
In various locations
I'll be wylin' out at places
I'm why they're running out
Of handicap parking spaces
Intense dreams
You want suspense? It's endless
How I massacre crews
Leave you solo and friendless
Contact lens less then lifeless
The trifest MC
You never wanna fight with
Or rock a mic with
Carry a knife with
Da Brigade on the night shift
Pack this big dick that I use to fuck your wife with
You ain't the nicest
Derelicts with intelligence
Leaving your grill wide open like pelicans
Just wait
My words penetrate through your vertebrate
Till it snap your neck brace
And crack your chest plate

You studies wanna job like assets
Rough is ready to start teaching niggas
In ass whippin' classes
Breaking glasses
Damage crews by the masses
Shit talking like Cassius
Get in your E-Class and dash bitch
Kon Artis
The only man that can expand the cervix
With the tip of my bone
Get in your girl and keep fucking
Until she starts screaming ""Leave me alone""
Walking predacone
Looking for weak grade to set it on
From dusk till dawn I bomb
Went through hell and remain calm
The devils to stir us to fight me
Just to see what type of shit that I was on
Those bastards is why they got burnt
And turned into crisp XXXXX
With lyrics hotter than lava comes
It's urgent
That she splurge with
Before I merge with
Kuniva will make ya nerves emerge and split
Heard me bitch
You weren't worthy with the mic
Is why I snatch it
And people think and praise with words that I like
With things that I say on you
You need someone to spar with
Put you in the back of my trunk
Get in my car trick
Running with nothing but thugs
With the fug
We more dangerous than L.A. cops with big clubs
Who's arresting you when you're drunk
You sick munk
Spitting up bills scriptures and gumps
Till you punks get the picture
Get it?
If rap was a whore you couldn't hit it
I make it my business
Twenty four seven to try and stick it
(Kuniva)
Gotta get it
I gotta give it to you non-stop
Bombs drop lyrical warfare we onslaught
Dead bodies rot
We making your body rock
Licking them off like lollipops
That the shotty pop
Kuniva snatch rolex chains, watches and anklets
Dissin' the stank bitch
Packing heaters to make you thank quick

Now its time for Bizarre to take off his shower cap
It's been five days, I patiently waited
Saturday morning, its time to get faded
And I mean get faded, ""I mean get faded""
Damn at four o'clock, I didn't almost make it
My barber's name is Sarah, she don't really know how to cut
But she gots nice teeth and big ol' butt
So two days a week, I get faded for no reason
Same ol' haircut, keep it low and breathin'
If you see me in a barbershop, go on and run
'Cause I'm probably gettin' a perm and my toe-nails done
(Proof + (Kon Artis))
Got here full grip, but can't call the cops
I gotta get the script from the lips to the barbershop
Jump in the seat ""Yo gimme the line and""
And tell me who came through shinnin'
(Homeboy scooped up, in a new truck)
(Gave everybody a cup and gave me a few bucks)
(Then he started braggin' bout his last lick)
Cut me a design along with his address
(Swift)
You can have a million dollar suit on, shinnin' with ya karats up
But it don't mean nothin' if ya floggin' in ya haircut
Now who next? (Um I just want my son to get a tech)

And all you do is whine, and drink wine (Hahaha)
Yo' you know that Cho-chie got knocked out (Man) (When?)
Early at Le'mott's house (Again?)

We wrote a song for the hoes, you like to hear it, here it goes
A little something you probably won't hear on your radios
So when it comes on in the club it's one that everyone knows
And if I'm talking too fast it just means you're listening too slow
And if you listen a little faster maybe you'll catch up, BITCH
Ju jah jah jah dah du ju jah, you just made me mess up, BITCH
Blibiri babiler blabber, it don't matter, I'm just blabbering

You ain't gonna get shit, so don't even ask
Disrespect my wishes (BITCH!) I'll beat your ass!
Watch me coming home full, eating half of your doggy bag
And I leave laughing, while you calling me on the rag
I'm the type that might cut off the lights when I hit

Huh, yeah this's just one of those days when yo' ass just wanna chill out.
And motherfuckers be all in yo' where and shit...
And that naggin bitch, it's just like to hear herself talk...
Blowin' all yo' high away. Yeah, that's some fucked up shit.
But it happens, youknowimsayin?

Schizophrenia
How many of you got it?
How many motherfuckers can say they psychotic?
How many motherfuckers can say
They brains dryrotted from pot?
You got it like I got it or not?
If you did you would know just what I'm talking 'bout
When your tongue's rotting out from cotton mouth
When you end up becoming so dependent on weed
That you end up spending a G
In the vending machine
You got the munchies
Look at you
Junk food junkie
Potato chips and lunch meat
Up in the front seat
Sometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja
That it's got you thinking the whole world is watching ya
Or maybe you don't smoke
Maybe you just grow
But whatever your drugs, yo
Go for the gusto
Just don't
Come fuck with me when I'm doing my drugs
You see me in the club don't come fucking my high up and
Blow my buzz
Do what you want to just don't
Blow my buzz
Then I'm gon' sit here and just
Roll my drugs
And if you talk I'm gonna
Fuck you up

Naw, just came to eat your mother out
It's the big guy
Doing the butterfly to the ground
Go 'head

I spot this fat bitch from across the room
Now suck my dick while your boyfriend's in the bathroom (ya ya)
My face is pink
Looking for a sink
And don't worry 'bout what I put in your drink
It's called a date rape drug
Ten minutes you'll be fucked up
Open your nasty ass legs up (ya you whore)
Bitches I'm catching
Blunts I'm matching
Don't call me Bizarre
I'm the Reverend Jesse Jackson

Who the fuck is this guy?
Why the hell you in my presence?
It'd be cool if you was asking me some reasonable questions (damn)
But you on some bullshit nigga
This your last beer (for real)
Get the fuck off my dick
And tell your bitch to bring her ass here
I kick a hoe out
Without giving her cab fare (uh huh)
And leave her barefooted just for nagging in my damn ear
When I'm out eating
You fags interfere
They don't go until I let 'em know a mac is sitting here
I get drunk and I smoke weed
What your ass wanna hear?
I didn't answer you clear?
I meant Manson is here, ok?
You want some lle'?
I'll front your ass some play
But other than that get the hell out my face
Because you niggas trying to
Blow my buzz
Do what you want to just don't
Blow my buzz
Then I'm gon' sit here and just
Roll my drugs

Fuck you up
Just don't say shit and we'll be cool

Yo, Denaun, you seem shook
I really am, dog, look
This fat bitch keep chasing me
Trying to get me to nutt
Ah man, you probably led her on
I just bought her a beer
I saw her rubbing on your ear
While she was wiping your tears
I admit, I was high
But you ain't see me crying
Nigga, you lying and you blowing my high
Just stop denying it
Well at least somebody in this bar is
This big bitch did
The ultimate by saying she wanted to have my kid
Look man, you grown
Just leave me alone
I'm in the zone
Call it a night
Get stoned
And take that fat slut home (take her ass home)
Just quit the drank
Hit the dank
Do some drugs (man)
Go kill yourself
Fuck you
Well stop blowing my buzz
(Proof)
I'm at the front of the bar
By the lounge in the back
With a slut on my arm
While I'm downing the yac
Got the pills in my system
Floating around
Everytime I start drifting
Someone open they mouth
Yo, my ear been spit, licked, and freestyled in (Yo, my flow is cool my whole crew)
I think I'm going Def like Mos senile men
Only one good demo outta three thousand
(Yo, I ain't wanna rap for you anyway)
Aiight, aiight

Next nigga that bump me
I'ma do the humpty
And elbow bitches
Till everybody jump me

Of that bomb-ass herb that's guaranteed to rock bells
A hiphop refugee like Praswell
Travelin citys

Game trump tight and solidified
Comupterized
To get rid of spies
Know what I do to guys
Shootin and spittin' lies
I'm banished in exisdence
Vanishin any instences

Proovin repentences
The only way to see me, don't miss these
Me and my crew smoke so many trees that
I piss leaves
Never my bitch please
But keep smokin' my system, roll blunts it's all tight
On an off night
I still smoke like exaust pipes
And bust a universal flow
And blow your wig back like niggas with toupe's
Drivin' a convertable

Back with a bungee cord
Bring your boys in
We can bring the noise in

Smokin' blunts with Mel Far (??)
In my brand new car
Wanna see me
Even if I was in Arizona I'd still request iced tea

On top of the mountain ain't nothin' your bitch-ass crew

Sick emcee that they call Peter
Treat your crew like an unexpected meter

Fuckin' more shit than Howard Corsell

It's the team that your entire clique scared to diss
Demandin attention when the glock sound
Y'all niggas to be murdered like Jeffery Daumer on lock down
I'm brown like Bobby, pullin hoe's like whitney
Take your title, kill your moms so you won't forget me
Lips sealed nigga I might blow important plots
Whoever fronts is gettin' done like Micheal Jordan's pops
Sure I'm number one translator my fame dirty D
Y'all niggas gettin' hung like this was 1933
Got word of me
Now flee
Cause you don't got a chance
Death is 3 easy steps so now we gotta dance
So look away
Don't play
With the style master

Lyrically I'm sick, ill everything but sober
My nickel plate pack the jackin fool get fucked over

Dirty Dozen is the clique so I ran over and lit cha
Ripped the ass right out ya pants like a Dovermin Pincha
Like the cobra and ninja
My intentions to injure
And prevent ya
From enterin from the edge of my center
Or get your muthafuckin pants split at the creases
Fuckin' you intelectually givin' you menatly sexually transmited diseases
My duty is to keep a stranger barred
I guard my sector like a Saint Bernard
And this ain't the yard
Bringin' the noise like a trigger happy gun slinger
Droppin' your whole clique with one finger

Your click made they trip, I make them hoes suck mint
Ask them girl, they know the scoop, don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I chop off her titty, have you sucking one tit
Them pink belly niggas, is who you run wit
Making half-ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate your damn sound, don't like it one bit!
You could make a double album, won't have one hit!
Your entire outfit is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't outwit
I ad-mit, that my style is unfit
For momma's baby boy, because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit, larceny, give harm quick
You pull the alarm switch I stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit
This egotistic hip-hop fundamentalistic
Don't risk it, you get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existence
I'm persistent when it comes to bend shit
Smoke the blunt with my judge right before my sentence
I'm relentless, to deny is senseless
Your bitch pay my bill, that's where the hell your rent went!

Pow-pow! Straight off the corral
Now, the dirtiest street vet from the mile
Is vexed without the techs and six shooter
Body bullet polluter, perverted intruder
Now who the, fuck wanna buck with the diseased, that's dis-eased
I got a bitch named trigger, my main-squeeze will make your brain
Freeze
Dirty D is dope like cane
Remained eased, maintain chill status with no pause
Hot slugs to your carriages, turn your dome to coleslaw
My only thought is survival before my arrival
I'm jumping out on niggas like I'm 5-0
Smack 'em up like a pack of trifling fly hoes
Any opportunity to mangle I never pass up
Fucking your clique with broom sticks - face down, ass up
Dirty Dozen packing the shit to turn your chest red
With our dick in ya mouth, fucking everything you just said
Yeah yeah bitch, coming to a block near you is Dirty Dozen
Nasty like a stank, slut bitch with 30 husbands
When I was 5 I was already fuckin'
And playing X-rated cassettes in Teddy Ruxpin
I used to walk up and down the block cussin'
Locked in youth homes at 6 with glocks bussin'
I grew up with not ballers, who got dollars
Shot callers with guns and Rotwillers
By any means necessary I'm on a killing spree
It's the devil in me, intoxicated with brown Hennessy
Beware life ain't fair and I don't care
Cher braids my hair while her kids are in day-care
Two blunts and I'm out for lunch
Your whore said I'm here ""Sugar pie, honey bunch""
This Bizarre kid, that ain't the answer
You're more uncomfortable than an anorexic cat with fucking cancer
Here's your chance to advance

Back from the studio boy, I don't wanna mingle
Smoking LSD, working on Lou Roths new single
Who's the big guy who's quick like Sugar Ray
Fuck Calgon bitch, Bizarre might take you away
Give up the pussy 'cause I know you a freak
?? In a week, cause my kids got to eat
Date raping anorexic girls in my beat-up car
(Hold up Bizarre, you taking that shit too far!)
But I can't stop cause my brains ain't there
Bust a nut then drop that bitch in Lake St. Clair
Your mistakes ain't rare, your rap style annoys
You rap like a bitch plus I can't stand your voice
Bitch you suck, you whack as fuck, eat a dick
You need a brick upside your dome, we be the clique
Runnin' you down in carloads
Leaving you smashed down on tar roads, flat line like barcodes
Put up your guard hoes, I'm blazing heat the way we speak
Not even Nike could cover these amazing feats
Burning rappers eternally, internally and externally
For half stepping like one-legged fraternities
Quickdraw McGraw, AKA Eye-Kyu
Putting something inside you, leaving holes that I see right through
For anyone obstructing my view, my art of attack
Is slugs through your chest, that'll blow your heart out your back
Making sure you get fed, with a whole lot of led
And throw you over the Ambassador Bridge and scream ""Drop Dead!""
Largely, I'm out to stack equations, without a tax-evasion
Make moms say ""That's amazing,"" all the same like black and Asian
My pack evasion, attack a stage and you blush like a Cadillac,
I wish your fleet would try to battle rap,
Or make a man bleed, like a cattle pack stampede
Front and co-sign my hands leave
Think to Recognize like Sam Sneed
My ?? dispose ya, froze ya, another classic closure
The death-master out to blast ya
My team runs shit, from from the D E side, down to last ya
Past the, norm, my crew swarm, molest the children of the corn
Dirty D till infinity, now bring it on
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants

Foiling your plot

A dead corpses that been cut up
And left in abandoned lots

To ours is a fucked up dream
The shit I done seen
Has turned me to a scandalous fiend
Sticking your peeps for cream

Keep your heat in your trunk

Swell you up with permanent mumps

Spittin' the phlegm out
Getting at you whether you coming out
Or you been out

Undeniably you are a loss
Invincible, why you trying to be a mind boss

Hate music like devil worshippin Satan music
So say your prayers, your Hail Mary's and Jesuses
Take two sticks, tape 'em together and make a crucifix
Try to stop it but you cain't do it (ha ha)
A whole generation of kids blowin' out their fuckin' brains to this
Kurt Cobain music - students converted to 'caine users
As soon as they heard it went out and murdered and maimed to it
What's your name?
(Swifty McVay)
Judas
Got my nine with six sharpshooters, now let's do this
I got niggaz that shoots to static - you don't understand
How I'm all up in you niggaz TV's like Carole Anne
I'm a poltergeist, lyrically I'm supposed to strike
Try to snatch this mic, you get cracked with Molson Ice
(Swifty get your own woman!) I want his wife
I'm the type to go to gamblin parties with trick dice
I rob casinos, slugs, eat those
You'd think it was the devil feedin you jalapenos
Now you out of the scene hoes shot at your clean clothes
My fo'-fo', prone to make you niggaz breathe wrong
(Chorus: Eminem)
It's Devils Night (da da dah, da-da da da dah)
It's Devils Night (da da dah, da-da da da dah duh da)
'Cause I came back to rule this time!
It's Devils Night - 'cause I came back to take what's mine!
Yes it's Devils Night (da da dah, da-da da da dah)
It's Devils Night (da da dah, da-da da da dah duh da)
'Cause I came back to rule this time!
It's Devils Night - 'cause I came back to take what's mine!
(Kon Artis)
It's like I'm on the john, tryin' to shit and get no response
Constipated bitch, tell these pigs to back off!
The mind of rapist, Denaun never changes
Beat up strangers without a reason, I'm a anus
Walk the street in a ""Beat It"" jacket with a glove to match it
Drop the hat shit I put my head on opposite and step backwards
Walkin' zombied it's ornery
Pullin armed robberies on politicians without a sense of camraderie
(Kuniva)
Yo, I can concoct the nine slot, plus I run with the best
Hop on a motorcycle, bustin' wheelies over your chest
Bystanders standin by, thinkin' oh what a mess
Blast through every hickie that them bitches put on your neck
What the fuck do you expect, when the slugs are dealt
And make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz done felt
A deranged team, smokin' ganja greens
This car beam'll make your fuckin' head shake like tambourines
I pledge allegiance to the streets of the D
And if you think you out cold, catch a piece of this heat
And when it blast, it'll take off every piece of your [scream]
From her barettes to her cheeks to her cute little feet
(Bizarre)
STOP TAKIN' DRUGS! I'm tryin'
My little boy is dyin', he losin too much iron
And if I die, it won't be because I got shot
It'll be because I tied my arm in a sock and smoked rock
Takin' drugs is cool, that's why I buy 'em
Shoot 'em up my ass, let your little brother try 'em
Ten years is what I'm facin
Police breakin in my house, Lil' Bow Wow in the basement
(Jermaine!) A rapist that'll bust in your mouth
I'll probably be in jail 'fore this fuckin' album comes out
I'm eighteen years old, still shit in the bed
Beaten till I'm red, fear nothin' but war and bread
It's me again, fuckin' dirty jinn
So what if it burns, bitch when I stick it in
No medication, I'm out of perkasets
I lost my weed, plus my fuckin' diaper's wet
(Eminem)
It's Devil's Night!"

Ayo, I know it's been a minute
But were back!
It's the return of the Dozen Muthafuckers
Lets goooo
(Hook - Eminem)
Fame, fame, fame
I think it's got me going crazy, ooh-ooh
I getting lost in this game, game, game
I'm getting tired of all you naysayers, ooh-ooh
Keep speakin' my name, name, name
And you'll have reason to hate me
Yeah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I'm going in
This the life of a rah
Jager-meister and vodka
Hopping off at the club's balcony into the crowd surfing
And when they drop me, I'm randomly socking fans
During my interviews, hocky masks, left the journalists on her ass
I'm high off Speed, driving my car at high speed
Pocket full of weed while lesbians swollow E
In the studio ignant, my engineer gon' call police
I feel asleep on the sound board, ain't did a song for weeks
And it's ? all up in my head, giving thanks for grateful dead
Bussing in the air with 30 bitches up in my bed
I'm kickin' 'em out naked, and its December
N-ggas ask me why I did it, but f-ck it I can't remember
(Hook - Eminem)
Them boys are wildin'
Drinkin', cussin' and hyper smilin'
Been ridin' for days, tour bus look like Rikers Island
Henny, Jack Daniels, spray painting a die hard fan
Little cocker spaniel, fresh outta the damn zoo
Man you, better be conscious I'm backstage living it up
With a couple of sluts feeling nauseous, drinking
It's been a couple of days since I've slept
My dick is sore from fucking, when I bust there's nothing left
Just Dozen, back on the stage
Give me my microphone
Scrapping with the audience while we perform hyper songs
Our label presented us with a plaque
Brought it on stage, and bash it to pieces with aluminum bats, thanks!
Now which one of you bitches down for the cause
Yeah I said my dick is sore but I ain't say shit about my balls
Last call, then we off to the next city
Whatever I didn't drink on my rider, bag it up and take the rest with me
(Hook - Eminem)
(Eminem)
Yeah this game has got me going crazy
F-ck it I am crazy
What's new, what kind of fucking glue you think I'd be if I was glue
We lost Proof, he was our groups glue but where was you when we were fallin' apart?
You were shittin' on us too
But no one but us knew we were beefing cause that's what happens
When you beef with crew, it stays in your crew
Cause its just crew, but were back now
Yeah we took our time but we punched through
Only thing were in a hurry for now is to rush you
And we back to say shit you don't got the guts or the nuts too
Pussy, go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree, fuck you
Atchooo, bless you
I'm allergic to pussy, sluts too
Yeah you think you're the shit till we flush you
Have some bullshit to readjust to
Now there's just a few of us left but it'd be unjust to rob us our just dues
So Rest In Peace to Bugz and Proof, this ones for you homies we love you
But we can't stop now we'd have too much of our blood drew from this fame"
25,Fight Music,2001,Devil's Night (2001),Hip Hop,D12,"Yo!
(Hook: Eminem)
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know - that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people acting stupid
(Verse 1: Kon Artis)
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smelling like Boone's Farm
Hiding under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own mom
Kuniving Kon, artist with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screaming, ""Let's get it on!""
A lush that love to drink, drunk driving a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slitting your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street, till it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music!
(Verse 2: Bizarre)
You know why my hands are so numb? (No)
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum (oh)
Smacked this whore for talking crap (bitch)
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap!
I fucking hate you; I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you (hell yeah!)
Satan done got me on this song
Eating a hot dog reading the Holy Qu'ran, while I'm on the john
Tired of wearing this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs (thong th-thong thong)
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Fuck your love songs!
(Verse 3: Proof)
Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on?
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen m-16's and one pump
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaws
Have you running out this fucking club in your drawers
We loving the broads, there's nothing to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in us all
It's fight music!
(Verse 4: Swifty McVay)
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the precinct (YOU HEAR THAT!)
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talking
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made them drop his coffin
It's fight music!
(Verse 5: Kuniva)
These beads I'm swinging is stinging them
See all these niggas? When I step in the club, I'm bringing them
If any nigga looking too hard, we Rodney King'n them
Malice green to them and gasolining them with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at them or spit it at them
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him (no!)
Blast while you right hooking, right when your wife's looking
Fuck fight music, bitch, this is losing your life music!
(Verse 6: Eminem)
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it!
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit!
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you Nazis
Watch me, cause you figured you got me in this hot seat!
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me 'cause you're NOT me!
You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me!
I came to save these new generations of babies!
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy!
To grow to praise me I'm making them go crazy!
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me!
And you fugazi if you think I'mma admit wrong!
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm siced on!
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on!
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called!
It's fight music!"

In a rush because I'll fuck in the truckck
I know you used to having your way
Niggas falling over you daily
Sometimes you wanna just do your thang
Let a nigga fuck out your brains
I know you hear it all the time
But you ain't heard it from me
A lot of guys would pay for it
But I get it for free
And I ain't tryna talk you to death
So I'll be brief: if you smoke
Here's a little something for you to chief
See, this movie's getting boring
The Henny got you warm. Plus you looking
Like a stund double for Melissa Boyd
I see you smiling, sexy little glancing
Licking on your lips and you welcome my advances
Pretty Young Thing didn't know she liked it rough
Till she ripped my clothes off and pulled out her
Handcuffs - sho nuff. All over me, so it's only right
That I give it to her like a mad man with a knife
And she's loving it! Scratching me up, push me off
Turned around and started backing me up, that's what
The fuck I be talking about, girl
A freak in disguise, banged her perm out
And left her ass sleeping high
Yellow, you know I know that's wassup

Niggas falling over you daily
Sometimes you wanna just do your thang
Let a nigga fuck out your brains
I see you wyling, hands/legs over me while I'm driving
One of them out the window, 5 miles per hour
Sipping amaretto like a champ, and I""m proud of you!
Still flexible, double-jointed, I can't argue
Everybody staring as you drive through
I continue to pull over to the first curb I find, boo
I take it you wanna be in control
Take it slow, but no dominations on me
Said you wouldn't call me, figured I would talk shit
I love the way we did it in the middle of an argument
I don't play the game, I'm doing what you wanted
Before I told you my name
It's just me, no disrespect. You wearing Donna Karen
And I got on a V-neck
You let it get this way, it'll remain
You got me, I grabbed you, fuck, I love your brains...
Yellow, you know I know that's wassup

Pistol whip a soldier, with a missile on his shoulders
You can fold or blow ya' brick house into some tiny boulders
A grimey older cab will leave you with a tiny odor

My car is right across the street bitch and ... (I'M GONNA GET MY GUN!)

Betta' watch miscountliss, slugs imma send
Watch you hollow when the hollow tips go threw you're skin

When I cock back might put the door on you're friends
Make a run, gotta him, bust a slug on his chin
Ain't going no were like the drugs outta Kim
I'm a psycho icon, a mightful might bomb
Get a eye full of lid when I slight you're lights out
With a street cleaner, whipe you're life out
Bullets know at you're ears, like a Tyson fight bout

You ain't ready for war, Runyan ain't nothing to play with!

Walk to Rite-Aid for a can of speghetti
It's been one hour and bitch my photo's ain't ready
Picture's of my dog and my family reunion
It's been two hours and my fucking days ruined
Hey ""Kate"" do you wanna get raped?
Have my pictures on fucking Philips 38
That's why I don't be fucking battle rapping
'Cause every time I lose, this is what the fuck happens (Gun shots)
Back to these pictures I was trying to get developed
This man tried to get in front of me, I wouldn't let him
I'm ready to blow this bitches brains out
I'm nervous, I farted, some shit came out
Times up, shot her with a gun
Got on my cell phone and called Rev. Run
And all this crazy shit I, regret it...
All because I wanted to see Elton John naked"

Ayo dog
I got some shit on my motherfuckin chest that
I need to get off 'cause
If I don't
I'ma fucking explode or somethin'
Now look
This is the story about
Some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this
It's so easy for me to make enemies anymore it's sickenin
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shit list
Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in a position that
I don't wanna be in shit
I never had beef with you corny son of a bitches
But now this shit is broke and you can't do nothin' to fix it
So I'm telling you right now
Motherfucker Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real
B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin
See he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'da never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpacking cyphering name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin'
I'da never involved you
But you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shit list and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known
That song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV
Now look who's mentionin me
That little fuckin' weasle, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props on that song you on national TV
Talking 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
Talkin' 'bout how bad you hate him
Now you all in his thong
What's wrong, you scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin' sissy
Up on stage screaming how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act
And don't call me kissin' my ass
'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song
I'm trying to prewarn you
Lethal, when I fuckin' see you dawg, I'm swingin' on you
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw
Up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all are some
Girls (y'all are some God damn girls)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies
You pussies keep talkin' shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, ha)
How fuckin' cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentleys
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down
Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
Now see if you diss me and I respond
The beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show I'll strip you naked
See I was smart
I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot, like I'll fight for Kim
All of them been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all my dawgs from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Melman
Till I'm hoist away
In my coffin
I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I never give a fuck
I won't ever be interested
Love me or hate me
As much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I've stated
The shit that I been through
My pencil never could pencil
But I won't ever be this gullible ever again, no
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin off me
I'm not bein cocky
I just know when somebody's mockin me
I stick up my middle finger
He sticks up his finger
I say fuck Christina
He says fuck Christina, but meaner
So from doin' a song with Method
To beggin to get accepted
I'm peggin Fred
With the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin' you up punk
You're dead
Don't think that I'm playin'
And fuck Bizkit
'Cause I know you're sayin' fuck D12
Only not to our face, under your breath, and to yourselves
Little
Girls (motherfucking females)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fucking sissies
You pussies keep talking shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (now we all know the truth)
How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')

And I won't put you in 'em
And that's it
That's all there is to it dawg
If you don't wanna do the fuckin' song
Don't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin MTV
Talking about Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dawg
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford
That's it
That's all you had to fuckin' say
I wouldn't a said shit
I woulda backed off
Did the motherfuckin song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it
That's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckingyou up shit when I see you
And I will see you, too
Oh, and by the way, Fred

Hands around our colt handles, hold them like roman candles
Vannas vo vannas, banana fanna fo fannas

Managers, bouncers and the club owners, the motherfuckers don't want us
To come up and rush in the club and run up in it with a bunch of
Motherfuckers from Runyon, steady poppin' them onions,
Ready set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixin to get into some shit just itchin to choke someone up

Yeah Yeah oh, what up, see my people throw shit up

And automatically explode on motherfuckers until they mouth be closed permanently

Tempt me if you think Swifty won't send a slug, people run,
When the reaper comes, the repercussions' gon' leak your blood,

Snatch you out our home, like eviction notices hoe,

At the toll, when I'm sober I'm prone to roll up and disconnect your soul, *****.

Grippin' the pump and who wanna fuck with a walking psychopathic
Pyromaniac shady cats with 80 gats
And maybe that's the reason that you gon' get it the worst a
And since you jumpin' in front of everybody you gon' get it first
I disperse the crowd with something vigor and versatile
So go on and record you verses now while you got a mouth,
And it's not a joke, it's some kind of riddle,
Kunizzle will lift up a 12 gizzle and throw a party from my acquittal,
And a glock that ? stop you from walking,

They wouldn't have TRIED that shit if I was witchu
Maybe we would've, picked another time or, maybe chose another way
Or maybe my prayers would've convinced Him to, choose another soul
Shiiit, it's just me and man Tony now
Man, you look so peaceful right now
How can I argue with that?
They say that the good die young
(Hook: Kon Artis)
They say that the good die young (die young)
That's why I think that you should have fun (when you're young)
Cause time won't wait for no one (uh-huh)
When God calls, you gotta go home (go home)
They say the good die young (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun (huh?)
In this life 'Cause, you only get one
When God call for me don't cry, I just went home
(Kon Artis)
I'm sure that everybody heard their momma say it be days like this
When you see, one of your friends die in the mist
In the struggle, into the circumstances
A risk that they take, just to prove a point to a friend
Even then, accidents are prone to happen
To any man or woman that's dumb enough to pretend it
Huh, God will hold 'em accountable for sins
That they commit and they try to repent the sins to repent
But I guess that's the way things go
I was blessed to see twenty-four
To wake up to that ""Hi, My Name Is"" video
Motivated me to write what I wrote
And I knew my little brother sold dope
And mom and daddy wanted to move our row
I did it, I still got a lot to prove and show
I just wish we ain't have to lose Bugz through the struggle
Cause you know
(Bizarre)
I know you used to Bizarre on some silly shit
But niggas in my clique, is dying quick (for real)
In Detriot, niggas don't party
They pull a fo'-fo' out, snatch off Ducartis
That's why I keep the pistol under the truck
I'm 27 years old, too old to be getting jumped
And fuck rap, I miss Karnail Pitts
B-U-G-Z, tatted on my wrist
Me and you in the jeep, listen to scream-o beats
It's a shame me and Fuzz don't even speak
I got married, my wife name is Dee
Peace to 31, and 5150 bitch
(Kuniva)
I think back on that tragic day my phone rung
And Bizarre's voice telling me Bugz was going home
It was like a knife piercing my chest and I couldn't breathe
I didn't wanna accept it, didn't wanna believe it
I swear, at his wake dog I cried so hard
Literally, Denaun had to carry me to the car
While I stand in this booth now, it's tearing me apart
But I had to let it out cause it was tearing at my heart
'Cause he died over something so petty and so small
A human life is so very precious, I hope y'all
Understand how I'm feeling 'cause I love you Bugz
I wanna rhyme with you, laugh with you, hug you Bugz
But I can't, and you were so close to see your dreams
A coward came along and took you away from the team
So don't mistake this track as just another song
This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one
Cause you know
(Proof)
They say it's never too late to have an early childhood
If I could turn back the hands of time, God should
Forgive what I did as a kid that run blocks
Now my dreams is just scream ""Cops"" and gunshots
The fun stops when your homies up in the box
My duty Bo, rest assure, snuffed by the cops
I used to court shit a lot, if there's a guy I'd probably say something
If you love him so much why ain't you gave nothing?
But he took my homie's slippers only in eleventh grade
Now I hope to see his face at the Heaven gates
It ain't never late in the game, Satan remains
With a grudge to see slugs break through my frame
My heart aches with the pain, the light limits breath
We got to have fun now, there's only minutes left
And in death cause stress young'uns is sucked in
To get tats for my fallen homies, I ain't got enough skin
Miss y'all!
(Swift)
When I was younger I knew four brothers that wasn't wise
That crashed and the driver died, my partner on the passenger side was paralyzed
And I'm surprised by the look of that ride, that the other two survived
Nine months later, another one dies
Somebody shot him in his side when he was starting up his ride
Three years go by, I made a hell of a run
And that's when Funky got done, Joey playing with guns
And Tookie over funds, Cardie was my man
And Reggie, I wish that I was with you in that van
And Bugz, if it wasn't for you
You know I wouldn't be standing in this booth
And that's the truth, I miss y'all"

Pick it up, call me
How Come... we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine... We even Beefin Now
After all the years we been down... ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true
We Family... ain't a damn thing changed... unless it's you!
We were so young
So full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it.
You even had the same type of childhood I did...
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us...
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises.
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it. you're cold
Your touch is just like ice.
And your eyes is a look of resentment.
I can sense it and I don't like it.
How Come... we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more

It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some
Worthless bitch that I wasn't with
I woulda hit it and quit
But you were fitting to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her
Stumbling half drunk
Like you were husband and wife or somethin'
But me catching her fuckin' other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
Cause you were openin your mouth to people like you wanted with me.
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty.
And every sister, fares and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose.
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth.
Don't hate the game or the player
The one that's changing is you.

Its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block.
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch
Get ta speaking all rude. fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin
And poof it just happen.
But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown,
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home.
See the devil in your glance,
Since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intellegence,
That's forever till the end.
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies,
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise.
(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away,
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.

Oh this life's too hard where are you god, your child is coming home,
Lord I've tried to stay but there's no way I can fight carry on,
If I die today please find a way to keep my family strong,
I am gone.
Verse 1 (Swifty McVay)
I'm a soldier that's been haunted by Satan,
I'm gonna hold a Calibur straight to my cranium,
Created as the angriest baby since Damien,
I'm grown and my family hate me, psychopathic majorly,
Drama persona, spirit Bio-hazard,
I create Bastards caskets for grandads,
A ??? seedless hospital???
The child of a wild family, dark cloud on top of the roof,
There's nothing to lose, cabinet full of booze,
And 2's that get rid of who don't understand my views,
The news destroy me, not trusted,
A null employee, busted from holding a gun to the customer,
They must got an APB and I been beating my wife twice as much since she seen me on TV,
An outcast, that's haunted because my past done had it,
So when you gonna cap my Ass Mother*****
Verse 2 (Bizarre)
Heroin Addict, crack heads gone wild,
2 years using, 2 years in denial,
??? Straight from the drug centre, timberlands, yellow thong in the middle of winter,
Like where the F*** am I going?
Who knows its snowing,
2 days from now my girl will be out here hoeing,
For my little girls birthday I promised her a bike,
But I also promised myself a pint,
Can't see me, ain't washed my ass in a week,
I smell like feet, face full of Taco meat,
I ain't F***** my wife, since our wedding night,
Viagras, can't even give me a hard pipe,
F*** it, give me a F***** long knife,
In 2 minutes, I'll take my own f***** life,
Leave my fishing rods to my son and my car to my girl and F*** it,
I'm a say goodbye to the world.
Verse 3 (Kuniva)
Yo, I'm life F*** the jokes I need revenue,
So when I Hail, (get the F*** down)
That's what you better do,
I didn't want to resort to bringing out the guns,
Or breaking in your savings wiping out all of your funds,
But I'm a dollar away from being homeless,
So late night I'm drunk and roaming mouth foaming (grrr)
I ain't seen my kids in years,
My wife left somewhere between the coke, grief and beer,
Now that I'm stuck staying in hotels with rats and roaches,
You eating a steak and I'm stealing cakes from hostess (I'm out)
Man I'll be damned if I be out on these streets,
Watching mo'F***** riding round laughing at me,
I'm a strong arm a school teacher,
Stick up a few preachers, (uh)
Jack you for two pizzas, (give me that)
Give me some new sneakers,
I stuck the wrong kid he pulled out a few heaters,
I hear a voice calling me I hope it's you Jesus."

Pole pose a shit and his arms a break your both of them
And I'm a dash faster than locomotive
I can trespassing a ram shaking murder your families and it ain't no closure
I cast snatcher, I stop all type of transactions
When I get back on the block these niggers mashing
I got the world in my palm and I'm a smash it
Sprinkle the ashes in the atmosphere
I'm just an animal, pass it enough to grab the back of your neck
And stuff your face in a half of cake
Force you to take a breath, I care less of who you be
Or what you be for the community
We taking it over I'm on the shootin' spree
Time and time again I get it, speak your hustling I get it
I get I, what? I get it, what? I get it, yes I get it

Continue to take the 5th and I ain't going to court
Then life an outlaw on the run, what she send to do
I ever get caught I'm a...
Just for me splittin' and everyday ... 74 stitches
Just for me (?) your blood bleeds your ass, I'm a a show what a ... do
Nigga you don't wanting with me then I ain't shitting with you
Up top d cap one and black tees no holster, 30 round clip the black squeeze
Versus smell roof, looking like black cheese
I'm backing these rap niggers up with a rap sheet

Act yo all punches Mayweather swag
Mike Tyson attitude, Ali Jab
Back at the lab, cookin' up shit
Fucking yellow pages you ain't looking up shit

Suck everybody's dick you ain't got no choice
I ain't T-Pain but I put something on your boys

Trick trick and D12, click click and see shells

And god forbid if I ever get shot
Give me 6 Vicodin and Michael jack son's
Bizarre, Bitch!
(Verse 4: Kuniva)
It's best to shut your mouth up
Bullets flying through your window
Hit your pitbull, split your sister and your sponsor
Gotta keep the hustle going, I said he fucking know me
Hollows rip your shirt like Hulk Hogan when it's nothing showing
We on the paper route, if he ain't talking right, take him out
I don't need cameras when I... your mouth
Get your patron mob, Trick Trick boom squad
D 12 loonie chop, shooting from the roof top
Gotta keep the green up, you can tell I'm seeing stuff
Making mess with you the corner player cleaned up
Do it for the gusto, what up doh

G-Unit in da house! What up baby
Performin' live tonight live on stage... Captain Save-A-Hoe
And the fabulous Case y'all, stick 'em out y'all
All my Detroit players, let's go!
(Chorus - Kon Artis)
I ain't set the stroke and I ain't for games
I just came to fuck and maybe get some brain
I got a woman at the crib so I ain't your man
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
You know all I really wanna do is fuck. I ain't
Gon' let a money hungry women set me up
And if you think I'm that stupid you done pressed your luck
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
(Kon Artis)
You gave right, yes I love menage-a-trois
And I got drawers as big as guys's big ""wah""
I'm a Trick Daddy nigga, so bitch how you figure
That I wouldn't turn my niggaz on to you when I hit ya
I probably could forget ya if I hadn't been drunk
But choke a dunkadunk, keep my mind on hump
When my mind's on hump to me my .9's in the trunk
And Denaun got a line for every fine bitch I hunt
Not once, twice, but three times the lover
That your man is, and I'm a freak undercover
I got plans for you, trick, I don't need a baby mother
I got five of them motherfuckers tryin' to smother me already
We can't go steady, but you can give me head
Give me that, get the hell out my bed, and leave the shit
My chap lips will cut nipples when breast fed
And on the way, leave the bread with Achman (?)
I'd love for you to stay but I got another date
With a fat chick that eat cake on playskates
She rubbed my funky ass feet and feed me grace
Plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape
(Swift)
I'ma make this one thing clear
Ain't no woman hear gon' ruin my career
All the hell you doin' is pursuin' a dream
That's when you find out that life ain't truly what it seems
All these hoes be lyin', bullshittin' each other
And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber
He might as well have went and told the hoe that he love her
I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother
Or my wife, and my sisters. So motherfuck a mistress
They signin' a contract before these bitches hit this
Never will a woman take me out that way
I keep a RCA camera in there motherfuckin' face
(Bizarre)
What's your name again? It doesn't matter
My name is Bizzy, a bodygaurd for Mr. Mathers
Sit down girl. Let me get you a drink
I'ma buy you a mink, and rape you in the sink
From day one, I knew you was a hoe
I put a rubber on my toe and fucked you some mo'
Turn around, let me see your nasty ass
Put on a Jason mask while I take off your maxi pads
(Kuniva)
These hoes be on some bullshit. Always tryin' to pull shit
Outta they ass. Get mad and put you on blast
Tell 'em bitches how she fucked you
Sucked you, put it on you, boned you
Yappin' off with they mouth sayin' she loved you
All on your dick, callin' your phone, spazzin' and shit
Havin' a fit until you feel like callin' it quits
Then she starts callin' your chick
Wantin' to fight. Everytime you show up at a gig
She front row with her friends. Flippin' you off
Follow you to the bar, the bathroom
The parkin' lot, to the car, pissin' you off
Until you blackout, now you and the hoe is havin' a scrapout
You get locked up for assault and now you asked out"

I love getting shit started
I instigate a peace talk into a beef talk
Until police need chalk to chalk you up
Have bitches walking up
Smacking you in your face screaming that you talk too much
Tell women you said you fucked 'em
Tell the hardest nigga you said you snuck him
Raid his pockets and stuck him
Till they gather in front of your crib
Guns and ??? clips
Laughing when they shoot at you over the wrong shit
I lock down your block with lies
It's so believable
You run and grab your shotguns, glocks, and nines
Walking blind
Incite fights until they erupt
Instigate my own death 'cause killing you ain't enough

I don't give a fuck if we beefing or not
I squeeze first

On these streets everyday
Snatching nigga's lle'

Liable to leave you strapped with your Bible

My bullets won't fly by you
You wanna kill me?

Guns are a part of me
I pack more than pottery
I oughtta be jailed for depicted mockery
Ain't gon' fight
The blood on the niggas that shot at me
I don't twist the truth
I just make it gothic, see?
I'm nothing but a liar
With a big ass mouth, dick, and fists
Big enough to knock your bitch ass out
Got no reason to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you
I rap with him
But I don't like Proof

Me and Swift got plans to jump you
Type of nigga to shake your hand and stomp you

Convinced a tenth grader

Nigga just pick up the kids
Swift got first dibs
On these cherry hot slugs
That'll barbeque your ribs
I'm preparing death beds
Quick to bust lead
While I'm staring at the feds
Tearing off their legs
Once you drop dead
They'll be swearing it's a plague
I'm sicker than a coke
Watch the ???????? with dreds
You could shake if you move
Ditch with no clue
Don't put shit on your tape
With your skits and interludes

They wouldn't put it in the news

Throwin' fire bombs down your chimney
While you eatin' at Wendy's
I'm in your bushes cockin' the semi
Nice wit the hands
Never bow down to another man

Smother your clan
Sever your hands and your legs
Mail your brother your heart and send your mother ya head!
(Verse 2 - Swifty)
I'm the only one your bitch let touch her
Type of brother that will fuck your mother
With a fishnet rubber
A belligerent and rowdy mothafucka
That'll dump your body and still fly away to Maui on the teller
When it comes to beefin'
It ain't no explainin'
I'll change your language wit a stainless
I'm contained wit a anguish to leave your famous
I'm a deranged pit y'all lift an AK to pinch ya face wit
Niggas don't say shit fuck your hype man if it's a bystander standin' by I'm firin' at ya, 'cause I can
You get squashed like pop cans
I be shootin' 7-Up in your mouth man
I'm about to sell your mama bud, and lace it

I love to see 'em wasted
I'm made to behave in this case
You try to be brave in this rage and your legs will be replaced!

The first time I had sex... a dirty mattress
No condom... my grandmother... bent over backwards
Bizarre been fuckin' raw all summer

I got Schoolcraft at your doorway, we gon' hit the hinges off your doorway
For shallow tips and slugs, to put up in your mug
Every n***a on your team already been plugged
I'm in to breakin' necks, not in to fightin' scrubs
I ain't got no love, D12, ridin' for Bugz
Got hollow tips and slugs, to put up in your mug

Ha...
Y'all ain't seein' Shady Records, what the f*** you thought this was?
You beefin' with G-Unit, they gon' throw you out the club
You try to front on Obie, you gon' have to see a slug
If you f*** with Dirty Dozen we be killin' who you love, we above you bitch n***as
'Cause y'all been kissin' ass so long your not a man, your mama just gave birth to a thong
It hurts when I'm around and worse when I'm gone
I smother ya, label me ""murder"", ""dirt coverer"", slash ""hersh burgular""
Your ass'll burn more than a lab spilled with acid
And ain't gon' be goin' further than that drastic ass-kick
N***as gettin' clowned, we dick pissin', they caught pissin' sittin' down
I'll snatch your wrenches, so bitches can cancel Christmas
It ain't no color shit, so f*** wearing trenches, you swimming with the fishes
I don't need a mask, I'll leave pictures in your kitchen
I leave a n***a linched for even mentionin' a mission
And all of the attention gon' be sent back to your henchmen, and they give different pigment
I can't keep it lyrical, once you walk the streets they'll consider n***as ""missing"", it's all apart of beef
I keep beaters all around me, aproach me and start it, they won't eat
I'll have you stealin' out of grocery markets, hoes just be retarted
Supposed to be the hardest, but the only thing they smart at is posing as a target
Y'all think y'all heat could stop McVay, y'all see me y'all ain't got shit to say
Y'all creep, y'all peeps, y'all streets was deep, D12 don't give a f*** about you anyway...

Yo,
Now when n***as get to babblin', bullets get to travelin'
Have 'em on some Judgement Day, Jesus and Heaven sh**
Send your body flyin' through the air like a javelin
On some Manson shit and I ain't talkin' about ""Marylin""
You know Kuniva, ***** I'll be rowdy as f***,
Run up on you with a gauge and blow you out of your truck
And I ain't no John Goddy, more like a sawed shotty
I don't wear minks, I wear full length dead bodies
Whattup do'? I don't play cards, I'm real cutthroat
Take the finest bitch that you datin' and run a busto
Hot shots settlin' inside your stomach now it's simmerin'
Bullets calm hype n***as down better than Ritalin
You little son of a bitch, packin' one in a clip, you always runnin' your lip
You probably born with a clit...
""I'm the king of this muthaf***a, we run sh**, been runnin' it
We been gettin' money around here...""
""F*** y'all n***as, this First Born, n***as...""

Now how the f*** you gon' act like Proof is just dizzy?
Everybody know me I'm the truth in the city
You don't want me against ya, the inventor of beef, turn the streets of the D against ya
P-Pis-P-pistol, pulverizin' the punks, period, provin' the P-power, it's painful
Fuck your energy, your plain flow, I stay cold,

Ayo'
I'm goin' up that henny low cleaved and he smoked
Till he's soaked and covered in blood and without a penny broke
I never was a mathematician, the class division bored me
I was snoring, dreamt of being a graphic villain
And caps we peeling, re-mash admission
Leave your face looking like a fatal crash collision
Blast the 5th and, dip out or throw you in the trunk
And like an old white lady's butt your ass is missing (nigga!)
You can compare me to Rick Ross in some ways (Boss!)
Cause whenever you see the Boss you're going to see Gun Play
Put the torch in your face and Daffy Duck your grill up
This ain't Call of Duty, grab the Uzi, get your kills up
Niggas be rolling, plus they claim they're sitting on grams
But they never tell you their fucking Grams are Golden
I'm so serial, I'll let the cannon Bussa Bus
In any Scenario, bitch, what the dealio?
I could take the hardest sack and turn it to a kiddy show
If I find you fucked like hide and go giddy yo
I am so vivid, let the bullets play hide and go get it
When I am pissed off, I am so livid
And niggas can't fuck with us, new niggas or old ones
Fill your homies with hot hollows and grab a cold one
Who next flexing? I lift my two hands up
A tech in each one, and you can forward this text message
(Bizarre)
Y'all know Bizarre's going to say some crazy shit (Y'all know!)
Shade45 gon' play this shit, I'm amazing, BITCH!
I'm the best rapper ever
Get on stage in spandex and a tight ass leather (Damn!)
Lace weed, cocaine joints
Stop looking for Bin Laden, Bin Laden stay in Detroit
Brain froze, can't feel my toes
All I need is an eight ball, and a picture of Amber Rose (Kanye!)
20 thousand, Delonte West can fuck my mother
50 thousand, he can sodomize my brother
Elton John said he's a celibic fag (what's a celibic fag?)
A fag that don't like dick in his ass (wow)
Gay or straight, fuck it, we all going to heaven
So put on some skinny jeans, and tongue kiss John Legend
I'm bout to go to Canada, I can't wait
Tell bitches I know Drake and get my asshole ate
Eating pussy, naw, that ain't cool
But what's cool is eating ass hair with food
I'm a rude dude, Ruder then Jude
Baby face, NWA attitude (Fuck the police!)
And I smell food, time to eat
Pinky porno on, time to beat (I'M BOUT TO BUST!)
Wife went to work, time too cheat
In jail for rape, somebody call reap, I'm a freak!
(Swift)
No surviving this poisonous hybrid
You bitches skating on thin ice and falling inside of it
I am a human piranha, with a murderous persona
I'll drown a nigga inside his own saliva and blood
The mental asylum kicked me out of it, it wasn't enough
I need a higher, more maniacal place to call a club
I'm a cutthroat, a nasty old animal
That'll crack a nigga fast as pistachios and mozzel tov
I stomp a nigga for being soft
See I'm just a dog that opened his mouth and broke the fucking muzzle off
I'm coming for your boss, at any cost
Here, watch this moss eat through his clothes like a mothball
I'm not y'all, stab a nigga with rusty daggers
Give him lock jaw, where they can't open their trap
Imagine what hack saws could do to these rap frauds, you ain't thugging
They should be knocking on wood like Jim Duggan
I'm hugging this Glock, I'mma squeeze like an anaconda
That's standing on your block I'll blast any bandana that I see
I'll beat you with your own I.V. in a 'spital
I'll put a pillow over that widdle to squeeze
I've been a heathen, see I was my momma's mistake
A born tyrant, I'm bombing where ever you bastards hibernate
They contemplate on killing me, I'm in the D' living it
I'm at the shooting range, and busting before I'm in that bitch"
42,Leave Dat Boy Alone,2004,D12 World (2004),Hip Hop,D12,"(Chorus: Eminem)
Y'all better leave dat boy alone
'Cause if they don't
You know they goin' come back on 'em
And they don't want him to come back strong
I wouldn't durr get that boy goin'
I said leave dat boy alone
'Cause y'all don't know him
That there boy he out cold
And that there boy he been known
To stirr some shit up when he in that zone
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
'Cause you don't want to get that boy goin'
(Verse 1: Swift)
It's my attitude that's makin' me bust shit
I hate to be fucked with
So basically niggas wastin they time tryin' to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Returnin bows 'fore you be lookin' at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
Witha mag and I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation I run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her mouth to gun ressecitation
A niggas information, they hunted and they sad
Got you mad 'cause they shittin through their stomach in a bag
We comin' too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancin
Comin' here is the worste mistake that could ever happen
When I'm in my vehicle I'm pullin you in
I guarantee the world will never see you again
(Verse 2: Kon Artist)
Honest to god I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain somethin' to ya
A real street nigga ain't tryin' to get in the streets
He's tryin' to get out, feel me?
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb hoe punk
Atleast a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
This nigger dyin' over prizes to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I don't play deep
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's wrong that you hoes thinkin' you can't really get sleep
'Cause you laid a nigga down without any meat
Well my cops wont allow me to make decisions in vein
I'm a magne I do my biddin and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever
(Verse 3: Kuniva)
Now people I live triflin I express it through writin
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fightin
And I jus bought me a new gauge and added on a knew knife
And I strike people so fast people think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few height men
Been harassed by two dykes who wanted (?lou pikner)
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whilin
'Cause as soon as you drivin' I'm a spit a few 5 ones
And I love to Kunive son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, skinny or wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You lookin' for hoes, and up in here you goin' find none
You niggas get dropped once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stuck till your eyes shut
No time for the wild ones, I'm writin these five words
FUCK YOU DICK RIDIN' NIGGAS count it, it's five words.

(Swifty McVay)
You don't me, McVay and I doubt if you understand me
Why would I give a fuck about you if we ain't family?
I roll with a chosen few, and those of you that's behind me
Witness the most potest' ferocious niggas that rhyme
These bitches turn they back on you, actin' like they ain't did shit
When you rappin' never mix business up with your friendship
If you lackin' up in this jungle, then what you breathe fo'?
Niggas don't love you, you got habits of breaking street codes
Far as static, I automatically get medieval
When I'm after people, then I'll explode you bitches with C-4
These hoe's, have no insurance, bodies get repo'
Making you vanish even when we ain't got our heat close
Keepin' .44's where you're hoes are swallowing deep throat
If you owe me dough then you know you falling asleep, close
Niggas pupils that's what I do, I'm foolish will shoot you
'Cause I'm coo-coo, But I don't think niggas can take in heat tho'
(Kon Artist)
See I'm a man, and a man's gon' do what he gotta do
And he ain't really family if he ain't loyal to you
If they was really soldiers then they would do what we do
And be loyal to crew and crew was loyal to you
(Bizarre)
I don't give a fuck, I'm quick to blaze chronic
Smoke on so much green, use twelves and super-sonic
Bizarre pack guns and knives, put to dick to 'Nuns and Wifes
Now who the fuck want to fight?
Ain't nobody fucking with me, Ain't nobody fucking with the D'
They get beat like a M-P
You heard about Bizarre taking all them drugs
You heard about Proof wil'ing in the clubs
You heard about that nine that Eminem packs
You diss us, you get your fucking face cracked
I'm from 7 Mile and stout, I'll shoot up you're house
Next day, I'll pee in your mouth...
(Obie Trice)
Aiyyo, loyalty's first, all the bullshit second
I showed you on the record, Cheers to who respect it
Most of these niggas neglect it
Even though it's a known method
From the hectic hood that you slept in
You wanna' be an exception
That's when the weapon is leaving you're half stepping
With that 'caine in you're left hand
Obie from a section that'll stain up you're flesh and
Have you on bare breast
Questionin' you're affection for streets
D-Twizzie no question
One of the best groups that done it
And Obie is their reflection
Lil' homey that know slowly that loyalty is reckin'
D-Twizzie fo' life, Obie Trice is second...
(Proof)
Which one of you niggas wanna' be ?boltion? bump heads
When I got a passion for clappin'...with one hand
Talent's on my roster this mobster's in dump land
Send a gangsta to sleep two by two like bunk beds
Never leave the crib without packing my black burner
On some T. Ali rapper to merk a have murder
Incorporated, Hitman Harry is at you're service
Reach for me one more gain' and that's closed
For life as D12, no ice and spreewells
Every night that I chill in, I fight by free-will
Knowing I can be killed
Leaving my group, pieces of proof with a reason to shoot
And a license to kill
We lost Bugz and I'll be damed if we loose another man from our clan
Without forcing our hand
Escorting your family, I'll torture you're granny
For my niggas, I'm on your motherfucking porch with a 'Cammy

Yo its funny how niggas get caught along (and get bombed on)
Knocking teeth in back of your throat (and break your jaw bone)

Pass me a cigarrete quick (shit is finna' get thick)
Yo' man I'll get split (by a brutal and critical hit)
With identical dent (or bullets with identical prints)

You were supposed to make it with me (You were supposed to be there)
Lord I don't know what to say but plead
Mrs. Pitts I'm sorry

Karnail Pitts will never never die
As long as I'm breathing and my groups still alive
And I can't lie I miss my nigga
Every time I see Belle Isle and Detroit River
Mrs. Pitts you done lost two sons
Proof dying that's like the 3rd one
And I wanna thank you for showing up to my court cases
Standing in front of the judge three years I'm facing
Told me to be proud and dry my tears
Be a grown man and show no fear
We all love driving, reminiscing about how me you and Proof used to go fishing
I wanna give you a call but I don't know what to say
That's why I get on my knees every night and I start to pray
Drive down 6 Mile I circle your block

Now every Saturday after shop
You gave me props I gave you props too
Respected each other and as time grew
He always took the time to ride through
And ask me if I had a verse ready to rock at St. Andrews
And as for you I'm sorry we never took the time to see you
When we got signed we came up to your job
Now that was a long time ago
I thought I'd let you know that you was on my mind
Through this rhyme I apologize
(Verse 3: Kuniva)
As time goes on and the pain starts to easy up
Just know your son's memory will never leave us
And you can call on us if you ever need us
Cause life's road is full of hard knocks and speed bumps
You so strong and I wish you the best
I wish you more stress so you can pass life's test
If you feel like you drowning we'll be your life vest
I had to get it off of my chest

I don't know, dude...
I think everybody's all jealous and shit...
'Cause, I'm like, the lead singer of a band, dude...
And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me, dude...
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because...
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
:
So I get off stage right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby
They're all like ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fuckin' God, it's Eminem
I swear to fuckin' God, dude, you fuckin' rock
Please won't you please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my A Capella's
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Because I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, baby yeah!

Hey dad how come we don't rap off Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no, I'm Swift (""Oh, I thought you was Kuniva"")
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room?
Cause our shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, (uh-huh) it's simple but,
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back
:
Kuniva: Look at Em, little punk ass, thinkin' he the shit
Kon: Yeah, I know, man, by himself takin' on a flick
Kuniva: Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
Eminem: No I had an interview, not you two
Kuniva: You gonna be late for sound check
Kon: Man I ain't goin' to sound check
Kuniva: Man our mics are screwed up
Kon: And his always sound best.. You know what man I'ma say somethin'
Kuniva: Hey yo, Em
Eminem: You got somethin' to say
Kon: Man, nothin'
Kuniva: I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man, what's up
Kon: Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it man shut up. And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be crew
Kuniva: Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
Kon: Man, whatever
Kuniva: I swear man
These chicks don't even know the name of my band,
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands,
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man,
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
:
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Eminem: Hey yo, what's....)
Ready to snap on a dumb ass fan
Every time I hear
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys actin' funny every area code
(Eminem: Proof, carry my bag)
Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(""Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!"")
:
God dammit, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Till Kon Artis, slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video, I was in the back
Superman video, I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
Bitch, are you retarded
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up (Uhh!)
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout start a group with the real Roxanne
:
Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name
Man, fuck this
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (ha ha)
But they all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)

And bust in the soap dish

You done sucked a senior citizen's old dick
Go spit (damn)

Talking all that hoe shit
All aggressive asking for a slow kiss

To have eight of my kids
Shit, bitch
I should be locked up
For having honies' legs cocked up
In the back of my pop's truck
I'm not fucked up
I just got a fetish for shooting
Cumm in coochie
Till the pussy is pooting it back out
I 69'd this one bitch and she bled in my mouth (shit)
Kicked her out
Cleaned the couch out
And beat up my clout
I don't gotta creep in motels
I cheat at my house
See I'm a dog
I don't need to keep a secret hide out (naw)

Your age and where you're from

Dreams of fucking a handicapped bitch
Suck my dick while your teeth start to grit (whore)
Inner slave, that's how I want you to treat me
I ain't into S&M
But I love when you beat me
I told you I was a horny ass freak
While I'm beating my meat

You my bitch
(Proof)
I do spit game
No longer than my name
There where my chain hang
My nuts do the same
Don't pay pussy
Pussy pay me
Bitch, slut, hoe, my lady
And knowing the fact I was born to mac
That's why I got a hoe in the back
Blowing my sack
Got good game
It's a hood thang
Got a huge brain
Loot of pootang
But I'm all bank
Run that cheese
Tell that trick nigga (come back please)
I'm a L-7 that's a square
You my bottom hoe
You gotta know
Off to a plan to make a lot of dough
So suck fast bitch and swallow slow
Bitch quit talking back
Now walk the track
(Kon Artis)
I don't pay for ass
You pump my gas
You get slapped for a short of cash
I get whip lashed when I hit the gas
And holler out the window with a hash
Where's my scratch?
Bitch, that's it
Suck it, stroke it, make me rich
'Cause a token of my appreciation it's
Another client for you to hit
I don't give a fuck if you gotta go home to the kids
You shoulda picked another occupation trick
You stuck with me
Fuck with me and I'm a smack you up in this truck
You must have lost your mind or something
Crying and whining like you dying and suffering
Go suck some head for an extra buck (or something)
You know what
You made nothing
I'm just another case of a lazy husband
(Kuniva)
I want the paper stacked
Buy you an outfit it
Then take it back
When you page me bitch I never page you back
You only act a certain way that I make you act
Hoes recognize and niggas do too
'Cause they realize that niggas who shoot
Don't like a chick that act too cute
Bitch hold my gat down when I shoot hoops
And don't be asking me all kind of questions
All harassing me calling stressin
Or I may have to release some aggression
And beat you to death and
Teach you a lesson
Looking for handouts
Like you my damn spouse
Pull your pants down
And fuck my man's now
Shut your damn mouth
Or get in the damn house
Open the damn blouse
And suck on my damn crouch
(Chorus: Eminem (Dina Rae))

Fuck it I'll let you hear one of my victims
(Somebody help, I'm on Seven Mile and Muriel)
Shut up bitch you talk too much
And about to get fucked in your dirty butt
Never seen a pimp like me out here whoring
Shut your fucking mouth and you'll be out by the morning
'Cause I'm the dirtiest pimp you ever heard of
Give me my 5000 and take this cheeseburger (bitch)

And there you have it goddammit
The fundamentals of pimping

From the dirtiest dozen you've ever seen in your goddamn life
Well this is Rondell Beene on the scene
And we keep the pussy hole smiling
Because we always wilding
You know what I'm saying?
Fuck what everybody else be talking 'bout
We letting you know right here
That pimping it ain't dead
We love getting head
In dirty ass bed
That's just what we do
You know we were throwing hip heroin parties back in 1968
The pussy is all great

I say the type of shit parents slit they wrist to

Need an anthem to amp you then this the shit to

To many enemies on my list to sift through

Nobody got my back in this bitch but this tool

Sorry officer I don't care how pissed I get you

But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

Nigga we violently active
So fuck with us
See I'm backwards
I slap niggaz and punch bitches
Just for askin
They must have been wanting to meet the lord
When my parents talked to me they got mean mugged and ignored
They was snoopin trough my closet
Seein drugs on the floor
Shells from the forty four scattered over they porch
Bussin pistols in your windows with intentions to destroy you
Tryin' to break your neck to conversate
Bitch, I l do it for you
Catch me laughin' at your funeral when they lower you
You and your hoe
You got's to go
Bitches died slow and horrible
There's no tomorrow fo any nigga
We'll shower you
We young strapped and powerful
And I ain't gotta lie to you
(Proof)
Stepped in the door wavin the fo fo
Blazin' at popo
Escapin and lay low
They call my tongue yayo
But I spit fire
I lit five inside a fuckin' dickrider
The clip slider
Love to blast the mag
You a fag
You love bein ass to ass
Grab a gun by the nose with the but the gat spank ya
Never say that I'm a gangsta ((Swifty): Now that's gangsta)
Y'all niggaz sound like Jigga but act like Pac
Yo my trigga got the flu and this gat might cough
It ain't nuttin to tell
Empty shells for the witness
I'm the hot nigga that's gonna put hell out of business
It won't be the same since we touchin the game
Make the hardest nigga in your crew
Tuck in this chain
Y'all think this shit's a game and I bluffin for fame
I squeeze of this tech until nothing remains
(Kuniva)
He only time that I'm at peace is when I'm close to one
'Cause I don't know what's waitin for me when my vocals are done
Toke the gun
It's my way of life and it works
These cowardly niggaz'll put your fuckin' life in the dirt
Cause it was wrong how they left my dawg he was priceless
Alone in the streets bleedin starin' layin lifeless
That's why I'm heated
You never know who start creepin'
Wakin' you up with AK's while you lie sleepin'
I'd rather pack the heat and not need it
Rather then need one and not have it
I married this glockmatic
Nowhere without my gun
(Kon Artist)
You know the sound when I'm spinnin rounds
Spittin' these rounds from fo pounds
While the whole crowd is screamin this loud from they mouth
Is they possibly alive
*Shooting and screaming*
Nothing is parallel to makin' you carousel aerial somersault
Like fast wheels who will perish shells
Denaun carry the nine where I go
Bullets whistling hit you while I'm shootin at five-o's
So semi-auto... matic with statics to motto's
Swingin' like Columbine kids from Colorado
(Bizarre)
This nine'll turn a softy to a hard rock
It'll make Jehovah witnesses think b4 they knock (Sorry sorry)
It'll make your grandmother come out of her purse
It'll make Limp Bizkit get rid of Fred Durst
It'll make Holyfield start fighting
It'll make Ma$e say fuck church and then go back to writin
It'll make Shyne say that he sounds like Biggie Smalls
It'll make R. Kelly give respect to Erron Hall
It'll make Christopher Reeves start walkin'
It'll make a dog with no voice suddenly start barkin
It'll make a nun turn into a filthy slut
It'll make the hardest pitbull turn into a fuckin' mutt
It'll make a Muslim dye his hair blonde
It'll make a redneck start to read the holy Koran
It'll make Ike stop beatin' Tina
It'll make Slim Shady fall back in love with Christina

(Yo, yo)
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive-by six people and five I hit (Woops)
Aww shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (Argh!)
These 'shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losin' weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
 I said come on, bounce!
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (Me!)
Not weed, I meant coke, dumb-ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin' out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out (Come on!)
(Kon Artis and Kuniva)
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Heh, hey Von you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid cause the X is gone
Yeah I took 'em all, dog, with some parmigian'
And I think my arm is gone - Naw, it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary-ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Yo, stop actin' stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new shit (Eww!)
Yeah, I think I did too much -
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills (that's ill), mescaline!

Pop pills; pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was Incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away like a Rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray, look for dope to smoke
No okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
(Cough cough cough) am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Aww, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle a- (You're crazy!)

I pop fo' Es at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine

Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
And if you like smack (uh-huh) then I might too

52,Rape A Bartender,2011,Return of the Dozen: The Mixtape Vol 2 (2011),Hip Hop,D12,"(Intro: Bizarre)
This what you do
When the bartender fuck your drink up
I said Absolut cranberry
This is what happens to you
(Verse 1 - Bizarre)
Seen this white bitch that I wanted to rape
So I said ""fuck it"" and I asked her on a date
Lots of cash, we went out to a casino
Just me and a girlfriend, out there playing Bingo
So I'm trying to think of a way to make my attack
I got a 3-piece with an axe in the back
And I fucked her raw, gave her black cock all night
I ain't Brian Pumper, I'm more like Wesley Pipes
Now it's back to this bitch getting raped
2 chainsaws and some black duct tape
Said she was sorry, didn't want me to take her life
I said ""fuck that"" and stabbed her with a knife
He raped the bartender (oh nobody's lookin' for me)
Pulled over the car with her (uh-huh, okay)
He raped the bartender (oh nobody's lookin' for me)
And now Bizarre is in her (okay)
[Verse 2 - Maestro](Rondell Beene)
Woke up this morning, almost late for my flight
Probably from the way I was fooling at the bar last night
I remember this one chick, body looking so right
Damn it what was her name?
She had a boyfriend, dude was staring at me with a mean mug (What the fuck are you lookin' at boy? Shit.)
Probably cause his girl's staring at me like she wanna fuck (Why are you looking at that nigga fo'?)
Don't be mad at me, stupid, don't bring your bitch to the club
I'll shoot two in your brain (Do it, do it! I dare you!)
Don't let this bar tab fool ya (Fuck You), I'll dump you in the trunk
You lost your life cause your girl thinks I'm cooler than you (Bitch, I'm Rondell)
You had too much to drink (So?)
You better stop and think (Or else what?)
Before you end up on Channel 5 (That ain't even a real station, bitch!)
I raped the bartender
You bout to get your ass beat
Just because you drink to much liquor
(Verse 3 - Kuniva)
Walked up in the club and I strolled on over to the bar
Breath a little on tard and I left my big bed in the car
Got my gun by my side, try to rob me homie and you won't get far
I'll shoot the shit out of you
But anyway I was chilling so I posted up and ordered my drink
She gave me some Henny turned away fast, and muttered ""man your breath stink""
Snatch her up real fast like ""bitch don't be disrespecting me""
I'll slap the taste out your mouth
She took a swing, I ditched and ducked it
Came up and molliwopped that bitch
She pulled a knife, I stepped back
Pulled out my big Gat
Somebody's in the ER tonight
He shot the bartender (Yeah, then I watch that bitch bleed)
Right through the heart and liver (I ma 'bout to do a 103)
He shot the bartender (I ma let that bitch bleed)
And now the cops have intern. (They'll never catch me)
(Oh shit is the po-po, I'm out bitch!)"
53,Revelation,2001,Devil's Night (2001),Hip Hop,D12,"Chorus: Eminem)
I don't wanna go to school (I don't need no)
I don't need no education (education)
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna save the nation
Daddy NO
I just wanna live my life (I don't need no)
Everyday a celebration (self-control)
One day I'ma leave this world
I wait for the revelation
(Bizarre)
I wanna kill myself!
I'm still debating
In front of a Baptist Church masturbatin
Praying to Satan
Think I'm crazy 'cause I smoke crack
Live on B with the mac
In a two family flat (Fuck it)
Tired of getting hit in the face with a broom
My mom's on her period
My dad's in my room (Daddy no!)
I got ten rocks that I need to get out
I sold 'em in five minutes
In my own damn house
(My mom smokes crack)
My poor grandmother
God bless her soul
The bitch got AIDS
She was waiting to die of a cold
There's three things to keep me from being a Nazi
I'm black, a fag, and my dad's Liberace
(Kon Artis)
No matter how bad the beating
I went to school cheating
My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meeting
Skipping school, I had to have nuts just to do it
Got born and became truant
When I had the gaul to go
I just couldn't do it
I was lured into corners by this peer pressure shit
How would you feel if you was held
By the tip of a barrel
Getting threatened to get your skin
Ripped to bone marrow
Bet suburban kids
Never got rushed for their apparel like me
Outcast
Last to class
First to leave
When the teacher called on me
Best believe
I had something up my sleeve
(Eminem)
I been praised and labeled as crazy
My mother wasn't able to raise me
Full of crazy rage
An angry teenager
Nothing could change me back
Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
I was boosted and
So influenced by music
I used it as an excuse to do shit
Ooh I was stupid
No one could tell me nothing
Hip hop overwhelmed me
To the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm
It was like isolating myself was healthy
It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
Compelled me to excel when school had failed me
Expelled me
And when the principal would tell me I was nothing
And I wouldn't amount to shit
I made my first million and counted it
Now look at it
A fucking drop-out that quit
Stupid as shit
Rich as fuck
And proud of it
That's why...
I don't wanna go to school (I don't need no)
I don't need no education (education)
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna save the nation
Daddy NO
I just wanna live my life (I don't need no)
Everyday a celebration (self-control)
One day I'ma leave this world
I'm waiting for the revelation
(Swifty)
I was raised with a rifle and mask
Steadily beating my psychiatrist's ass
Just for asking about my past
I was never on that punk shit
Fucking around could get your beloved abducted
Smothered in blood quick
You couldn't pay Swift to give a fuck
Was crazy like my father
It must have been poison in that nigga's nutt
Far as probation
Fuck peeing in cups
I violate it anytime
Let 'em see the blunt
I grew up steadily masturbating inside a cell
Drunk as hell
Having conversations with myself
You could tell I wasn't leniant
A disobedient lynch
That slapped teachers
Bitch I'm not reading it
You don't know what dogs go through
A little nigga sipping liquor
With my old dude
What the fuck you gon' do?
I'm quick to curse you
I told my mother that I'ma hurt you
If you ever again mention a curfew
(Kuniva)
Look
My family ignores me and I don't like that
They don't even listen when I tell 'em
I'll be right back
This nice beautiful house mom?
It don't mean shit
'Cause you know Daddy's a drunk
And he don't clean shit
And yesterday he hit me like a grown fucking man
I couldn't stand up to him
I just ducked and ran
I'm sick of this
I wish on Christmas
That I can get a loaded four-fifth
And put a fucking end to this (Fuck it!)
I got no friends and I can't get a bitch
Only thing I have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips
Nothing to smile about
I'm about to lose my mind
Got me an automatic nine
Now I'm wildin' out
(Proof)
When schools over
Pupil or people to shoot through
Kids going cuckoo
With a two-two
Since my friend is this new dude
In his high school
Losing his noodle
Learning people don't like you
The football jocks is
Spitting on him
Popular kids in school that's now picking on him
Burn out youngsta niggas now hitting on him
And his teacher in his English class keep flipping on him
And now he's grounded with no allowances
For drinking forty ounces
'Cause he was caught by his counselors
And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach?
Already got expelled for wearing a trenchcoat
All I ever seen is
(Violence, violence)
Told me to keep silent
Stop batting my eyelids
It's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all
That's why I blow out my brains
And murdered you all...(FUCK YOU)
(Chorus: Eminem)
I don't wanna go to school (I don't need no)
I don't need no education (education)
I don't wanna be like you

Yo, that's right motherfuckers we back
Same slanging
Orangutaning
Wilding out on hoodrats that say I act
Like I'm too famous
To say hi and tell 'em what My Name Is
But really I'm still nameless
You niggas don't get it yet do you?
Kill or not
Platinum or flop
I'll still put it through you
With a luger that'll spit fire
And hit higher
Than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
That we won't deal with you in front of St. Andrew's still
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until I see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that road you pack
You gon' see these Runyan Ave. niggas
That really need some Prozac
To show that ask the others
Brigade'll lay you down
Next to your mother's mother's grandmothers
(Kuniva)
You know I'm feeling real rowdy tonight
Ready to fight
And half the niggas I give DAT to
I don't even like
The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it
Like the next L.A. Clippers game
I'll kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom
You and yo' madam
It's really unexplainable how I have 'em
Who call theyselves screaming about a challenge
Nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off of mere talent
My skills are deeply imbedded
Even your hoe said it
She was knock-kneed
I fucked her now she bow-legged
In the middle of rapping I drop the mic
And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrapping
Kuniving Kon Artis my nigga we get it cracking
While the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughing
(Chorus: Kon Artis) (x2)

This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh

The feds can't hold me (why?)
I hold feds
I was born with a dark ass cloud over my head (uh huh)
Raining acid (nigga)
You can't refrain from getting your ass kicked
'Cause you talk too much
You asked for it
I'm on some massive shit
Everybody ignore me
They wouldn't fuck with me if I was performing at an orgy
These niggas think I'm fronting (what up now?)
Then they change stories
I catch you and they thinking everything's hunky dory
I even have you pour me the gasoline for me (do it)
Pulling up slowly
Cop tailing your homies
Met a lot of niggas but you wouldn't wanna know me (for real)
Your ass might not even make it home with your roley (nigga)
Don't even try
In your system like eco lie
Trying to beef with me
Nigga please, your people die
I'm so wicked that my momma gave birth illegally (uh huh)
I survived the abortion immediately (Surprise!)
(Eminem)
Picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting
Or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
When the *cops* come knocking
Each hands got one
Cocked ready to dump slugs heavy as shot puts
One man army
Guns can't harm me
Young and ornery
Worse than my Uncle Ronnie
Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me
I can't stop airing out my dirty laundry
Middle fingers flip at censorship
Your friends just flipped
Over this swift penmanship
Ever since I spit some shit on Infinite
I been giving it a hundred and ten percent
'Cause when I vent most of my energy's
Spent on enemies
Eighty percent of what I invent is hennessy
And twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
Ten is because I love being under your skin
Ya, (shit) shit can happen
So stick to rapping
Quit the yapping
Or I'ma lift the mac in
That can lead to another mishap happening
Skip the crap
Get the can of whoop ass cracking

Da da, da da, da da
(Eminem)
I'll Shit On You
I will Shit On You
I'll Shit On You
Girl you know its true
I'll Shit On You
Bitch or man
I'll Shit On You
I will Shit On You
(Swifty)
I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin bombs to the back of record companies
Blow them up if they ain't want me
The national guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef; I got you hoes duckin me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggaz in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna (biatch!)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes endin up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screamin
Keep the motor on then I'm leavin' (I'll Shit On You!)
I'll Shit On You!
(Chorus: Eminem)
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
(I'll Shit On You!)
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
(I'll Shit On You!)
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
(I'll Shit On You!)
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
(I'll Shit On You!)
(Bizarre)
I have an eleven inch penis round
Stick it in your mouth piss 'n' hope you drowned
I'm a alcoholic with the fuckin' toilet
Pass the hotdogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
Bitch shut your fuckin' mouth
I'ma keep eatin till Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out (me out, me out!)
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fuckin' the 12 year old babysitter
And all women ain't shit
Only good for cookin, cleanin
And sucking dick and that's it (I said it)
I was responsible for killin' John Candy
I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my Ninety Eight Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody
Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre
(Eminem)
My adolescent years weren't shit till what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignorin the shit how borin it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who hate me and say they can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
(I'll Shit On You!) I'll spit on you
Start pissin and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants down and...
(Kon Artist)
Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dyin' (what?)
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggaz that I hang with
Will hang you up naked by your ankles danglin
My meat I stay stranglin
I don't need your help
If you won't give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll Shit On You!)
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda caught
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest
(Kuniva)
It's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(Hey, hey, hey!)
I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like D-Bo fightin Peabo Bryson (I'll Shit On You)
So what you hollerin and yellin' about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin' skeleton out
Niggaz get hit wit a two piece, ""Bling Bling""
Wit a poisonous sting
I'm such a violent thing
(Eminem)
Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(C'mon, I'll Shit On You!)
Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zainy actin' maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimmin pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too {*bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misoginistic which is true
I can't deny it- matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by and prepare to start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child...
(I'll Shit On You!)
I will Shit On You I don't care who you are
I'll Shit On You
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll Shit On You
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll Shit On You
I will fuck you wife if you fuck with me
I'll Shit On You
You heard me {*Eminem laughs*}
Bitch, I'll Shit On You
D-12 will Shit On You
I'll Shit On You
Your life
Your wife
Your kids
Your car
I'll Shit On You
Your house
Your spouse
Your rings
Your things
I'll Shit On You
I'll Shit On You
I'll Shit On You
I'll Shit On You"
56,Slow Your Roll,2004,D12 World (2004),Hip Hop,D12,"(Intro ] [ Eminem)
Guess who, New shit!
D12 World, D-Twizzy!
(Chorus ] [ Eminem)
You don't got a reason to want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better put them brakes and let off the gas
And Slow Your Roll
(Verse 1 ] [ Swifty)
??? A menace to many, I'm not friendly you get shot in da kennedy fast
You popped willingly you walkin' around with Pac's identity
I'm a mockery you bout to watch what its fin to be
I'm not mentally focused but lyrically we got it locked
And it's not about droppin' albums, I'll sock a nigga on da spot
You can't help it but to imagine this walkin' massacre
A madman strapped with a magnum blow that spasm out ya back
And just stand there and snatch your medallion
See I can't fear any nigga that can not happen
The immaculate Mack handler
That got this wrappin by the back of his neck
A scavenger I'm a threat then you fear me like a hand full of syringes
I'm ill enough to scream at your front do', blow it off the hinges
I'm marksmatic to press marksman outta walkin'
Cause soon your body can catch me shootin up your carcus
So don't provoke shit, I wish the whole mankind was a neck so I can choke it,
Furocious and you ain't gonna be knowin' where ya folks is
Fuck the milk cartons and posters it's over, they ghosts
(Verse 2 ] [ Proof)
Niggaz is bitch instead of diggin a ditch
I'ma see how fill this river can get even bitches get hit
I'ma walk a dog on all fours embark 'em with long claws
Just fight for the wrong cause your boss with thong drawers
You ain't in my racket bitch followin faggots wit wanksta tats on their ass
Eminem: Magic Stick If I get hit once you get hit twice (backwards)
These thugs need to do what he love and just play the back
Before I'll Put A Sword On Ya Head Like A Raider Cap
You bust I'm sprayin back, leave your hood layin flat
Now what you gonna say to that?
(Chorus ] [ Eminem)
(Verse 3 ] [ Bizarre)
Pull up ??? truck, throw up, blow up, beat a handicap bitch up
Fuck butter I kill the DJ
I don't need you bitch I got a instant replay
Lay down bitch get butt naked
And fuck the viagra I'm tryna nut in two seconds
All around the world, fuck wit different cliques
You ain't got no weed get the fuck out my room bitch
(Verse 4 ] [ Kuniva)
I'm calm but I steal on niggaz like I was Clepto
Put that chrome shit to ya head like you was Destro
Why stop niggaz, why not pop niggaz, we cop figures
Keep them toast like I hop nigga, we breathe dirt so be alert
Or get them guns on ya chest like a welcome to the hood T-shirt
Let's go back before throw backs, before I dro sacks
I used to blow gats, bullets'll find you like a low jack
I'm hopeless, a ferocious dosage of dope shit
A culprit of culture a chaotic comotion
Kuniva will blow shit off the map I post it
Knock you off your penny load so fuck that cold shit
(Chorus ] [ Eminem)
(Verse 5 ] [ Kon Artis)
I point my fingers to the ground, throw my waist to left of me
To knuckle should ship like a Em upside down and you best be
On your p's and q's people we sees to use
No one see's your views, so now you see's exclusives
And put it in your little magazine, but you should
Know that was the most desperate thing that you could
Pull out of your crotch you faggots all owe us much
Start doing herion lines for as much as you gossip
Like bitches with Oscars, y'all actresses
45's make bodies flip like flabby tits
Bullets coming at your doom like a buck up 6th
Now what the fuck you gonna do to get up out of this shit?
Your record was released 17 years ago you dumb bitch
Do the math, you'll never have a shady / aftermath ring
And that kind of staff to back that ass up so back that ass up
Before we clap that ass up ...
(Chorus ] [ Eminem)
(Outro ] [ Kon Artis)
Nigga you better ask somebody
These niggaz think they can just put shit out on their own, Fuck 'em ..."

These drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do
Be... cause... of...
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do
(Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1)
It was like... whoa and then the fuckin' room started spinnin and shit
And my friend came in he was like, ""Yo! Yo! Em! Em!
You puttin' that shit up your nose again?""
And I was like, ""Naw"" nuttin like - everything was just spinnin
I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster 'n' shit
Then I just started laughin' and threw up all over the fuckin' floor
It's crazy
(Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1)
It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me
Do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do
(Eminem)
My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it
It's got the power to get you to do it (c'mon)
So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did
Cause times like these, got me doin' lines like these
Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed
It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does
And is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids

Hey Stephanie (hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (okay!)
Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next to me
(Huh?) Till I'm dead I'm takin' blunts to the head
Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead
These mescalines got me sure
That I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour
Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?
Cussin out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!)
Fuck it, I was born with half a brain
Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games
You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick
'Cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit (UNNNNGGGHHH!)
The last time I sniffed blow
I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show
Bizarre be smokin' a half a pound
Fuckin' the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down
(Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1)
It's like, back when I first went on tour
I like, went crazy I was like out of control
And - just was fuckin' wasted every night, like
Wakin' up the next morning like - where the...
Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is goin' on
You see what I'm sayin'? I was just like, out of control
(Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1)

These Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin
Eight years old swallowin Anacins, standin over my bannister
Laughin' with a chromed out caliber (hahahahaha)
The weed that I'm sellin this (?) look like the back of a tarantula
I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura
Smashin it, after framin a nigga with smack and dust
I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months
Crackin' capsules to expand our blunts
I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head
Now I'm lookin' like a extra on ""Night of the Living Dead""
Until they find me on a stretcher
I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester?
This crank'll have me blowin' up banks like Uncle Fester
(Proof)
Ah... watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend
Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines
Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens
Got a Jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings (oh)
Blue pills, and purple mushrooms
(Hey little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?)
Missin' since yesterday, perfect just for rape
See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K
Two tabs of X and vitamin C
Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3
Grindin the teeth at the signs of the E
I lost six days at a time in the week
The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
While D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson
In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
Barf up my stomach linin, drown in my vomit
(Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1)
'Cause I like, I always tell people - yknowhatI'msayin like
If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody, yknowhatI'msayin?
Keep that shit to yourself; because if anybody sees that, yknahmsayin
When you're out in the public eye and shit
They're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not
That's why I always tell my friends, knowhatI'msayin but
I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck
I'll probably end up, dyin' from this shit one day
Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like
""Eminem dies from, drug overdose"" - youknowhatI'msayin? And
And my friends, they ain't no fuckin' better, yknowhatI'msayin?
They ain't nothin' but influences, bad influences to me, y'know
It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure
That's what it boils down to - and, I give in to it
So do they...

Amazed by the way that you shake them hips ooh,
Shakin' your ass off on my dick ooh
I get aroused by them sexy lips cause ooh
U r the one, u r the one, u r the one that can dooo
(Swift)
And you wonder why I call you everyday of the week,
And have that operator breakin' on your line when you speak.
And I can say that I'ma make you mine in a blink.
You nominated just for your behind and I'm game,
You a thug with your best of friend, mud-wrestlin'.
Sittin' in the corner with a mug and a cup of gin.
See me lookin' for you when you win in a pen,
See I hug you dirty. You confronting me for flirtin'?
You wanted me so suddenly, my company's a burden,
But I won't jump a balcony, and how can I be hurtin'.
I'm just playin' wit you and it's workin'.
Your friend's can't save you, they fakin' like they nurses.
(Bizarre)
First time I saw you, up in them guests,
You the only reason I use Federal Express.
Shit, I don't be havin' no packages. Naw,
I'm getting dressers, lamps, and big matresses.
I go crazy when I smell your odor.
I just want to pick you up, and take you to Pan-De-Rosa.
Steak and potatoes, whatever you want.
I'll register the buffet, my publics cheques then come.
You don't care about D12, you don't know about Bizarre.
All you know that I'm weird and I wear a wonder-bra.
That's fine, I just wanna make you mine.
Niggas say you a 3, I think you a dime.
(Proof)
I love the way yo' body grindin', gettin' all in my face
Only thing on your mind is which wallet to raid
Your ass looks so perfect with your thong on your waist
Built like a stallion, you belong in a race
Get money by the barrel, King Kong in the place
Movie and a dinner, that's as long as I wait
Hey, I ain't on your ear off, talkin' dates
Got you dizzy off D-twizzy, you ain't walkin' straight
Got a roomy, bring your booty, and lets cultivate.
You so pretty, love them titties, they soft and fake.
Bring your friends, ""Damn your skin smell like coffeecake.""
Yo meet me at the place when you get off at eight.
(Kuniva)
The way you move have got me buggin' out.
And you quick to take off your jacket and slug it out,
We thug it out. Pourin' 40's out and give each other death. In fact,
We both hate goin' out, we both hate small gats.
You the truth I'm for real yo I love you to death.
And if we break up, I'ma stalk you and bug you to death.
Till you scared to leave the house because you know I'm in the bushes.
We went from hugs and kisses into shoves and pushes.
Tis all love, take it and stride, I'm only jokin' wit you.
I don't get down like that, you know I'd never hit you.
But yet and still if I ever feel I'm about to,
I'll gently grab the shoulders and shake the shit out ya girl!
(Kon Artis)
I take a light skinned, dark skinned, short and black,
Attitude sassy and they ass is fat.
Corporate suburb when you could be a classy rat.
Louis Votton cost to much to have a bag to match.
Girl forget all that, I'm gettin' rich off rap,
And you could be my aid in all as long as you got my back.
Seditary, there's entrepreneurs, and that's a fact.
And your birthday's seven days after mine, correct?
Well that's two things that we got in common, baby.
Hope there ain't a problem that I'm involved in Shady.
Cause come next year, I will not be datin',
Cause my plan's to be with your stinkin' ass OK?"

(Eminem)
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons
I never did show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record
(Eminem)
Yo, the rage I release on a page
Is like a demon unleashed in a cage
Lunatic, soon as I hit the stage
My mind is like a fuckin' stick of dynamite
Onen I get behind the mic
It's like the wick is lit you bitches die tonight
My nine is like a guidin light at night shinin bright
My fuckin' grip is tighter than my wife's vagina, psych
These cock-suckin cops got my Smith-N-Wesson
I guess it's time to pick a different weapon, man the shit's depressin
But Swift is getting me a new one for a Christmas present
(Swifty McVeigh)
Come on Slim, let's go and teach this fuckin' bitch a lesson
(Eminem)
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady stay creative baby hold your head up, don't you let up
One bit on these motherfuckin suckers you're a soldier
Get up
Stand up for what you believe in, long as you breathin
They jealous of you man, that's the only reason they beefin!

It's that Dirty Dozen renegade
You done pulled the pin out my grenade
.38'sll move your shit up out the way
You niggas wont forget about McVeigh; you got somethin' to say?
Let it out today or watch these bullets spray
From these ten black fingers huggin these deadly millimeters
That'll make Jeff Dahmer's look like he caught a misdemeanor
See I'm 'Dirty, so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater
You gets whipped with it, tell them motherfuckers Swift did it
You packin somethin' special in your crib then bitch get it
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile (uh-huh)
With this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils
You get splitted and guess what, I'm blowin' up the hospital
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe
I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector
Findin whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em
(Eminem)
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents

(Bizarre)
I'm eatin crews like I'm Hannibal
There's no way I can be the gay rapper
(Why not?) I only fuck animals (Oh! Ha-ha)
Stupid trick got my dick startin to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch
One on one in this bloodsport
I'm in divorce court, sold my bitch off a pack of Newports
(Your honor!) Six times I been arrested; how would you feel
If you was a Jehovah witness that always got molested?
(It happens) I'm smokin' dank drikin drank
I can't have any kids 'cause I'm fuckin' shootin blanks!
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck?!
Nicole's a whore, I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut (uh!)
Responsibility, I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, should be stabbed
Let Richard Simmons be the President (oh HEYY!)
Call me a weirdo, call me Bi-zarre
While I stick it up yo' ass while you shittin diarrhea
(Eminem)
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons
