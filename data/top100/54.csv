0,10 2 10,2013,Hall of Fame (2013),,Big Sean,"Imma' be paid forever
I look up
Finally Famous Nigga
I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline
All this bread can't be good for my cholesterol
Don't come round' talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire dawg
I can't lie bruh lately I've been stressing heavily
I'm sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off
Diss you, FF Imperial till my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti-fuckboy material till I'm dead, I'm living proof,
If you focus on what's in front of you and not what's in the peripheral
It's gone, word? Boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama over comma on comma
I'm bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like its haunted
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments
Went to sleep, snoring
I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline
I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though
One cook, one clean, the other PMS'ing, ho Hablo ingles'
If police have questions they don't know what that mean nigga
They say Detroit going through the great depression
Still it's been depressed so long I can't even tell depression here
My homeboy still gon' pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb my lil 'cause thought the fair was here
Like oh, I'm primo, top spot redeemed ho, for who? My team
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego, pussy and flamingos
Got me thinking the fuck I need to sleep for?
I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline"
1,100 Keys,2011,Finally Famous (2011),,Big Sean,"Ay, ay
(Chorus-Big Sean)
I'm from a big city
Tryna make a living
Come to my hood
Everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money
Just a bittersweet symphony
(Rick Ross)
I play the keys handle dope, Barry Manilow
The game a bitch, but at times she sweet as cantaloupe
Hit the road key of coke in the mantle fold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes
Japanese denim, down south numbers
Hit it once trust it would make a fat fiend stumble
Do the speed limit, all gold shoes
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too
I'm tipping strippers but I call it penny pinchin'
She talking shit but I could get her titties lifted
My new crib got it's own city limit
Motherfucker got his own city in it
Blue marble on the floor
Wet as salt water
Ima boss, I'm just playing hoes (holes) like a golf course
(Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money)
(Big Sean)
Just a bittersweet symphony
(Chorus-Big Sean)
I'm from a big city
Tryna make a living
Come to my hood
Everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money
Just a bittersweet symphony
(Pusha T)
One hundred keys
One hundred please
My gazuntite could make a whole city sneeze
Walk the mud jungle where they grind it out the leaves
So they swarm to my honeycomb, hideout for the bees
You know what this sounds like
Money counter sound bytes
Machine gun fire
Name ringin' through like the town like
Church bells ringin'
Know what he was found like?
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white
She live on her knees
I live in a condo in the trees
The air's a little thinner that I breathe
Iron Man Audi, let the top strip tease
My life is slow motion but the watch screaming freeze
Yeah, young nigga gettin' money
The feds dragged neck, couldn't take nothin' from me
The decoy car is a crash test dummy
What follows is a hundred of 'em wrapped like a mummy
(Chorus-Big Sean)
I'm from a big city
Tryna make a living
Come to my hood
Everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money
Just a bittersweet symphony
(Big Sean)
Boi
And they gon' risk a hundred lives
So they could rock a hundred whites
The guests look like a hundred lights
Man when blade died my city cried a hundred nights
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred types
Every wrong I do, I'm steady tryna do a hundred rights
Got it for cheap, compare the price
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White
And don't worry 'bout the info
From where they ride Pintos, and could afford Enzo's
'Cause everybody know, keys open doors (keys-keys open doors)
But bricks open windows
Countin' a hundred hundreds, more by more
Built this from the tile up, floor by floor
Talk shit, I send 'em door by door
Made for the Snow White like 4x4's (truck)
(Chorus-Big Sean)
I'm from a big city
Tryna make a living
Come to my hood
Everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money
Just a bittersweet symphony"
2,All Figured Out,2013,Hall of Fame (2013),,Big Sean,"It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit
Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out.
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the night it's all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March ninth
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbys out, you know?
Stuntin' like a bitch, prom night me out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back when I was seventeen
It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had it all figured out
It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times I missed out on
More than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have
More than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way
Two lyin' and one bed-never too tired
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin' overseas I do buy it, who higher?
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks
SUV swervin like it's O.J.'s car, oh
To me and my dogs is all gettin' out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck.
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all trickered out
Even when it... all of it... when you still ain't got...
Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Every minute turns into the longest second, yet never ending
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
How old or young minded someone is
'Cause we all started at the same starting point of a woman's legs
But each have our own finish line
Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized
Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized
And remembered for all the right reasons
Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
With who thinks about you:
Your family, your team
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it
Winning the game: hall of fame"
3,All Your Fault,2015,Dark Sky Paradise (2015),,Big Sean,"Yeah, you know we good

Your house got another house
Your bitch got a bitch, your spouse got another spouse
Young Walt Disney, I'ma tell you truthfully
If you leave Mickey you gon' end up with a Goofy
I imagine that's what Chris told Karrueche
Girls be actin' like it's diamonds in they coochie

But cops chokin' niggas out in the media
We finna have to protest and tear the city up
We bout to tear this whole place up pretty much

Ho we done made it through hell and disaster
My crib done got bigger, my women got badder
You wonderin' how do you get in the game
I'm wonderin' how do I get to the rafters
Oh boy, I'm mad until these records gettin' shattered
Till I'm MJ or Magic, oh she just want the status, so
You the man she got, but I'm the man she been after
She done sent so many naked pics my phone ain't got no data
I walk off in New York like my name Derek Jeter
Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina
I'm the good with the evil
Fuck you nice to meet you
You can have a peace sign man without the middle finger
With the clique when you see us, that's my family to me
That's my family tree
They're my arms, legs, hands, and my feet
And I can't cut them off even with diabetes
Hit the beat and kerosene it
Scratch that, I white sheet it
A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us
Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar
Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's
Got me thinkin' back bout how I used to roll to Little Caesar's
Piece of pizza with Tanisha
Now I'm with a Boniqua
She finna blow at that
I got your dream girl, yeah she actin' like a ho at that
Throw her to me I'ma throw that back
Top spot I'm finna go at that

I don't like loose pussy or loose lips)
And I done did the impossible a few times, Tom Cruise shit
Ho and I ain't satisfied bein' on that top 5 list
(I ain't satisfied until I'm on that all-time list)
Till everything I spit is all timeless
(My girl on that all fine list)
My life a little luck, a lot of grind
Bitch no maybe ho I gotta make it
(Fuck your nomination man fuck the world)
I'm repopulatin', wrap my rollie round my waist yeah time's a waistin'
(Niggas want the comma, comma combination)
Long as I'm around, it's gon' be dot dot dot a lot of waitin'
Got my pinky on her brain while I'm gettin' brain plottin' world domination
(People ask me how I done make it)
I'm just like ""man if you want the crown, bitch you gotta take it""
Straight up"
4,Ashley,2013,Hall of Fame (2013),,Big Sean,"(Hook : Miguel)
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything
And you
(Verse 1 : Big Sean)
Yeah, I got a brand new Benz
Crazy right, brand new Benz
Got less miles on it than I do friends
Remember when we laid at you and Paige's crib
Was there so long I coulda paid rent
Remember when we couldn't get shit?
Best thing bout being broke is you don't spend shit
Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list
We couldn't afford nothin' but we still get shit
Ironically those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe its because I had you girl
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris
And gave each other times that we cherished
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower
And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed
See those are times I can't let go, I can't let go
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs
So you Sipping on XO till I snatch you up like ""let's go""
(Hook: Miguel)
(Verse 2: Big Sean)
My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful, distasteful
Yeah I know you're not supposed to have cake and eat too
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full
What about the emails you hacked in?
I know we hate to live in the past-tense
It's been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D
And ain't came back since
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city
That's about the time that you left for the city
You and all your girls moved to NY,
I shoulda' known now how you watch Sex And The City
I know we ain't close but, I gotta focus on blowing up
I know I promised that I'd be there, and really did I ever show up?
I know I wasn't honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl
Brought problems to your world
And you said ""how could you just lie to me? I thought you'd die for me?""
I was scared you'd find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to
You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to
And when Thanksgiving come around,
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma
So it's back to the drama,
""No I don't know that number""
""Why the hell you text it?""
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in
Young and living reckless
(Hook: Miguel)
(Outro: Miguel and Big Sean)
Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you
I can't imagine myself without you
I need a whole lot of help without you
Me and my granny both agreed
Damn you're such a G I'll hold you down forever, B
(Hook: Miguel)"
5,Beware,2013,Hall of Fame (2013),,Big Sean,"When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart
Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say ""be real"" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (funny right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart
Okay, skeet, smoke
Sleep, call
Miss, text
Woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa ew
Time, kill, months, still
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy
I drank too much, please call me a cabby
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screamin' till my phone dies
Then she text me like ""why you still talk to my mama?""
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you
Nigga I don't even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I French kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, ""ain't no woman like the one I got""
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me a one-eyed fuck
Sch, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped pad sch--
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy
Crazy, crazy
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy
Crazy, crazy"
6,Blessings,2015,Dark Sky Paradise (2015),,Big Sean,"Look, I feel blessed
Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
Straight up

Fuck a vacay I feel better at work

For my niggas who gonna go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth for a hell of a check
Yeah whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father forgive me these are all my confessions
Man this wasn't luck it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you dog
That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga
Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was all for a sec now it's back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three
Man this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just got it, thank God that we got it, blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your profit we profit, oh God
I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'
'Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin' it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks bout' where the Grammy's go
I just gave out Grammy's on my Instagram
Them OVO boys the business man
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give
You gotta come to my side and see how we live
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six
Look at what we did
Be quiet I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' about whoever's next
I am just worried about my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit man
I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
My grandma just died I'm the man of the house
So every mornin' I'm up 'cause I can't let them down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, man it's to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who put it back together
I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I snapchat that whole shit
Tryin' see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See 3 POs like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled
I'm blessed, and I was thinkin' 'bout startin' up my own school
A montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery
Oh yes I'm way up, I feel blessed"
7,Bounce Back,2017,I Decided. (2017),,Big Sean,"If Young Metro don't trust you, I'ma shoot you
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I'm takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back

Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)

Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one

Celebrity hoes, Hollywood parties that never get old!

But I just had my face doing a Earl Flinn
Hoody over my head, Jedi,
Anacin, looking like a BBC
Louis V mannequin, she ain't got no man in him,
She got no companion, she's Jenifer Aniston,
I'm trying to hit her, and her friend!
And again, and again,
Pass it to my man's and them.
Fuckin' all the baddest bitches
In cities we landin' in.
What happens when it all falls,
And the success is all gone, and is all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity!
For now I'm a celebrity!
'Cause I'm in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs,
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The money they said that is the root of all evil,
At least that's what the pastor tried to teach ya,
But he ain't pass around and collects and play,
Till he's heavy weight as soon as his speech through, hah.
Now hop in that Benz, coop.
Shit, I'm trying to get Benz too!
Man how is it the root of all evil?
If it could take my whole family out to Rio.
No more re-po or depot speed-boats.
Jury all gone, come and see 3PO.
Smoke so much, I gotta see 3POs
'Cause I'm worldwide tourin with me and my nigga Zeno
Most comfortable behind the Mic's like Tito
So I hate to lose my mic like Tito
What happens when it all falls,
And the success is all gone, and is all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity!
For now I'm a celebrity!
'Cause I'm in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs,
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs.
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
I do it for
Anything in life for love and meaning,
I hope they never try to tell me I'm leaving,
Getting everything I want, then I got my mom next,
LA Reid sign checks right after the contract.
I always had a crazy flow, pockets was on radio, active.
I guess 'cause I was active on a radio.
Way back in high school, yeah nigger CT
Where I met my nigga Ton', bad pimpin' CT
Came up afta Slum Village, way before T3.
Give my hoes the run around, we just call 'em track meets.
It's funny now when I look back, tho.
Cause them the times that gave the inspiration at the track meets.
Yeeuh, Boi.
Do it."

11,Dark Sky (Skyscrapers),2015,Dark Sky Paradise (2015),,Big Sean,"I see the skyscrapers in the back, this shit is official
I got a lot on my mind, I got more in my face
If I ain't going to get it, that day is going to waste
I'm tryna move in my safe, like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on the stakeout
And you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out
I'm thumbing through the magazines like ""this the girl I'mma take out""
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way way out
And yeah, your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out
And I've been waiting all god damn year, all year
I can tell that it's near, but near ain't here
Man, them bills is here right now
I guess you shine brightest when the lights down, like now
And then they say it happened for me overnight, shit, yeah I guess
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success
What you know about living check to check to living check to check to check to check?
First place, no neck and neck
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air
Yeah, saying I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like sign these
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gonna stop
'Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top
I said I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gonna stop
'Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top
And I don't owe nobody in the world no favors
I started from the basement, made it to the skyscrapers
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on
Bitch, watch how you speak to me
I've been working all week and I know I need ZZZZs
Tryna get paid repeatedly
Jamaica or Cancun, oh now that's where I need to be
Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT
I be thinking about becoming a cop
So I can murder some niggas one by one off legally
I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it
One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership
Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
He like ""man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother""
But that's on some other shit, look
I'm into risk and taking it
I'm into making it then back then make it like I ain't made it yet
This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it
I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work
Even if you don't get paid for it
Shit, call me the greatest
Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour
Like thank you God, look at all we created
I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement
And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers"
12,Deep,2015,Dark Sky Paradise (2015),,Big Sean,"Do or die nigga
I'mma keep poppin' this champagne
You ain't pop shit
Man I look up to god
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep
Man I swear to god it get so deep though
That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid ain't turn me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep
Deep, deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
The deeper it gets, boy the pressure increases
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean 'cause I shine, it's self explanatory
I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish don't call it
My opponent probably praying for postponement
You fuck with the best rapper don't even know it
It's written in the stars man the sky is the author
I pulled the sword out of the stone I'm King Arthur
Motherfuck your armor nigga, only weapon I'm scared of is Karma
You watching the son turn to father, fucking life and her daughter
Nigga that shit just get deep
Man I look up to god
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep
Been going hard all day, wish a nigga would fuck with me
Then I blow the candles out on my K
And niggas always thinking it's a game, 'til we ran them out the arcade
Stunting in my southern player, reach the caddy like Andre
I talk that cash money shit
YM plus CMB you can do the math for me bitch
Jail time a slap on the wrist
Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Anything can happen 'cause a broke man is an optimist
Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
I got some miles on me but it's cool 'cause I never get an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
'Cause shit is deep and in rap I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times
I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos, he ain't throwing up signs
Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line, just finish in lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time, then cross it with pride
That's real my nigga, remember that
And ain't nobody if they remember you they remember rap
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
'Cause this shit is deep, deep
Deep as empty pockets, nigga
We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets slime
That shit get deep
Man I look up to god
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep"
13,Deserve It,2015,Dark Sky Paradise (2015),,Big Sean,"Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing Tennis
Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change
Don't play no games with hoes, I play Nintendo DS, nigga
And pray I don't see the ends of my paper like P.S nigga
But damn in high school you had the fattest ass
And now me out of high school, you got a fatter ass
Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago
Seen your ass in deja vu, that shit was deja vu I know
Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip
And you gave me that head
I swear to God that was the best night of my life
I can't even sit here frontin', lying, pretend
Dancing with your titties out
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah
But 5 minutes later you on my lap
And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here
You're telling me how you went down South for school
Down near TSU
But you know business majors
You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school
Told her check the valley, seems like out there they be hiring
In L.A where all the girls that look like you are aspiring
A new scenery might just be inspiring
She said ""Pshh, man everything ain't for everybody, shit I'm good""
Okay I came up how I came up
A little change bring change up
A little fame bring famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous
Gettin' high now I'm the supply now
Laying low cause it won't fade us
Deliver how I deliver cause nigga I need to
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing Tennis
Some hoes are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change
She drop it for me, pussy pop it for me, take it to the top
Spending extra money when she ain't got it, on me
The she turned around said
""I'm so proud, seems like every where I'm hearin' ya
Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria
Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask""
When she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past
Man '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim
Don C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand
Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye
And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit
Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint
Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense
And he said ""Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet""
Sign me, got a profit
Few years later yeah we on here poppin'
And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in
Brr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it
Almost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it
Fuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody
Oh boy, swerve
Okay I came up how I came up
A little change bring change up
A little fame bring famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous
Gettin' high now I'm the supply now
Laying low cause it won't fade us
Deliver how I deliver cause nigga I need to
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it"

That's what happens when you're here with no trust, okay
I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit, and I'm still here, right?
And motherfuck your friends
All them hoes hatin'
If you're not down, then what's your location?
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man, you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from ""I love ya"" to ""Ya don't know who ya fuckin' with""
Fresh off of vacay and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time?
If you wanna leave fine
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave
'Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
'Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu
I be right back in bed witchu
So don't tell me you love me
Wishin' I would've tried more
She wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more
'Cause when I was true, all I heard was buy more,
Fuck you, who is that? And I don't know why more
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feelin' like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hittin' high notes and you don't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'ed up
Girls dressed alike lookin' like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinkin' ""Damn boy, grow up!""
And I could still hear her leavin'
Crazy, when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not workin'
'Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time?
And if you wanna stay, fine
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave
'Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
'Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu
I be right back in bed witchu
So don't tell me you love me
So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do
So don't tell me you love me

I'm a real D Boy, take a look up in my face
Never did real estate, but still put you in your place
I don't trust dog hoes, dog hoes got fleas
From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski
Every time I spit a verse, my city like ""Preach!""
Niggas thought I got evicted how my shit up in the streets

Swear I'm skinny 'cause I'm always on my feet
Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week
Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats
Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave
Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speaking trapanese
If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back

Bought my fam new six star crib
Momma feeling like she jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest
Yeah I talk about my mom, but shoutout to my dad
Would drive me to school every single chance he had
Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past
And gave me the talks that made me to a man
Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam
And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand
Coming from Detroit where everybody say ""whaddup doe?""
Horror movie nigga, cause everybody there cut throat
Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though,
Even though you deserved a commission plus mo
The grandma sad when she saw my commercial

16,First Chain,2013,Hall of Fame (2013),,Big Sean,"Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes
Annotate Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She's ask why I rock all this gold, 'cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
What's the noise all about with this rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
'Cause it's a mental game, I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the big gold, bold anchors it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm coppin' stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on, not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what way I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying
I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF, GOOD, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D.
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
Stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches, where you at?
I got my mind is on me, a couple others and dreams
Would've seen me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Went from feelin' hellish to godly with lemon-lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now? Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now, how sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is, the troublesome chick
Who throws fists; sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up, but when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, I surely hope and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes, so dead it
Shred it; young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go, my life is fucking awesome
I could be fuckin' dead right now but I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought don't know the god
'Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God
It might be too late, but the songs will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance
More like a prance - I'm signing off with a crotch grab
Thank you man for letting me get on this record, Sean
You the coolest
GOOD Music nigga forever
Understand? Yum."

Looking at her like ""you never seemed so close""
I had a dream about a trillion in cash
It's time to make it happen!
I'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
Talking cash, you ain't got to fake an accent
I've broke enough tree down that I couldMake a cabin
Look: I turn all my problems to ash
All my ones that I have is then divided by half
Pass it on to my man, write my will out then
Pass it on to my fam and finally become a man
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Greatest of all Big's, greatest of all Sean's
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check
With no ink - I get it"

From where the streets feast at, but made it out the belly of the beast without a C-sect
I'm so straight up, I'm so erect
Hype off that action, I'm so direct
I know it's a hundred thousand niggas up in Michigan
Doing it, but where I lack in talent I make up for it in discipline
And go hard, so hard till nobody else is on my sonar, radar, or lane 'cause I Bogart
Nowadays all we do is classic, Mozart
Outta here, it would be polite to send a postcard
I meant a post heart, y'all niggas post hard
So lost co-star, coast off au revoir
I mean look at all we been in
And I look up in the mirror like boy you ain't even finished
Do they really need my info, to show them what they in for
I'm recognized like kinfolk, even when my brim low
I come from where that life talk, where dat where dat knife talk
D-town, be brown, more money than white chalk
And on them nights how we grind till its light out
Grind till the sunset, till my grandson set, yup
Yeah, man my kids gone have the good life
Good days, good nights, and not the wish I could life

My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good
I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good
It's time for a new crib, it's time for a new chain
20 thousand on me homie that's just loose change
Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess
But if you knew bout my hood you'd say that nigga is blessed
Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?
Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door
Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though
The hustle's who I represent, dope boys we in this bitch
And I'll be goddamned if I didn't
Put the city on let's get it
(All right all right all right, all right all right all right)
Let's get it
Detroit, once the backbone of this country
Now it's the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy
Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
Going from a population of nearly 2 million
To under 700,000 in a matter of years
The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together,
To make it through these tough times"

How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now
(Verse 1 - Big Sean)
Hell yeah nigga high right now
That's the reason I said ""hi"" right now
Come have the time of your life right now
All you gotta do is close your eyes right now
This shit classic, they ask ""where your outfit from?""
Please, The Saks Fifth, first class
Only culture games and practice
Oh you athletic? Shit, show me on the mattress
'Cause it's already night time
And I feel like the right time
Twisting up my fingers

Stress turned me into a weed-head
And parties into an alcoholic
And money turned me into a workaholic
And money turned her into a twerkaholic
Yeah do it, do it, do it with no hands
Do it like you do it when you do it with your man
I could pull up in a Honda Civic, pulling bitches
Ain't about the cars, bout that nigga who is in it
Right here: and all I need is a minute
Start it up, guaranteed I'mma finish
In the nighttime, I feel like the right time
So here go the drink you've been waiting all life for
Make sure the muthafucking ice cold
My jewelry is ice-cold, stone is albino
'Cause you're burning up, your outfit is dyno
Let's give 'em a light show
(The Dream)
I ain't Paul McCartney or John Lenon
I ain't buying Beetles, I'm buying Benzes
They mad at you mamacita
Cause them bitches look like Bobby Bonilla

I take that bitch to my mansion
And a nigga can't pay her to leave
Yo mama a great head doctor, with no PhD
My pockets stuffed with dough

Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that?)

This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Talk to the, talk to the hand
You talking to a grown ass man
It's like, way way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak
(There goes the bed sheets)
Err'ybody rip the swag off
'Fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off, 'cause I'm rappin' my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it, the fucking anthem
(Kanye West)
I don't really wanna uh talk too much
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when ya blazin'
And I swear you turn at least half asian
And we 'bout to have a liaison
She cool, get head with her shades on (whoa)
You should just go and throw a cape on (whoa)
And it's just so amazing
So amazing
So amazing
(Big Sean)
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop, that shit look like I'm speed racing
Leavin' with me, it'll boost your reputation
West side is where I'm stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it till it's...

29,Memories (Part II),2011,Finally Famous (2011),,Big Sean,"(Verse 1: Big Sean)
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit
So goin' and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life'd it!
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin
They say the sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Muthafuck the radio if I can't hear mine
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I'm a make it, but even if I don't
Don't feel bad cause honestly all the times that I had
Those will be the best memories
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
(Verse 2: Big Sean)
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set till you considered great
How many missed calls till you considered fake
How many dreams till it's considered fate
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me 'cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say ""in memory""
I'm praying that he make, wishing we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories...
Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
(Verse 3: Big Sean)
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, 'cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can't purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles
I'm marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
Man, I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan'
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal Twenty Dollar bills right out her purses
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die, of course I have the memories...
Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back"

Hands up in the air (I do it)
And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all
Big ass bottles, Big Ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public 'cause
'Cause if you don't do it big, bitch, you ain't doing nothing
And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all

35,No Favors,2017,I Decided. (2017),,Big Sean,"Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (Brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, ""Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too.""
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America; I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30, so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
Though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means, so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing, dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power-how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the GOAT while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes, like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, ""late"" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back, like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round, like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle, rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch
I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beatin' 'em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
And yell, ""Wait!"" pleading-but screaming is pointless
Like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving them pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma...
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
(I know you feeling yourself right now.)

What are you doing here?"

Nothing is stopping you
Nothing is stopping you
Nothing is stopping you
Stopping you
Stopping you
I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried to keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone till we on
What's up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this,
I woke up early on a Saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: ""Go rap for Ye
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday""
Man, that shit sounds stupid
Then I hung up on his ass, then called him back like ""Fuck, let's do it""
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursued it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, ""Let's do it""
When I heard the songs he was doing
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music
(Big! Sean!)
(Big! Sean!)
(Big! Sean!)
(Big! Sean!)
(Big! Sean!)
Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches,
Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented
'Cause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons
Man. who claim she never did it (Yeah right)
But under these conditions, she was with it
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
I been gone for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning
Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it,
Getting rest that I be missing,
But fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
I know the Program Director hot
But I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
That everybody in that bitch forgot, now I'm running late for sound check
And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station
And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme
Manager said we ain't got time, but time to time
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around
I say ""Aye dawg, What you got?"", ""Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot
Um, all right, it's that young renegade, man they been afraid
Tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem
It's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And a bunch of synonyms about how he was living in, I even let him finish it,
I mean I can't lie he was all right, but at his age, shit so was I
So I give him my email on a fly, and if his songs good, I'll reply, Uh
Hello
Ay nigga, ay trick, where you at, nigga?
Ay what up? What's good? What's up man?
Ay bro, ay nigga I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg
What!
Bro, haha, I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg, aye
Oh hell naw, what?
Hey I ran into this nigga, but aye he cool as hell man
Awwww dang! Tight!
Bet, he short as hell though.
Hahahaha
But that nigga was cool though man
All right!
Man just like how he spit a hundred bars, I spit like two hundred bars.
Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith
In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe
What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch
What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need
All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need
I'm sorry
I know you're not my child talking like that. Focus on shifting this negative energy, into something positive. And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have, for your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you. You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay. Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha"
37,One Man Can Change the World,2015,Dark Sky Paradise (2015),,Big Sean,"They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
Hol' up, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day, no Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?
They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
My grandma told me if you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they broke, they need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying
They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about me
It's all good I love you grandma
Bye"
38,Outro,2015,Dark Sky Paradise (2015),,Big Sean,"Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back
I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that
And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that
'Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating
Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it
Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs
And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings
And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk
Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed
What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?
Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this cross
Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off
She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft
Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball
I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw
Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off
Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off
Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk
It be like ""we don't got time for bullshit, dawg""
You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype
You look like the ""um, you owe me"" type
Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no
Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like
""Oh, you owe me likes""
Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em
The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em
The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em
I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em
I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD
And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first
No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy
Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know
But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um
White people with a black son
And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation
Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation
Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper
Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn
Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do
Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?
But what about now? 313
515-8772, bitch, call me"
39,Paradise,2015,Dark Sky Paradise (2015),,Big Sean,"I always wanted to stunt so hard
I always wanted to ride that whip
I always wanted to fuck that bitch
Thank you God, I fucked that bitch
I always wanted to live this life
I always wanted to wear that ice
I always wanted paradise
I always wanted paradise
Look, now it don't take a lot to make you rich
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit
Man, I feel like money is the best drug
Sometimes, hate can be the best love
Walkin' in like I got cameras on me
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
Bitch, you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homies
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he saw change
So fuck is my ransom, homie?
Money bag, money bag, money bag (x4)
Straight up, Finally Famous nigga
I always wanted paradise"
40,Platinum & Wood,2015,Dark Sky Paradise (2015),,Big Sean,"Come roll with a nigga, get high with a nigga
Count stacks with a nigga, fuck hoes with a nigga
Back in high school we used to trade clothes with my niggas
Back when Icebreaker and Girbaud was like the wardrobe for the killers, we pose for the pictures
Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros
Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us
Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats
You know, spending gas money on everything except gas
Spending my last on the shit that won't last
Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass
A movie and popcorn and caress that ass
Overdress and undress that ass, god bless that ass
It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer
Riding around like we dumber on dumber
Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer
What happened to those days? I really do wonder
When all I did was safe sex, latex
The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade aids test fuck
But I ain't flunk once
Back before I got drunk once
I was smoking on haze, all in a daze
My homies would call and say ""nigga, come roll""
Man, I'm straight up off the 7 Mile
They call that the better mile
Tryna get a house up in the woods
Off on 11 Mile, better that, one time for the D
Girls that hold me down Corretta style
And everything I want off in the world is a must-have
I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking ""fuck rap""
Cause there's niggas in the streets getting money under my nose that I mustache
I've seen people get murdered who ain't deserved that shit
Cops should've protect-and-served and shit
But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit
That's why their attitude was ""bitch, you deserved that shit""
Bang bang bang, how do you maintain the same brain and mind
In a city of AKs and K9s
When only language they know English and gang signs
Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll

I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga
That you make love with, but right before take drugs with
Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds

Wine fine, like a bottle from the 99
Hit you with the 99 like it's fucking primetime
Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times
Girl, even when I'm gone, just know I'm there for ya

44,So Much More,2011,Finally Famous (2011),,Big Sean,"Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Jewelry looking like it got free throwed in ice
Debatin' with the reaper not to repo my life
Cause in my 23 years I done lived a couple lives
Like why? 'cause I stunt, bags of trees, like its fall
The girls that was outta my league tryna play with my balls
I pay bills, I work hard
And when my momma cried a river, they never gave us a bridge
They gave us a bridge card, nigga
Ridin' low, puffin on lye
I came way too far to f-ck it up now
Text from my mom said ""me and your grandma proud""
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me get a job, save up for a 401 (k)
Man I'd rather be young and shit, countin' $401k.
I'd rather die with a smile instead
I'm just multiplying the money and dividing the legs
B-I
(Been this way before)
(Dream of finding so much more)
But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred (I deserve)
Throwin' westside up like Pac, when they pop ya block up,
Big Poppa flock off, you holy lil ? holy Kenobi, chewbacca
I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I betchu that you won't find it
Rocking Louie and MC'ing
Guess I'm closed (clothes) minded
Obama suite, you one below, up in the Joe Biden
I'm in your city just chillin', where are your hoes hiding?
24k for the fit because it's 24 carats
And I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-Town reppin'
And makin' all these niggas who second guessed it regret it
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
At least I realise now how much I loved Ashlee Marie
And when it's all said and done I'd probably give her my knee
'Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
Man she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET
Just making it seem easy
Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy
And the whole world's seen me
Bitch I know you seen me
(Been this way before)
(Dream of finding so much more)
""Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Everyday's a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings
I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life's prom night and guess who the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like LeBron's ring""
You tell me that wasn't verse of the year
Man that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overf-cked
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints get over stuffed
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a f-cking thing that's over us
So take that check out and owe it up
Man I turned impossible possible
And what these niggas can barely see in the optical
The same teacher who told me rappin' is what not to do
Said I'm throwin' my life away if I drop outta school
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove
Is that I did everything they told me not to do
After I went down the road, they told me not to cruise
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional
My old school look like a T-Rex, I should feed her fossil fuels
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules
Little hoes
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations
Man, they wanna see me dead, but I gave them dedication
I'm yellin' f-ck 'em all, with a hundred exclamations
'Cause I'mma be the man till my f-cking expiration
B-I-G, I do it
This goes out to my muthaf-cking city
Detroit, Westside to be exact
Right over there on Northline..."

Hit the club, lose seven Gs, film it all on 7D's
Spilling liquor rest in peace, rest in my G's, rest with her P
Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team
Same show, different seats, same game, different league

Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see,
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see

I was thinking about the ice that I put on, money that I've blown
Bitches that I know, everything that I've done wrong
All the licks I hit, all the bullets missed
Got my shit legit, a lot of people pissed, well
I got money coming through
Drugs and women coming too
Got my family living comfortable
Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do

Could you just wait for me a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late (x2)
I hope it's not too late
I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase
Ridin' in a Chevy that should've been a Mercedez
Tryna keep my head above water
So I stayed out the navy
I, I, I made a promise to my girl
Said Imma leave town and bring back the whole world
So I bought a ticket
Took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace
And the first thing she said, was (it's too late!)
Like nigga, I got needs too
I found a man who gave me what I need
Now I don't need ya
I barely gotta text the call back
You ol lying ass nigga
You're a dog
Out here chasin paper
Fuckin' bitches
Nah
Nah nigga you're too late
Live with it
Now you got a roommate
My homie served ten years
It's too late for him to be treated equally
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally
Ridin' around doing my thing
Is it too late to be tryin' to live dreams
Turn them up real
Reality is just a technicality
And so is being fake
So don't tell me that
I'm that I'm toooo late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late (x2)
Alarm clock said I'm too late
And they said I'm too weak
I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long
And don't look too strong
Well how long would you take
Waitin's got me here in the first place
Another second maybe second
Maybe third in the worst case
Now we'll display
On my word plays
Moving weight
It's such a trap
Move and weight
You can't do that
I know I'm dope man
But I can't move crack
And is such a fraction
They way you thinking about your plans
But I tryna bring it back
Before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit
Lupe from Chicago land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers design both of the sedans
Ride with Mr. Right on time
Or stay Miss another chance, man
Re-direct it at the girls
Not an ultimatum
Just an option in this world
But things come and go
When the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing
A little late for a lot
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late (x2)
I hope it's not too late
I hope it's not too late
The last thing I wanna hear is too late
Tell me is it too late for me to try and change the world Is it too late to say I wanna change girls
Is it too late even though I'm the shit
Is it too late to tell y'all to suck my dick
(Talking)
Bitch
I do it too late for what
I want it I need it
If I need it I got it
Cause this how finally famous niggas do"

Tell me I'm all you need
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don't ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me it's not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I'm all you need

Understand, I am
The renowned, newest talk of the town
When errybody talk and just keeps on talkin' about
Wassup? Tellin' girls ""You should call if you down""
And if my phone doesn't ring, then leave it after the pound
'Cause I be up in the air, more than I do on the ground
My city is on my hat, and I'm wearin' it like a crown (Westside)
You're now rockin' wit' somebody on they f-ckin' bidness
Watch me do it big, no pun intended (Boi)
See, I done seen nights turn to days
Love turn to hate, hugs turn to laids
Niggas turn to sirs, Andre to Spades
'Cause when it turns real, that's when everybody turns fake
Instead of sayin' f-ck all 'a y'all and turning away
Man, I was cool enough to say ""F-ck it"" and let 'em stay
F-ck, I hate to say I told you so
So buying rounds is my way of saying ""Told you, ho""

My new watch, or the chick that's standin' right next to me
Killin' niggas at rap, but being the man's my specialty
I love shitting on all my exes especially
Double shots, then re-reload
Let's toast to the interns that made it to CEO
Boss player, collectin' every single check that's owed out
Puttin' on a show until everything is sold out
Man, I'm chillin' wit' Jays, 'Ye's, and Common Senses
It's crazy when legends are peers and your competition
I would hate to be a almost nigga
I call ya that, 'cause you gossip like y'all almost bitches
You know, went to school with Jay, and was almost Jigga
Or hooped against LeBron and would almost get 'I'm
Y'all niggas make me realize how good almost isn't
Would hate to look back on my life and say ""I almost did it""
F-ck that, reflectin' on the last chain I bought
They on my tracks, waitin' on the next train of thought
Visualizin' how the crown might be
Got the whole rap game tryna sound like me

You was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home
Damn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong
You got time for that gig, but not time for the phone
Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends
I seen your ass up on TV, touched up on them twins
You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz
Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, wow
Niggas want handouts, and I only got two
Now I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you
Gettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit
Ain't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew
Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do
Cause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through
So when it's time to travel management say I only need to
Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules
I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose
This the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze
Lately though my family been too happy
I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy
People thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that
I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that
Worry 'bout my next Rolex time piece
My nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice
We supposed to be the role models
No wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college

Sometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin' through somethin'
Real life will teach your ass way fucking fast
I always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last
I got four aunties, two uncles, one dad
One mom, two brothers, and 200 niggas mad
And it's only one me, divide it and do the math
I'm the one that dropped out, got no time for the class
How am I supposed to have time for everyone I just said?
I don't even have time for everything in my head
On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot
Wishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots
Man that's drama, drama drama
So deep that call each others mamas' mamas
We need a break I mean comma, comma comma
I'm tryin', homie
But she always picks the wrong time, my phone's dyin' on me
In the bed cryin' on me, talkin' lyin' on me

It came from the breast, just spread to the spine
It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:

Got me thinking, ""what's a girl to do, a girl to do?
When her world's a pool?
And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames
And all the stress is all propane
She's burned again""
Hoping I could make her smile
Take cancer and David Blaine it out,

You don't know what you-
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get dressed up
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get messed up
Heart breaker, young heart breaker
When you get in the game I swear the whole world commentates you
But man, I don't give a fuck what they saying, I don't give a fuck about opinions
I don't give a fuck about feelings, I ain't no dentist, either I did, I do or I didn't
You could try to tell me how to live my life, I ain't hearing it
I must be doing something right if every mill comes with a spare I guess
Straight, straight, straight up out that dirt, but my t-shirt clean, oh
Do it for the city, that's the 313
That's unnecessary, fuck her like she my secretary
Ass and face is hereditary, her momma, shit, legendary
You don't know what you do
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
You don't know what you-
Go, go, go, go. go
Can't let that high go to waste I feel high on
Supposed, supposed, supposed, supposed, supposed
Man, watch your back I swear man some of these niggas be
Hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes
But I'mma live this like I swear that's all I know
Know, know, know, know, know, know"
