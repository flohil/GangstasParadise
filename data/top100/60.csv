Haha, we label mates nigga I shoulda been jumped on this shit
But it's all good I'ma take care of it
Start like
I started out lil' nigga with a dream
Now I'm on but it still ain't what it seem
'Cause now I got more money
More niggaz rather see me somewhere on the floor then the ceiling of this thing
But I can give a damn what a little nigga think
I pop more champagne, peel another sweet
Catch Wiz skinny ass chillin' on the beach
Cut my own hoes off, I ain't deal with them in weeks
I pray to God every night before I go to sleep
To let her know I'm safe, kiss my mother on the cheek
My little sister grown, little cousin tall as me
And I'm proud 'cause he ain't fuckin' round in the streets
The fans love the old school sound that I bring
You like jab-work, I pound on the beat
And bein' from Pittsburgh they sayin' they concerned
With tryna make a lame 'cause my sound is unique
I love when a nigga talk down, think it's sweet
You couldn't play me if you was acting and seeing
The haters can't see 'em, the money's in the way like traffic
Pistolvania is straight action
I'm from the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)
Where niggaz ain't workin jobs
They only option is to hustle
They feel like they gotta get it
Not all about it then fuck you
You ain't someone that I grew up with
So why you think I would trust you?
Real talk like a dictionary
They say life's a bitch, I'm married
And we make love, she fuck other niggaz tho
Can't keep up, you haters to slow, oh
Yea budy
That's how it is
That's it, that's all
Hahahaha, yea bitch
OK, hahaha"

2,B.A.R.,2009,Burn After Rolling (2009),,Wiz Khalifa,"Fuckin' hoes everywhere we go
Taylor Gang, paper planes
Uh, they lovin' what I say
Tell her keep count
What you other niggaz speak bout
Lamborghini dreams, beach house wishes
Poor bottles of champagne for my beach house bitches
It ain't new to me, the money boy I been bout
Throwin' 100's on the floor, I tell her keep count
Nigga, they in love wit what I say
'Cause I, really live the life you other niggaz speak bout
Got my camera man, he down to do a movie for me
Couple niggaz round us, down to do the shootin' for me
I'm still ridin' wit my main bitch
She rollin' the joint, somethin' old school playin'
She love me, we fuck and we in the fly-free zone
When some niggaz will captain-save-it
I let her shop till she drop dead
Sleepin' in her crib, wake up to decent pot plan
Jordan shorts and a pear of polo socks, blazin'
Wit yo bitch, you wanna live smoke this
I'm glad to be here, I been waitin' so long (so long, so long)
I finally found me a cloud to float on (float on)
And I'ma float on (float on)
Float on (float on)
And I'ma float on (float on)
Float on, float on, float on
And I don't have much, but I'll take all I got and that's what I give (what I give)
What I get in return is the money I earn, and the life I live (life I live)
I'm so gone as I burn after rolling (after rolling)
And float on, and float on, and float on
Talk numbers, I hire people to speak for me
If you love her, then hide your bitch so you keep shorty
Ever fly private
So much diamonds in my chain, hella sky mileage
I fell asleep on a plane
And never woke up, and now I'm living a dream
Suckas hate hard, hoes treat me like I'm a king
They wanna live comfortably, sippin on champagne
Real niggaz fuck with me, so drama is not a thing
I gave my momma the ocean
Told her anything to come through the door to open the whole clip
I'm wit yo bitch smokin', let her keep the mid, I'ma roll this potent
Hotel so close to the water
You can even here the ocean
Them bitches can't breathe
Beware of them niggaz wit tattoo sleeves
Wanna smoke, 'cause they know that I keep flavors
Tell me how them other niggaz lame
And she love the cool crowd, so she fuckin' with the Taylors
Wear All-Stars and smoke papers
IPhone with no ringtones
Vibrate or on plane mode
Palm trees and bomb pre-rolls
The weed burnin, but the money just fold
While I'm lookin' at you niggaz face
Light another L, and pull the liquor out the case
Niggaz try and fail, see me now they wanna hate
Fly another plane, a different city, another state
My cash change the forecast
As the team was half-baked before class
Now I smoke joints wit others niggaz hoes, and this shit you burn after you roll
Fool"
3,BTS,2016,Khalifa (2016),,Wiz Khalifa,"My momma ain't raise no fool nigga
Matter of fact, maybe she did
My momma raised a fool (haha)
But that don't mean we can't get rich
Too rich (too rich)
That's what they say
Humble beginnings, rich ass endings
Pockets on swole, big ass benjies
Started off losin', man it wasn't choosin'
Stuck with my nigga's, now we all winnin'
Rollin' up paper, ball like a Laker
Top on the building, I'm high as a 'scraper
What can I say now, cops know my name now
No time to play 'round, I'm rich and I'm paid now
Stay on that piece for shit for nigga's that spray rounds
Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now
Try not to fade now, try to find a way out
Nobodies innocent nigga, get down or lay down
Made so much money but look how I'd paid out
Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house
Guess all these diamonds on my wrist, what you blinkin' about
It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about
Try to be the best that I can
They got the right decisions, handle it like a man
You know I try to do shit with my heart
They talk but I don't listen
I just finish what I start
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man
You know I try when people say I should change
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same
Nigga's still hating, critics still waiting
Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases
But never said I'd stop counting these faces
Flyin' new places, buying them cases
Nigga's want problems, I don't entertain it
'Cause if it's real problems, It's not entertainment
I'm rollin' a joint up, precise like a painter
The grind is what made us, the grind is what made us
Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer
Too much turnin' up, the club owners tryin' to censor
Tatted everywhere my full body full of scriptures
Pull up in the phantom, paparazzi takin' pictures
Sellin' so much swag, we should be your swag vender
Big winner in the club, big cash spender
Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher
Some shit you can't witness, my nigga we been business
Try to be the best that I can
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man
You know I try to do shit with my heart
They talk but I don't listen
I just finish what I start
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man
You know I try when people say I should change
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same"

I got-I got-I got-I got so much
So much, so much, so much
Quarter million, little nigga, I was nineteen
Had my hustle down pat, I did the right thing

Bring that shit back to the hood
Anytime you see me, man I'm on the grind
Nigga wasn't workin' when you knew you should
Now you talk about me when I'm on the road
And when I ride by I'm in the newest one
I got so much money I think I should pay for all this
They ain't down to spend how much they say 'cause they ain't ballin'
I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'

Ain't no way they spend how much they say 'cause they just bluffin'

In that California, that's really hard
In that California, that's what we on
Smell that strong, you know I'm baked
Chances dog, that's what we take
How much you hate, that's what we make
Roll up one, that's what we face

I got so much
Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys
Step up your game or step down
Whenever a problem troubles us all
If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow
For there's nothing too much for the great God to do
And all that he asks and expects of you
Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield
Confidence and knowledge that God knows best
And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test
But without God testin' of our soul
It never could reach the ultimate goal
So keep on knowing and believing
All that God has promised you would be yours to receive
Preach, Church, tabernacle
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way"

Everything about me (what?)
Everything about me
Youg wild nigga, mouth full of gold teeth
Treenbay.com, like to swap meat
Goin' crazy on a bitch until she knock me
I'm in that hella fast whip goin' top speed
Make a mess in that pussy and then she mop clean
I drop racks and she drop G's
Smoke green as I lean, top droppin'
Nigga I am all about a buck, falling out a truck
Probly with some hoes that I just met and yeah they all gon fuck
Got a man calling up the homies, blowing all the mug
Tryna figure outwhich girl is, she probably toasted
Uh, like a champagne glass
So much money, there ain't a damn thing sap
Do my damn thing in my campaign add
Let's get straight to it, don't let a damn thing past me (what?)
Worried 'bout a hater? Not me
Turned to the max, no sleep
Smoked a hundred joints to the face
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say
Everything about me ('bout me)
Everything about me ('bout me)
Everything about me, everything about me ('bout me)
Everything about me ('bout me)
Everything about me (what?)"

And when I'm on ima share my glory.
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
A prospect with his mind set on what to be.
Alot of chronic smoke . yunq broad come puff wit me.
A attitude like y'all dudes can't fuck wit me.
Still I stay humble.
Focussed on my hustle.
Later forgettin it but everything got doubled
And my team got bubbled.
Anybody that seen our struggle got respect 'nah mean' for the youngen' cards.

Smart to do it. talkin' ess. then lets prove it.

You ain't gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it

When the same ones running up on you wasn't speaking
Look at all your achievements
You work hard so it'd be kinda hard not to believe that
You party every weekend (weekend)
Fuck 'em all who act like they ain't see it then
All them nights on the plane
Buses nigga too, had to charge it to the game
Always wanted stardom 'n' the fame
Learn to out smart em
And now it ain't no stopping the champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin'
Us seeing muscle cars and coppin' em
Started off just a little less popular
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for cameras than life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you are
Never gets boring
And haters in your face you just ignore 'em
Don't know what they talking shit for
Seems niggas get there's you just tryna get yours
Therefore, you left all the people you care for
Hopped on a plane and got airborn
Seen all the bullshit and fell for it
But it's all good now
Cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it
Then you start seein' hoes you dated
Then thoughts started getting jaded
Now your life's sort of different ain't it
Feel your scars knowin' what your pain is
But what's it all worth if its painless
Say you wanna be famous
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You stop all the cameras than life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you are

Are, are, are, are, are, are, are,

Always knew I was this good
But never knew I'd be this good
Them niggas just startin' I've been doing it
Hear 'em talk but they ain't living my life
In the dark tryna get in my life
But chances I don't 'em, dodge twice
Spendin' grands for hoes, this is the high life
And for the camera's posing this the high life
Bottles raising for my niggas not here
I pour out a couple sips
Blew 'em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit
But never like this
It's so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots
We just pour and chase 'em
Ain't worry 'bout it, 'cause they gon hate
Know where I'm going, look where I came from"

Gettin' all this paper
Got me shittin' in public
That roof with a city view
I did that from nothing
And these nigga's keep hating me
But I'm just gonna keep stackin' up
No one thing I'll never change
I talk shit but I back it up
You nigga's don't go hard as me
So why the fuck you mad at us
I'm rolling up the (?) weed
The first one wasn't fat enough
Your car don't go fast enough
You don't fly first class enough
You don't do no switching states
You don't do no packing up
All you do is gassin' up
That's why you aren't past enough
Smokin' weed and crackin' up
All this cheese I'm racking up
See one thing about me
I've always been about my
As soon as you doubt me
I show you how hard I grind
Yeah I hear they hate me
But they do it all the time
There's no you without me
I know this so I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
Get it how I live it
Get it and don't care how I spend it
Swear to god, my credit card ain't got no limit
Time is expensive so I spent hundred thousand on my watches
Full of diamonds
I ain't even reached the top and I'm still climbing
I'm still climbing
I'm still rhyming
Filling up paper with chronic
Keeping nigga's out the way
Who got the hating shit in common
Let's be honest
Let's keep it real here
My bank is full of comma's
I'm talkin' millions
And I got no problems
Spending what I spent yeah
'Cause I'm probably
The realest nigga in here
Matter of fact I know I am
And I know my diamonds are frozen
Not to mention my bank overflowin'
And I just can't stop I keep goin'
See one thing about me
I've always been about my

Teacher say I was going nowhere
Now I'm worth millions that's the worst feeling
Said fuck a job bought the building
All these fake niggas where the real ones
First-class no shoes, young nigga I got no rules
6'1"", no roof, go hard won't lose
And you know the truth, I got more to do
Already made history once
Fuck I'm supposed to do?
Big bag, no seeds
Yeah I rap and I grow weed
When you this great, niggas don't hate
It's about dollars so it can't wait
Break down the gas roll another one
Puff one J, roll my brother one
Already stoned and I'm almost home
If you high then you know where I'm coming from
KK feel it all in my lungs, one puff damn got me going numb
Everywhere I go niggas want some
(Damn, man let me get some of that shit)
No, high all day I ain't coming down
Take two pulls then it's going round
Since a young nigga I been blowing pounds
Always in the sky I ain't on the ground
Jump in the ride about to blow a cone
Niggas at the crib so I'm solo
Take this half-ounce to the dome
Smoke this hash out of the bong
Don't choke don't pass out until the morning
In the club throwing cash out 'til it close
And I stay with the pack on any coast
KK cut down to a clone
Gameday touchdown Randy Moss
Say we just ran out so we getting more
We gone smoke 'til we ain't got anymore
Don't just roll one roll plenty more"

Standing on the corner rolling up their marijuana
Smoking weed and selling packs of D till you're a gonner
Caught a case and lost some racks, the nigga got it back
In any case a nigga disrespect, he's on his back
He bought a pack, then bought a strap

All up in the club and he ain't looking for a ring
Fucking other niggas bitches, yeah he swear that was his thing
Yeah, he learned a little lesson 'bout messing with them haters
'Cause they found his body later

It's all about a dollar man
Don't let nobody else tell you anything otherwise
Unless it's me
Uh
Leave my iPhone cracked if I take a loss
Know I'm gon get it back, I'm always on attack
Learn to let the money stack, homies turn to rats
When you deal with certain cats, they deserve the facts
Stay in constant meditation, always burning back
Wipe them ashes off my lap, you ain't part of my set
It's harder to maintain than it is to get
That's why you hold on to it and don't ever forget
That you did good with less just gotta deal with the stress
It's part of the game
Sometimes things ain't gon work out
How you think you want it to go
Sometimes you gotta keep going
When you think you can't no more
Sometimes you can't depend on
Who you think you can no more
Sometimes you gotta try, gotta try and
Figure it out
Knowing your worth is half the battle
Keep fuck niggas out of your circle
Yeah they gon try to hurt you
See you focusing, they try to divert you
Being fake ain't rare, it's universal
That's why I'll never work with you
Family first, till I'm in the dirt
How these niggas bosses but they needing work
That's exactly why I don't believe em
Goals, set em, achieve em
Joints smoke 'em and leave em
Ten toes, no matter the season
Hot tub with my feet in
Living comfortably cheesing
Sometimes things ain't gon work out
How you think you want it to go
Sometimes you gotta keep going
When you think you can't no more
Sometimes you can't depend on
Who you think you can no more
Sometimes you gotta try, gotta try and
Figure it out
You know what, playboy?
They always gonna wonder why
You gotta have a brand new car
Or why you gotta have the flyest watch
But you know what, playboy?
You just gotta keep doing you
'Cause ain't nobody do you better than you
You look good doing it too, playboy
And you know what else
Them haters, they just gon keep hating man
And when you on top, people always gon want your spot

It's up to you whether you give it to them or not

Me I'm riding clean, smoking good, can barely keep my eyes open
Listening to my favorite song, leaning in my ride chokin'
Tell my dog to hit this weed, feel like I'mma pass out
Thought I had exclusive trees, until he pulled his bag out
Had 'bout a half ounce, some shit I've never seen in life
Said that once he grabbed it, smelled so bad he had to bag it twice
I told him roll that shit up, this weed I had to light
These clowns somewhere in the clouds, me I'm a satellite
I roll them very nice, with smoke coming out the end like a muffler
Got game from the Hustla, never said I'm gon' quit
I can't get enough of good weed in my lungs, plus I'm sharin' I ain't cuffin'
My eyes wide shut, I'm just staring saying nothing
I flick ashes, got big staus, so I don't need a dime, I got big baggage, bitch
Yeah I blow it by the zip, anywhere I go it's on the road on every trip
Ask my Nini, love her grandson but she know that I'm a trip
Got my habit from Ms. Peachy smoking roaches getting lit
Now I fill my blunts with so much weed they say ""that all ain't gon' fit""
On some highly grown shit, with a Hollywood bitch
Got the sweetest purple kush in a precisely rolled spliff
High as John in Pulp Fic' on the way to see Marcellus
Girl I'm in another world, and Chevy got another twirl
For those who don't know he got that roll game
And I ain't gon' lie, he the reason why I got my roll game

All the while supplying
The money for your request
Without me you're a dime
But with me you're a buck fifty, haha
I can get another one quickly
But I'd rather wade it out
Take the broken pieces try and fix it
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit
Ha
Remember what you said
But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel
I was doing good way before I met you
Now you're off the set
And I'm a let you see the show go on without you
Take a bow... think about it
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes
The story of my life, you're just another page,
But everythings good until it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky

Now these niggas acting jealous
'Cause they feel like they ain't shining
And they little shit stop
When it's big shit popping
(Incomprehensible)
Gotta keep it in my system
60 box of Cigarellos
'Cause I blow it by the onion
Pack up some dollar bills
Send some paper to my younging
'Cause he just like Steve Francis
He be playing with them rockets
Whipping on the wheel
Got my peddle to the medal
'Bout to hit another city
Ain't no point of getting settled
Straight onto the plane
Ain't been home in so long
You think it's my cologne
But it's money that you smelling
Eyes like my father
Can't stand my older brother
Got some niggas doing years
'Cause of funny niggas telling
Nigga, I'ma be grinding
Till the day that I expire
I've been running through the batch
Till I'm the last man standing
Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye
Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye"
42,Got Everything,2012,O.N.I.F.C. (2012),,Wiz Khalifa,"Baby I go, hard
So hard, sometimes it's hard to tell whether not I'm even on my job
Most of the time I'm running 'round, either that or I'm gone
Some of these people hating, but we don't see 'em at all
'Cause we done made it, too far
Got something to say then fuck 'em
Ain't trying to lose out on all of this for nothing
I'm usually just balling and shit, whatever I want, I'mma get
No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent
And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich
And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit
That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since
Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips... wit'
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me

And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring
Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me
Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you
Take you places where they using different language to greet you
Smile and shake when they meet you
Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get enough of me
Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me
Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me
Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want
And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me
Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'mma need it in a rush

Couple of important folks doing some talking

Getting chavo
Niggas duckin' from rosado
Checking battery life now, charging my iphone

I switch those like clothes
Charm like a computer with a virus whos mind froze
Whoa

Spend a whole lot of cake on a prod of clothes

This for thinking they ought of know

And my city got faith in me 'cause I give 'em someone to believe in
They tell me I'm a hero
A young motherfuckin hero
The best when I'm flowin', get goin', no way I can stop
Superhuman strength but don't show it so call me Hancock
Benny off of Sandlot, I pick on the Beast
Represent my city streets when I shit all over beats
Young Pete Park how I stick to a track, man
The way I make hits you should call me the Batman
I'm more like a Jetson cause nigga I'm spacely
I'm eatin' like Pac-Man you playin' like Jackson
A role model but gotta keep me some weeds whirled
Ridin' with a superhero dime I call her G girl
Know I'm a star my car's parked out of the world
And my diamonds kind of remind lil mama of sea world
Homie you niggas got zero
They say they need someone to come and save the game and I'ma motherfuckin' (hero)
A young motherfuckin' (hero)

46,History in the Making,2006,Show and Prove (2006),,Wiz Khalifa,"I'm so incredible wait
Wit no metal to waist
I flow great
And that'll level ya face
But I'll still let a nigga have it
You talk greasy but you still a faggot
I front on cowards cause you niggas backwards
I got my money right
Game on top
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock
I'm from tha city
Of the triflin' hoods
But when you see me
Gotta smile on my face
Nuttin sweet, it's just that life is good
Yeah, I dodged the hood
Slums came up out that
Rap game about that
To gain pay wit out crack
See I'mma youngin wit too much on my plate
To let some small change have a youngin dumped in a cage
I seen niggas make sells
Niggas get knocked and make bail
And take lives, they worries ain't jail
Wit no regards for life 'cause they livin' ain't well
Who gotta make it to heaven 'cause they livin' in hell
But me I don't do much just keep to myself
And stop these cock-suckin' motha-fuckas seekin' my wealth
I was told the world's cold but I see for my self
And I'm too hot to take the back seat or the shelf
So I'm here
For sum reason though they hate it to death
The love's gone only hatred is left
Only achin' and stress
A king not be mistaken for less
And this here is for the taking
This is history in the making
Where I'm from it's kinda hard to trust
Cause the hate's from most of your own people
They're fake and they're all see through
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks
Rather him be down in the dumps
And out on his luck
But I'll be damned if my grind stop
My mind tickin' like the time watch
And I'm gon be spittin' till the time's not
Presently there
I touch minds everywhere
And I'll ride hopin' heaven is near
See the pain in your eyes young wit every stare
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair
Cause somebody went and took Greg's life
Son reached
Deceased
No time to blink or think twice damn
Wonder when it gonna be my time
To meet death
I'm stressed need to ease my mind
And unless one of y'all try to see what's mine
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones and leave that spine
U see I did the right thing
I stayed up out the gun and knife game
I knew about the pain it might bring
And we all got problems
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em
The top, but I rose from the bottom
And I'm here now
Ain't no body harming young
My screw's loose they say somethings wrong wit young
Ya time's up I'm just warning young
Cause this here's for the taking,
This is history in the making"

Take her, to my home, Say hello to my neighbors
She my biggest fan, I see her man just tryna save her
Put it in her mouth, and now my taste she's tryna savor
Shorty saying Khalifa Man should have his own flavor
Haters wanna be me, but can't walk in my Chuck Taylor's
All black eleven's, Mac-11 with the lazer
Mami keep on shaking it like she a salt shaker
Hand on the ground, everybody around.
Yeah it's goin' down, Yeah it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', Watch her hit tha flo' (X4).
Wiz Khalifa: Yeah. Yeah
Hey A lot of niggas hate, but all the bitches wanna do me

Probably fucked your girl, you don't like it nigga sue me
Shawty from the hood, but in the club she actin' booshie
Body like a centerfold, Boy look at that loody! (*Taylor Gang word for booty)
My ink got her gone, Wanting to know who tattoos me
Head game right, Just said she'd like to ride (Yeah)
DJ play my song, When it come on she gets excited
Before I leave the club, I'll put her number in my sidekick
Swagger on some different shit, She tell me that she like it
Watch her break it down, I ain't playin' around.
Yeah it's goin' down, Yeah it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', Watch her hit tha flo (x4)

Unless I'm weedin' (weedin)
That's all I know
Oh oh oh (oh oh)
I work hard, niggas hardly work
Smoke good Swishers, y'all hit dirt
Talk bad 'bout that Taylor Gang swag (swag)
Now we hit the club in that small T-shirt
Hopin' that somebody will notice him
I'm chavo chasin', that money keep rollin' in
I step on stage and they say he's goin' in
Four hoes tryna leave with me and the motorman
I'm blunt roastin', on a cloud just coastin'
Shift once and I'm speedin'
On my way outer space
A couple niggas in this race
But its one that I'm leadin'
Hoes see me think they dream (dreamin')
I'm a star
Drive a space ship sweetie, not a car
Come on dog, we ain't gotta wait for the weekend
I'll hit the West Coast and be back for the weekend (back for the weekend)

I bought a whole O to smoke
I'm riding high
My niggas with me, they down to ride
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
Got niggas hating on me hard because my paper right
Money from the floor, way up to the sky
Now they want to know, and they wonder why
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide
And I'm killing them, it's homicide
I'm killing them, it's homicide
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
Got niggas hating on me hard because my paper right
But I'm killing them, it's homicide
I'm killing them, it's homicide
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide
I'm killing them
(Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa)
First forty eight, first forty eight
Took out fifty racks and blew the first forty eight
I ain't worried about spending bread because I got more to make
Soon as they see that Maserati they gone surely hate
Hundred for a show, can you afford a date?
And that's just one show, imagine what my tour gone make
Police ran up on my tour bus
But hey my niggas, more money, more problems, more lawyers on the case
Niggas was at the Grammys
I was at the crib working
Heard they little diss, but I'm just being the big person
Never been trained, still my aim near perfect
Everything I spits murder, bow
(Verse 2 - Chevy Woods)
With black on black cars coming through
Presidential shit, tints on the whip
So dark can't see who riding in that bitch
Suits and ties no questions why
Somebody get a box ready for these guys
No four door, had the coupe that ride
That eagle right here if you want to feel fly
No games though, no names spoke
This crack right here, cocaine flow
I don't know what you doing but I'm paid bro
Yeah I pitch that .9 like Pedro
(Wiz Khalifa)
Stuck in the car with my nigga I'm ready to ride
We on our way to the top, watch that paper rise
(Chevy Woods)
Keep telling everybody what you going to do
Middle finger like fuck what you going through
All I know is that money that I'm going to
And them gang gang boys want to bone you
Like what's up 'cause I told you
Just money in the pocket, fold you

50,Hope,2014,Blacc Hollywood (2014),,Wiz Khalifa,"Way before your time the world knew this would happen
Was destiny to many, was just hard work for you
As you were brought into this world
You tried to find out about your surroundings
The people, the feeling of being alive and breathing the air
The smiles you see at that point are the ones you should always remember
Authentic is due to the choices you make for yourself
It'll be a bunch of fake smiles so easy to forget
But some although not healthy for them will create an understanding of what the word real means
Us and never as one of your greatest attributes
Others before thyself as long as long as thyself is taken care of is well being
And money, well, I know you know how to get money
I'm gonna say this one time only, live young man, you deserve it
Let's celebrate, Blacc Hollywood
And we be in the club, buying all our champagne
Spillin' it on the couches
Me and my niggas deserve this shit
We was there for the come up
I am Blacc Hollywood, I live Blacc Hollywood
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hope you got thousands in your pocket 'cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles 'cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love
That's no love

Hope you got thousands in your pocket 'cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hop out and walk through the back, so high I don't know where I'm at
Them bitches get open, I'm with some niggas who all 'bout that action
Poppin' them bottles, you look outside, see them foreigns
She get them dollars out them niggas 'cause she ain't lookin' for love
Smoke that loud up by the pound, she get champagne and drink it up
Hope you ain't a Captain Savior 'cause she ain't lookin' for cuffs
In the club spinnin' face, she in your face, you think it's love
Said you throwin' dubs, bro that ain't enough
Money, clothes, and drugs, that's what bitches love
Rollie cold as fuck, that's what bitches love
Back to the topic, pop that ass and please don't stop it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hope you got thousands in your pocket 'cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles 'cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you got thousands in your pocket 'cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles 'cause she ain't lookin' for love
That's no love, that's no love
That's your bitch, get her bed in my truck
You ain't give her what she needed, and she ain't lookin' for love
Homie she don't want no flowers, only make her cum
Poppin' ass, kinda naughty, met her ass at the party
Took her to the after party, drink some gin off her body
Spend some ends, now I'm going in
Took her and her friend, hit the skins
Then we smoked again, eyes like I'm Korean
Shots of gin, that's what all this juice is for
In Blacc Hollywood, that's my newest car
I'm like eney meeney, I got plenty
Pockets filled with hundreds, fifties
Nothin' lower, come fuck with a stoner and get stoned
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hope you pop a lot of bottles 'cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love

52,House in the Hills,2014,Blacc Hollywood (2014),,Wiz Khalifa,"Got no time for the conversations or funny shit
Nigga, only the reals who I get my money with
Used to turn on the TV, see what I want
And now the same one I dreamed about, the same one I'm stuntin' in
In the 6-2, almost 26
And every nigga that I'm with got a zip
I look at this shit as one big table and best believe every nigga I'm with got a sit
They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us, then sell it straight to the public
You young, black, then you thuggin'
What they don't talk about the kid that came from nothin'
Who stuck to what he believed in and turned himself into something great
They should use that story to motivate
But instead they'd rather focus on the fact that he's a pothead
Not the fact there's not a lot where I lived
25 and not dead
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
The man that start what they knew and they ain't (?) away
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills
You make a little money, take care and right yourself
And people start coming up with they hand out
People take their stresses and make them yours
Well that's just what comes with being a man
I try to do all that I can to make sure that
My son grow up without having to see half of the stuff I've been through
But in life we all got our own path
Don't understand that by now you won't begin to
Cop another Rollex or Porsche try and get even with me
Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like the dealer with me
'Cause we had so many cars it was stupid
So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me
Made a couple million and fast too
They ain't teach a young nigga that in the classroom
Or how to make your people better by taking knowledge and spreadin' it
Not being in the game but ahead of it
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
The man that start what they knew and they ain't (?) away
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills
Thousand dollar benefit plates
No matter how high the stakes, niggas never outta place
Now I'm high, Empire State
Drunk stumblin', never will I tumble far from grace
I'm one of them under-celebrated greats
Under the influence of what Uncle Snoop threw me
Soon as I stepped off the plane
Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine
Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne
I been in the crib enjoying my hobbies
Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me
Try me
Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy
I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran
Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in
Come out with the whole hen
A dollar and a dream
Have a house on the hill and the world on a screen
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
The man that start what they knew and they ain't (?) away
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills

53,Hustlin,2011,Cabin Fever (2011),,Wiz Khalifa,"If I said it, I meant it nigga...
We all in... everything's taylored
And fuck it, we ain't gotta go to the store no more
I got my own papers baby girl, I'm finna get my own weed too
Get you a pound and let you roll that shit
Uh, I'm rollin' up the windows while I'm smoking weed
Driving through my town like I don't know the speed
Countin' so much paper I can't fold it up
Bad bitch, she sucks me while I'm rollin' up
Yeah bitch, you probably see me everywhere
Money long, now my house got TV's everywhere
Literally everywhere you turn you see a flat-screen
New bitch... looked nothing like my last fling
Ridin' in a Maserati nigga no shirt
Niggas probably hatin' on me but it won't work
Camo shorts on like a general
Mind on a meal blowin' on medicinal
I'm just a young nigga hustliiiiiiiiin yeah...
Hustliiiiiiiiiiiiiiinn yeah... (X2)
Been through every nigga town, neva had a problem
Young millionaire, never had a job though
Throw that money up and watch her hit the ground
As long as your money up she said it's goin' down
Brought her homegirl said that she don't do friends
Kicked the bitch out and make her find new friends
Should I get hella high or buy some new rims
745 or a new benz
I take every day and live like it's the weekend
Doin' it all if you ain't ballin, take a seat then
If I said it, I meant it... throw a stack at that bitch'ass
And make her pay her rent with it
I'm just a young nigga hustliiiiiiiiin yeah...
Hustliiiiiiiiiiiiiiinn yeah... (X2)"
54,I Choose You,2006,Show and Prove (2006),,Wiz Khalifa,"I oh, I choose you baby
That's what the game told me
Ain't nothin' change, still the same man
The game chose me, sing
Oh, I choose you baby
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin' change, this is what the game told me
Listen close here youngin'
See I've been doing this here the most fed coming chea
And not a dude that a post here frontin
See niggas pay attention to mine
You listen and find, you gone hear something
I know
Niggas wanna know how I came up
He only 18, they see him stacking his change up
And alot of niggas chose to get in the game
But difference from you damn pricks
The prince was hand picked
The young guy is about as fly as it can get
They want I, 'cause I supply and demand quick
I'm C4 explosive is how ya man spit
And I got a seat for anyone who can't stand it
I ain't chose the game, the game chose me
A lil fame from the rap, but still the same OG
'Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey
But always making sure they know me
That's when the game told me
I oh, I choose you baby
See I ain't choose the game, the game choose me
A lil fame, but still the same OG
That when the game told me
Oh, I choose you baby
'Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey
But always making sure they know me,
That's when the game told me
And you know
I can't get enough, it's like I got a fetish for it
Too many wack MC's for me to just ignore it
I get on track simply to flood the state with heat
Stack my cake and eat, preaching more then they the streets
Seen them teens drop out the bumping the corner
Money and order, so they don't even want their diploma
Me, I'm tryna make a company owner
So while that may be tempting, this rap shit is bringing the ends in
And some say that (what?) there will be no one greater than him
One day that (what?) non believers, I'll convince em
I'm more of a leader and eating like I'm supposed to
Talk by the older dude, stand on my own two (yes)
And I'm deep in the game, not like I toasted be
I get somewhere if a lane, they took over me
Somewhere down the line, the grind molded me
It's so sick and this what the game told to me
I oh, I choose you baby
That's what the game told me
Ain't nothin' change, still the same man
The game chose me, sing
Oh, I choose you baby
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin' change, this is what the game told me
Now ima take you back to 97
I put in work to grind better
I was now with a rhyme fetish
Aged quicker, and seeing things in a different way
Was fourteen when I figured I had some shit to say
So I let it be known
That the tighter with top spitter
I'm coming for em, ready to own
And if somebody better let 'em be shown
I'm a comptetitive dude, plus I'm ten steps ahead of you fools, they say
I oh, I choose you baby
See I ain't choose the game, the game choose me
A lil fame, but still the same OG
That when the game told me
Oh, I choose you baby
'Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey
But always making sure they know me,
That's when the game told me"

Between the star life, and your life
Me, I live the star life

They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar
Don't act like you know, I know just who you are
Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star
Yeah
And you know that, but you can't stand it
Out of this world I'm from a different planet
See how I landed?, big ol' chain on
Tight ass white tee, black chuck tays on
I make great songs, my shit classic
See y'all CD, walk right past it
Call me acid that's how I do y'all
Heat niggas up till I can see right through y'all
Never slipped out, goons right by me
Hear niggas talk shit but they don't try me
Can't do front door, don't got I.D
Straight up the elevator to the V.I.P
Drink my drink up, blow my weed smoke
Bitch don't say shit, let my team poke
Bout my money, you see me grinding
There go a hater, you see me shinin'?
When I come through watch me put my game on
Fresh from my head down, big ass chain on

Yeah I am a star, look inside my car
They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar
Don't act like you know, I know just who you are
Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star
Rocks in my charm look like boulders
Young and rich so my hoes much older
Me I'm cleaned up, tats all over
Know I'm getting it. home girl told her
No not sober, need my weed lit
Keep my blunt rolled, ain't no secret
Blow like 3 zips, me and po run
Brand new Guccis, big ass chain on
Where my plane goin' down Miami
Sun gon' tan me, palm trees fan me
Takin' pictures where my fans be
Niggas sit down, they can't stand me
Straight from the Burgh', taylor gang my family
Hustle heavy that's why we cakin
Get my shine on that's why they hatin'
As soon as I pull up y'all can't say shit
When I come through watch me put my game on

56,I'm Gonna Ride,2006,Show and Prove (2006),,Wiz Khalifa,"See a nigga well know for switchin states, mackin broads, gettin' cake
Clockin mags, cock and blast, on a bitch nigga for the quick escape
I move with the dudes that be dishin weight,
Smooth with the uz that will hit your face,
Came in the game,
And I'm changin the game, with a flow that'll run around the crews that hate
This guy is a pimp and you know this fam, I don't hold the grams of a colder man
And I do it for the youngins and the older fans,
Niggas whippin in the kitchen just to hold the gram
I don't play around, lay 'em down, for the little homie wanna play the clown
I came to pounce, spray your rounds,
Follow a nigga, cause its goin' down
Money in a rubber band, slangin crack rock
So you did it round a man with a flat top,
Ask anyone in the streets, everyone around know wiz a beast
And I'm killin' a beef you could chill on the team, pull the steal and relase,
I'm up in your brain, you bet on me takin' a loss, you better be cuffin yo chain.
See this guy here is a nuisance, you talk fly and can't prove it
You just lie up in your music, send my guys to come and shoot shit
Duke I ride, and this as true as you will die if niggas pullin
I don't know what you fuckin' see
When its well know that y'all can't see me
P-I, T-T-S, B-U, R-G-H,
Represent to the fullest and I'm puttin' cowards back in the place,
When I""m rappin' their taste,
They ain't crackin' a place, laugh in your face, lay up and chill, after you say,
That's a mistake,
'Cause I'm all over a gang of ill guys lookin' like their lives out of date.
So why you say? cause my nigga, I could die today,
Knock down, never see the light of day,
Get in that chest and I hide away,
So I never give the cats a ride away,
Fire inside that made the kid move through the fools on the right to take the game,
Back to the time of the rhymin age, came back for the fact that guys are fakin,
I can't even believe you can spit, shit to the people I get,
Chips and just leave you with kids, that leave you see through your bricks,
Hear my shit and overdose, sold you rope and sold some coke,
Moved some crack how true is that, front on my cats you'll lose your back,
Finna get stacks till I'm through with rap, and I've been on my tracks with truth in fact,
Killin' 'em all, wacks, and I'm movin cats, with a crew in all black, ya I'm doin' that
I gotta flavor that will fuck with your taste, and imma do it till I'm blue in the face
I think 'n' figure that any nigga that thinkin' that he pullin the place,
Is gonna need to have a tool on his waste."

Only just for a week
I'd look myself in the mirror
And shoot the first thing I seen
No honestly I'd try to find someone else
And I'd make it seem like it's his fault
That I'm broke and can't get on
And he's doin' shit I can't do for myself.
If I were a lame
I'd probably understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate anotha man
Shit I'd say that I'd
Should be right in his place
And talk shit behind his back
When I'm smilin' while I'm in his face
'Cause I'm just a lame.
If I were a lame
I'd talk shit to the hoes
Like you shouldn't fuck with that nigga
He ain't rich
I heard he really broke
I would get on a song
And talk as bad as I can
Bout how I wish I'd catch him slippin'
How his mixtapes don't be shit
And how I'm gone end his career
But I'm his numbah one fan.
If I were a lame
I'd probably understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate anotha man
Shit I'd say that I'd
Should be right in his place
And talk shit behind his back
When I'm smilin' while I'm in his face
'Cause I'm just a lame.
It's killin' me how niggas act anytime I come around
No matter how much I do for myself
They wanna bring me down
But I juss gotta do me at the end of the day
'Cause I'm not a lame
So I can't understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
No it ain't my fault
My shit flies off the shelf
So stop tryna be somebody
And worry about juss bein yourself
If you could juss be yourself
And don't be a lame

No don't be a lame

Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
Put it in a joint, not a blunt
Don't disrespect mine, player
This not the two, this the one
Don't even need a scale
Back in high school I used to be the weedman
Quarter ounces, half ounces, what you need, man
Eleventh grade, made my way up to a P, man
And sent it back if I ever seen a seed, man
And you don't even gotta ask
You know it by the smell
I treat every day like it's a payday
Top down, counting up the cake and

If you wanna take a hit you can't be afraid of heights
You gon' need some new lungs, roll me up a blunt-a-thon
While I'm smoking out the bong getting sucked like a thumb
Boy I'm in a daze, tangerine haze
I smoke so much KK they should've called it Juicy J
Bombay and lemonade, weed get the lemon taste
Never hit the bong, let me demonstrate
Go and roll it, chief and choking, marijuana, reefer smoking
Trap the semi sum under Reggie, foot up in his colon
Call the doctor, call the clinic, bullshit we staying with
Your life ain't worth a motherfucking quota, what you paying with?
Khalifa kush a hundred pounds, that's a half a mil
Memphis streets so eat this like a baby, like Enfamil
Lungs full of KK, have your mind on a runway
Blow my high, motherfucker, I'mma shoot up like an AK
My white house higher than Willie Nelson, on dabs the wax is melting
These clouds are smoking, help me, I'm flying like Elroy Jetson
I might bring a dispensary down in Tennessee
Whole pounds of grandaddy, but he ain't no kin to me

I been runnin' the town
Lot a chicks thought I was nuttin
All of a sudden, wanting me know
Doing research and hunting me down

Trying to see what's on your mind and something
Got a place to unwind, it's nothing
Have a wild discussion

Never see myself loving a chick, you might change that
And if not, I'm happy being the same cat you
Think it's a shame that, that's how it has to be
But you with another dude, that'd be sad to see
You still mad at me, some high school tragedy
Seeing how I played your home girl who had it bad for me
I'm like whoa, slow down baby, and
Kick it with your man itta go down crazy
I wanna get to know ya
Talk to ya hold ya

Drop the top, let your hair go, free in the wind
Now we can go and get a room on the other side of town
Or give me head in the whip if you wanna ride around
Roll up the koheeba getting blunted by the pound
I made it to the top, who thought I rubbled from the ground
Bird city, who holdin' it down, me and my man whiz
Hit the club, Buy the bar, we let the champ fizz
Knockin' couple of brauds you know the plan is
We call the whole crew, and then we ran trillz
I'm so street I feel a part of the canvas
Hard knocks University the heart of the campus

And you here so pretend ya man don't even exist
And get your lips wet lyk a lisp

Yeah

Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got your name and your words will never break
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bona Ville hoping I could make it
Out selling peas and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name 'cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated

Rolling weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy begin so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good cali bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngling my nigga
Juicy do all them drungs
Niggas smoking that beverage weed
I be on that light green
Pop marley in the after hours
A member of no slit team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps
You know I'm fresh up out that corner, pussy marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we on us
Got acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in no hole
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let 'em ill it straight
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebre
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch me
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie

Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggers holding on their heat
Throwing up their side rolling up that leaf
Ondoers get high all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my nigga dirty crocked I just had to make it on
And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner

And rosee bottles for the pain
The lines that I ink make rappers get kinda nervous
People telling me to sink when I'm trying to surface
Groupies all up in my face like they got a purpose
'Cause we ain't gotta pour drink bring bottle service
Orange juice and some more flutes
Let a friend sky dive man I need more shoots
I'm live wire you a cord loose
No charge I go so hard
Hookin up a table on a promo tour
Say I live a dream but I'm just on my job
And can't quit 'cause the first class flights get addictive
Try and get a ticket
Say I'm on my way but I don't know where I'm going
Been gone so many days don't know my way back home
Now I'm starin' out this window
And I see my life in aerial so
I might as well write my name on a cloud
Ain't comfortable but got my feet up
Its hard to hear you when you thirty thousand feet up
Claims since I got my cheese up
I been walking round chest out like some D cups
Ole g puff say you got it locked and we found out it's the key stuck
Used to fuckin' with that cheap stuff
I show you rosee bottles of that cleeko
Than we drink till we fall
And when you wake up and realize what you did
It'll be me that you call
But I'll be on a plane
And even though we had fun
Shit I don't know your name
Say I'm on my way but I don't know where I'm going
Been gone so many days don't know my way back home

Niggas say damn change, wiz couldn't give a fuck
Spit it like my last song, one life live it up
Niggas see damn's change, kids couldn't get a buck
So please don't approach me man
Like this a free show, cause you don't know me me fam
And please don't extend your hands like you know we fam
And please don't pretend like we only scram
Where was all this love at when I was only can?
When I was tryna sell y'all my only jam?
I don't keep friends, I'm my only fan
And take falls, I'll never, I will only stand
Ima make this all riches, is what I totally did
If you don't know me now, then how you know me then?
And I hope y'all loving the kid, but if not, its
""Never too late, too late to start start, never too late, too late to start start""
I'm tryna have the strip all whipped out
Crib all pimped out
Chicks smiling in my face, tongues all licked out
Flat on the front side, back all sticking out
Waiting for that one time, a rap nigga did it out
But you gone have to slow up love
Tryna skee 'cause she think ima blow up 'cause
All she thinking me getting her nails done, and her hair done
Ma I'm not the one
Ion need no chick plotting all my tricks
No birds tryna fly with me on my trips,
If I am with a Miss, she a down ass chick,
So take a sec, just chill and get off my tip
I'm just tryna get rich of these tracks I get
And you tryna get rich off the scratch I get
And you chicks think it's all about bread, but it's not, its...

I'm tryna have the city on lockdown
Fam off the block now
Money coming fast, more cash then the cops now
Would harass, but they can't really not now
Used to laugh, but your man's really hot now
I used to rap for the kids in class
Told 'em I would use rap just to get my cash
And I was on the word about how to get my math
And told my teachers and the staff they can kiss my ass
'Cause I can't find a interest in my book
So I stayed to myself and every class I took
Supposed to be doing work, but I made my hooks
'Cause I get motivation everywhere I look
And I show no regret for any chance I took
But I learn from mistakes just like I should
So if you dudes ain't paid your dues, for you fools its...

Here people sayin' shit about the way I am but I know that ain't true
At times I feel like I'm all by myself and I know you do too
I made some phone calls and checked emails 'cause I'm always grindin'
Ain't no rush, I do things slow 'cause it's all about timing
Some people think when you get to this point in life you've made it
I've seen so many settle for less, that's when talent get wasted
I ain't there, but if I can I'mma try to be perfect
And for those that's ridin' with me, I'mma try to make it worth it
I drink too much, I'm into weed, 'cause it's better for the stress

I'm talkin' ?, leather seats I sit on
This ain't just how I feel today, this the shit I been on, I been on
People always talkin' about what they think they know
About what they think I'm doin', how I feel, and where I go
But no matter how much money I make, I'm gon' stay the same
Since I've been up at the top ain't too much changed
'Cause we already on

And on and on, and on and on
Never smoked weed that was quite this strong
Never took a flight this long
Never drank champaign in Italy
Never spent a night in Rome
But it's funny cause those are the exact same things
That helped me write this song
Caught up livin' a life where tryin' to do all the right things feels wrong
So I keep rollin' and lightin' up and prayin' to God that we live long

Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter
Nigga, you know everything Taylored
Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper
That's the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through
Rollin' doobies up, ya hoe who we pass 'em to
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool

Plus I'm struggling tryna find the keys to my car
'Cause I be going hard, roll the camera
Life just like a movie, I'm the star
Wish you was in my position
You too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back
Sippin' Rose with some hash twistin'
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin'
Straight out the burb, we drinking we smash niggas
So when I say I'm balling, that don't mean that I'm playing mate
All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin' mayne

In the middle of the night, early in the mornin'

Lightyears past the class
Hit it, don't have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
You's a fan, I'm a player
I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade
Good to you

All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can't say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
It means haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne 'cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

But instead they hating on what I've been doing
Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em
What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em
Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning
If the flight is private, we probably should board it
You see it you like it, I can probably afford it
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know
Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches
Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show
Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow
And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go
Started small but now we all in them bigger game
All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above
But we still rise above
My phone is dead, but I got a contact
My sharpie paint pen on my Timbo combats
You talk shit, I won't respond back
What they gon' get, and you don't want that
That nigga will forget the deal
Remember what? get for real
My whip appeal, my crib is real
My wrist as well you know... the Richard Mille
And my grunge nigga, I make her come quicker
Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga

Multitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin'
House of rollin' run a business while I'm tourin' on you bitches
Doing features while watching a double feature nigga
I see you suffering from haterism, get that check
I take nothin' and make somethin' there's no breaks when the hustle's runnin'
Ain't dealin' with fakes ain't fuckin' with snakes
They all in my face now they got what it takes my nigga I'm straight
So don't reach out 'cause I peaced out when I reached out
There's no response like knockin' on an empty house
Yeah, so I keep on while you peep on what I be on and you're behind

And they say they ballin? but I do it how the pros do
Where we goin' next? we gon let my hoes choose
No socks and my boat shoes
Guess a n-gga eating good like whole foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ride wit me so she pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high roll up weed up like I'm supposed too
And now I'm into big things
On the building you need to know the tenant rate
Gettin' paid still ridin' no shirt
Let a b-tch give me brain call it home work
N-ggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work
Alota shit done change
New clothes new car new things
Sayin' boy they used to be at the bottom
Came up that's what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowedd in the building
But now we on the roof top
Slow money just better than gettin' no money
Learn to get good show money, that's yo money
Get comfortable with it, really know money
Rich n-gga shit, that really goes for me
Self made n-gga, well played
I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade
You tryna copy what's done, I'm tryna innovate
And club owners getting tired of tryna ventilate
Big mistake
I'm too busy finding places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like ?who is this??
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independence day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My n-ggas keep it real, so I hear what they say
Either you getting paid, or you paying to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way
(Curren$y)
Uh, just made a million, got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless
You n-ggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did
They hatin' was the fuel for this shit so you wrote your own check off a hoe ass
Sweatin bullets at home, wondering if she coming back
? And she she can smell it on ya
That's why you only see her when you buying stuff for her
We was sneaking in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena deciding who allowed in it
Our windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'?
Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin? and chillin'
We plooted this out, one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twisting
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it
Twit-pic?ing when we get it and they mad at us
F-ck them n-ggas

By the way that she making that ass shake
I just told baby do what she do
She the type I got to search for
Wasn't handed to me, had to work for it
They riding the wave like a surf board
While the boy hotter than the earth core
Told her wait til' I go get my cash right
When the money was low she didn't act right

T-Pain, they sayin' I couldn't believe it
Funny 'cause they say the same thing when they see me
The way I spit you would say I was bulimic
And this beat so hard
I had to say I did a remix
Niggas hate they don't say it but they think it
When you lame I can't hear what you sayin' when you speakin'

I can't I'm livin' what others sayin' they dream is
Now the hoes sayin' I'm conceited
'Cause they wanna give me brains
And I say I don't need it
I'm gettin' paid and payin' so much attention
To what these radios playin' and sayin' to me ends
I ain't sayin' I'm that deep in

In a year they gon say I'm Michael Phelps
And you gon think to yourself
Before you jump into the deep end
It was said that my city was sleepin'
Outta state I had to say what that P meant
""I put on"" like Kan said on that Jeezy
Come to where I live the kids say I'm like He-Man
Doin' everything that you say I can't

You can say I plan
Tired of sayin' shit to make these niggas understand

Twenties on the floor
Kids wit dirty handguns posted by the door
When I was 14 they used to send me to the store
To bring back blunts, now I'm the one that's rollin' up
Speakers bump, iPhone plug-in for my truck

Every night late comin' home when I call
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I feel like you're lyin' to me when I'm askin you
Sometimes...
Wiz:
I hear you talkin' to me
You sick and tired of the kid man
Sometime you feel like you talkin' through me
That's when you walk up to me
Trying for attention
Ma listen
You wild'n Stop trippin'
'Cause a nigga work too hard too long
Always got a show or in the studio doin' a new song
Them other dudes couldn't walk with my shoes on
Still I come home hearin bout what I do wrong
Pullin stunts and
Rollin' blunts
With my dudes from the hood
But to you they no good
I'm just doin' what I could
And that's givin' the circumstances
You only get one shot at these certain chances
Instead of trying to find dirt
And where your manners
Try and understand when that work demanded
And no mama that's not a punch line
I'm always there when its crunch time
But still you say

Your home girls got my every move on replay
Scream'n how you know niggas
And the games that we play
But all the while I've been grindin for this weeks pay
Hustlin each day in order to eat right
Call me sayin' she need me in order to sleep right
Not really knowin' what these streets like
So you stay up until I come back
A nigga love that
Help me relax
Warm plate an the dub sack
And after that proceed the bend the back
Then I'm back to politics the usual
And sometimes I wanna talk to get through to you

Cloud crowd.
Heavy hustlin.
Yeah.
Big money, small money
Short money, tall money
Soon after we locked eyes,
I had a vision of me inside.
I stimulate your mind and give your body everything it wants.
Private school her whole life,
Got an infatuation with being bad.
You take her out to shop and spend it all,
'Cause she don't see them tags.
I get deep inside her soul though,
If she was a guitar I'd treat her like the solo,
And pull my fingers through your hair.
And last night was amazing,
I could honestly say that you're the best I ever had.
And you don't remember cause you weren't even there,
But your soul was.
Keep goin', just catch up on the next one.
Ay.
Ay, ay.
Ay.
We don't make love, I touch your soul girl.
She don't party where the rest go.
You need to be able to let your hair down,
So you can feel good.
Girl you can buy your own drinks, drive your own car,
Purchase them louis bags on your own.
Her parents money long,
But since she grown she'd rather spend yours.
I get deep inside her soul though.
Go into the drag and beat it like I'm bolo.
And so you think it's too much.
And even though now you figurin out how or what we shouldn't have did,
To your friends you'll admit that we have fun.
Okay, okay.
Ay, ay.
Ay, ay.
Let's ride to the gate so you can meet the mayor.
I'm a beat top man,
I'm gonna take you to never never land.
When you're all dried up,
Heres an ocean to wet the sand.
Of course I'm gonna see what's good with your fancy car.
I'm relighting in the dark, to her lock I got the key.
And niggas down to get a copy.
Damn.
How does it feel this great when you're not even here?
And you climax with the thought of me,
That mean we gotta be."

Champagne with bitches with foreign names

Got the bottle, bring the trees

Askin silly questions, bout where you been

Could've married to it no woman.

Rolling presidential no election
Bought the floor I for the set look like its residential
Can't just call you got to schedule in or let me know ahead?
My time is money if you talking and I hope its bout some bread
Ain't nothing like them other niggas
Naah they don't even compare
Got reefer flowing through my body
Money growing out my hair
I wouldn't say I do too much but hey
I do just enough to get by
And I done been a lot of places in my day
But I never been this high
Smoking drinking all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
Smoking drinking all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke lets smoke away we go
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke lets smoke away we go
I probably took some time off 'cause I was bored of the game
I probably missed your call 'cause I was boarding the plane
Or some other shit
Now roll some weed Put some hash in
Light that tree up and pass it
All these clothes in my closet
Like I need all this fashion
And this car that I'm driving'
Made for speed not for crashing
If you smoking I got it
Being brokes not the object ya feel me

I got that food for your thought, plus what the streets thirst
And you can ask around the haters'll know,
I'm tame with the flow, I'm sorta like the jaeger and blow
I see the dream like a martin luther, I preach to the constitution in peace,
But violate it, get that ass annihilated
I'm on the grind, money is time so why waste it
And everything but my piss clean, I'm high maintenance
You niggas are weak, sweet like one of them now-and-laters
The canon blast your candy ass if you try and hate it,
I made it, 'cause I stayed a couple steps ahead of y'all and
A hundred percent, since benji got the bread involved I'm,
Lovin' this shit, come fuck with the prince,
I'm leavin' heads hollowed like them things stuffed in the clips
And the streets gon' remember this cat name, I'm beatin' the rap game
Just like nigga huggin the strip (why?)
Cause that's how a hustler do, fall back I don't fuck with you,
We make it happen the clappin know we can scrum with you
Yeah we can take it to the heads, give you a lump or two
A fool is still, team bring heat like a oven dude
(Chorus x2) ladies stand up, gentlemen stand up,
This is pure skill, far from damned luck,
You gotta make a plan to never give your man up
And man up, to positively stand up
Once again the youngest sin came to drop the hammer
How could a bystander feel that this is not bananas?
We earn stripes, you all hype in that propaganda,
Gats spot, you cats shot, but not from cameras,
Back glock, cause snap shots'll stop your plan up,
Stuck in my ways, the haze taste like tropicana,
Thinkin' the days of way back, people will say that,
The youngin was gifted sick when he stayed back
Now the people listenin play back, I got it made
Obligated to gettin' passin grades and blaze tracks,
You'll be amazed at how I make units move
Self-made, twelfth grade, boy I'll take you to school
I'm through the streets of pistolvania where my goonies move,

And you can find me speedin, listenin to big and em,

And I can do what I what, went form being hated on
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on
Ain't no love lost but ain't no love shown
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song
Party every weekend, hardly ever home
Don't see me face to face so you have to talk about me when I gone
Stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)

Get you to buy us a drink than it's over 'cause
We back around the time that she sober'd up
Shit ain't been the same since the limosuine showed up
The best moments of my life
Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life
Rarely gon to see, smoking with ya wife

But I'm just out here putting on for anyone who knows me
No, I ain't in my position getting comfy
Drinking bigger and ifa chief and bring alisa oz
I stay with me some backup, in case you run up on me
He gonna play the pastor, make a nigga holy
They call me the 501 Don
Mr. know he got a pear of 501's on
My marijuana strong and these hoes ain't shit but probably calls
Dog I met her at the club, we was fucked up wildin
Made it to my crib we was both drunk, driving
Now you on some lame shit, claiming you're my main bitch
Do us both a fav, don't text, don't call me, darling
I was made to ball it's like Spaulding rolling
They say I'm the bomb and they call Wiz, atomic
Hotter than New Orleans, or a geoge foreman grill,
And Chevy eyes caught like Jalil
I'll is what I go so I need sudafed,
Big dog nigga all y'all poodle fed
Money in the wall all through the vent
Still got time to blow"
133,Stay Focused,2017,"Laugh Now, Fly Later (2017)",,Wiz Khalifa,"Started small with nothing
Now I got it all
I still want more
Who say I can't have that too?
You feel me...
Foot on the gas, both hands on the steering wheel
Jumped in the game, 'cause I know it's real
Heard it'll change you, I know it will
Gatting still, we made it over the hill
Being broke, I know how it feel
All about a dollar bill
And seeing my son grow up
See, they ain't know what they focus was
That's when I see my lane open up
Drinking champagne on boats
So drunk that I'll probably spend a month sober
Little more famous but a lot older
Been through situations, niggas acting bipolar
You don't always keep it real with me, I don't know ya
Say they good intentions, but they not even close
Say they got sick of whips, but I'm driving the most
Nigga I be on my shit, you ain't gotta provoke me
Fuck you talking 'bout it
You know it ain't like it was before
I know it feel like I've been here before
We know that it's all about the dough
If it ain't we out the door...
Hit the bank and I'm counting more
I know to the top's where we can go
You know that it's all about the dough
If it ain't we out the door
All I know is I been here before
Blew that smoke in the air before
Smell like dope in the airport
I'm the one that they're cheering for
Lotta kush smoke, that's what they preparing for
Gave you solid shit before now you hearing more
Seeing my niggas on top that's what I stand for
And only money conversations what I care for
And anytime you eat just know you gotta share yours
Them niggas out to get you, claiming they down
Shit change when you turn around
So it's no love for them
It's only papers when I roll up
Focus on the money now and not later
Ain't got the time to play
Thirteen cars in the driveway
God telling me keep going
One foot on the gas, two hands when I'm rolling
(Ay what chu doin' nigga?)
Getting mine and staying focused
You know it ain't like it was before
I know it feel like I've been here before
We know that it's all about the dough
If it ain't we out the door...
Hit the bank and I'm counting more
I know to the top's where we can go
You know that it's all about the dough
If it ain't we out the door
So you really need all those?
That's how much you gon smoke?"

Hanging onto what niggas told me ""get your paper up""
You work hard for what you got, they could never take it from you
All you need is a little patience, let me demonstrate
All my niggas in the game, we talkin' 'cause we been through it
Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded

Make sure my team keep ballin' and the hoes keep callin'
And the money keep fallin' on the floor
Where you tryna go, only care about what's in your drink
You tryna go hard, don't think about tomorrow
Don't care about what people think
You don't care about waitin' outside
You be with everybody up in the front
You yellin' ""face down, ass up"" up in the club
And now we turning up (let's party)
I'm in the club rolling weed like I'm Marley
Smoking dearly departed
That's kill, too real, come to me get it started
And The bottles be poppin' like its 4th of July
We just pourin' them shots, back shooting corks in the sky
Pouring some for the girls, and pouring more for my guys
'Cause we made it my niggas, I just wanna thank my niggas
Hear niggas talking shit, but they ain't my niggas

They tried to put me into that lane
And we had to go our separate ways
Instead of fussin and flippin out
I did my thing and figured it out
Security trippin' I ain't puttin' it out
Smokin' round
And all my peoples got champagne, fast cars by the bar wasted
Potent marijuana that aroma make her wana taste it

She in this king size bed with me.
Give her space boy, Let her breathe.

Got rich when they said I can't
Got high and got on the plane
And brought all my niggas when they said I can't
Went shopping places they said I can't
Bought some shit that they said I can't
Jumped on the road and did all them shows
'Cause I was poppin' places they said I ain't
Went hard in places they said I can't
Promoters call and try and set up dates
Bought the car with that yellow paint
Go to parties now and they set up drinks
And it's first class so I'm private plane
Nudie jeans with my Get Up Mane!
Rollin' papers and Mary J
I made eleven mill and I'm still the same
What's with all these niggas and they feelings, man?
All of this and I'm still the man
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money I'm a business man
Out of all these niggas I'm the realest man
What's with all these niggas and they feelings, man?
All of this and I'm still the man

Ballin' hard and you in the stands

Out of all these niggas I'm the realest man
Out of all these niggas, they callin' me the realest
Started underneath the floor, now my money through the ceiling
Always staying on my grind, turned nothing to a million
Used to just tryna live, now a nigga make a killin'
Gold rollie on my arm, ten rings like a don
Cuban links in my chain, Zigzag on my charm
Champagne on ice, good weed in the jar
Everything Armans, Chanel seats in the car
When you all know; them fuck niggas start hatin'
Talkin' bout what they gon' do but I'm waitin'
When you getting rich they doubt you
Shout out my gang and my brother Will 'cause I couldn't do this without you
For real!
What's with all these niggas and they feelings, man?

All this money I'm a business man
Out of all these niggas I'm the realest man
Eighteen racks I paid it though
To send them goons straight to ya door
To show you niggas what's real
And let you meet that .44

Glock to your head nowhere to run
Catch you niggas when you by yourself
We gon' hit you niggas with a hundred drums
Both low no bad bitch
Good drink I'm famished
Bank account outlandish
Big wrist stay sittin' on Lamb bitch
Niggas out there tryna test me

Don't fight with hoes, don't fight with niggas
No security bitch so don't test me
Double cup full I be sippin' up
My niggas man real criminals
If a nigga find you they gon' hit ya up
With a Bin Laden chopping the switcher up
All these hoes be jockin' tryna get with us
They gon' swallow this nut, no spittin' up
Your niggas get murked your niggas in jail
My team gettin' money stay full of drugs
What's with all these niggas and they feelings, man?
All of this and I'm still the man
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money I'm a business man
Out of all these niggas I'm the realest man"

Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's
My dime piece only recognise the best tree's

Nothing, they ain't singing my song
Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along
We flying up, now you want me to take it all off
Want me to take it all off
Tell a bitch I'ma ball and I'ma buy a new crib for my niggas 'n' all
'Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all
Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star

And nope, I don't hear these niggas trippin'
Closing the cabin door and reving up all my engines
The weed is rolled, the drink is cold
It's new to you, to me it's old
C-E-O, these off brand niggas ain't really the future, Ms. Cleo
High when I approach, been known, to leave weed crumbs and trails of Sour D smoke
The irony, of suckas who predicted the planes land and know they wanna fly with me
I just let it boost my confidence, roll another joint, drop pilot shit. O-K.
This ain't the life that we chose, but it's the life that we living
Know we belong on the top, but we ain't trippin'.
'Cause we'll get there in a minute
And we'll get there in a minute, 'cause we'll get in there in a minute
Know we belong on the top but we ain't trippin'.
'Cause we'll get there in a minute.
Ask me if I plan to be roof top chillin' with some pretty ass women, you'd be glad to meet
Trees stuffed in the passenger seat, charge it to my phone, 'couple changes of clothes
And the OG told me all haters expose they self, so it's best to leave it alone
Pop the cork, put the tree in the bone
Been here for a minute you niggas just catchin' on
Master of the craft, I've grown
Haters trail the path, I've flown
It's obvious, suckas talk down but we ain't trippin'
Hoes fuck with us, say we different
At my hotel chillin', bad women come to fill my marijuana perscription
You niggas know the biz, it's Taylor Gang or kill him.

Any bill she can't front, her parents paid it
The show was far, you the only one with a car
And your girlfriends, but being that's she's a big fan, of course she made it

Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it

Fuck the room we buy the hallway

Just get real airy, fuckin' dreamy and shit
Wake up drunk go to sleep fucked up
We both amazed at what we just done
Mixin' drinks, knowin' we'll regret this
Ain't been asleep yet, room service bringin' us breakfast
All this money, darlin', what else is left to do

178,Won't Land,2009,Burn After Rolling (2009),,Wiz Khalifa,"Nigga, yeah, fresh up off the plane
Real niggas embrace my music and bitches go insane
Even they kids throwin' up the gang
They don't bother pronouncin' my name
They just look at my chain
Boy how much you spent on it?
This ain't nothin' but hard work
And what you can get from it
Ain't no toilet paper but this smell like the shit
Don't it?
Smokin' chronic and drinkin' gin
Till we get sick stomached
And them suckas ain't gotta like it
'Cause ya bitch love it
Ima roll it
She gon' light it
Tell me she in desperate need
Of a pilot
I told her kick her feet up
We gon' go to my crib
Soon as I roll this weed up
Call some friends of yours
And we could all have a smoke out!
You ain't gotta hold it too long
This is rapper weed
Couple hits is all you gon' need
In my Versace frames, I'm blazed!
Somewhere on the island
Smokin' some ray, middle of the day,
Drunk dialin'
Be surprised by how high a nigga get
I'm a different kind of fly, we ain't on the same shit
Nigga!
I won't land
Won't land, won't land (x5)
No need to apologize
You should know how fly niggas do
Only EZ-Widers
Been done with them cigarillos fool
I been on the road choppin' and killin' them interviews
Heard I left a major deal
But my paper major still
And all of them fans in love with me
'Cause I say what's real
So I can never give a fuck!
How a hater feel
But uh, every time they send a driver for me and Will
I call her doin' my talkin' on the field
At first niggas was tough,
They don't wanna be gangstas now
Faces of my flow,
Yeah they copy and paste my style
Wouldn't think I notice it
While in my hotel, smokin' wit yo bitch
Fool! Haha
And this is it, what!
Relax your feet, put on some music
Roll a zip up
And we gon' smoke it till it's gone
Ever see me cough?
Can't speak for suckas who do
Because I'm G'd up! What!
Haha! Ah!"

Coke white, so tight, game over
Coupe to the block, bop to the bang
Car full of girls in a blue Mustang
Four y'all, more y'all, caravan
V.I.P model in hand, bottle in hand
Wobble again
I make it crack in the back a Benz while cracking the frame
On the highway, just me and Wiz
With a dirt dozen, about to handle this
Was they cousins or was they twins?
I love it when they both go all in
Like that, this one and that one
See he wants the cute one, I want the fat one
Bet she pay what she weigh
I'm looking for a Jennifer Holiday in my way

Look nigga I'm the rawest, the mo'fuckin' animal
Want war? One phone call is how I handle you (whew)
On the grind, you pussy nigga's hate
Bitch I'm out in different states, politic, and gettin' cake.
Fill my lungs with the best weed, pockets with them doller signs.
Run with them niggas holdin' glocks like its columbine (pop, pop, pop)
I'm a star, ain't a choice hoe I gotta shine
Far as Pittsburg, I'm the voice so I gotta rhyme.
Grind all the time ever since the 1st day
Now I'm gettin' cake like every day became my birthday
Something like a earthquake, the way this shit drop
I be at the tip top posted with a big knot
You didn't know hoe you sit at home and just watch
Less then haters, stone cold spectators
Same lame's turn out to be investigators
No where near comfortable need extra paper.
Got the city on smash, the streets on lock
100 real niggas with their heats on cock
Got my pockets on swol still need more gwap.
Plus the hood says they love to hear the young boy talk
Ay ay
The jeans spent about a buck 45 on them
If He trick the team, buck 45's on him.
When we hit the scene, the club hoes just pile on him
You scrubs show them groupies love, I just style on them."

Let me roll this weed up and wrap this shit, you know
Too much purple for me
Uh, coming up I always thought I'd be the runner up
Gave my all but it felt like it wasn't enough
I remember spending summers in the studio
My pops told me have fun be a kid for once
What he ain't know, was for a kid a that I had big dreams
I take a small frame turn it into a big screen
Taking best friends turn them to a good team
I'm watching Scarface living all the good scenes
Burning dope thinking about the days when I was broke
Desperate niggas in my city don't know how to cope
Young nigga said he starving he ain't got a meal
Down to catch a body all about a dollar bill
My niggas is all I got so it's more than trust
We ain't even have a car we was on the bus
Public transportation now it's underground we make it
Throw it in the safe I can't hear what they say
I'm packing up my bags
Packing up my bags, packing up my bags
I gotta catch a plane
Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane
I can't be at home
Can't be at home, can't be at home
I gotta be away
Gotta be away, gotta be away
Theirs just way to many niggas I use to know back in the day
Now when I see them out
I just don't got shit to say to you niggas
When I see you in the club I make my way through you niggas
You must be mad I ain't wait on you
But no matter the circumstances I never (?) on you
I'm just taking all my dream trying to make it facts
Putting on for my team trying to make it crack
Getting all sorts of green trying to make a stack
Lose yourself in my city and never make it back
Said he will but the chances are he will never change
Daddy sold dope but you would probably do the same thing
If I get $30K I would probably spend it on my wrist
Fuck these politics when these kids ain't have a pot to piss
Fuck the Promises, the shit I'm on is common sense
If you ain't talking them I'm gone
I'm packing up my bags
Packing up my bags, packing up my bags
I gotta catch a plane
Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane
I can't be at home
Can't be at home, can't be at home
I gotta be away
Gotta be away, gotta be away

And I done popped so many bottles thing I'm through with it
Been smoking so much weed in public own a school with it
Been on my grind since I was young and now I'm stupid rich
You niggas stupid, I'm in the club and it's ruthless
My crew ain't part of that bullshit
My new whips the hardest
Walk in the office like a business man
I'm just an artist
Smoking and all, crib full of weed
Plaques on the wall
My face on all the magazines
Kush in this jar I'm getting this cheese
Pants skinny rubber bands plenty
Whole team going hard like it's the last inning
Whole team going hard you got no chance of winning
Lot of seats on the floor lot of cash pinning
I play the game left hand like my man Jimmy
You just a right hand man call that man semi
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do
All of this off the internet
Those who ain't seen it coming dog I been a threat
Been smoking up all this weed
Been rolling up while I drive
Been to the bottom and back
Been seen you haters disguised
Niggas telling me lies
Just to try to get close
Shades cover my eyes 'cause I be higher than most
Been on the plane for twenty hours, and wasn't tired
Live by the code, money power
Once I got on, my niggas hired
Juicy J he ride, it's the gang or die
The game will stress you out but that's what this dubie is for
You acting like you know me now
Never knew me before
Snoop sat me down, school me even more
Kick it with my son and don't even do the awards
Said next year I might win me one
You got problems don't lend me none
Got a pound then go send me one
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do
Niggas out here broke because they scared of that bread
My money so old I got mold on that bread
How you think I win and copped that Rolls-Royce Corniche?
Turn around and bought a Maybach next week
A nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat
A nigga ain't paying fair, and life ain't cheap
Nigga ain't shit sweet but this box of swisher sweets
Ever since I was a youngin I was
Getting it in the streets
Now I'm on tour even getting it overseas
All the way in Switzerland stacking swisser-cheese
I ain't too good for that brown paper bag
I can still move that work and I get it off fast, hoe
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do
What can I say?

To show how much
Real shit a nigga do"
