0,50 Ways to Make a Record,2008,A Kid Named Cudi (2008),Hip Hop|Electronic,Kid Cudi,"You sit and think about, 
How you can hit the scene.
Take one look inside, 
Your mirror clear to see.
You need to find yourself, 
As honest as can be... 
There must be 50 ways to make a record.
Now Don't get wrapped into, 
The hype and what they think.
This shit ain't rocket science, 
And the scene changes with beats.
And now you ask yourself, 
How you want to be seen... 
There must be 50 ways to make a record.
He's up inside the clubs, 
They like to lean and rock. Oh, 
Stands around and looks intrigued by what he saw.
Now he askes me, 
How he can make hit songs to reach the top... 
There must be 50 ways to make a record.
50 ways to make a record.
You got talent and, 
Your soul cannot be bought.
He looked and smiled at me, 
And told me ""Thanks alot.""
See I could use your help... 
And would you please explain about the 50 ways... 
It's kind of easy, 
If you have a open mind.
This game is more than, 
Spending money and fucking dimes.
It's all within your words, 
Some shit that outlives time.
There must be 50 ways to make a record.
50 ways to make a record..."

No safety, fall, we'll end safely
Inadequate, he is so unwanted
Make him want to disappear
From the fire calling
Damn that is so unfair
Inadequate, he is so unwanted
Make him want to disappear
From the fire calling
Damn that is so unfair
How could I care? How could I care?
How could I care?
And we're floating out to nowhere
No safety, fall, we'll end safely
Lost in my reflection, how do I chill?
Only crazy makes sense, it's starting to make sense
While I'm still
Her vagina is moist and warm
I'll keep you safe, just hold my arm
Hell is beyond the door
Heaven doesn't want one more
No more chicken sandwiches
Yes I'll pay for the damages
I explore through the galaxy nightly
On my body
Accept yourself, except yourself
Exit yourself, access yourself
No safety, fall, we'll end safely
Inadequate, he is so unwanted
Make him want to disappear
No safety, fall, we'll end safely
(?)
That song was kind of freaking me out
Ya it flowed
No safety, fall, we will end safely Beavis
Kind of makes me think about my life ya know
What life?
Ya ya exactly
The part ""We're floating out in nowhere""
Don't worry Beavis we will land safely
How come you're talking lie that Butthead
Like what?
Come on stop it
I'm not talking any differently than I'm normally talk Beavis
Take some of these mushrooms that Cudi gave us
They'll make you feel better
Stop talking lke that Butthead
Like what Beavis?
Take some mushrooms Beavis
These mushrooms suck, but they're fast acting aren't they
These taste horrible
Eat them all Beavis
They're doing something, give me some more
Trust me Beavis"

The moon shines I become alive
Yeah
And every time
The moon shines I become alive
Yeah
I'm feeling strange in the night
I'm in myself I feel I'm thrown into a fight
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, nothing's right
My skin is burning and my heart begins to speed
There's something going wrong with me
I am changing rapidly
I'm feeling stronger, more alert, I'm on the move
I smell her scent and I know I will find her soon (soon, soon)
The one to come and free me from this fate
I'll find her, it's not too late, hey, hey
Everytime
The moon shines I become alive
Yeah
And every time
The moon shines I become alive
Yeah
I'm a beast in the night
I'm on the prowl and I'm hoping to find some light
You call it heaven, I do too, we feel the same
Ain't nothing wrong, I've been feasting on something brave
A sexy lady who's pure, she has the cure, uh
I hope she can find a man within the beast, and
I hope she saves me from the curse I have to beat, hey
I hope she figures out a way to save my soul
Yeah, to save my heart, hey

Nananananananana, whoa
Nananananananana, whoa
I watch the sun collapse and took up in the clizzoud
I am the lone wolf, go where I wanna
Let the moon shine, be the guide to the lizzight
Even when I stray away the light never left me, uh
I learn to follow my instinct
Blinded by the light, rather that than the evil
Feelin' out of place in a room full of people
Try and be the same, but you know you're not a sequel
Your fate will be whatever it shall be, be, be, be, be
We'll fight no more, I let these things just be, be, be, be

Bitches in my ear, they saying they love me
You don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fucking slouch, show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings
Transitioning to my inner, I'm hearing their voice
Tell me stay in focus, keep focusing, boy
Feeling like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore
Mixing fluorescent to the core of the accouterment
Off the tippy titty, setting off my groupie radar
Sipping Hen, dapping hands off the roof of my Porsche
A fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard
All my youngins say keep it going
All my youngins, they dumb and repping, they always knowing
Got some pride in your town, I'm spotting 'em lately
Three piece suit and I'm looking so cute
Sexy mama, send her way, you doing it honey
Them hating fucks sidelining and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here
Big boss, I made your heart heavy
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby
Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky
Did just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama
Phoned home to the moon, did you change your number?
If and when you get this message, need you back home

Nightmares kept a nigga from closing his lids
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant the haunted ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are coming for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxing, I'm whippin'
Last week I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefing good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie is so rock 'n' roll
My princess Vada know rock 'n' roll daddy got the glow
Got some pride in your town, I'm spotting 'em lately
Three piece suit and I'm looking so cute
Sexy mama, send her way, you doing it, honey

Demolition expert, I exert through your network while the tech squirt jerk
There's holes inside your sweatshirt
Through your apparel, through your blood, through your bone marrow
Precise with this mic device, slice your pie like [?]
You falling nigga, and you can't get up
You been stalling motherfucker and your ass is stuck
Brooklyn, Brownsville, baby stay with the Killer Hill crazy
It grows up above the booth
And conceils my three eighty
Are you running for this money money
Hunting eggs like easter bunny
Geeks trying to beast upon me
Freak, I will eat a zombie
Calm and double while you jumping through these hurdles, silly rabbit
The race is over, is won by the turtle
Metal machinery, purple herbal mixed with that greenery
I don't write songs, grasshopper, I write scenaries
Everything ain't what it seems to be
What it means to you it don't mean to me

I workout at 24 fitness
On the weekends, I sip Belvedere with that citrus
My dogs is vicious, exotic
Life is good, I live every day like it's Christmas
Happy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here
I splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear
Trust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out
Long dick stamina, I fuck a bird till she sings out
La la la la, body could convert Lady Gaga
Dr Hannibal sexual, I'm classy like Impala
Plus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas
Like Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla
Four rings like the Green Lantern
You see me in the mean phantom
Pushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton
Or maybe in the Grotti rugged projects of Stanton
Tall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton

That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em ever play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they're my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur a chick call in my trill nigga
I met Duke in 92, and we still niggas
Rocking Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas go'n eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be (x8)
Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they never change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playin'
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money never change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasing got them sucker niggas hating
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' bout crack or we talking about blacks?
So for the blunted, then they picking the gun up
Motherfuckers is tripping if it in in the run up
Then they getting the come up, yup bitch
And they do with the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be (x4)
Hey yo, all right...
I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know then please hit me
No question no hesitation when it come to holdin' fam' down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skipping past
You got me fucked up, keep talking and kiss my ass
No sweating the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If it's a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis
Riding thick and thin till we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished
Clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from going away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasing these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so bothered 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals, that's the code
So long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need it or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad my nigga
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be (x4)"

Well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
The nigga (?) so sad
When I smash wipe the smirk off their face, my bad
Who bad, I am, my dad raised one hell of a man

Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
Come on who gon' go half on a zone
Oh, thought I would be done off the coke, no
Let me tell you something ho
Been said everything that shine ain't gold
Been skeetin' on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
Been the nigga sittin' in hell in fresh ass clothes
I know what it feels like to have a broken nose
And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be ok, with being demented
By the way nigga these cars ain't rented I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted look who the fuck it be

'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui
Feng shui, feng shui, feng shui, feng shui
I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, I shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful
Ooh, tap in to the frequency, love
Ooh, tap in to the frequency, love
The universe never steered me wrong
The universe never lied
Take me bound to the come me down
The fantasy in this remedy
Free from where you don't belong in the concept of time
New levels
Mmm, come on
Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design

I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui

I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful
Ooh, tap in to the frequency, love
Ooh, tap in to the frequency, love
Feel like I'm being tested every minute
Feel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost
Seems like I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence
Truly in my essence, I've arrived
Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me
Too alive, too alive, new arriving
You were right, I was left in it before
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
Parallel to paradise
I reach out for my lifeline
The angels laugh in paradise
They say I am my own lifeline, look in you
To the night, to the night I'm abandoned
Shouldn't I, shouldn't I? What a sandpit
Couldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui
I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving

Y'all can really hear it now.
Hit 'em like comic books,
Kaboom powpow
Into a girl's mind spitfineawinedine,
I keep two phone, sidekick for bad dimes.
And a topical question is why I'm so chill,
Girls don't understand, he ain't even made a mill.
They say I'm complex just like the magazine,
I wear my closet complex like a magazine.
I get in their head, They don't even see my bread.
Oh so, oh so fly cool as I wanna be, one hell of a guy.
I keep 'em short, sweet, thick and petite,
Ridin' alongside in my Cutlass Supreme.
I'm from a place where old school's are common,
Gotta explain every time I'm rhymin' I be.
""I be all day rollin' in my whip got my sippin' cup out on the low.
I keep two pretty woman by my side I'm cooler than a polar bears toes
And I say""
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is the reason I'm cool.
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'.
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is the reason I'm cool.
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is my my city
Yup, yeppers smile all the time while,
I chop it up like Michael Watt's slow talk style.
So the girlies can really catch all my accent,
And the double O got her own accent.
Some niggas sell drugs to provide for they fam,
Some niggas sell CD's up out they trunk man.
Some niggas they go to school for that higher learnin',
I play the O'Jays while I'm turnin' lanes.
We be on our shift, freakin' black and milds still controllin' the whip.
Ain't no city like Cleveland, cruisin' wit my bad bitch in the evenin'.
You wanna know exactly why I'm this way,
Take a trip to the land, swing this way.
After the song done ain't much I can say,
Cleveland is my city, city.
""I be all day rollin' in my whip got my sippin' cup out on the low.
I keep two pretty woman by my side I'm cooler than a polar bears toes

I got my head on a swivel
Think its time I open my mind where I left it
Nigga make it easy
Make sure that they can't delete me
I'm bout to be rewire your whole fucking mainframe
I'm sick of the same
Lame old same thing
I got some bubonic you might wanna mix with some whiskey
I got a vendetta with showing niggas that I'm way better
Feeling way worthless
The lost black sheep of G.O.O.D. Music
Only good for a hook, huh?
Let me show you flows
Intuitive when it comes to many things I know
Cold
Most winters I would dream of being a winner
Feeling like less than shit to the doubters
Pain I promise to all who oppose my knowledge
My reign
The fucking essence of pain fuck rain
Standing in a monsoon of cool
Time will tell
This is what it is when you're walking to hell
Oh! Bitch you know I'm cold yea
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh So cold
Niggas know I'm cold yea
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Owie!
I love how I can make so many people feel uneasy
Walk right passed I know you hoes see me
Can't deny the shine of a jedi
World class almighty super cudder the Godly
Went from ? to smoking tiva that was my hobbies
I love shittin on these niggas that is my fave
Can't fuck with an unstoppable force
That lives with no regrets and of course no remorse
One two one two
Assholes now please listen close
I live for the day to watch all you pussies roast
Whoosah whoosah
So I don't slit nobody throat
Awww it ain't my fault, thought he had the juice
Bash a nigga face in
Watch the blood leak
Put my ear where his jaw was
Tell a nigga to speak
Standing in a monsoon of cool
Karma is my armor
Was always scared of my father
Beyond
Oh! Bitch you know I'm cold yea
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh So cold

I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga wit' a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of the sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul attack
Now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you're gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can't rule out these claps for gun
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
So maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Been pimpin' you should think about marriage
Until then get it then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute, I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zone and see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah homie, not even
I'ma zone out till I lose feeling
Remember, I'ma be gone way past November
Even stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin' I could find peace somewhere
In my mind it sounds like, ooh
When I'm gone it feels like, ooh
When I'm zone, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
I'm feelin' alright
When I'm zone, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
I forget about it all
Ballin' is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Comma's on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland city we ride around
Greetin' my niggas wit' dap and pounds
So if I fall I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight
Man, everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am fadin' man
Doin' other shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't just standin' 'round hatin'
So my advice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin' all alone
And then the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the devil in a hot pink dress
Tryin' to ask me for one dance
He think he slick but my guardians
Protect me from his wrath
So in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin' I will find peace somewhere
In my mind it sounds like, ooh
When I'm gone it feels like, ooh
When I'm zone, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
I'm feelin' alright
When I'm zone, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
I forget about it all
In my mind it sounds like, ooh
When I'm gone it feels like, ooh
When I'm zone, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
I'm feelin' alright

No more dodging this shit, the cat and mouse
Finding love in the shadows, ready to pounce
They yearning for my return
Laying next to him, you daydreaming of my meat
You remember when I said, ""Put it on my face""
Damn girl, when will you learn, there's no escaping me
Passion never dissipates, no soul without your mate, relate
Man I coulda never fathomed
Hate you mingling with these corny niggas
Though I don't care how it happened
It's cool now 'cause I'm home
Sloppiest sex, the best way, we're both giving dome
Uh-uh, 'til the break of dawn
I gotta, gotta, gotta get you on, on
You know I'm the only one to get you revved up
Spread it open, pound it till it's numb, yum

Takes a man longer to see this fact
Women are quicker with this type of shit, we know
Uh uh, show me the lane dude
I'll be speeding down that bitch, I'm going straight to you
Uh uh, always knew you still thought about me
Now cut the doubt
Lying, lying entirely to every one
Distant yearnings and fantasies
Keep lying, you keep lying
Entirely to every one
There isn't another soul who knows your soul
Like I, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I
Yeah, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I
(Quite like...)"
26,Does It,2016,"Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin' (2016)",Hip Hop|Electronic,Kid Cudi,"You can depend on Cud Life to kill it
Having guillotine dreams with my enemies (oh!)
See em in the ditch, see em out
Hit the X can't stand to hear a bitch nigga mouth
Took a hook in the road to get in the mode, geronimo
Get em a jeans, white tee, Cleveland fitted
Hoes know me round the map, I can't hide the old summers
Litted
The rest unfolds, tell me how the fuck does he does it
Levels unreachable, can't pin em to a mole
Its' like a nigga been here before, shit is a bore
My thoughts sore in the AM
Slay them like a machine 'round the clock with the 12 gauge aim
Telling Satan to fuck off
Hated the hand I was given
Tossed that shit back like ""God must be kidding""
And not for a nigga like me, not for the family
Not for the similar plans I just dumped
And I made simple choices, her voices follow
No can't stop a man with passion
These hoes don't distract a God, I am no clown
Grown man laying in stones all around in my throne
My kingdom throwing from space
Fuck all expressions on face, this is the case
I'm in a place to be great, hmm
No fakes, raising the stakes
I'm in a place to be great, hmm hmm hmm
Uh, doing music, TV and movies
Sitting on the floors we ain't heard of
And the media wanna act like I ain't out here (I'm out here)
Running laps around these hoes (for years!)
Running the game with no cheat codes
Unfuckwittable with two T's nigga, who else but Cud
Give a mother fuck

Nigga, I does it, yeah
Oh, I, nigga, I does it, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, I does it, yeah
I does it yeah, oh, oh
Thought the kid dough 'cause I'm in a oven often
The kush in the lungs, a bushel of nugs
Awaken the dope you ain't never sold
Got the homies in the hood and they ready to rage on
Fast lane pushing to the limit
Uh, enjoy the spoils but no baskin' in it
But see I really wanna give me if I'ma go crowd live with some girls who love me in this condom
The more I grow, the more I double in powers
Non ambitious for cowards, trippy go for toes
Won't be a drone clone, half hearted
Sheep in the heard, brainwashed to low 'cause
And if I piss people off along the way, bonus
Cause these niggas are stale chips, all around thinking they're fresh with the stale shit
And corny bitches need corny niggas that's well fit
God has a plan for everybody but I'm it, chosen
Scotty bout to even the mood, get lost in the tomb
Say we are, we are, the knights in the world
The sun up, sunny side up, running from you, taking the que
Having a drink
Here's to you, you, you, and you
Salute
Hmmm, I bet you would do
Salute
Uh, doing music, TV and movies
Sitting on the floors we ain't heard of
And the media wanna act like I ain't out here (I'm out here)

One day I'll be what the world want me to be
I was born to be super duper Scott
The one bad bitches call super duper lame
Now super duper fame gives me super duper brains
86 to Cape, but I'm super duper high
Soarin' passed the moon I'm super duper lonely... guy

Down and out, so I'm out and down and looking for a substance to drown in
For even in hell, I still have faith
To one day be free with my father at the gates
But make no mistakes, I'll show you what time takes
To be a success on earth, mixed with all the hate
I stand on my pivot, my life you could not live it
For the things that I've seen have been too damn explicit
But soon you will get it on a CD with some credits
I provide my grind, mixed with no edits
They say they don't want me when I'm fucked up and forgotten
Until I rise up amongst the evils tryin' to stop 'em
Slow down bitch, my money is what I'm clockin'
I'm tick-tockin'
Once I start, I ain't stopping

And tell me somethin' that moves me
Seen all types, different continents
Nothing more intriguing than an accent
That's a one, two, double up, get it up
So many surprises, so many colors and sizes
Love them (mmh) they're so dope, they're so dope
We're rolling, coasting
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
(So many colors and sizes, so many surprises)
When you live like me, you get used to fun
There's an endless supply of the beautiful ones
So I opened up those exotic thighs
The baddest little bitch half black half Thai
Don't be prejudice, 'cause she's mixed.
I'd still fuck the blackest bitch
That's how it is, if you in my world
Light skin, white momma you a white girl
And I got that fever and a big thick you know what I wanna feed here,
Met a girl named maria, it's your turn, I loved them senoritas,
I'd like to fuck them, but then I said fuck 'em
Lil momma can get a little somthin
OG Too Short don't stop
All the pretty girls come on top
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
(Let me see that body)
(Like everywhere, my favorite kind, bitch)
They love me. Yahm."

But, I don't know where I'm going
Where I'm going, it's all happening
I'm going, it's all happening
Hey, where is she, hey, where is she
I'm over it, I need me some change
Something to feel good
Get me on the level
No no, no need to cry, no need to cry
You straighten up, you're such an adult
Pay all your bills, bet you are a zombie
And you don't know where you're going
Where you're going, it's all happening

I don't know Butthead I'm feeling kind of I don't know
Come on Butthead, sometimes when you have a very powerful artist like Cudi
It's possible that his songs invoke certain emotions and feelings and those feelings are valid
Another thing that brings up some of these feeling is hallucinogens
Which I know both of you have been doing
So why don't you get just relax and take this as an opportunity to meditate, go inside yourselves look inward
Ya Beavis look inward, look up you butt
Shut up butt head, your vibes all wrong, you're not on the same frequency, butthole, you just don't get it Butthead, you just don't get it"

And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed indeed just what I need
How I feel upon a time so recent in time make me sad
When I recollect how it use to be
Like David and Goliath kinda like me and the devil
Trying to rip out my soul, Trying to catch a nigga on sleep, no, no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger
No, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in hell
At the end of the day, day my momma told me
Don't let no one break me, let no one break me
At end of the day, day, nobody, nobody
Ever could stop me, ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day you can't regret it
If you were trying, if you were trying
At the end of the day, day I'm walking
With a heart of a lion, yeah
Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't see ahead of me so I move in stealth
Hide and seek within a dream
I seem to glide above my horror though
I feel I'll never be complete inside the dark I borrow
To proceed and remain intact my mental was so unstable
And they talk and judge a man they have no clue of what I'm capable
Till I show a side of me no one had thought could be within
I told ya, no, I'm not no loser I'll see you in hell
At the end of the day, day my momma told me
Don't let no one break me, let no one break me

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, no, yeah

I'm just a kid who needs no help
I've achieved a bigger thing no cash or check could be more blessed
And if you would've seen the things I've seen up in my stumble?
You'd be shook stay awake no need to run your fate will follow you
You should know not for the faint at heart
This world understands no coward
It's a goal a simple code I stay on the grind to the 25th hour
And I know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within
I told you, no, I'll never let you drag me down to hell, no
At the end of the day, day my momma told me
Don't let no one break me, let no one break me

Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Closing your eyes the feeling so right
At first you might see this one bright beam of light
Clutching your soul to the toll of the blight
Happy unites and feelings take flight
Blind to the evils you give them no sight
Focus on floatin', your focus is tight
Like you rewrote a essay for a class
To pass in the night
Have you ever seen the ending so nice
You feel so free like your high as a kite
Like how you feel if you drink some bud light
Followed by Jag
Models will smile then tilt their heads back
These are a few of the visions I like
Mixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night
This is my heaven at night
Have you, ever been to heaven at night (to heaven at night)

You can see a nigga shinin'
Just a lil doe, a couple hoes, a couple 2-3 diamonds
Up in the hood where you'll find him
Unless he out on the road
Every show got a bag full of blow
And patron all my niggas gettin' dough
Like they supposed to
Cause life is short, and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just pour that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out
And free my scalp
I mean free my mind
One puff at a time
I'm up all the time
I'm up on the grind
So a big booty and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine
Just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Don't really like sippin
'Cause I get to trippin' my nigga
Just roll me a heap of that pine
And I only bring a little good for the trip,
Just in case we get blurred by 5-0
Sir you look high
I know, but I prefer my eyes low

Can we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher, and higher
You know we get higher, So higggherr

There he go talkin' bout weed again
Probably becuz of all that weed in him
Yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doin' bad like Mike said
Could be doin' wrong
Forget about the obvious context of the song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along
And we float
We kids with hope
Better than coke we smoke
Dog please don't miss
Whatta a nigga tryna get you thinking bout
We outside becuz my mama in the house
Puff puff pass with yo bitchass
Back in high school smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict
Tragic stable enough for reclining
I be lookin' down and see my jewels be shinin'
Good look Yeezy
Y'all stay blinded
By that light
Somebody pass me a shell to the right
Yes, I'm goin'
I be outtie
And you can find me

I tried to tell all my friends when I was a kid that I had powers, nobody wanted to believe me. All right.
Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cave
I can't explain this sudden peace in my walk
I sure hope
I am living my life as if I had powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal
Tonight I feel immortal
Bet you want to see me weak
Not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost day 'n' night, young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely Imma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame

Welcome, yeah Welcome YOUR IN MY DREAMS NOW
Narrator (common):
Long before we know ourselves, our path's are already set in stone.
Some may never figure out their purpose in life And some will.
There are alot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in -
Content with being blinded by rules and judgement.
We live in a world where its more okay to follow than to lead
In this world, being a leader is being trouble for this system we are accustomed to.
Being a leader in this Day and Age is being a threat
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life.
But towards the end to the first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
A voice who were speaking to us from the underground for some time.
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilites and other human emotions and Issues never heard so vividly and honest.
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too,
This is the story of The Man On The Moon."

But, I can't fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We're all troubled, in a world of trouble, it's scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I'm what you made God, fuck yes I'm so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren't my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane's a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

That's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade
I'm going, going I'm on a crusade
To save the kids from the weak shit
It's finally my world
Here all the girls can be my girl

Won't you tell me who is; the supreme leader
Still want to use like I'm not a human eater
Move and groove, make the bitch linger
Want more than the dick, gold on the ring finger
Not the one who wanna play dumb, see I'm from Cleveland bitch
I'm up in the hills still keep it way trill
And most wanna relax, someone tell me how that feel
I say that loud until I go an pop this pill
I say out loud 'you wanna let me cop a feel?'
Now I pray out loud but I know my god ill
Bounce with me If you don't give a fuck simply
Fed up won't let up on the overtime
The more I work, the more they wanna sweat mine
I can feel those lames they love to speak my name
Sometimes dreams of breakin' niggas whole faces
And fuck the precinct, ain't scared of catchin' cases
Sky might fall, but I ain't worried at all
Got me some xannies and a couple adderall
Plus these racks up on the strippers at the mall
With the spirit of god and some Gandalf balls
Lord of the sad and lonely
And the ones that feel like shit on the daily
Don't let these phony niggas and hoes
Be the ones that bring you low
Let it be from the fatigue from making a pussy plead
All of the things I've seen and survived
Make a nigga feel way more than just alive
You know my name you know my face
All hail King Wizard in your motherfucking space
You love it
Yep, yep, yep
Lord of the sad and lonely
Yep, yep, yep
Lord of the sad and lonely
And the ones that feel like shit on the daily
I got you, you love it

In a way in which this universe has never seen

Wanna find about the real me

Show them pussies you're growin'

My bloodline runs deep, unless I don't sleep
Figure it's my pops keeping me away
Help me keep my mind off the clouds for reality
These muthaf-ckers can't fathom the wizardry
Slow more brain that's backwards cowards
Took a shower your attitude stinks
Wanna know what I think?
Oh oh, oh,
Hey my mojo so dope b-tch
Hey my mojo so dope
Yep we live it, live it
Yeah we on it, on it
Give a f-ck about your lifestyle,
Give a f-ck about a muthaf-cking lifestyle cause n-gga
We, we live this sh-t
Oh oh, oh,
Give a f-ck about your lifestyle,
Give a f-ck about a muthaf-cking lifestyle cause n-gga
(Kid Cudi - Verse 2)
I live through words not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk
Often the fave till I came to park heart
And said true things
A whole new legion of some n-ggas
Aiming high pass the idea slangin
Praise Allah for keeping me awake man
I lot of my n-ggas fell victim to the dope game
Some things will never be same
Wish I could tell my brother something for some motivation
And get him out that gutter
He's leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn you must understand when I speak about a song its how I really am
Yeah this is how I really think
You could see what I see, yes I really wink
Yes I really drink
I really do rage my demons at the cage
By most of the day before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning them sorrows with some more E n-gga

Take my blood
Give fake love

No worries I just kill a bitch with success
While she at home stressed out eating ice cream
I'm at the Grammys living out a nice dream
No bitch on arm, just my words and my stoner charm
With my dimples deep I smile at peace
'Cause I went out and got what most y'all seek
Now I'm the one you meet
Who throws you the peace sign, not one eye met
And this is just the first step
God walks with me, but I'm still vexed

Oh, Oh
(Verse One)
What a World that I'm living In
Will the rain storms ever end
Still I Feel My
Path narrow I run again
Seem Happiness is gone again
Then You See 'em
Grey clouds up above mane
Metaphor to my life mane
Still I feel My
Heart stronger then it's ever been
Strong will till my journey ends
Until then I Roll
More than I ever rolled
Not pills but the Mary though
Still I feel my
Eyes heavy when the day go
Nothing helping with my head dose
But I ain't Sleep
Awake in another state
Living in a new space
Still I feel my
Mind running at a steady pace
God help me so I win the Race
Until then I go
The Sky Might Fall
The Sky Might Fall
But I'm not worried at all
Come on come on
The Sky Might Fall

(Verse Two)
Grey clouds stuck together fam
Lightning piercing through another land
Over the desert where the lost play
Soul searching each and every way
And then you see the
Awesome sound so profound
When it-
It'll grip you
You can see it
If you hear it you can feel it too
Something Special I am running to
Until then I go
Away, very far away
To another universe where all the people say
It's the new, new place
For the special to embrace
Like a Martian who seemingly wandered out of place
Take what you need from the valley of the hope
Where even if you drowned you'd be floating higher up
And you can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be falling but remember you can fly high
The Sky Might Fall
The Sky Might Fall
But I'm not worried at all
Come on come on

To the ones who figured me, Outcast, no not the duo
Back in Shaker Heights when they knew who
Dough lil brother was a strange one, boo hoo
Cry me a river hater, Look who traveled without a igloo
Cold Cold world wasn't fit for me at all
Look at where I stand at, tall
Clutchin' my Kid Cudi bizalls
Mute muthafuckas back home quick pause, Gargle on my mayo
Look at me a bit I'm the one you think the fail
Floatin' on my mind, no sail, ahoy... ahoy.
Listen good, I don't need nobody
This is what you feel, all the sounds of insanity,
Hoping what I hear loops it itself to finish me
No I won't be afraid
Hey, hey

Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right, do right?
Oh whoa whoa
Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes

Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them
Super Solo Dolo attack, run into that
If you'd like to know, yes, I am on acid
Who could it be? K-I-D
Searching all day in the streets for DMT
Don't sip it, though - it couldn't answer
Drip, drip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie
Watch who you hate on, fam', without the facts
Sad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat
To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that
You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth
Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about
But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber
Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker
Better get on back
You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack
And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be:
Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo - see me and repeat it
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 other nuns
God blessed my tongue, God need it for life
Awkward like car rides, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?
I really want it - I need it
Break bread - or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out ""little Johnny is dead!""
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, simply got 'em everywhere you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
My son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell that to me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 other nuns

Wish I was Jigga man, carefree living
But I'm not Sean or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rolling with them Brooklyn Boys
You know what I be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, How'd you do it mom? huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
Why he by himself? He got two older brothers - one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept my fly when she could
But they all didn't see, the little bit of sadness in me, Scotty
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring outta me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is - The Soundtrack 2 my life, (yeah, yeah) The Soundtrack 2 my life, oh
I'm super paranoid, like a 6th sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split a 8th of 'shrooms just so I can see the universe
I try to think about myself as a sacrifice,
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom.
Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck, it's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound, My hearts an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cáncun, Where it's never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So its more than right - I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions keep pouring outta me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is - The Soundtrack 2 my life, The Soundtrack 2 my life, oh
I'm prolly this close to go and tryin' some coke
And the happy ending would be slitting my throat
Ignorance to cope man, Ignorance is bliss, Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talk about fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty,
I just need a thoroughbred cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down - pussy and some cali tree,
And I get both never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions keep pouring outta me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is - The Soundtrack 2 my life, The Soundtrack 2 my life, oh"

Never play a nigga when you see that he is tying to grow
Candy blocker when he knocked out (?)
Empty chamber so I'm watching every angle
Under the moonlight with he devil octangle
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, its better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way I watch a stranger
(Chip Tha Ripper)
Chilling rolling up something to change my felling
Thinkin' about how I came up from nothing while I'm
Splitting this cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin' about really killin' them all
I say slow down, slow down
What the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I'll be there in 20 minutes but it only took fifteen
We wasn't that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
No knowing that this was all a set up
Secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They passes move was to slow for me
I pulled up, wasn't no ambulance, there wasn't no police
Something fishy going on, not even kept pressing on
Nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit
The nigga with something to lose almost lost it, wont trust him again
(Kid Cudi)
Cheese came through at 3
Salute at ease he supplied the weed
'Cause I've been that OD'ed
It's me with a black rockstar steed
Will rock tee's, 300 a pop for these
Please bum me, you don't owe you money
They ignite got flipped I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a heinie (heineken) with my jamie boo besides me
That's my fucking best friend
When I be tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that's the part I find intriguing
A little bit off I am, I am, I am
I see that I'm caught I am, I am, I am
It's something like a spiritual healer that could end me
I think that's the part I find intriguing, I'm fiending

Yep
Shades over my eyes
Make the creepers look back at themselves
Sitting stuck in emotional bliss
The skinny amount of girls with coke on their gums
Tap my knee
I'm keepin' the rythym
The young and wild take chances together
They all jump up, twist and groove
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood
Hey, there's a hunger in the night
The moonlight kissing the nips on the model frame
I kissed her inner thigh
Closed my eyes, she began to make me fit
She like to go the mile, all the while
I can see her tear bit
I forgot her name
Something that sounds like Penelope
May be a French twang to it
Tongue was quick, she was French I knew it
A lovely foreigner, foreign to racism
She like the young nigga by my brown skin
My shag dog fro
I'm king to her
She will please her friend for me
So funny and they'll starve in the garden
Naked as always, honest
Her hands all over my privates
Lost in the mood
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood"

Sometimes I'm thinking God made me special here on purpose
So all the while till I'm gone make my words important so
If I slip away, if I die today the last thing you remember won't
Be about some apple bottom jeans with the boots with the fur,
Baby how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed but the demons I confronted would disperse,
Have you ever heard of some shit so real?
Beyond from the heart, from the soul you can feel...
And if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take
But please don't cry, just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
My mind runs I can never catch it even if I got a head start
God please tell me I am feeling so alone way
I don't need to worry 'cause I know the world'll feel this nigga
Blessing in disguise but I am not hiding who I am open your eyes brah
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love yo
Girls that I dated, it's ok I am not mad yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho.
This shit is so ill,
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

You should dig deep
Mmm, don't go through extremes, hmm
Oh baby don't get so down, oh baby don't get so down
Now that you know, now that you know
Yeah, here's what you do, you gotta dig deep, deep
Oh to find your truth, your truth, it will speak, speak to you
I'ma sew these wounds
I-I'ma sew these wounds myself
I'ma sew these wounds
I'ma sew these wounds myself
Hmm, hmm
We all have times when we weep
It's a troubled life, traumatized psychologically
I pray, in the shadows when I'm speaking to no one
Myself, did everything right, didn't I?
So why aren't I whole?
You know you better dig deeper
Don't lie to you
You better dig deep, deep, deep
I'ma sew these wounds
I-I'ma sew these wounds myself
I'ma sew these wounds
I'ma sew these wounds myself
Hmm, hmm
I'ma sew these wounds
(I, I, I, I....)"
116,Young Lady,2013,Indicud (2013),Hip Hop|Electronic,Kid Cudi,"In my head your smile appears clear
Wish it wasn't my imagination
But in a way was a dream
Your eyes they tell it all, called it
Hope you got a good heart,
And you're smart
You got a good head on your shoulders
That's what turns a nigga on, strong
Feelings that I have you'll probably never
Find out ever
I'll admire from afar, star
Keep doing all the great things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
How'd you get so fuckin' cool?
Fools probably trying to spit at you daily
The price you pay 'cause you're hot
Has anyone told you that you're fresh as hell
And I dig the way you wear your hair too
It makes you look more mature
See I just wanna be a man, and
I think you can be the one to guide me
But who the fuck am I kidding?!
And you know they say I'm wild
But real people rarely come around, if ever
You got it going on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
You turn a nigga on,
These feelings I have you'll find out never
Unless you're clever
I'll admire from afar, star
Keep doing all the good things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady"
