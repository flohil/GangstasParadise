Yo, yo, the A-1 sauce, the Divine Force
My mind blind force is known to blow time off course
Even, if I rode around the world on a blind horse
Strapped down, I'd still get my point across
Allah is father of all
You debate whether big, whether small
Whether short, whether tall
Whether dense, whether length
Whether strength, whether width
Either man, animal, bird or fish
Whether, black or white, more shapes than snowflakes
Existin', everywhere but you still can't locate
The man of steel couldn't bend me
Time couldn't end me
Even the great devil Satan that tried to befriend me
Understand the equality, God in a bodily
Form, lettin' my knowledge be born
Lettin' my knowledge be born...
""I wanna stay with you, forever""
Yo, yo, yo
I be the fatal flyin', I'm like NATO flyin'
Over your country and droppin' down forty tons of iron
Filled with explosives, your chance is hopeless
We have your head poppin' up like the blowfish
I'm not talkin' Hootie, nigga pass the zootie
I could bag the cootie, maybe smoke the ootie
The runaway train with no track
I got the heart of Faye Dunaway whippin' that child with the coatrack
TV droppin' bombs or droppin' germs
Baby moms in the courthouse, she's droppin' terms
Guns go off, bustin' all directions
D.J. choose, another fuckin' dope selection
""...With you forever...""
""Like the corners of my mind...""
""I wanna stay with you, forever""
Yo, the pen is mightier than the sword, as I face my worldly challenge
In the scale of justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral
My respect for all men is mutual
As my thoughts surpass a level to which you devils compute to
You've been given the chance to hear the true and living
So do the knowledge, son, before you do the wisdom
So you can understand, how the thunder and
Lighting above your head is caused by the Son of Man
We experimentin' with high explosions
That cause the place to quake and the surface erosions
The earth produce lava like the mouth produce saliva
This wisdom goes deeper than your scuba diver
In search for the pearl jewels sold to Tiffany
My verbal heart symphony will strike the epiphany
Insight, ignite, and then men might, see love and hell
Hell and right, then excel, to be masters of your circumference
First, by obtainin' mastery of your common sense
This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision
You can see it through the lies and the fantism
Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual
Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies
To eradicate the wise
But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies
Of the heavenly celestial sphere
Trust me, son, it's dear, in between your ears
A day to God is a thousand years
Men walk around with a thousand fears
The true joy of love bring a thousand tears
In the world of desire, there's a thousand snares
A day to God is a thousand years
Men walk around with a thousand fears
The true joy of love bring a thousand tears
In the world of desire, there's a thousand snares
""I wanna stay with you forever""
""I wanna stay with you forever"""

*Alot of static*
This is a Wu-Tang Killa Bee exclusive blast
*Echoing*
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wu-tang, Wu-Tang,
Wu-tang, Wu-Tang,
Wu-tang, Wu-Tang...
Verse 1: Bobby Digital
Bobby Steels fables till
MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Taking sword play tongue-twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts
Blast in your box walk wid alarm clocks
Cars drive explodes on the block
One stop parks, pops in trunk
Snears pop loud as glock shots
Pierced like a earring in your face
Cops stop, give a sitation
Report for radio station identification
*Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up*
Love IQ got you drunk, you depressed of Wu
Flying monks fatal darts from your airwaves strike you antenna
You feeled a bit shimmer
It makes you're like you dimmer
You thought you turned your dial from this
You best to slit your wrists
Through the soul of your heart like dark Emelius
Unfamiliar, leave no trace like Simon Templer
Rhyme emperor, styles switch daily like temperature
In your atmosphere the rap racketeer
Six pack battery back keep 'em stacked
I live for hip-hop
And tall brown skin sugar plum who love the lollipos
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Can't think about the proper remedies for destroyin us
Your best bet black is sit back and start enjoyin us
And run your commisary, attack your corinary, I'ma bury revolutionary
Honorary is sonic electronic brain like Johnny Nneumonic
Get boosted from the sorrow and went Wu-tonic
You be fickle, get your tongue thrown into a jar of pickle
To serve to your bird, with cheese and pumpernickle *Ch-cha Pssh*
Three state Charlie a classic like Marley Marl

Rain, hail, snow and earthquakes, search your mental birthdate
50 straight push-ups keep the body in perfect shape
Just got hit on the hip by this bird talkin' bout
She got a blister on her lip
That comes from not garglin after suckin
I'm togglin the buttons on my cell-phone
Call my nigga, Tone the well known
Bubblegoose shredders made him thick as Carl Weathers
Solid chrome barettas nines stuffed inside the Wu leather
Hot shots melt through your pleather

Tre-pound snub rap we might joust
Fresh spring water from the ounce
Stalked like a tomahawk, Indian bitch, you get scalped
Like a ticket sold in Cleveland, you feel me in

And ""bad situation man"" throughout the song*}
(RZA)
Yeah it's Bobby Digital
Just floatin over +The City+
I came across this, this, this black man
He was talkin' about (look down below)
Sure of yourself risin', prices of food skyrisin
Foreign countries movin in USA, enterprisin
Snatchin your mic then speakin', while you might be leakin
Then losin the luxury, average man be seekin'
Thought he was so smart; hoe's cheatin', life fall apart
Fuckin' a hundred bitches couldn't mend a broken heart
Start as a soda jerk job, as a mail clerk
Fucked this white bitch in the office, got fired from work
Nine-to-five, government high taxes, police dispatches
Beauracatic attackin black Asiatics, resident with bad plumbin
Cocaine got my brain numb an' bitch complained 'bout cummin'
Pussy stay hummin; $200 parkin, summer's out of state warrants
High blood pressure pills prescribed by Dr. Lawrence
Got me gainin weight, fuckin' up my right kidney
Cousin raped at school Allah wit me
Peoples' eyes closed like envelopes by folk membership
With unpaid doctor bills
Framed got shot and killed, cops poppin' pills
Three pair cotton, steel closet, cabinet of +No Frills+
Mo' bills, sister got evicted from Park Hill
Punch a hole inside the NARC wheels
My dogs bark, still carry dark steel
And unmarked bills, I'm from the uncut, dope, found on director's reels
Bobby Digital may switch back to Bobby Steels
Rusty .38's, bought rust inside the herb gate
So +Hungry+, son, 'bout to shrink down to a bird's weight
Rash break out, where's the blue ointment, face-to-face appointments
Un-proudly in the church paid for annointment
Bet the checks don't come late
About to separate with her man
In +The City+, +Domestic Violence+ excavates
Get a highest ratio in five years
The idea is to plant fear
Boy you slap yo' bitch, po-lice is there to cuff you or snuff you
They might bust you
'Cause your hoe snatched your money up, didn't want to fuck you
We must learn to communicate, and unificate
Stop the black on black, hate on hate
White on white, black on white
Put the love in love
I'm blunted up, blasted inside the strip club
Shorty wop, fifteen year old, all she needed was love
And mo' dough so she won't have to show her knotty afro
Collect call from my son to now, he might blow trial
Foul cut, and cop out to a 3 to 6
Bad situations, bein a man is hard shit
Somethin'll get trapped out, I mean, yo
Got crack fiends in spots with vaccine shots
Black teens drop out of high school, white teens sellin stock
With bonds they can't put their word on
20 years, shorty wop, pussy 'bout to swerve on
Up in the crib, new fridge, dead pig
Two kids, pawned this older cat who looked like Calvin Coolridge
But got splat in his back last year
Robbin' his jewel inside the diamond district
No one got convicted, heard they never found the biscuit
I'm booby trapped by the capitalists
Tryin' to subsist, sometimes happiness is hot grits and catfish
Or a bowl of Cookie Crisp, I got harassed by this rookie bitch
Talkin' 'bout I couldn't put my feet on the fire hydrants
To tie my kicks, $50 ticket, 'bout to strike and picket
And shout at the City Hall, motherfuck the wicked
Too greedy, give to the needy, down on my luck
'Bout to jab a ouija board, that's when Bobby Digi seen me
Said, ""Yo son, don't stress out over no one, learn the slogan:
Knowledge is half the battle, that's one to grow on
And don't be counterfeit
It's a bad situation which bein a man, but we got to handle it""
Bad situation when you ain't bein a man"

Y nunca me llamas, Roberto
You treat me like an analog ho

Yo, lyrically, I got all y'all niggaz under my wing
Cause I bring terror throughout this rap era
Like them Muslim cats, who don't give a fuck
About blowin this rock, off the map
Where Mayor Guiliani rest at, so let me get that
Microphone up off of you, cause it's
Definitely not meant for you to have it in your palm
To try to rock the crowd
Puttin it all on to stay calm
You waited for the God Islord to drop the bomb
And swarm the stage about a hundred fat
With lyrical material that's all that
Like a two point five carat clustered jew-el
Rock like Patti La-Belle
Cause everything is real kid, you dead up
Dissect the true kids gettin set up
For a car/Jeep heist, it ain't nice
As we ran up in the crib and stuck the kid
And smacked the wife, cause she, had on two chains
With a tray full of ice in em
But that's how it goes down
When you livin in the Cold World
(Timbo King) Cold World, what?
(Ndira) Todo lo que a ti te gustas es music pa' lo puta
(Timbo King)
Yo, I spit flames thermonuclear type
Ignite mics, blow up U.S.A. satellites
Insane Unabomber, my whole Fam lace golden armor
Royal calmer, black Queen black Madonna
The missing link be the big lips on the Sphinx
Intelligent instincts
I say knowledge is the foundation
When I move in the L's formation, against Hell's nation
Bobby Digital cybertech test microcheck
High bi-as, record the levels
Anti for devils.. anti for devils

All you analog cats from weak tracks, and weak raps
And weak video clips and weak stacks
Beatin bitches with weak lawyers, and weak acts
And weak staffs, born life couldn't copyright
With weak math, come get a dose, of the strong
Coconuts splittin, all you chocolate deluxe butter alms
French buttercups, probably wanna see Bobby in handcuffs
With the toes in my mouth
Stand up or rape me, rotate auto-locate me
In the center solar
Corner block Hip-Hop now expand to the polar
Fuzzy low short frequency
Circuit breakers, try to take
Us on illusionary rides to the future
Polygram graphic rap actors, flash ya
Cash and jewelry like bus passes
That's why your ass got stuck up
So Wake the fuck Up or get smoked
Analog rhymes hoes are like groupies we fucked
Took for derelict, Sales are too Soupy
Better get the Bobby Digital movie!
(Ghostface Killah)
Tarantula, that groove season
Newlywed of rap, which G you believe in?
Rally back, twist a half a man arm off
Late night, nearly happy standoff
How boldly blinded by Bobby crossthievin van diva
Lever 2000 mic talk
Might bolt to match, pinch me in the eve
Carved perfectly from God
Manufactured through the eye, came Puma dash
I snares Dumar, Nicolas, half a face, Cage
Half a coke Dutch sprinkle sage
Bounce to Huey crib yo and got laid
Straight off the ground y'all word up
.. Bad bitch

Yo, yo
Yo my tapdance sword splash
Yo.. my nigga Dix'll leave you whiplashed, feel the cash
Pussy worth a key a stash, bloodbath

Split you open, stitch you back wit a staple
I'm football head, I put your head
Into a brook, all four, your momma wouldn't look at y'all
Gold from the Panama Canal, Alabama gal
Got me laid up on my nuts like kapow

Stretch up the Power you like Mr. Fantastic
Stop, it's a booby trap
Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack?
Digi Snack yeah, while we living in a booby trap
Yo, when it comes to this mic device, you get ate
Like the Gingerbread Man tryna cross the lake
Or the Winchester, call my white son Lester Poindexter
Tell 'em bring back the black mack, strapped with two extra
Clips, where's the natural, words inside the apple
Pot holes in the street, it cracks the Jeep axle
Shrivel your heart to a raisin, shorty star gazing
Yeah, he got steeper than dunce, once he start blazing blunts
Beef and get drown in Hunt's
Your flame get toast, your best bet to punt
I lounge like a hungry jaguar into aqua
Trying to catch a fish that multiply like the Magua
Pocket fat be Jabba the Hutt, Clan gallops up
Feel The Force of my steel but you can't count the caliber

My mind like Professor X from the X-Men
One line 'cause MC's to write their albums down
Devils only come amongst you if you allow them now
Do to trading they infiltrate with persuasion
That desire to rob and steel and make slaves of all
Living luxury destructively, conductively
Improper nature, privately and publicly
Man so stupid when confronted by something he don't
Understand, he shoot it, the whole world's polluted
My earth gave birth to a universal, change us
Scribes reflect the Child born in the Bethlehem manger
Devils try to steal me of my intellect, rob me of my culture
Like they white washing sculptures
Like they snatching down my posters
But it's been caught through the eyes of Minolta
Stop, it's a booby trap
Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack?
Digi Snack yeah, while we living in a booby trap

Yo now, watch Miss Sommers, shake that ass
Yo, you love the way my brother splash
Chain reaction keep you puzzled
Mouth muscle, card shuffle, belt buckle
Jammie S'll never kiss ass after I close a deal
You best to believe this rap shit I say is for real
A lot of y'all bitches be good earners with two out
Take too many chances, chillin' with niggaz, lampin
Profilin, wildin, Jammie hung with the realty smilin'
Takin' shots at Louie the thirteenth, and tie you up
Bathed in Sheik, so you could watch your man beat his meat
'Cause, uh, lodi dodi, I got the body
And tutti fruiti, I got the booty
I shake, my rump, all in ya face
Make a bitch tie my sneaker lace
'Cause A is for Apple and J is for Jack
And most of y'all bitches ain't go no hair in the back
And ya tracks is wack"

You act like you don't fuckin' know that shit
Nigga, what the fuck?

Growin' up as a Brooklyn baby
Bedstuy, this is my life...
(RZA)
Yo, yo, yo...
A Brooklyn baby, I was bron up in King's County
Inside the womb seven months before the Queen found me
Up in wroughty Brownsville with fiends around me
Now roam gat in Staten with Cream Team around me
They called me Bobby, cousin, really got the black Harley
Taught his son how to spike cats like Lee Harvey
Oswald, all's well that ends well
My big brother Divine, he pushed the Benz well
I got the cherry Range, broke and rockin' heavy chains
I'm from the tribe of men who would bury Kings
On the back of the A-train, my daydream
Should I make a phat hit or should I take CREAM?
From the Clan that taught you Cash Rules
I make soul grind tracks, you grab ass too
Give respect to the Prince when he pass through
Might have a chocolate deluxe in a glass shoe
Cousin Billy, known to strap the black uzi
Two-two in front of the Jakes like Jack Ruby
Live on TV where you see B-O-B-B-Y
D-I-G-I-T-A-L, A-L, things ain't too well
(Chorus 2 - Force MD's)
Digital, these niggas should be crazy
Growin' up as a Brooklyn baby
This is how I live my life...
(Masta Killa)
Yeah...
Peace Lafyetee, Stuyvessant, Malcolm X
Shot dice on green, we live from Calasky y'all
It's Fred Glassy, zig-zag-zig through traffic
Get the herb, get the God, peace Ra'
What's the word on things?
Through the phone I heard the bangin' sounds
In the background, layin' down
I'm spittin' what the people missin'
We extreme with the murder type theme
Don't sleep, get ya head split to the white meat
Big guns, down South we blaze
Shippin' bodies back up North, it's the Weston
Wild Texan, no trespassin'
Long mics hit the dead arm
Planet Earth, home of Islam
Brooklyn, I was physically born, clothes torn
Rough tacklin' the streets, Allah Math' spine Technics
We bring heat to the block party, drinkin' Bacardi
Baggin' shorties for the homies who ain't here
(Chorus - both to fade)

Bobby, that's right, you ain't shit, nigga
You ain't shit, but a big dick and a mothafuckin' cheque
All that fuckin' Brooklyn shit, Shaolin shit

You ain't shit, nigga
Comin' in high off that shit

I'm tired of yo' shit

Yo yo confused but yet wise my problem surrounds me
A lot of things upset me as my soul rejects me
Enemy of self physically enslaved
By the luxuries of this world so I behave
Like a man inside the grave
Who's life is lost
I want the promised gold but can't afford the cost
Or could I, I know the prescribed laws
Any effect is a result of the cause
Of lies and delusions to myself I have lied
Burning inside wanting to open wide
And scream
The name of the supreme
But I'm trapped in this world
Lusting for girls
Therefore I imagine a genie and a wish
And searching for things that just does not exist
But in the midst there's the answer for which I have searched
'Cause from me springs divine prince rakeem
And that is me the master of equality
With the ability
To set myself free
But b.o.b.b.y
He don't want to die,
He don't want to die he don't want to try
So I'm forced to cry
And get trapped up for living my life inside a lie

A lot of things upset me
As my soul rejects me
Enemy of my self physically enslaved
By the luxuries of this world so I behave
Like a man inside the grave
Who's life is lost
I want the promised gold but I can't afford the cost
Or could I, I heard of the prescribed laws
Any effect is a result of the cause
Of lies and delusions to myself I have lied
Burning inside and wanting to open wide
And scream
The name of the supreme
But I'm trapped in this world
I'm lusting for girls
Before I imagined a genie and a wish
And I'm searching for things that does not exist
But in my midst there's the answer
For which I have searched
'Cause from me springs the divine prince rakheem
And that is me the master of equality
Give myself the opportunity
And set free and be all I can be
Be all I can be
And not a nigga just trapped up in luxury
Yo bobby digitial got to get knowledge of his self right now,
As we go through the struggle of life we got to go from boy to man
We start off as sperm to baby baby to man from man to dead man
And from dead man back to sand

Four Shellies

Four shellies rip through his belly
Blast him right outside of Mike's deli
Dip to the tele
Call my bird up on the celle
Bobby what Bobby lust I walk strange
And talk strange
Long range sniper aims
Swiss cheese your brain
I don't sleep
And don't eat meat
Rest twice a week
Speak without moving my lips
Got fifty pairs of sneaks
Fingerprint proof rubber grips
Hollow tip clips
Eight ounce sip bud nips
We crack private do chips
And clock a bird off the block
Straight away from a flock
Just caught me at the bus stop
Twist the Snapple top
Off, pierced her breast
Kept her hair processed
No panties underneath the dress
Wally ankle bracelet
Polo frames
Her shades had no name
Popocane
I slowed my game
Thick gold chains
Make your eyes flame
Up against the Bodega gate
She stay straight
Perfect figure eight
Shape, couldn't wait
To bust her grape
With the applehead
Legs spread open
Invincible body armor
My scarlet blade will slice the leg
From the Shaolin llama

Tryin' to avoid getting caught up in the funnel

And keep our third eye open for c-cypher punks

You've seen Bird? You had beef with that chump
And I heard he came home from a two-year slump

The grand ultimate supreme, no extremedies
We use Tai Chi to deflect off our enemy
Five poisons, from the Clan there's no Remedy
We dispell the smell of wickedness in our vicinity
Bobby, the atomic, Islamic, bomb-droppin'
Appear in your atmosphere like the comet
Heading to the Western Hemisphere, non-stoppin'
Strikin' the belly of the seed to make it vomit
Things of beings is unseen by men
In shapes and form, never been dreamed by men
The word of God, always intervene with sin
From insight, my inner-light beams within
Pin-point focus, move silently un-noticed
When you attack, I fall back in the wind like the lotus
Put the soul in the track like my name was Otis
Pain in my heart and your chance is hopeless
For you to win, a change is gonna come
You heare the ""suuuu""?, Wu-Tang is gonna come
And my vocals, they gonna bang on the drum
You go against the grain you will hang from ya tongue

To my soundwave there's no sonic solution
No Pro Tools to edit or out-date my producin'
Form like crystals, mushrooms after the missile
We strike into the hip-hop bone, of the gristle
And my thoughts be the marrow, son I'm the narrow
Tube inside the gun that's released through the barrel
And the words travel in lead, expandin' high-speeds
With the hole in ya head, and filled up you
With the, knowledge of self
I dropped out of school, I went to the college of self
And I pertained my wealth, B-O-B-B, when y'all niggaz see me
I'm like Godzilla stompin' over Mount Fiji
Or Rodan with the wingspan, Prince Rakeem can
Rocks to the solo or combine with my team and
Spit like the calico, welcome to the Alamo

Put a knot on ya head, the size of Grimace
Bitch, jumpin' out ya speaker
Huntin' for yo' egg like it's Easter
Although I come in peace, I would just like to say peace to
Scallywags, skeezers, and I don't really need ya
You don't understand why I don't understand either
Now shit's gettin' deep, you should've thought a lot deeper
It's my time to get over and I got on my blinker
So I write and I spit on the mic, so you can feel
What is truth, what is right and what's not
Yo I must kill the ideal and enlight this Earth
And yo I will give birth to a light that lives to keep it real
All through research, I learned in schools, not even Church
Can enstill, these words are jewels so you can heal
Still I search, and I works real hard, I need a deal
And with speed 'cause it hurts indeed
Yo can you feel? my heart still pumps the blood that makes me bleed
All real and the pastor's best and I always will, do my thing

Yo let me know son, yo...

Catch them while they're sleep
Empty every shell from your clip
Knock them off their feet
These streets that we maneuver through, ain't nothing you familiar to
Don't talk it out, noodle you, walk it out at your funeral
Cold blooded, black hearted, Black Knight and Black Ballin'
Black Christmas, be all in your crib with my killas callin?
Even if you ain't street then we creepin', it ain't no secret
Delete you with big toast, that roast you when it heat ya
Off whiskey, pop up and bong that ass like Bob Digi
Crisis the sharpshooter, I'ma lay 'em down gently
One shot, guns pop in the streets of Camelot
That's why some keep they shit off safety
Others keep they hammers cocked
Ready to blow, ready to go, fire in the hole
And if a nigga ready to retire, we retiring his soul
Creep, creep, creep
Catch them while they're sleep
Empty every shell from your clip
Knock them off their feet
Aiyo, I woke up hungry every day
Till I learn to do the hustle every which and every way
The Compton niggas hit the Chevy with the K
And the candy apple tray she gets heavy in L.A.
When Track died, Mack cried
Once we start banging again then he did a back slide
I was in tune with the sun, star, moon
Eddie shot up thirty niggas in the bar over June
The city's full of Crips
AK's, four-fives, mac-11's, full of clips, Long Beach
Young hogs wit they pockets full of chips
If any, not many, academic scholarships
Pulp Fiction, driving in your car without permission
With a video vixen, giving me head like Bill Clinton
Got a drug addiction, pop pills with no prescription
Stuck in the rehab, the only man with bad intentions
Truly I'm the one the West is really missing
Your shit is garbo', I kill you off with one sentence
The rap apprentice, with a little sack of new inventions
Don't listen and I Jimmy off your head like a henchman
Creep, creep, creep
Catch them while they're sleep
Empty every shell from your clip
Knock them off their feet
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze
Make them Swiss cheese
Empty every shell from your clip
Knock them off their feet
You wanna feel the heat? I pull the flame out
Make a wish boy, blow your brains out
Watch me step out the cribby with the heavy chain out
Leaving blood on your shirt, you can't get the stain out
In a big body truck my hair knotty as a fuck
Shotty tucked under the seat plus a hottie in the truck
Get these wizes, get these digits, get my ninjas back in business
All you suckas get the scissors
You don't work like you broke and keep AK's like I'm Oakland
I be, making that dough, like the Pillsbury Doughman
Bobby, covered in ice like it's Frosty the Snowman
You suckas is useless like old New York tokens
Front on the Bobby D, watch how your body bleed
You ain't worth the weight of a grain from a poppy seed
Make your brain rupture, decompose your frame structure
MC's tremble when they hear the name of us
Puffin' Eastwood stogies, swinging Tiger Woods bogeys
The mic is my co-d, the pen is a parolee
No jail cell can hold me, Zodiac can't describe me
King Tech scratch the beat like he caught poison ivy
Compton's where you can find me in the hood, so grimy
Run laps on these tracks, it's a fact, you can time me
Ready, set, go, I let the, tech blow
Rugged Monk kill a track at any tempo
It's simple, we usually take all niggas garments
Spot rush them busters, blockade they apartment
It's over, foreclosure, your shit is shut down
Creep when you sleep and squeeze the four pound
Creep, creep, creep
Catch them while they're sleep
Empty every shell from your clip
Knock them off their feet
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze
Make them Swiss cheese
Empty every shell from your clip
Knock them off their feet"

Verse 1: Bobby
I'm paranoid of loiZOID
We fight like Guiver against the hyperZOID NOIDS
HIGH ACHIEVER mind computes like a THIEVER
Thoguhts connect like the quarterback to the wide receiver
Stay blunted drinking cokey nine hundred
Never fronting on my niggas on the battle zone
Thoughts flip before they change your whips on the
Good ship Jesus before Kimet was called Egypt
Before the bloods and crypts tomahawks and pimps
Eighteen pumas spazed we still had balds and braids
Amplify the sound of the earth rotation
Who could pin-point the exact location in space
It's to see hear and feel the earth rotation
That's why knowledge is the basic foundation of
All days and creation, like man is the foundation of
His family and the sun's the foundation of the solar system
Wisdom is the manifestation when words and actions are put
Into activation escape this captivation niggas busting
Wasting shots like masturbation transforming like gobots
They created a race of robots our new rulers are
Computers Abbott's been known now come through to us
Heads drifting in space like asteroids,
Pass the roids, savages trading places like Dan Akyroid
The truth is ignored, these devils must be destroyed

Beef wid wife make a nigga live a street life
We smoke blunts, throw weight, pay rent

Only smoke rounds a day and
Ain't nothing to overdo the shit
Y'all niggas best to come up quick
We gonna start and finish it
'Cause I'm sure watch me murder it
Undersiege fatigue get bat at major league
Nine industry forms that be forced from catigues
We live righteous TC they go up do the same
Fuck the fame we hear the bill better keep your
Eyes peeled fuck around get killed it ain't safe no
Fucking more C-Ciphers at my door and I got more
Than one war, I'm gonna stay on my toes and do the one
To two timers, we gon' make this year our year to
Beware peace to rhymers our life is in a bond-a
Sware we gotta find a, way out we took the crypt ride
We all about, on these streets trying to make ends meet
Stay on my feet gotta eat God you things is deep peep
The sleep, How you see camouflage these cats
We on that bullshit, last days thinkings of snakes
And either pull it soft you know like an afro
Other cats sit like Castro I murder that snitch ass
Donnie Brasco, We dissatisfied of your devils
Running running high, my mind and my physical be unified
To the day we testify we wanna be penalised
Form God Allah motherfuckers best recognise

All I wanna do is feed my seed, plus my team
Keep it logical, no games, straight up about Prodigal
Diabolic drums and I run from none
Testimony one, give my life before my only son
Thelonious crumbs, why they wanna press me for guns?
Now I'm in the face of the judge, court case thug
From a race, laced, based on drugs, some made slugs

Made their stay real short, I stamped the passport
Couldn't bring through no wack shit of no sort
I walked the borough challengin' the best that stood
Torch metal mics, they conduct better than wood
Once I electrify and only expect to die
Rounded Bed-Stuy, ZZZZ, nigga fry

Bob Digi, yeah you know who is he
Girl, I fucking slave trade your ass like Kizzy Kinte
(But wait, fuck you motherfucker)
You wish you could fuck
Bitch, all you can do is dick suck
(Your ass can't fuck, that's why your wife left your monkey ass)
Fuck that, you don't cook, you don't clean, or press my jeans
You don't scrub or wash clothes
Or buy food for making (???), bitch
You don't read to the seeds
All you do is watch TV and smoke weed
Get your nails done and feet, scrub the hairweave
Sleep all day, eat, gain weight, can't breathe
Talking about you're going to leave?
Then bitch leave! What the fuck you're waiting for?
Hit the door, I ain't taking this shit no more!
Spending all my cream on Gucci, Phillies and Coach
Before you moved to my lab, bitch, I ain't never seen a roach
Stains on my carpet, bathroom's more like a fish market
Take all the space in my closet, where the fuck's your logic?
Disrespecting my old earth, aborted my child birth
And every day I catch my credit card inside your purse
You can't speak a sentence without a curse
Talking 'bout you're going to be a nurse
Bitch, to be a nurse you got to go to shool first!
When I first met you, you was a hoe
I tried to reform you, bomb you, warn you and teach you
But couldn't reach you, and you're still a hoe
Your father said you was a hoe
And when you leave me, bitch you're gonna be a hoe
Celluloid and gargoyle feet, I'd rather beat my meat
That raggy ass pussy a starving dog wouldn't eat
Started with the body of a model
Pussy tight as a pharmaceutical bottle
And you could swallow a whole avocado
And two forty ounce bottles
To the end of the world, which to I would follow
Now, when I fuck you, the shit echos 'cause you pussy is so hollow
Turn your fat ass sideways
Your stressmarks are like the US highways
Fuck a new nigga every Friday
Talking 'bout bust a nut, bitch I'll bust yo guts!
(You come so quick nigga)
Wonder why I come so quick?
With that wide ass pussy and soggy tits?
I'm trying to get the shit over with, and go to sleep!
But when I'm with my real freak on the weekend
Bet that baby we fuck for two and a half hours or three
You'd better study the 1-0-40 knowledge culture degree
About M-G-T, and G-C-C
'Cause you ain't shit, and your mother ain't shit
And your sister ain't shit, and your pussy ain't shit
That weave ain't shit, your ass ain't shit
Girl you ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit

Then a night in the sheets with fine wizzes
Dime wizzes who don't waste time they get straight down to business

Tried to look when she seen the God zip past

Don't allow negative in my circumference
You can't understand, son, you incompetent

Timbo King put the rhinestones on his Timbs

22,Drama,2008,Digi Snacks (2008),Hip Hop,RZA,"I wanna dedicate this song to the young god, Kareem
The Genius, Digi
Sing it to 'em van Seijen
Like to keep my head up to the sky
And ask myself why it has to be this way
I'd like to live my life in peace
And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day
As we strive for luxury and try to feed our families
It always seems that someone's in your way
I'd like to live my life in peace
And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day
I met a young brother about 28
Who seemed intelligent and rather quite straight
I greeted him and struck a conversation
To see if the youngster had some self-motivation
Peace brother, what's your name? How you be?
I'm Rugged Monk and I'm all about the currency
You mean gettin' paid? Yeah, like my man's brother
Who has a condo, he shares with his baby mother
You know a condo beats my apartment
With no lights, no gas and backed up rent
No hot water or heat, infested with plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alley cat
I'm like damn homey that's poverty he's like
Word O.G. that bothers me
Plus I'm about to be a new father G
We need to wise up and change the hood policy
Like to keep my head up to the sky
And ask myself why it has to be this way
I'd like to live my life in peace
And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day
As we strive for luxury and try to feed our families
It always seems that someone's in your way
I'd like to live my life in peace
And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day
Yo, why you fear the devil as a grown man?
Why you not out there tryin' to make your own plan?
See we are a victim of a situation
Where are wicked man, separated the nation
And got us killin' off one another
Black on black, they pit brother on brother
It's gettin' hot, hotter than July
See the murder and crime rate is risin' to the sky
For example, in my neighborhood it's so hot
I'm often woke up from the alarmin? soundin? of a shot
So I'm thinkin'?, what? Is your neighborhood a trap?
Could this be the place marked X on the map?
And I'm spotted like a target in a shootin? gallery
So I strive to seek for a better salary
So I can escape from where? From this ghetto life area
'Cause everyday it gets scarier
Like to keep my head up to the sky
And ask myself why it has to be this way
I'd like to live my life in peace
And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day
As we strive for luxury and try to feed our families
It always seems that someone's in your way
I'd like to live my life in peace
And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day"

Niggas was psyched out, Beretta brought the dirt bike out
Everlast just came home, it was his first night out
He was arguin' with these bitches how they don't mind their business
When he was locked the fuck down, no one came to visit
He was snuffed, black, his little cousin Moe stuck Cap
That's Miss Sommers on the bike with the gat like, ""Fuck that""
But finessin' over here, he could've wished he had ten more years
Cracked a cold beer then bust a shot in the air
Everlast, ego went full blast, didn't splash
He'd act like his head was too big for the casket
I told him, ""Slow down God, you ain't wild
You ain't been in these projects in a while
Runnin' 'round with that old school style""
Don't think these young bucks won't lay you down like tile
A hard head makes a soft ass, these New York lads
Chopped faces, you talk fast - they bust off fast
And chase you out the hood, in a bloody hood
Yo, son, you seen that kid was actin' Hollywood?

Yeah, I mean that nigga, clap happy Cali, clap when he 'ttack
Most get astounded by sorrounded sound effects in the back
Adidas shoe, phat laces, packin' buldge in his jacket
Head nappy, black and nasty, but he nasty for gats
He nas', passed me, bumped me and laughed, then flashed me his Mac
Said, ""I got sixteen for you, we could bang on the track""
So strap this, nah, this bar's a bullet, par pull it
In fact, blast me bastard, I done came to far for this

Mama stomach touchin' a bed, two bids
Cats sacky in Comstack, retire from the crack
I'm askin' Allah that the warm Hennessy help me
I ain't chose the struggle, the struggle chose me
Lord forgive me fore I have stolen from my brothers
Snaked my brothers, even killed my brothers
Familiar fishscale, everybody plays the fool
The +Older Gods+ givin' me jewels
The younger Gods givin' me tools
Solomon Allah, I feel I was jerked
To the drug dealers, my baby mother's a flirt
Holey socks, one fatigue suit, what you feel it don't hurt?
That's my problem now, I ain't afraid to talk
Still cop coke from the well Willy
When I was young I got robbed from the neighborhood bully
Till he forced me to hit him with the nine milli'
Now him and his click know that I'm a thug fully

Blind in glasses
Daredevil bang head with shovel
Iron skin, Tony Starks, liquid metal
The rebel in the evenin, shadows sweapens, vanishin
The book of instruction, fuckin' with the Wu-Tang Production
Is lord to all who come and see, my art too deadly to teach
Read my death touch, ascended grief between each point
Slendid, hand Swingin' Sword recommended
Slice through the bone intended
Try to sketch the classes, reflection of perfection
Mic-phone swing like numb stick to scar
Mohammed Ali, mic MC, Shakwan walk the dead sea
Dead sea, Digi...
(Streetlife)
Yo, yo... yo...
My mind keeps playin' tricks, I'm caught up in The Matrix
Digital mould, your flows is all wasted
You smoke weed with seeds, I crush mines and lace it
Two tokes a pass, kid it's all basic
I know you lust, so relax and be patient
As soon as I spark the stem, ya all taste it
Number one on the charts, it's time to erase it
Replace it, you was wack from the start, face it

Good night, here's your kiss
Sleep well and make a wish
Don't be scared, I won't bite
I keep you warm and hold you tight
Good night, here's your kiss
Sleep well and make a wish
Don't be scared, I won't bite
I keep you warm and hold you tight
Your dynamite antics drove me to your magic
Merrily down the stream, you got me goin' frantic
Enchanted by your kiss, the apple's gigantic
In your Atlantic abyss I'ma sink my Titanic
Granted your wish to be captured on candid camera
Oh shit, I got to pamper you
With this hand trick gambit, open handed
Edible panties, no need for the hamper
We can spread out on the floor like Pampers
Chantin? Karma Sutra, you got me speakin'? Spanglish
Mamacita, fuck semantics
Goddamn it, you understand it?
I'm about to blow like somebody pushed the panic
You fever the gene that Yaqub sub-planted
Shape and mold ya body just like ceramics
Big valley rodeo style, above to stand with
Dream, dream, cream, cream
Legs open, I'm in between
You squelch and scream, I split your gene
My chi, my yi, my shit, my jig
My lee, my con, crown me Kong King
Bottles of Ginseng, Jamaican ting
Wood root, it's the ultra sheen
Your flower bein? blossomed, pollinate like Spring
Good night, here's your kiss
Sleep well and make a wish
Don't be scared, I won't bite
I keep you warm and hold you tight
Good night, here's your kiss
Sleep well and make a wish
Don't be scared, I won't bite
I keep you warm and hold you tight
Love, love, love is in the air, fireplaces, winter time
Bottles of wine, cuddled up with a friend of mine
She a dime and in her physical prime
So every time we grind, she get a chill up her spine
Sign is Virgo, she from Chicago
She like my slow flow and like my turbo
I'm like yo, we can burn the herbal
I got the purple and you in my circle
By them hips I can tell she fertile
So I'ma take my time and as slow as a turtle
And I like her verbals, that wine she gurgle
Got her actin' terrible
And that ass is durable
Had her bent over in the Bentley convertible
The girl was beautiful, my flow was surgical
And now I'm preferable
Good night, here's your kiss
Sleep well and make a wish
Don't be scared, I won't bite
I keep you warm and hold you tight
Good night, here's your kiss
Sleep well and make a wish
Don't be scared, I won't bite
I keep you warm and hold you tight
When tonight chime, I taste your kiss
I make a wish, for you
When tonight chime, I feel your kiss
I make your dreams come true
She was gorgeous, wit ass that make you cum fast like Porsches
Face look like a portrait, body like a fortune
Mills in small bills and tall heels, flexin? sex appeal
Got my mind ponderin?, wonderin? how the sex would feel
First to kill she'd be an assassin, main part of her attraction
Was her sense of fashion, stopped her and asked her name
Complimented her elegance, she blushed, respond with intelligence
Her scent was heaven sent
Offered me a drink, beautiful with dead presidents
A few drinks later, we back at her residence
Surprised and 35, I was deep between her thighs
When she came she cried, looked me deep in my eyes and said
Good night, here's your kiss
Sleep well and make a wish
Don't be scared, I won't bite
I keep you warm and hold you tight
Good night, here's your kiss
Sleep well and make a wish
Don't be scared, I won't bite
I keep you warm and hold you tight"

(Hook: Allah Real)
When I was small
We had nothing at all
We used to eat Grits, for dinner
It was pain
Almost drive a man insane
What we could find for
To survive another day
But I said nah...
(RZA)
An old killa bee once hummed me a tune
Stay up at night, don't sleep on ya moon
Four seeds in the bed, eight seeds in the room
Afternoon cartoon, we would fight for the spoon
Old Earth in the kitchen, yell ""it's time to eat""
Across the foyer, ya hear the gather of stampeding feet
One pound box of sugar, and a stick of margarine
A hot pot of Grits got my family from starvin'
Loose with the welfare cheese, thick wit' the gravy
Used to suck it, straight out the bottle as a baby
Steamy hot meal serve less than five minutes
Big silver pot, boilin' water, salt in it
House full of brothers and sisters, the pop's missin'
Pillsbury box on the stove in the kitchen
(Masta Killa)
Young shorties in my hood started hustlin'
Packin' bags at the neighbourhood associate
Growin' up, not as fortunate to have that fly shit
I'm too young, no jobs'd hire me legit
You walkin' down the street with ya gun in ya hand
Drinkin', thinkin' of a masterplan
Your Old Earth can't afford what ya friends got
So you roll up to the spot, with ya thing 'pon cock
And it seems worth the takin', stomach achin'
Morning star Reggie makin' go good with the Grits
Now let's take it back for real
When we used to build at ghetto big wheels
With the shoppin' cart wheels, and wood to nail the seat on
Girls skippin' rope in the street
The Summer heat, left the jelly prints stuck to they feet
Skelly chief, flippin' baseball cards for keeps
Momma said it's gettin' late, and it's time to come eat"

You never ask the question, ""Who's the man behind the red mask?""
About to a driveby on MC's so listen
Aiyyo!
Yo my mic check is Robo-Tech
Run over the track till my lyrical GigaPet slow flow
Cardiac arrest like FloJo, rock ice Ro-Ro
Pack fo-fo fo' sure though
More and more cream, and niggaz Still Love You Rakeem
The game of death, we kickin niggaz in the chest like Kareem
My wingspan is wider than Rodan
My sweet and sour niggaz wit nose candy sniff blow by the gram
I grammatically slam, before I eat a groupie bitch pussy
The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan is eatin ham
So catch me in Deep Space Nine
Wit eight million stories on seven continents
And six billion bullets on the Star Trek
Solid state logic thug niggaz electronic
Eat, drink, sleep, shit, fuck, build and smoke chronic
Playa, this is not a game, I said it before
Went through the door I came wit Wu-Tang
The Artist Formerly Know as You
Got snatched out his truck on Florence and Normandy Duke
We strictly Digital
(Bobby Digital)
Yo, yo, yo, yo
The Last Starfighter, my thoughts make the sun shine brighter
I bust in a bitch mouth to make her teeth seem whiter
Roam like space drones through all time zones
Your face get blown, I make home, Bobby'll fuck Grace Jones
Mocha caps without lithium cristal
Raise the pendulum cuts through your ear tissue, Digital signal
Scramble your brain then we gain the visuals
Like Microsoft, I might micro-walk before the lights go off
You develic bitches, I give your tonsils eighty stitches

(It's all about Bobby, I'm floatin in your galaxy)
You fallin' down a endless tunnel of doom reality
Graphically, my killer bee family stings the galaxy
Insanity, titanium stomach, devouring Guinness
My flesh is solid stone despite my outer appearance
Still diseased, kill viruses, planets and racial creatures
Made MC's sprout tumors so bad, lost facial features
Waste your peoples, left out in the rain, fountains of pain
Eighty shots to the mouth and the brain, shoutin my name
Holocaust, black man, whose veins littered with thorns
Back-smack you so hard, all your seeds will be born deformed
Swarm dorms, sting birds, fling verbs like mean curbs
Strike three, mics flee, I infect 'em with green germs, ringworm
'Cause I'm filthy and guilty, dastardly, mastery
My felony melody has to be a bastards masterpiece
Start graftin' me, chump-ass niggaz eyein' me, temp me
I'll break it down simply, I'm horrifyingly empty
Spittin' darts on the tip of a glacier used for my hide-out
Rock crusher German suplex, watch spines slide out
The side route, Forearm bash with twenty jabs on the ave
Or your lab, get stabbed in bloodied bad
While, I'm sippin herbal teas, verbal bees plant fertile seeds
Bitches leave with broke backs, swollen palms and purple knees
Circle thieves like vultures in deserts rest on a cactus
Got oscar nominee MC's stuck to my hatchet
Drastic, indescribable pain, I injure bars
While, Bobby's throwin' razor CD's like ninja stars

Chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chhhhh
Yo, yo, yo, dropped down a man-hole, yo, a rap ammo
Blows out your candle, check, yo
Dropped down a man-hole, a rap ammo
Blows out your candle, have Wu-Tang tagged up on your tombstone by Ganno
Release the info, 4-4 increase your heart tempo
Scared your ass, you jumped through a closed window
To a hundred beats per a second, my mic's secret weapon
Infertiate your style to that of Led Zeppelin
Encyclopedia Brittanica, Hanna Barbera, world of super adventure
Couldn't give a proper word on the scripture of my manner
You're just a flicker to my inferno, we burn for eternal
MC's delight - popcorn, we poppin' every kernel
Jot us in your journal, we hot like a thermal
Nuclear explosion, under my control of your country
Like the Federal Enforcement Management Agency
My technique, be vocabulary freak
Recite for state, my divine is like Dante's Peak
At most, you'll be trapped off in PatMoss
Get smacked in the back of your neck with the black toast
King Cobra, back blew back and bare foot
On the roof dusted out, waitin for carriers
Poppin' like Orville Reddenbacher or Betty Crocker
The pop secret is the forty-five glock popper
Control men like rats that's controlled by Ben or Willard
American Express privelages, blood spillage
We got more balls then village
Star-spangled banner, soldier stand up
Cobra commander, stop the propaganda
Thirty shot banana clip, full-loaded, radar scanners get decoded
Digital warfare torments your head, eye's bloated
Nexus floated, poison darts quoted
American eagle stingin up blue Beetle Bailey
On the wine mixed with Hennessey daily
Keep thee scaly, Israeli niggaz from the clan
We bide the omish that'll harness the promised land
(Dr. Doom)
Yo, yo, yo, you can't escape from the Dr. of Doom
My lyrics bloom on bafoons and take flight like witches brooms
That full moon on all you dumb-dumbs
Watch your filthy rise away like soap scum
The war-lord swingin' flamin swords just like a shogun
Of the darkness, my scriptures cause arches like flamin archmen
My killer bee sting remains accurate like a marksman
So, tape with caution, we attack like black martians
Corner of the market, by usin' digital strategies
Reefer sparks my acid battery, y'all niggaz flatter me
With all that tough talk, I drop bombs like Mookie Blaylock
>From the outside or the inside, create intense rides
When my pen glides all MC's will get they heads flied
For talkin' shit, lyrics always strike throughout my dungeon pit
Killer bees must reign supreme throughout the continent
We conquered it, mother fuckers

Eh yo, the beat terminal, exquisite young coolie high production
Caught up in the hollow-head suction
Ten pogo sticks, two black-belts that break bricks
Diet coke meetin's with the rich
I'm faithfully married to rap
We've been engaged for twelve years
Tyson bite Holyfield ear
We love the sport, look out your window
Now see, pull up to say, y'all be amazed me
Tony Starks, spaceship, ran by a daughter's cellar
Only man out, walked through hell
Dick swingin' like shit went well
Call it the mighty Joe Young
Double-swirl slush, Wonder Woman, sapphire shit with the pearls
It looked real nice, yo, heavy on the gravy
Third, bag a secretary in the glaze, he tagged eighty words
From Whirl-winds to whirl-pools, see wise watch the earth spin
Sunny-dance with the serpent, who shot JJ and it's my bone
The same nigga ridin' the train, same nigga with his name on the jacket
Switch to chaseable, inhaled the bad bag of that Jason
Fell out twice in the basement

You motherfucking triple breed motherfuckers
Bitches we love you motherfucka
Verse 1: RZA (Hoe)
Bobby Digi, Bob Digital shit is critical
Laid the fuck up inside the hospital
It's a riddle of a sphinx bitch had me jinx wid hijinx
Cuban linx snatched from my neck
It was the sex,
This 12 ounce bottle of bex had me drunk
One night laid up wit the Ol' Dirt and ten bags of skunk
Just met this hoe last month
Lookin' like a Benz with a woofer in the trunk
I pushed up like a push-up stick
One hand up near my cheek the other hand was holdin' my dick
I said ""Power equal... Boo!""
RZA people I be Bobby D-I-G-I too
(Is that right?) Word, and exact
Girl you got a smile that a make a nigga heart crack
(For real?) Word to grill like a thousand dollar bill
Close your eyes count to three and click you heels
And we could end up at my place face to face
Butt-naked I'll invade your inner space
*Sniff* Straight up boo,
Damn I can taste it!
One drop of sperm the God wouldn't waste it
Over the quilt,
I rather put it inside you so your breast be filled with milk
And we could lay up,
And I could squeeze until it tilts
My house built on stilts is bangin' like the Hilton
Look how you feelin' gimme some feeback boo 'cause I need that
(Look Bobby where's the beer and the weed at?)
Look girl shit I got more than a little
She set me up for the kiss of the black widow
Verse 2: O.D.B
You couldn't get a flick of the hype outfit
Cause the way that I'ma dress this style is mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream Oww!
Whether at a party or just in bed
Or thoughts of Ason bitch keep that in your head
My beats are funky my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I say well motherfucka what's the recipe
I don't know I ask my ma she don't know
Go ask ya poppa...
It's all about me in the place to be
Nigga you all that uh...
Motherfucka that shit is due it's mad
Motherfucking game and it's a God-damn shame
How many motherfuckas wanna know this name, Ason
Yo I LOCK ON pass the break!
Shake and motivate, stimulate

By this ways that you dying you have in your clutch
Fall in love like a drug
Call out into her love flood
Fuck her so much dunn you'll only bust blood
Caught inside the scud-missile grip like tissue

Collapse like the Berlin Wall, while I'm just hurlin' y'all

Bust like the spermbag, because your germ had
You on some ol' fake thug shit
Drunk from the drink, gassed up by the drug shit
Wrong analysis: kidney shot cause dialysis

Careful, you might get trampled, caught flashin'
Wrap him in the maskin' tape, Jimmy Baskin
Murder was the case when the crowd break fool
Iron Mic Duel, held down by the poolside
Along came a spider spun spools in the cipher
Swing with all your might, lead spray from the sawed-off pipe
Stenographer type, the ghetto hype slang
Flow like water off the brim in the rain
No escapin', Iron Maiden, check matin'
Grandmaster Flash spinnin, P.F. cuttin'
The sticky Ave. gooey, roll in the frontal leaf
Jamel Irief smash teef in be

Some people lyrics ain't hot
My delivery is ill on the mic and I rock
So hot, this stage should be a stainless steel pot
Leavin' burnin' pains Neosporin couldn't stop
On cats who couldn't rock
Would shook 'cause I drop 'em
Fear is a problem in this game if you got 'em
My mic I carry the heat for rappers playin' possum
'Fraid that I'm a see 'em, spit a rhyme, lyrically drop 'em
Just to say I got 'em, but it's realer than that
I'm about more that what you see and what I speak in my rap
So be conscious of that
Grand told you, ""Watch the quiet ones, you didn't get it?""
You think that you could rip a chick who spit her lyrics
Pretty rhymes so tight my lyrics did it
Got you open and it worked it and you won't admit it
Hopin' that we both forget it
These ain't no one night stand lyrics, I'm never really finished
Got you duckin', tryin' to pivot, beware

Puffin' all that trash, you best to see so (so so)
So I introduced her nightcap, she was like, ""I like that""
Later on tonight, you know, I gotta spit that
Flow and a half, blow at her back
I like it rough, and I hope she's rough back
She was like say her name

Needle threaded, one jaw have said it

Wu boats will float, torpedo, you can't stay a-float
You sink to the brink of extincted animals

Steal stinger, Killa Bee ten inches, sharper than picket fences
Quick to detect your intentions, if they're wicked
Meditate, build the house on the next dimension
My flow is co-hension, you'll be startled
Stumbled into my lab half-drunk

Recochet to the ceilin, the desert eagle hemisphere
Deflect off your medula, exit off to the rear

And makin' beats to me is easier than bein
Killin' vibes is easier than seein
I be geein, and fuck with the Wu-Tang Clan is wildin

Yo, your floweress is powerless against me
Your cowardess attack can master track alchemist raps
Rap Malcolm, my champagne staims, silver, lex bullet 4
Millennium falcon, just to protect the Wu-Tang's sacred valium
Chased by jake's planes, I race state's police
We slay microphone foes, the size of ro-beasts
Unpredictable pain is inflictable
Razor blade will ripple you, death blow will cripple you
1.9 level meter, son, you just skipped on my class
Is here to rap camera classes, hi-jack these bus passes
This system was symphonic, jacked with no masses
Sound systems blast-es, rhyme system was writin, well-casted
Strong as safari hunter, calm in black mongo
Un-plug the dynamic mic cord and hung you
From a towerin speaker, I tape your ear to the tweater
My mental idea's are more severe than your heater
Innocent drive-bys, 85'ers shoot try to over throw us
They love us like babies, once they get to know us
Your floweress is powerless against me

Smellin like I ran over I skunk

I begin to pray for today might be my dying day
The great mind, surpass space and time
Seven plains of energy, interlace combine
Five conscious stages, stand up courageous
Change your polarity, seek mental clarity
Ziplock off the chronic, kissed it, then I twist it
Build on today's mathematic ballistics

It's a quick locked secret so Protect Ya Neck

Nope, you get your face all over the bicep
Go out the closet, you slimy sausage
Six degrees of luxury with no deposit

The mathematician who calculated God from nigga
The Zig Zag Zigga, who civilize the wigga

Bytes of information in one line, I sometime
Use the sky for a blanket, then I bathe in sunshine
Nine concubines and nine wives, nine lives
Nine grands sit on my side, we carry nine knives
Eighteen strikes from Low Hand, ain't no man
Can withstand the blow from the Wu-Tang Clan
I answer many questions of life without asking
Breathe in the stench of death without gasping
Fasting and praying while you laughing and playing
I am fast in my mind to attachment, what we came in
And go through the river of life, I stay floating
Live a hundred twenty degrees without quoting

They said, they said I'd be okay
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day
I have no fascination with Satan, no relation to probation
I'm the sun sitting still, while you trapped in rotation
Every rebel's creation, every thought has been ovation
One demonstration, we civilized a whole entire nation
Attract a generation, who's built with elimination
Of wickedness and sickness, we striving for the bliss
We rising up our fists, five stage of consciousness
Keeping our promises, master our circumference
It's been a long time coming
Days, days are turning to nights now
They said, they said I'd be okay
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day
It seems like life is gonna pass me by
But now I'm reborn to a new chance, a new opportunity
And life has just begun
If you ain't having a good time stop wasting your time
Seven plains of energy must interlace and combine
And all praises due to the Most High, I'm here forever"

You make me dizzy, ah

Lost and founded, stay surrounded
By these hoes who can't count it
Park the whip then dismount it
Forty ounce, yeah I down 'em
Shorties drowns in pools of love
With these ounces I be loungin?
Roof thugs chew on slugs
Maneuver through hoods and clubs
Purple kush by the bush
Dick is curved like Nike swoosh
Push, push in this bush
Guaranteed to make her shush
Red bone, head on tilt
Six hundred cell phone bill
Big trucks, shell toe wheels

Yo, women I love 'em, leave 'em
Lust 'em but I don't trust 'em

My finger fuck 'em
They sell me off in return
Women I love 'em
They love me back in return
I'm just a young man
Head smart, cock strong

Throw a mean dart, fuck it, we on
And got this fly talk
I kick that ass to the curb
You on the sidewalk
You gon' respect the Don's words
Your love so Digi, ah
You make me dizzy, ah
Hypnotized by her hips and thighs
Beastin? on the bitch, I ain't gon' lie
The H E Double N E, Double S Y
Got me in the vibe, her ass is super sized
I can see the future up in her eyes
We'll be dumb high, keep her occupied
Till the sunrise, I beat it up right
Then she can't deny she heard the roosters cry
Break her ass down with some crucial lines
Nasty darts known to seduce the mind
She all up in my world, she ain't even my girl
But she knowin' my world produce dollar signs
Whispered in my ear she'll swallow mine
Like she don't do this freaky type of shit all the time
Like she was the one or her head was that bum
I be dumb, sprung and just call her mine
Your love so Digi, ah
You make me dizzy, ah

The technique, depends mainly
On arm and finger strength
Once you've that, then the next step
Is to learn how to pierce stone
Well you might as well start practicing now
Do you-Do you-Do you-Do you
Do you know, mantis legends?
How it was it all started?
It was fighting off this blackbird
Although it was only a tenth of the bird's size
It was a very valiant insect
And that's why the technique, needs a brave man
And a strong one, who isn't afraid of birds
(Bobby Digital)
Welcome back to the temple of hip-hop and Sword Kem'po
Lyrical rhyme nympho, b-boy Bob Digital
Diamond crystal ring solid gold bone rituals
We be the humble most calmest individuals
Hard to spot microdots, we Sasquatch
Stomp MC's, third eye Cyclops lazer beam shots
Being fired once the father get raised up
We John Blaze up, abrasive heat, from the phaser gun
Never left for a stun Dunn, Atilla the Hun
Type Killa Park Hilla, eighteen wheeler Mack's
In the truck lanes, from the rugged grains
Of Shaolin soil, the red wolves be prowlin
Howlin over the shit that got the whole world bowin'
We spoiled, one thousand swordsmen
One thousand recordings, one thousand Wu stores and
One thousand rap tours and global insurance
Not your everyday occurrence
My rhyme torments MC's with the fear of God
You'll be cursed like Farad, and struck by the iron rod
Tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-POW
Chorus: Tekitha
Hell's Wind Staff, the wrath of Black Titans
Niggaz battlin, sword swingin'
Cutthroat women, whirlwind given save the children
Escape the poverty for live and, let live
Die by the mic, shadow skill by night

Man-Mantis style isn't easy to learn
A mantis is small, but powerful
With it's arms, it can lift up many times it's own weight

On behalf of the Wu-Tang Clan I'll display
The Hong Kong, Shaolin King Kong poems
Slaps niggaz in half from Kwan'tan
Ten tigers scratch like Allah math, the Hell's Wind Staff
Watch the eight diagram strike the diaphragm
Pierced lung minute from tongue double-edged
Sound the drum, here I come as predicted
Holdin' the raw seal, all heads kneel
7th Degree black mic skill is ill, listen to the guns holler
Swallow the shell, East New York terrorist
Break fool to this, madness, crazy low-hand
Grabs the mic stand, smooth as water
Spat Seven Seas you've not yet mastered
Breathe and lungs wheeze, Earth kills
I'm wreckin MC's, blood spills, meadow is round
The piercin sound of silence deafens ears
Fires fears, wood sharp eagle claw tears
Tree from bark, hard to maintain control
When you leakin I stand with the strength of Jobe
And hold pressure that'll bust your head, while I'm teachin
Civilization, one havin' Knowledge
Wisdom Understanding, culture refinement
Knowledge savage in pursuit of happiness
Thunderous mantis, all chant this"
40,Money Don't Own Me,2008,Digi Snacks (2008),Hip Hop,RZA,"My woman and my money don't own me
I've got to keep holdin' my own
Heaven, heaven
The dangerous dynamite dosage, mind full of explosives
Digital brain is the closest to Moses
Civilizin? came, the flame inside the holster
Revitalize the game, the name's on the poster
The mask with no cape, the flash'll crush grapes
The dancer on the lap, the ass with no face
It's shaped like an ace, say your grace before you taste it
Haste makes waste, slow down or you may waste it
The bunny in the car look like an Indian squall
The honey's in the jar, the money's in the bra
It's funny ha ha ha, how dummies, ha ha ha
Think 'cause we call 'em sunny they can be a star
I implement the instrument, disintegrate the 10 percent
You entered the square but you don't know where the circle went
You ain't worth the cent, you cursed, I birthed the Prince
Drenched the baby from creators that the nurses sent
You can't still convent, don't have seven cents
Grave the raven, my birds are heaven sent
Where the brethren went? Where the Reverend went?
I told you these words are heaven sent
My woman and my money don't own me
I've got to keep holdin' my own
It's time to show you how them rugged MC's rock
If that's steel you see, it's that steel I pop
If that Benz I want, it's that Benz I got
Who rock them white tees first, get a West Cost props
Can't nobody do it better than the West Coast veteran
Three six letterman, Monk's the name
Black Knights the gang, I'll ignite the flames
Strike my hood up on the wall and cross out your name
With a K on the end of it, that won't be the end of it
Till them guns is drawn and you standin? on the end of it
Poof be gone, I'ma write that wrong
I'm the shit all by myself, nobody writes my song
Peep my technique, strictly gangsta classics
Gun talk nigga, muthafuck theatrics
My flow is matchless, ain't no way you could surpass this
Level I'm on, better go home and try to practice
Why yes, am I next to impress
D T S, bless the best, no cess
Stress from guess to gold press
The quest to protest, we head the Pro-Keds
But this is the new improved shit
'08 from the AMG, '92, bitch
My woman and my money don't own me
I've got to keep holdin' my own
Keep holdin'?, keep holdin'?
Keep holdin'?, keep holdin'?, no"

Hit the bodega for a 40 ounce son, Garcia Vega
Two bags of chips, and one pack of Now and Laters
Flame tucked down to my nuts, on my last buck
Only thing keep a nigga calm is a good fuck
Loose-leaf cigarettes be dipped in wet
Chicken of the seas get trapped inside my net
With their clothes off, son when the gun goes off
I'm bound to play Napoleon, and blow a nose off -
Your Sphinx; your stumble rap style, your flow's off
Like Kunta, tryin' to run with his chopped toes off
Unchallenged sword I yield the storm rider
Clip full of ruffled-tip fast-actin' long fire
Four hundred grain cartridge, with steel casin
Those who can't draw the crowd is still tracin
The mic is cast to the floor and shapeshifted
Heavy as the hammer of Thor you can't lift it
So tense, bitch there's no defense
This four-four inch'll make you jump the fence
Right eye squinted; I speak brok-len English
Stumble off the cold four-oh of Olde English Wu brew
Two-two inside the shoe
No describin what this heat, in my jacket could do
I teach, seeds to read, never reach for the weed indeed

Sit in the sun six hours then I charge up like Goku
Dragonball Z; imagine you're raggin me
That's like walkin' through a Blood hood flaggin a C
Not, tryin' to tell you how much weight we carry
It may get, every snake in the tri-state buried
Plus, Feds had one add, sayin' I gun traffed
I sold twenty million records bitch; some laugh!
Fresh shafts of morning dew on Nancy Drew
Sherlock Holmes crime sleuth couldn't figure the Wu
You loaf of bread head, keep a sober head
One point five million years my overhead

I keep MC's puzzled keep my dogs in the muzzle
Ice cold forty ounce drink 'em down with one guzzle
Son might spit a word at a bird, see if she chirp back
Tall chocolate deluxe buttercup, off the meat rack
A chickenhead scratch the yard for worms
And roosters walk around with their heads in the perm
I be spreadin knowledge keepin' my third eye polished
Never, chase for dollars to fulfill the black wallet
You must be Bellevue son I walk with twelve jewels
Afford anything this world could sell you
Beats that the change the style'll rearrange ya

Ride shotgun and, bobby keep the love comin'
Compares when my niggaz come in I'm sittin' pretty and my lovin' is digi (bobby digital)
Fresh dipped out my laboratory, just dropped down bout 40 stories
Red and blue mismatched shoe, abandoned your wu-wear bandana
Hit the ground, you analog cats ain't got nothin' for me
Play you vegas type hoes silly, like dantana
Bubble hill banger goose, gold rope thick as hangman noose
She had the honey blonde hair mixed, with the chocolate mousse
Butterfly tattoo, boo, let me holla at you
New york city ditty bop type slang, girl let's smoke a blantz
And I'll change that tattoo to a wu-tang tattoo
Hit the jack danz, and after that we could dance
With the black widow, gold benz with the chrome griddle
Fat juicy lips, ebony let me taste your spittle

Hear rap like angela bassett for malcolm x
And one inside her power-u she said she use for nuttin
Ice cold golden texts, cassette of inspectah deck
Uncontrolled substance, earring inside her belly button
Scream on it, bobby the black green hornet
Girl dream on it, I put the killa bee sting on it
Rejuvenated, honey kept her throat lubricated
Let off so much chi, ginseng couldn't recuperate it
Quentin tarantino type porn, like lewinsky-bill clinton
Suck it down with no commercial,
Back scratchin, eyes squintin, dusk to dawn
Good power universal self savior why

Screw the top off the boilin pot, girl you must be boilin hot
Sit on my unfalling cock, let me strike your g spot

Yo, kept a nigga well fed, put seven braids in my head
Pillow soft as cobweb, egyptian cotton bedspread
Lyin' deep between the legs, I mix the sperm with the eggs
Bust off about a keg, she called it creamy nutmeg

Throw on my high beams, her breasts was like two scoops of ice cream I scream, you scream, we all want, ice cream
Bone until she fall asleep, she can have a nice dream I scream, you scream, we all want the ice cream

Perfect precision marksman, spit darts an, flip charts 'an

Mista pitiful, your whole shrap stack is despicable
Undernourished, your shit cannot flourish
Cherish every moment of his love before you perish

Take your pussy out like a pap smear
Make you smile, at the same time crack a tear
Smack ya rear, vagina saliva, Trojan wear, rough rider

Taste the apple cider, you become strong, then become a ?prider?

Some said Bobby oughta burn in hell because these fancy bitches
Got a closet full of kung-fu flicks and nasty pictures
A library to decipher anything religious
He beg for mercy, we pray for Allah forgiveness
Rough nights, tough nights polite cuff tight
Locked the fuck up, someone's mad enought to snuff mic
Couldn't fuck right or puff right
This 15-year-old bastard got drunk and stuck like
The kid in the GangStarr vid, +Just to Get a Rep+
Pop goes the clip, moms out on the steps
See sometimes he feel like a motherless, starve for another kiss
At night search the skies and searchin for the mothership
Only to find it's all inside yourself
Are you ready for the things of mental health?
This old man had a lack of mental health
Because his grandfather Clyde got to old for hisself
So he had to die with a cold on his chest
The Old Earth said that the soul went to rest
Something that we never could understand
Is what he told me, sayin';
""Yo, how could the ghost be holy?""
That's what he told me, when I watch TV all I see
Is unfriendly ghosts is bustin' through like Scream Part 3
(Junior Reid)
Them say Digital way
All the youths, them ah say
They wants them to live in the Rastaman way
Now follow Babylon way, long time nah Babylon ah lead them astray
They want Bobby Digital way, say the pussy and the +Righteous Way+
Want the Rastaman way, Rastaman never lead you astray
Righteous way

Now lead the youths, them astray
Tell them to watch and pray
Just, watch and pray
Jah will lead the way

49,See the Joy,2003,Birth of a Prince (2003),Hip Hop,RZA,"See the joy of life beginning
See the joy of life beginning
Oh sweet joy!
A brand new baby boy
My mind flashed back to the early moon
When I was just a sperm cell in the fallopian tube
In the mist of a state of triple darkness
Going through a struggle so I could exist
Avoiding everything that came within my path
As I watch other sperm cells get ripped in half
One out of a million completes the job
And for the other sperm cells the womb is a grave yard
Though my travels I had to pass through
A lot of battles and violent hassles
Cause inside the womb I was a foreign object
I'm like a new nigga walking through the project
Trouble, everywhere I turn
Damn it's a struggle just being a sperm
Cell, so I attempt to prevail
I guess the womb is the first stage of hell
Now here I am in the danger zone
My head and my tail, my 23 chromosomes
But then again yo it can't be that bad cause my dad
He could have used a body bag
And if so then my tomb would have been the trash can inside my moms bedroom
But they was fucking, they was true to this
And here a go on a mission to the uterus
A million mother fuckers tried to race ahead
But I was the one that fertilized the egg
Then I thought then I was safe
Because I reached home base
But oh no my job wasn't done
In fact my troubles had only begun life as a struggle
Life is the struggle
Life is the struggle
See the joy of life beginning
See the joy of life beginning
Oh sweet joy!
A brand new baby boy"

Where you crab niggas want to go, I've been there
Carry big guns, without bein parried
Yo, Cali niggas say it's carried
Yo, don't waste your mind on time, don't chase the blind
Don't eat swine, don't play with loaded 9's
Don't quote weak rhymes
If you approached by a brother in need, give him shine
Show him light, don't get emotional, son, don't fight
Unless it's self-defense, to break the savage backs

Yo, try to cross reference, my epic preference
Fresh mint, tight lint, you get trapped inside the monkey wrench
Ain't no man lover ever gonna silk the sealer
I'm blessed like the seed who sucked the milk from Mahalia
You wishin' Shaolin Island could be swallowed up by the sea
Gobbled up, like the lost city of Moore and Atlantis
But I'm fierce as the cyclone winds that blew through Kansas
Have your clan stranded on the enchanted land of Gumas Azubar
Gem blue star, razor blade scar
Who dare wanna spar bar for bar? Allah you Akbar
I turn the most degenerate hood into a pop star
Bless the seed who prays the Most High, without askin' why
Flicks from ocean shore, kick like Marshall Law
I might strike with the eagle claw or tiger paw
On the shores of African beach, facin' the east
White sands stretched out as far as the eye can see
Found buried by the sea
The heat of Allah son will crack through Antarctica
We ride blue whales, you sell Nautica ships on the carpenter
We should send all these Devils back to Hell
You small as to die in my sentence, I speak with vengeance
Snatch up 17 million plus 2 million Indians

You didn't know it was a Wu-Tang affiliation
Legs speak like twigs, you're forbidden like pig

Cursed the ancestors and the seed of the assailant
Dissect his body like an alien

Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head
All you niggas out there who got money
Better watch out for the money hungry
Straight up...
The most beloved from a region undiscovered
I've been hovered over by black buzzard walkin' through public
Imagine the feelin' of growin' up, ten children
Stuffed inside a shack, in the project buildings
Women, infants and coupons, one stole camel soup on
Stressed out with four kids, aborter
Next door the dope fiend neighbour tryin' to sell his little daughter
Poisonous, heat from the oven
The only way we had to live was survivin' off mommy's lovin'
Dead bodies found in the incinerator
Lights Out, somebody fucked up the generator
Talkin' welfare, cheese, franks and beans
Mud stains on mock-neck shirts and tainted jeans
Twisted up, how the fuck we get bended up?
And ended up in this four block radius where they enslaved us
Sweatin' from cheese ravioli with tomato sauce and anchovie
Spoiled, ah shit, my blood boiled
But fuck that, I'm ready for open hand combat
It's the tomcat, and my thoughts are unlimited
Inflicted fatal wounds and I'm immune, see a evil society

That was +Only Built 4+ niggas with +Cuban Linx+
Who +Entered the 36th Chamber+
And keep the true links, inherit +The W+ emblem
Movin' the muscle changin' and bone tendon bendin'
Science of 25 thousand year millennium
The sinners from the men who exiled the Indians from India
Who's times can't be measured linear
In all tribes on Earth who can't find a friendlier group of people
Who shunt all evil, treat all men equal
Even though we see through your wicked intentions
We gave you land to experiment with your inventions
But you strive for global lynchin', extension
But it's yourself that will become extinct
You inherit this power to think and build things
The free wills of love, not hate or kill things
And when you went astray, we sent prophets to reveal things
And left scriptures behind to fulfill things
But you still wanna kill things, rob and steal things
So don't blame us when it's time to fulfill things and kill Kings

Raise the sword and praise the Lord
On this wicked society, society
Raise your sword and praise the Lord

Ever since my Birth (no one there!)
I've had no one to care (worried all I know... yeah!)

They say wisdom, is the wise words spoken
By a brother attemptin' to open
The graves, of these mentally dead slaves
Who've been lost on a cross, for decades
And centuries, lookin' for the liberty
But receive nothin', but misery
And hard times, and things of that nature
By the devil in a genocide caper
Little Boy Peep, has lost his sheep
But I found 'em, in a deep long sleep
Nine thousand miles away from home
Livin' the life of a modern-day Flintstone
We the people, supposed to be equal
But the men who wrote that, they was evil
Slave owners, who did not include us
They just used us, and abused us
First they trick you, then mentally kill you
And use technologies, to rebuild you
This whole plan was a perfect scam
See that's why they called it, the Six Million Dollar Man
Six is the limitation of the Devil
In the Million square miles of land that he settles
Put you in a three piece suit, give you loot
Chemicals in your head to make you look cute
They use you as a fool to deceive your own people
And fillin' my children head with pins and needles
But I'll take out the pins you inserted
And I'll avenge all my mothers that you murdered
And brutalized, by this modern form of slavery
To speak the truth it takes bravery
And no man could stop my flow
Because I know what I speak and I speak what I know

Seen through Panavision
The inner light inside my mind's shines expands the prism
A man of wisdom, victorious and the glorious
Sight beyond sight we stand up as Divine Warriors
Who smite with the mighty right hand of God
Yield the holy sword, swings the holy rod
Then bathe in the pond of Nirvana, escape the realm of Karma
Allow the true grace of God to shine through my persona
And build the reconstructional terms that's constructive
As we destroy the negative germs that's destructive
Productively, sincerely, we uphold the righteous banner
With the gold touch of Midas, mold the righteous hammer
And anvil, to the sound of Man-drill
Ignite to the speed of light cause time to stand still
Rewrite the script of Egypt, who made the Holy Bible
Or Koran, how long ago, who made the Holy Title?
Of I Self Lord And Master, who control the vital
Parts of your heart, who wrote the wise recitals?

Still puzzled like the jigsaw

Many tips, or many Vicks, many sticks
And love to fuck with plenty chips"

Car 36, 36, we got a situation in progress
37 between 106th
We got a possible homicide
All cars, all cars, we got a situation down
(RZA)
Aiyo, toxi' off the grey goose, vodka, shots of hypnotic
Y'all bitches want beef, son, you got it
Fresh off the bliz-knock, Bob Diz-noc
Plex on the K.B., son, you get shiz-not
Right in your hiz-ead, you'll be diz-ed
Don't front on this nigga, I'mma from New York Ci-zey!
Y'all butter pec', make my nuts weak
Have me walk around, talkin' backward with stutter speak
Like tuh tuh tuh tuh tuh, buh buh buh buh
Butter pec', make my nutter weak
And y'all crabs down south, you ain't got a clue
How it feel to slip in that papi chino power u
White Cadillac truck just high beamed us
Mami look like she was Angie Martinez
I don't espanol, I play imposter
I was like ""Mamacita, yah yah, que pasa?""
And slip back to my casa
She was like ""Nigga! You sound like rasta!""
I'm the ace in the decks...
(Girl speaking Spanish)
(RZA)
I'm the ace in the deck, still casin' a Tec
That filled with the taste of the lead, buck buck
The bass and the treb', the space in the back
Where chumps walk by, and they face get slapped
I'm not known to talk a lot
Sit on five whips, son, so I don't walk a lot
Got ten chicks, so I don't hawk a lot
Been around the world, but I love New York a lot
Especially up in Bedstuy, with those crazy Cuffies
Or in Fort Green, with those crazy Cuffies
Y'all floss like y'all Jay-Z and Puffy's
You get robbed, bucked down by a crazy Cuffie
Bobby! Fuckin' the mics is my hobby
Fuckin' the mics is my hobby

Yo, I beat the case, now I face the acquittal
You nizzles try to belittle, but y'all lest in spittle
From a baby's lip, the digi made me flip
Plus they paid me chips, just to spray the clip
And empty out on you, in sync like the SMPTE output on the MPC 2002
We be housin' crews, plus we housin' fools
In abandoned apartments with a thousand tools
Crazy shootin' dudes buck off the beat
Brainless boutless fools who be stuck off the leaf
Two guns in their hands yellin' ""Fuck the police!""
On the weekend get drunk and they fuck with the niece
Of the precint chief, she got the tattoo
On her breast that's shaped like The W
Go 'head snatch the guns, son, I'll cover you
And if they get past me we got another two, yeah...

We smoke those blunts the size of bats
We got those gats as long as ax
We snatch that cheese right off the trap
We put those Beez all on your map

I shoot the fair one, I dare y'all run through New York City
Or any city or place, my face, royal taste, pace myself
Ace my health, great with wealth
Undetected like the wings of a Stealth, I move for self
Or any man, woman or child that I call fam
That's the way I am, word to Glock, my sister Pam
Son, lived through the terror of the World Trade blues
Nine o'clock news, abused the mind of many fools
Braves and jewels, made my moves, paid my dues
From the School of Intelligence, I stayed benevolent
Most high, magnify, multiply, as I add to the Kings of Kings
We never die, built my name, sustained like blood
Flow through the veins divine sign
Dine with wine forever sunshine
(RZA)
We smoke...

From the Vil to Brazil, live on your C-SPAN radio band
Explicit, dice kiss it, pour a little liquor
Golden imported from Cuba, Miss Aruba
Sexy as Asia, met her up in Mecca
Getting up in Just Cipher, hit it on the first date
Plotted my escape, twelve hours shift at the gate
How can you beat a G a week in '88?
Trips to the Pocono Lodge, the fresh Izod
Mama shouldn't work so hard to pay the landlord
A grand in your birthday card, times is hard
The gun hammer click, when the pigs blitz
We scramble like Vick, automatic six plus one to the head
Yo, the east so hot, it's red, but that's home
And my Glock still burn your skin to the bone
Sonny Corleone don't discuss it on the phone

Wanna stick her tip of her tongue through my piss hole
You play the target, and I be the guiding missile
Oh, how they long this strong grissle
Yup, see that flesh is weak
But it taste so good, they want the recipe
The king catch the queen, don't mess with me
Kssh, yo, my niggas never grow up, drink till they throw up
Some sniff that cocaine till they fucking brains blow up
Drunk from that Brass Monkey, grass junkies
Walk around with the brain of a Crash Dummie
How dare you try to come and gas crash from me
You be in the House of a 1,000 Corpse like Rob Zombie
It's I God, inside your iPod
'Cause my squad, nigga, is die hard

Who rock meaner, than the Gods from Medina
You numb skull girls, be caught and talking Tina

Bitch, suck a dick and die, forty five lit the sky
Fool, let the shit fly, split, right between your eye
Nothing like that little slit split in between her thighs
Sitting on the nine, applehead, bitch, let it ride
Hickory dickory, block, niggas is slippery
Glocks tucked down my socks, secures my victory
You like fourth period, son, you history
White girls with big ass, I check them suspiciously
Vanilla Pearline, had the saline
Stuffed inside her jeans, made the niggas day dream

Rollie Fingers in the back, son rolled the bag up
Street had the pen and the pad, he threw a tag up
Uncooked beef in the street, they tagged the rag up
Goldie got the clip from the closet and filled the gat up
Bobby sharpened the razor, oiled the bat up
Let the dogs out the basement, pulled the rap up
Somehow the Brown cats about to get clapped up
Pussy high nigga off coke tried to act up
Against the world's greatest mind, Bob Digital
Might throw a Shaolin Hand-block or a fifty-two
My young son Big Un don't fuck with Patty Cake
Bound to walk through the woods barefoot, choke a rattlesnake
While his brother Mel ???, dissect it
Up in the project life, the street's be hectic
The gun burst, son shot his tongue first
Should've shot his tongue first, should've shot the gun first
Now chew on the Sunburst, bitch, it's Bobby's day
Lyrics for the out, click click, like shotti's spray
Tear through flesh/bone, get lodged up in your ass cheek
'Cause you came talkin' that same bullshit last week
Fuckin' cokehead nigga, what? Your brain numb?
I used to wonder where these pussy-clats came from
Up in the thirty-six cell block I Shadowbox
Ship on weed grass and build up like a male ox

Rollin' in the cutty about five niggas deep
One SK, two Tec-9's and two sticks
Ready to trip on these fools around my way poppin' shit
Like the Black Knights don't air them things out
Knuckle up in the spot till someone get drops
Stomped, get passed out
Passed out off a pint of that pah, ready to mic brawl
Clean sweep, took the first pitch, knocked the homerun
Black Knights known to grab mics, leave the spots full blown
You know motto, the +Knights or Nuttin'+, so stop frontin'
Like you ain't heard this high pitch through your twelve-inch
Don't care which Alpines, I keep those six-by-nines thumpin'
+Jumpin' Jumpin'+ like Destiny, I laced it with the Rugged recipe
You know my technique on a Ra' beat
Speak the Digi slurred speech but aggressive with the mic
On mine, it's strictly Black Knights
Steal the spotlight, show niggas how to rock mics
The right way, spit like a K, M-o-n-k
The conqueror, smash your sponsor
Learn the lesson from the Black Knight lethal +Silent Weapon+

Slipped through these metal detectors with plastic German luggers

Deadly dialect, Digitech, I'm six steps ahead
Spread like plague, plus I wire tapped the feds

Turnin' corner after corner, with my Southern Cal folk
But the underground in the city life, it ain't a playground
I'm loyal, dedicated, always ready to throw down
My morals and my values, reach high up on the Richter
Speak this vivid so you clearly get the picture
And description of a real one, standin? in your mist
I don't just talk, I walk this Killa Cal shit
Footprints of a legend as a I paint the concrete
King of the jungle, still no one can compete

We can bust a shot or we can bust a verse or two

Word's on the street Dunn Dunn Bobby's goin' Digital
Hoverin the city inside the Wonder Woman's invisible jet
Clouded by the Meth we move undetected
In secret society sects, NARC's radar
Suspected us to be a cumulus cloud, ejectin lightning
Strikin like a wild knuckle fight, in New Brighton
A million strands of spider webs weaved to make my vest
The energy compacted deep within, my inner chest
One touch of my eagle claw clutch, rips your guts
Brass head kill you fast with a rapid, head bust
Ninjas spyin, the ammo flyin, the steel iron
Blow a nigga neck from his head, like dandelions
My team is a magazine of M-16's
But we calmly, defeat your army, by blowin' steam
Noisy as a thousand barkin dogs, rap's sweat hogs
Welcome back to the catalogue, hip-hop cyborg
Bobby Digital, keyboard clogged bitch you analog
We blowin' smoke creatin' Scooby Doo fogs
Escape cell block eight's my tape on the rocks

You feel the flurry huh, don't worry yo
You get cut by the razor, yo, yo, yo yo

Carry large black guns in small school bags

Laid back like a fat Huffy bike, on the kickstands

Dear momma, no need for the head drama
I quit slinging that yac', don't need the feds on us
I made a mil' off the deal, legit
And after I pay the tax, I'ma buy us a crib
In the winter, I'ma buy us a whip
So we can take long trips, just me and the kids
I'm up again, I never let you down
Nothings ever gonna stop me now
I'm up from the gwop, don't gotta hide from the cops
Plus homies got a spot, they can stay off the block
They can drop a few tracks or spar a few minds
The God, home from the pen, he left the yard behind
Got a brand new sampler, take the breaks and I loop it
Got a license for the gat in case the public is stupid
Plus I ain't afraid to shoot it
A man with the family is firmly rooted
We on top right now, we living
Ain't nobody saying it, can't nobody fade us
Oh and look at this luxury, sweet in here
We did it, we ain't gotta worry 'bout nothing no more
We on top right now, we living
Ain't nobody saying it, can't nobody fade us
I always knew you was gonna make it
You was a dreamer from day one
What shall I speak, about the brothers that passed?
Make me weak about the knees, make me wanna bust ass
Or should I kick knowledge and I ain't even graduate
But take it from me, it ain't cool to skip class, imagine it
Five Gods, came to picture perfect to ovulate to it
Music and expression of freedom, escape to it
Not much to it, we was born and conceived to it
And me being the man that I am, it's like we knew it
Surrounded by a civilized man, a weak woman
Subconsciously be planting a fed inside children
Allow me to explain my cause
Who I B E R E, Double T A, N I N E

Searching for the truth in myself, I seen, I saw
In order to achieve it all, must give my all

Look at how you killing 'em right now
Why don't you go get you a massage or something, daddy
Ain't gotta worry 'bout none of that
Matter fact pass me the oil
I got you all day, you know you did your thing
Just sit back and relax

Where the winter time temperature be twenty below
Knee deep in the snow the Reverend still get dough
To pay the bills, feed his family and go get more
Money, now we taking trips to Jamaica just to relax
My homies came a long way since paper from g-packs
But gone, they used to be pushing BP's and Zenax
Now, they wire us our paper back and forth like we fax
We ask the lord and savior for guidance
It's probably hard to hear us over gunshots and violence
Figure when I'm in the casket it'll be plenty silence
So in the end when you add it up it all balance
The crew been up, staying higher than pallets
On vacations in the islands, watching women with talents
Fellowship and with the family members who be the wildest
Now we live in mansions, castles and golden palaces
Enjoy everything that you put your hard work into
Look at the gold on the lamp, baby
Look at the size of this TV
Look at everything
Just take up all the beauty in this room right now
Look at how you did your thing, you did it

67,You Can't Stop Me Now,2008,Digi Snacks (2008),Hip Hop,RZA,"Round up, round up, round up, round up
Round up, round up, round up, round up
Round up, round up, round up, round up
Round up, round up
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
The greatest B-Boy of all time, started from small crimes
While others had big tops I was slingin' small dimes
Tryin' to make the come up, the blow used to numb up
A few G's a week, my clique used to sum up
Till my brother got locked up, my girl got knocked up
My closest homies each, got popped up and shot up
And cops flood the block, no way to eat
So I dropped a half a G
On a rented SP-1200 Sampler and a Yamaha Four-Track
The bass from the lab used to blow the fuckin' door back
While Ghost was doin' stick-ups, tryin' to make a vic' up
Waitin' outside for the Brinks truck to pick up
Nothing would work, so we're back to choppin' nicks up
Givin' grown ass women two vials for a dick suck
When I was stressed I would head to the rest
Then the pads on the SP-12 got pressed
Makin' beats for the streets, so the family could eat
In '93, Wu-Tang Clan dropped their first LP
We went platinum, whoo-peesh, yeah, we flatten 'em
Pockets got fat and um, went and got Cap and 'em
Staten's on the map and um, Brooklyn Zu is bombin' 'em
All around the world, Killa Beez start swarmin' 'em
You can't stop us, you can't block us, rock us or mock us
Knock us or top us, better sit back and watch us
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Can't stop me, man
No matter how hard, you better go hard
So hard, if you gon' try and stop me now
I be ruckus to rhythm like the blocks be wild
Bad enough I got the cops tryin' to lock me down
Can't nobody break my stride or shake my pride
Without a homicide, case and trial
It's a long time comin', long nines bustin'
Cradle to the grave I be on my grind hustlin'
Sometimes when I think about it, have my mind buggin'
The shit that I been through, things that I've seen
The chicks that I ran through, places that I've been
I'm a victim of the very song I sing
That's how it is in the heart of it, most want no part of it
Some will soothe the pain through booze and narcotics
I'ma hold my head, stay true to where my heart is
Either you pay with your life or you pay dues and homage
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now"
68,You'll Never Know,2003,Birth of a Prince (2003),Hip Hop,RZA,"(Feat. Cilvaringz)
(Intro: RZA)
One-two, one-two
Mic check, one-two, one-two (You don't know, that I really love you)
Yo, yo, You'll Never Know
Check me out (You don't know, that I really love you)
Yo, yo, yo
(RZA)
I love you like how birds love rose petals, Killarmy love full metal
I love you like how the Park Hill cats love to pull metal
The heat will make ya head whistle loud like a full kettle
I come like the Mecca in civilizin
The hallway jackal, Chicago Bull bandana
I keep police scanners from fishes
They try to slash me out like Douton Hanna
And blow my spot, yo, I'm not the polka-dot
I tote weight, sip Scotch, bust shots, smoke a lot
My cousin Billy, he done it silly, used to joke a lot
Chased bitches, cut class, got high and stayed broke a lot
So when the rent was due he would grab the identical
Twin gats and put a fuckin' hole in your right ventricle
Not sober yet no potent threat, yo, I hold a Tec
Show this jet pack on my back, blast like no respect
While you bickerin, this flame is still flickerin
Then the magnetic attraction to my wisdom keeps you listenin
(Interlude: Cilvaringz)
Yo, yo
Choco bang that shit!
Yeah, yeah (You don't know, that I really love you)
Killa Beez, European
Yo, yo, shut up!
(Cilvaringz)
Eh-yo, my sword so sharp I split the tweeters in ya Genelacs
European Killa Beez attack, chk-chk-chk
I never smoke blunts, tote weight, nor bust shots
But fuck with me I guarantee you'll get ya neck chopped
Be the haunting, dauntin, brothers won't fuck
With The Wu-Tang swordsman, slowly get dropped
When my Shaolin sword, swing at Nasty Immigrants with passports
To teach Man, Woman and Child, with the sword style
God, complete the presence
It only takes seconds to chop a nigga head on RZA records
But you a worthless effort, follow faster then leopards
I can't wait to return to the fuckin' essence
Of hip-hop, yo, my shit chop constantly
It's over when my shit drops, son, honestly
I love the RZA and the whole Wu Academy
For givin' me a chance to be what I wanna be (What?)
But You will Never Know how much...
(RZA)
Do you think this cocked mic will jam or choke?
Come on my nigga... Listen yo...
Do you think this black mic will cock back, jam or choke?
I should stick a long silver hook down your throat
And snatch out your vocal, bitch my eyes is black opal
Reflectin this 2.2 kilogram Mac that smoke you
Firin lightnin, Northern Lights, duck tight and chocolate Philly
Lyrics pierce through the ear like the spear of Achilles
Iron body Bobby Digital suit, don't bother to shoot
Quicker than Clint when I draw the six shoo'
Mortal Kombat whether it's the blind or the mute
Cripple a idiot, dunn, it sounds ridiculous
Rapid flow got you petro, my voice echo, echoes
Off the Wall Street money we stack like golden geckos
Gecko, gecko, let go my Eggo or feel my Eagle
4,5,6 in my hand, I've rolled the c-lo
Brother knocked the long pound, ounces or straight kilos
You know how we go, it's the Killa Bee show
Then I love you like how the pharoah loves Joseph
The jewelry of Moses, like a man bendin down on one knee before he proposes
The special 8, laid the hammer, about to slay Isaac
And the paitence of Daniel in the lion's den with closed eye lids
You'll Never Know, You'll Never Know...
Yo, yo... here... (You don't know, that I really love you)"
