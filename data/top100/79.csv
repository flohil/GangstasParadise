0,A Kiss,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,"I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
(No you don't, not from me, not on the lips, are you crazy?
Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me)
(Verse 1: Royce)
Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefing, first rapper that I shot a fan
Gucci's my absolute state of mind, like Waka's man
Chopper's brand, getting head in the car park, new Gallardo
This bitch sucking my dick today, call it yesterday's news tomorrow
Stretch a nigga out, I'm the new Tae-bo 'bout to cross over, I'm the new Ivo
'Bout to saves a couple of these bitches, that's right, I'm the new Bible
You? You five-O, me? I'm all grounded to punishments
But I'm too fly though, y'all niggas be winin', I should call you Moscato
(Eminem)
Look down at the floorboard
It looks like someone left a pair of stiletto shoes in my Tahoe
Never know what type of a ho inside of my ride I may let
Last night at the 5 a.m., and she ain't even recover from last Friday yet
Hoes all over the ride like it's an ice cream truck, I can see why they fret
I already ran over two hoes and I ain't get up the fucking drive way yet
Soon as I open the door, you try to resist, what for? Get in girl, don't push
Shorty your, fightin' an unwinnable war, it's useless as, tits on a boy, little tits on a whore
Got a mack and it's screaming like little kids throwing fits on the floor
Get in the whip but you ain't turning, a frog into a prince, what you tryna keep your hands on me for?
(Verse 2: Eminem)
Now you in my whip just long as you understand that I can't be whipped
You say companionship, I say abandon ship, I'm a gigolo so you know
I'm always on the go, I ain't got no time to slow down for no relationshit
Drop the P and add a T, yeah, you can get mad at me all you want
But I'm ghost before you can even say boo, hun let alone call me one
A one night stand is all he wants but a female fan, yeah, one like Stan
So by the one nightstand this bedroom has two lamps and only one nightstand
Get the hint? Ooh yeah boo, ew! I ain't gonna argue but why do you think
They call it boo? Yeah, cause the sound of it's 'posed to scare you
(Royce)
Oh ho, we can share you in the back of the McLaren
I don't give a fuck what your name is, we gon' call you Hi and Bye
Hope you bi in the mean time your name is Sharon
Slow the flow down so I can what? Tell you same face
I make when I'm shooting the gun's the same face that I make when I fuck
From the back of my hand on your neck pressing your face against the sheets it's insane
You been changed, 'cause I'm outta this world girl I got that Milky Way dick vein
I'm at an all-time high with highness, I'm at an all-time fly with flyness
And this is exactly what they say when they bow to your highness, yeah
(Verse 3: Royce)
Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefing, first rapper that shot a fan
(Push a chick out the car while it's moving like Waka's man)
Her bottom's dark, but her top is tan, her private parts
Got her on the pole like the opposite of her papa's plan
(Come on stripper, let's hit the strip 180 throw it in reverse
And drop the trance! I'm in the trance, now look at this bitch dance)
Looking at this tramp, like what you wearing girl, quit playing
(Yeah bitch and them scrach and sniff pants? Well let me scratch 'em)
Let me sniff, yeah What? Did I say that?
I'm on lean like styrofoam cups and kickstands
(Eminem)
Middle finger stuck on fuck, stiff pants
But girl you got a butt like no if ands
So can with the hell, maybe, oh hell, Shady, he'll tell it like it is
So tell Katie Perry he's on the tail, he's tailgating still bating
These bells are my maiden call and I'm here, bell's raiding and tell Lady
Gaga, she can quit her job at the post office, she's still a male lady
Wouldn't fuck her with her dick you heard, the verdict
Seein' he's allergic to divas, and take meat cleavers to 'em
Him don't give a damn about beaver do him?
What a demon, a behemoth, evil just seems to be seething through him
(Royce)
I like the little strip tease you doing this evening, you and me gon' find
Three more chickadees and have a menage like Nicki
You hot like a Dickie outfit in Texas without shit under it, sweating
Suck my dick, both gets to steppin to my logic
(Eminem)
My patrick, my dick is hard, thick as a yardstick
What we gonna do? Ride around till we're carsick
Then I'm gonna put this shit in park like dog shit
And you can blow me in the dark in the parking lot
Out of the trailer park by the garbage
What you waiting on? Me to roll up the carpet?
The condoms are in the glove compartment, let's start it
Think I'm joking? What, am I sitting here
Tryna make fake farts with my armpits?
Tryna get you to spit pot through your nose?
Am I here to amuse you? Stop it
(Royce)
I'm in your pocket outside of a church
The other hand is at the bottom of your purse
You giving me head in a boxing stance
My dick's so big you could drop it in dirt
I'm not your man, we're sparring partners
There's five things you are in charge of, that's
Sucking a dick, sucking a dick, sucking a dick
Sucking a dick, sucking a dick
(Eminem)
If you ain't sucking a dick, why you sitting there
With puckered lips? Oh that's collagen, mothafucking bitch
What you mean how'd you, get suckered into this
You gon' jump into my truck and then try to get truculent?
(You should be suffering, you should be cooking
You should be buckling your seatbelt with oven mitts)
Excuse me while I'm making an ass of myself
But it's only 'cause I just wanna get"
1,Above the Law,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,"The poor stays poor
The rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate...
(Get outta here!)
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I've gone through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it
Tear-able, but not rip-able, invincible, I hung invisible
Fuckin' mistletoe all over the world, I stuck my ass up under it
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it ho
Here we go, Bad and Evil so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches this is no, joke
Goin' overboard like someone threw us off the boat, choke
Cough from all the smoke, I'm tryna stay on fire
So you know if I hate fucking water sprinklers, I don't love the hoes
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff his face
Back in that bitch, smother that little motherfucker till it suffocates
You had long enough of a wait
Why are they tryin' to be so secretive when Bad and Evil has reunited, hey?
Came back to annihilate to the game's in dire straights as I await
World is Satan as I drop fall to my knees before this Ouija board
And I pray now I lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I'm sleepin' now, imagine if I awake
I'm champ bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy, never mushy, so you can't squish
Nowhere near a toosh, in fact if I jump out a bush
In a sneak attack's the only way I say I am-Bush
Outlandish, these words are weapons that are brandish, standoffish
To hoes, keep your hands off this
Can't top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for?
Law? Fuck protocol, and holla, but now my throat is sore
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I've gone through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it
Baby I'm lawless, you couldn't burn me if you threw acid on me
I met your homie, I'm at your home ready to spray you while you nappin' homie
Have everything on and around your mattress lookin' like the word in front of a matrimony
You high, thug yeah go 'head jump, no matter how high you get
You gon' come up short like Spud Webb
My DUI's get waved by saying bye
Still ridin' with no L's like James Todd
Can't change I thank God for my safe thinking
Last time I was safe thinking, me and my niggas was doin' a bank job
I stay violent, y'all go to the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye, I'll knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit I'm just nice with mine
And this just wrap 'em, I'm like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These weak rappers wanna set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em left to right, head or gut
What y'all messin' with is a nigga that'll leave you foobar
Fucked up beyond all recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite
I could just throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it
Partner, you're not hard, I body your hot bars
Beef is left you pray, right like Allahu Akbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot, you ain't gon' be on your Metro
In a bad area that call dropped
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I've gone through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it"
2,Echo,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,"(Hook: Liz Rodriguez)
All, around, the world, there's an echo
As, he takes, a bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
(I can hear them calling, calling, calling)
(Eminem)
I eat rappers, with the rhyme, consume them
The only fucking thing that you consume is time, I'm super human
My world is like a Rubik's Cube, it's too complex girl
You assuming, cupids looming, my mentality as caveman stupid woman
My life is Truman show, all I have is music, ho
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago, so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
But you better put a fork in it if you think I'mma lay here just spooning, yo
Oh, you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful!
Diabolical to my last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rotten to the core, to the bunghole all the way down to my sole, from my hair to my toe
Ever since I was 13 I learned how to sew and sewed shut my whole bootyhole
'Cause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire!
And this time I don't mean I'mma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
Cause this time when I fuck this world I'mma put my whole goddamn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that ho yet, I'mma go get Nickel and try to rip it wider
(Royce)
Classical palms, battle my own demons, I need a glass of Patron
Bad as I need a horn stabbing my clavicle bone, I'm at it or prone
First time I seen a desert eagle I was letting the 44 buss
The 44 popped, the first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
Looking at Robocop, I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm Sustain
In order to clean my veins you need saline
I'm never referring to the solution, I'm talking about more like the mustang
Vroom! Get respect from the get-go, hello! Step to the echo, echo, echo
Pen got a mind of its own, got to write my rhymes with a timer
Otherwise I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
As the echo follows the Maserati, as the petrol swallows
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton, check your bible inside it
It'll say this guy's an elephant, I'm fly like I'm killing the scene like
I'm a villain with wings, I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep
Right now I'm living a dream, though we may be reckless
The ladies check us, they whisper Shady Records, baby echo!"
3,Fast Lane,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,":
(Uh)
First verse, uh, I'm on till I'm on a island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him wit' his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin', bet you could light your own cigarette wit' ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past so that basically resurrected my cash flow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke, though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s
My '90s was like the Navy
You was like the Bradys
You still fly kites daily
:
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' ""Ice, Ice Baby,"" screamin' Shady till I die
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy so I live it to the fullest till I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now b'fore I get on a roll (
)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin', try them trailer parks
Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back wit' a capital B wit' an exclamation mark, maybe
You should listen when I flip the linguistics, 'cause I'm 'onna rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball I'ma kick the ballistics
So get this dick, I'ma live this
:
Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll till I drop and ride till I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (
)
Livin' life in the fast lane (
)
:
My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war wit' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says ""I'll let you take me
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpe's of Jack Kevorkian""
Go back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down, my tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers
Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity
:
Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up (Pt!) and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get get down
He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit-fit now
Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I st-st-stutter, motherfucker, fuck the mall, he's just
A whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight wit' 5'9"" to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown, shawty when you dance you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it
:
And then after takin' that, I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gonna say ""The whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator to Michael Jackson' activator (Woo)
Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data
Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Homey, this sick, you can normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent)
:
Now make that ass drop, like a sack of potatoes, what girl I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell you boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You rollin' wit' a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're livin'
:
Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll till I drop and ride till I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (
)
Living life in the fast lane (

4,I'm On Everything,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,"(Intro: Mike Epps)
All these little young kids ain't got no direction
Shit, these lil kids is on everything
(Hook: Mike Epps)
Syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka (I'm on everything)
(Verse 1: Royce)
I'm on syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Henny-Henny, sober don't interest me, I'm on everything
Bout to sip the liquor like it's 'caine, that's how high I am
(I take painkillers to ease the pain, though I ain't in pain
No, we, ain't the same, we drunk, I'm on everything)
'Cept when I kick it, gout, me sobering up, ha, Alf
Cash rules everything, acid tab, hash, 'rooms
I done woke up with a fucking tiger in my bathroom
I am fucking high, high, high, high
Menace to society I feel sorry for your mother
Me and Vicious on 'shrooms, call us the Mario Brothers
Back down, we never back down, never laid out, can't put my back down
(Verse 2: Eminem)
Painkillers, I call 'em 'caine pillars
'Cause they'll hold me up when I take 'em
I need a cane and pillows, I'm on everything
Sick when I kick it, barf, me sobering up, fart
I crush ya brain like a pill crusher, let's crush a pill yeah
Fuck, I think I just crushed my last Tylenol 3 up
Grab the key up off the counter till the camp all left the crib
Man, who'da knew that 3 in the morning I'd still be up
Could barely see up over the steering wheel, crashed the whip
Tore a tree up on my way to the dealer's, tryna re-up
Call me Brett Favre, spell it F-A-V-R-E, yep
It's wrong, other words I just fucked my RV up
Bitch, it's on again yeah, break that Klonopin in half
While I smoke some chronic in the cab with Donovan McNabb
And I dye my hair back blonde again and laugh
I'm the real macaroni you cheesy bitch, I'm demonic with the Kraft
There's a devil in my noodle, you angel hair pasta
Flows dreaded like some fucking tangled hair rastafarian, Jamaican
Relax man, I'll send a fucking axe at you if you insist on a fucking accent
Bad and Evil is back with an epidural, check ya girl
Cause after we pop you up, we popping her up
So, baby, come put ya feet up in these stirrups
Your boyfriend better find another fucking hornets nest to stir up
We rap like we're on
(Verse 3: Royce)
I'm on syrup painkillers, cigarette, speed, Henny... classic!
It's Eminem and him again, my sentiments exactly
I told that bitch to get at me, then the bitch attacked me
Kid you not, I'm lit up as fuck, tablecloth tucked in my pants then
I'm hearing dishes drop 'cause I walked away from my dinner with schmucks
(Eminem)
Then I aimed to the front of the K-Mart shopping center with a coupon book
And a hundred and ten bucks and a bunch of change
And wife beater with a mustard stain
I'll crush your brain like I'm crushing pills
What the fuck's the mothafuckin' deal?
This shit's making me feel like
I'm tryna do a mothafuckin' cartwheel up a hill
(Royce)
How many bars, how many tabs? A-C-I-D? Y-E-S
'Cause I'm sniffin NYES (F-U-C-Ked up, and it's obvious)
Smoking Henny in my chest (I'm B-A-N-A-N-A-S)
I'm a C-O-C-O-N-U-T
(Eminem)
Put this CD in and you'll see, the sequel to Scary Movie
Bad is too evil, the roofie to Roethlisberger
(You are gonna wind up six feet deep under
That shit's creek so I hope that you want preservers)
You could put a turd on the plate
Silverware on the tablecloth to serve us
You don't bring shit to the table
I mean your grill like a Seville when a mark gets murdered
You pushing the envelope and I'm shovin' that whole post office further
Right off the surface, to the serpents in the darkest and the farthest corner
(Royce)
How many bars? How many bars? Maui, wowee, sour diesel
How many jars to all my people I'll be the Mars, mommy come on
She can actually wrap my nutsack
'Round the back of her neck in a bathroom stall
And she can just puke from sipping this piss from my 24-inch catheter cord
(Eminem)
I'm the type that'll take a bath with a whore
Drown her, bang her head on the passenger door
When I'm stashin' her in the back, smacking
Her forehead on the dash and its accidentally blowin', a Benz jeep horn
(Royce)
My friends be knowin', that when I'm on a binge, I'm stingy
Even when I'm ten deep in a room with the MGM with Lindsay Lohan and she on"
5,Lighters,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,":
This one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters
:
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightning
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward, uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock, you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it 'cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz, and now you wonder
Why he does it, how he does it, wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it
Or was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, 'cause fuck, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make, what's it take, to get it through your thick skulls
If this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9"" but I feel like I'm 6'8""
:
This one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters
:
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and
Buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me ""Slow down, boy, you going to blow it""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on 
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right
Till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed, I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and autotunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston, I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a beehive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal
And now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV Awards gag
:
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine
'Cause this one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters"
6,Living Proof,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,"(Intro: Royce da 5'9"")
Yeah, Bad and Evil is (back)
(Don't stop)
(Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"")
We bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
This is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
'01's the year where I fell from blundering
Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it
Now I'm freefallin', my career is gone into re-callin'
Regardless of who's fault I was speedballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Marshall doubled back and got me from on top of the Hearse
I'm alive nigga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I done cried Mary J. Blige rivers
I realised that God's with us as soon as I decided
To put that bottle down and pick up my Todd Bridges
The writing's on the wall
Since niggas seen me at the baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z
Suddenly everybody calls like ""I'm just checking on you dog""
While I just throw up this message on the stall...
(Hook: Royce da 5'9"")
When them bottles stop poppin' and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop
I'm living proof nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I'm living proof nigga
(Verse 2: Eminem)
Your body language is sayin' your confidence is gone
Well pick ya ass up lil homie, come on
You just gone sit there and take it or make 'em suck it
Tell 'em where to shove it straight up
You gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it
The last time that life kicked me in the ass
I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass
Man what a catastrophe it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop ass, did ya piss ants whoop me
Will be the day I say I ate poop, shit, the day that
I don't straight shoot, I'll drop outta my anti-women hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back
And put it on straight loop, you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
You see me climbing back on that wagon got my swagger back
I was dragging, hop back on it, grab the reigns on that bastard
And came back on 'em without remorse man
Man of course I'm a one trick pony
'Cause I'll be screaming on these whores till I'm hoarse!
(Veres 3: Royce Da 5' 9"")
Nah I ain't fading yet, I'd rather stay and rep, I mighta made a dent
But I find excitement in wondering what I'ma write next
So I don't stay in debt me broke, you might as well cut the embryo
Out my momma and play catch
With the baby with AKs with baby bayonets
I'ma get rich or I'mma die trying
That's why its either kill or be killed, so call me suicide homocide Ryan
(Verse 4: Eminem)
There's a bomb inside my head, I'm a live wire
I am on the edge, teetering on it like I tore the iron mic
Get on a nut like a tyre iron, I have no desire stopping
So why would I drop and roll, that's how much on fire I am
Rappers are fun and I'm the time 'cause I'm just flying by 'em
Man I'm laughing at 'em the entire time, why am I up?
Cause tribulations I have triumphed bitch I'm fired up
So it's time for me to slit your fucking lighter, light the sky up"
7,Loud Noises,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,"(Intro: Brick Tamland)
Loud noises!
(Verse 1: Eminem)
Life handed me lemons, I jump back into the public eye
And squirted lemon juice in it by now you just wish I'd fucking die
But I electrify, get electrocuted, executed by an executioner
Of my flow too quick for the human eye to detect zooming by
Guess who, what's happening guys? They told me to shit
I fell off that pot hoped right back up on that crapper and I
Said fuck you with a capital I, look who's back to antagonize
You don't like it? You can eat shit, fuck off little faggot and die
You right back like a maggot on my dick grabbing at my shit better get to the back
Of the line, нou wanna get your shot at me what kinda crap is that battle
What kind of rapper would I be before I let another rapper think he's hot
I'll bury my face in his stinky twat and go...
Go 'head, space is limited, ain't even room in the back of my mind
That's why I ain't thinking about you, I don't got time and I told you a thousand times
So how can I find the time to put an alkaline battery in Royce's back
And at the same time put juice in mine? Goddammit Slaughterhouse is signed
(Voice)
Slaughterhouse!
(Verse 2: Crooked I)
I'm a menace villain, my pen is sitting spilling, my livers killing
Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceiling
The niggas willing to give the listeners the sickest feeling
Like mixing some Benadryl and penicillin then I'm filling the clip
With a written, can you picture my pistol drilling?
A million women and children when I'm illing but it isn't real, it's a rap
On the real, it's a wrap, how could you possibly stop the Apocalypse
When I'm atomic bombing the populous
Shock the metropolis hostile as a kid popping the Glock at his moms
And his pops then he hops in his drop with his iPod rocking the Slaughterish
Documentation and lyrics I write with confidence
Write like a columnist slash novelist
I'm in this game to demolish, establish my dominance
Over prominent rappers you popping shit till you opposite
I can spit ominous so spit politics now I'm Haile Selassie
Gandhi and Pac of this hip hop genre, bitch
(Voice)
(Verse 3: Royce)
Lyrically I'm a cocaine Altoid
Ability to bring (?) it's a no brain bout boy
Physically I'm literally a cocaine cowboy, wait-wait
Did I just go almost four bars without talking about my big dick?
The other day me and your thick bitch had a great day and we ate cake
And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost
'Cause she couldn't handle my shit, wait I sweared, irony of Ryan
Is I am bipolar while I'm rhyming standing beside a big old white bear
Neither one of us fight fair, you are literally looking at Woody and Wesley
In a movie with a white boy ain't got to jump no where 'cause I'm here
Nigga I'm on fire yeah and I'm every bitch's dream
One, two I'm coming for you, I'm a big old nightmare
Nigga this the slaughter stepping up
I'll pretty much slap your ass and tell you to shut the fuck up
After that I'll slap your ass again and tell you to shut the fuck up shutting up
And that's how you body a fucking beat
(Voice)
(Verse 4: Joell Ortiz)
I should be the one that goes slow... nah, get a stopwatch, clock my flow
Hit the button on top, watch the jaw drop, oh-oh, that's that
Aww Yaowa, when I drop I go outta space
Blackout like Darth Vader's face, placed in a molten shower
Say something and get them proper mama poppa pouring out vodka
Mama Mia, Em pass me the seeds in this Slaughterhouse casa
Better yet boy go home, better yet boy G4 Chrome, better jet boy
Mark Sanchez, Santanio Holmes, I'm not just any old homeboy
Sitting in a lab picking up a pad
I be spitting bad, I'mma get you mad with this gift I have
Lord duck sufferin succotash when the trigger blast
I'mma put your beak on your fitted hat
Where the liquor at? Sip of yak that bitch and a vicious track (?)
Sly Pro tools to boast Joe smooth I coast to the West like we're tired of living at
New York here's a piggyback ride to the motherland, hold on brotherman, on the other hand
Get down, I'm gutter fam, gun butt you with the Eagle handle Cunningham
I don't wanna talk, I just wanna beef, I don't want a piece, I want it all baby boy
I don't wanna eat, I wanna feast up (?) rough piece of shit, you done weak, I'm the one, capiche?
(Verse 5: Joe Budden)
Insane what they call us, ain't married to the game
But you probably shouldn't have came to the altar
Every bar like propane for the sawed-off, using (?) to forge you
Eminent Mr. Porter, slaughter my sentiments imminent torture
All of you feminine marauders, that's women at war
Men will assault ya, Tommy's and bats that resemble Lasorda
Kidnap your trembling daughter, at least a quarter
I'm administering supporters, got an aura more like Sodom and Gomorrah
Normally something's wrong with me
Claiming a quantity of the porn I see on the pause to me
When I fix the game they'll think shit came with a warranty
How the fuck are they gonna stop what I was born to be, corner me, shit belong to me
Two choices, you can get along with me or sit your faggot ass right there in dormancy
Wait, all you missing is heels to be RuPaul
Ain't nobody that's real ever knew y'all
Second to none and I'm dealing with Marshall
This time I never come down, deal with the blue balls
You ain't gotta fear me but you'll respect me
Niggas who never met me threaten me, want to gillete me
Why don't you let me come (?) I got some machetes
Swinging spaghetti like it's heavy some said he deserve an ESPY
In a Chevy like Andretti, put the Dezzy where his chest be
(Voice)"
8,Take from Me,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,"You're going to be okay kid, you're going to be okay
(Intro: Claret Jai)
Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me
(Verse 1: Royce)
Always been the type of dude that'll feed my clique, I know that without the fans
I ain't shit but y'all better read my lips, I don't spit raps this ill
For you to just hack and steal and leak my shit, so peep my drift
I hope y'all don't think you're helping me out with that shit that shit stressin' me out
Nickel nine is blowin' up, Christmas time, you should hang my album
On top of your fireplace cause around that time, my stockin's goin' up
Feels like a victory, bittersweet, cause the bigger I get? The bigger the wedge
Between the relationship of me and my bigger bro, hear what I said?
Feels like the shit just switched on me, everything I do for the nigga, and the nigga know
I would do anything for him, but the nigga refuse to just quit straight shittin' on me
Keepin' your distance? Probably best if you don't wanna fuck with me
But you know me probably best, fuck pity You want that? You know it's Laila Alis' chest
Tough titty, the problems, you got a problem, you think I'm already set
So I'mma look down on you? Just be proud of me, you already got my respect
I ain't gonna say something I regret so I'mma just stop, chasing the pain
Let you deal with the fact we don't get along 'cause I got a big face in the game
Sometimes I feel like fuck my life, I fuck with a few niggas that I know that
If my chick was a Shady ho? Niggas wouldn't think twice 'fore they fuck my wife
Guess that's the difference in friends and associates, I done been broke
I done been through the motions, I don't pay no attention to birds, I use my scope and I tend to the vultures
No one ever blows up your phone just to talk, I don't make money just to loan it to y'all
Tell a nigga that and you wildin' it's dialin' 'em and then talking to a hole in the wall
Please look at these expenses, these niggas expensive, if I gotta lend you money every time
I see you just to be your friend bitch, I don't really need your friendship
(Hook: Claret Jai)
Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me
I give and I give and you take and you take
And you just walk away without nothing to say
You just take from me... ay ay
You just take from me... ay ay
(Verse 2: Eminem)
I live in a bubble, I struggle with the fame
Trouble is the pain grows double, give a fuck what you say
When my music you take so subtle, just to give it away
To people who don't even appreciate flows, mothafucka I'm livid today
'Cause I break my back to give you my art
You steal my thoughts, it's like driving a spike through my heart
You might not think it's a big deal to steal from me but music is all I got
Aside from my daughters, not to sound like a martyr
But it's getting harder than I thought to not just go crazy
Trapped in this house, I'm about to just snap
Am I not deserving of what I got, did I not work for it?
Put it all in every record I record, well then please tell me why on this Earth
Lord does it keep happening, I keep rapping
But I wonder sometimes is it worth all the bullshit
Cause it feels like a down there ain't no gettin' up from
But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb I'm anything but bum so fuck 'em
They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they say it was ill, right?
The way I kill mics? But the way I feel right now?
It just feels like I'm so done with this shit, I may as well wipe
I have nothing else to give you, nothing left to contribute
Farewell I bid you, but before I go, my last gift to you
Ladies and gentleman, Slaughterhouse I give you!"
9,The Reunion,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,"(Eminem)
Ayo, this next song is a true story (Come here, bitch)
Cause some things in this universe
Don't make sense but somehow (Always seem to fucking work)
(Verse 1: Eminem)
Driving down I-75 about to hop on 696
I look over this fucking chick's trying to fix her makeup
I'm like bitch, you ain't a plastic surgeon
I advise ya to put up your visor, I'm getting kinda ticked
You're blocking my side mirror, she's like yeah, so? I'm like so?
You gonna need a stitch you keep acting like that, ho
I look like your husband slut? That's a rhetorical question
You talk to me like you talk to him, I'll fuck you up
In fact, get in the backseat, like the rest of my dates
No bitch rides shotgun, what taxi?
Stop and pick you some Maxi Pads up is that what you actually ask me?
Bitch reaches over and smacks me
And says I annoy the fuck outta her, get in the fucking back
Put on your slut powder, you slut, what? Shut the fuck up now
Or get your feelings hurt, worse than my last chick when
I accidentally butt dialed her
She heard me spreading AIDS rumors about her
Turn the radio up louder, make it thump
While I bump that Relapse CD, trying to hit every bump in that cunt
Thought I snap back in that accent 'cause she kept asking me
To quit calling her cunt, I said I cunt, she said, Marshall
(Hook: Eminem)
You ain't really like that, oh
You're putting on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breaking my heart
She said you're breaking my heart
(Verse 2: Royce)
Uh, pull up to the club in a Porsche, not a Pinto
While Marshall's at a white trash party, I'm at drama central
I walk up in there looking at my phone, on Twitter tweeting
I'm feeling a bunch of bitches looking at a nigga, cheesing
I get approached by this little skeeser
She asked me am I the realest G, 'cause I'm Gucci from head to feet
I said, yeah, I'm really is 'cause I spit in your man's face
Like Cam did that kid on Killa Season
She said I'm feeling your big ego, wait, am I talking wrong?
I said nah, I'm a walking Kanye/Beyonce song
She said I'm mad at you, I said why?
She said why you never make songs for chicks as if it's hard to do?
I said I make songs for me, leave the studio
And go and fuck the bitch who belong to who making songs for you
She said I'm feeling your whole swagger and flow, can we hook up?
I said, umm, you just used the word swagger, so no, she said
(Verse 3: Eminem)
We been riding around in this hatchback until I'm fucking hunchback
Where the fuck's this party at slutbag cunt? Cut what act?
Think it's an act? Fuck that, I'm trying to shag scuz
Better find this love shack or somewhere to fuck at, ah, don't touch that
You fat dyke, I'm trying to hear some Bagpipes from Baghdad
Don't act like you don't like them, them accents, I rap tight
And I'm a torture until we find this place, yeah that's right
Thought it was just past this light, past Van Dyke
Better hit that map right, read them directions, oh yeah
You can't read and you can't write, told me that last night
She took my CD out the deck, snapped in half like
Relapse sucked, I snapped, hit the gas like
Blew through the light, spun out, hit a patch of black ice
Forgot we had a trailer hitch to the back, we jackknifed
Bitch flew out of the car, I laughed like, she deserved it
She didn't think I'd act like that in person
(Royce, Marshall just crashed right in front of the club)
(Verse 4: Royce)
Tell him I'll be there in a minute
I'm trying to break up this cat fight between my mistress and damn wife
Then a chick wanted a hug, she was fat
So I gave her dap, then I tell her to scat, I'm not mean, I'm cute
On my way to the front door, taking the scenic route
To avoid this chick with a lace front looking like Venus's and Serena's hooves
I'm just saying, those chicks got horse asses, they been attractive
Hope when they see me they don't slap me with they tennis rackets
My mind drifted back to this shit
I seen my wife push her down, step over her body, then smack the mistress
Police outside, I turn and pass the gat to Vishis
Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin
He mugs the mistress, turns around and gives the misses hugs and kisses
Looks at me twisted, like Nickel ""Yeah, watch this shit""
He smacks the dentures out of the mouth of the fat bitch he rode with
Looks back to mention, ""Royce, it's good to be back to business"""
10,Welcome 2 Hell,2011,Hell: The Sequel (2011),,Bad Meets Evil,"Yeah, told you we'd be back
Welcome 2 Hell
(Eminem)
There's a switch, I flip, emotions cut off
So cold I done froze my butt off
And this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet
It's like squirting a squirt gun in the ocean, fuck off
Other words I didn't put a dent in the game compared
To the damage I've yet to do
Long as you still have feelings to hurt
I'll be around as long as you let me get to you
Long as I got two balls to palm
I'll be the bomb, you're just a false alarm
Get scared little pissants
And see if I don't come along and stomp your farm
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail
Sleet with a tornado's the kind of brainstorm I get
So when the wind starts blowing, shit
Talking about going in? Going insane is more like it
Wizard of words when he spits hazardous with it
Like a disastrous blizzard
So you better listen quick fast don't miss it
Yeah, go ahead little prick bastard, diss it
But when you get hit with a sick ass explicit flow
Don't ask how much of his passion is it that goes in it
Just know, that all he knows is this
It's better to kick ass than kiss it
Dick dastardly of audacity
Mental capacity, unmatched it has to be stopped
But it can't be, but man I can't just keep
Doing them like that or no one will rap with me
Except one, you asked who is it?
(Royce)
Guess who just came through the blast, you bitches
With the ratchet, the book of Matthew
A book of matches, lighting them under white linen
You about to have to admit it, they pass you the mic
Asked you to spit it, you got handed your own ass
Your ass in your own hands, I'm sure they gon' laugh
When you're going to the bathroom with it
Now with what would you come against us
Better be something with a big foot pedigree
Easily these are the reasons
That we need to be in your prayers
Each region breeds some MCs that wanna be
Which means they wanna breath our air
With these ideas, anybody thinkin'
That the game don't need, the Bad and the Evil regime
That's like saying that bad boy Piston team didn't need Isaiah
(Eminem)
Sip piss and bleed, this is a different breed of MCs
I swear, better be aware, there's too much at stake
And to find someone this raw on a beat is rare
You can kiss my ass and the shit stains on my underwear that I don't even wear
(Royce)
This gotta be no fair
This like hittin' the lottery, oh yeah
Who you know hotter there gotta be no pair
Shotty that I got a lobotomy, your hair
Classic, smack it, smother it, read it and weep it
And perhaps you'll have no rebuttalin'
In fact, you seein' me in this rap
And it's like saying Tila Tequila can sing like Jasmin Sullivan
(Eminem)
Back to bash her skull again
Push a bitch out the Aspen until I get the fuck out of Dodge (Dodge Aspen)
Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors
You has-beens are duller than color books that ain't colored in
Second and third, fourth wind, gotta another win
Here they come again, none other than, Bad and Evil
Also known as Saddam and Osama Bin
It's been a long time
But I bet neither one of us have felt sicker than we do right now
And we only get iller with time
Me and Nickel fucking shit up on the dime so tellin' us to pipe down
It's like talking to a meth head
Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection
Fighting it while he's watching internet porn
About to meet his death with an erection
My God, what I mean is
David Carradine jacking his penis in front of his tripod
Choking his own neck, what part you don't get?
I'm saying I die hard
(Royce)
When you listen to my bars, nothin' but the F-I-R (E)
Comin' out your iPod (we) come up in a place
Chicks heads start spinning like motherfuckin' white walls
(Eminem)
Got your mother suckin' my balls
(While we) fuck each other (we) punch each other in the eyeballs
And I never say I'm sor (ry, the Five-Nine and the) Fire Marshall
(We) spit with an intensity to shut shit down (in the industry
Two different entities, with a propensity
To put these N-U-T-S up inside of your fucking mouth
Welcome to the CD"
