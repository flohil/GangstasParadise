If I ain't rockin' emeralds and Bentleys, I'm coolin' in Poughkeepsie Me, shorty, new Glock 40, and some bent weed
Ridin' the married boots, take care of me, sincerely
I'm Israeli, machettes is cris, swish some Baileys
Snuggled up, mink on, call it a cover up
Just like two murders in the hood, I'mma double up
The rap surgeon fix the game up, crack merchant
Everything I sell is well, my shit is that worthy
GATs that come up out the ceiling with the beam on it
Chinese Queen, Parasuco jeans on her
Rock long jeans, known for throwing blings on her
I stay king, by any means scream on it nigga
Come on, let's go nigga
Word up, close the door to the Aston nigga
Yo, get out the, take that shit out the ash tray man
(Snoop Dogg)
Do you remember a real gang member?
Choppin' till he timber, December to December
Never stoppin', too busy poppin' off lead in the heat
Clownin' ass all around him, they crown him the Dogg Father
Glock hot, crock pot on the block with a chef
Out of bounds on the grounds with a hole in your chest
Invest in back in feedback, gorilla the west
Take a whiff of me, spliff, till it fill up my chest
Convertible with the Cadillac, mackin' the mack
With some Roscoe's Chicken in my lap, imagine that
I'm groovin' down Sunset Boulevard
No harm, no foul, no body guard
Yo, stop right there man
You don't know what you're doin' man
Chill, chill, let them handle that man for real
(Raekwon)
Chill yo, the movie is scary
Take off the sheep skin shotty
Nigga make a move, and don't dare me
I'm blessed with these million dollar hands, I'm like poker
Niggas screw they motherfuckin' face, so what?
Guns are collected, flips perfected
Boats flying in, every brake's inspected
The clique's connected, everybody wrist and neck lit
Two shots of Cisco, let's slip
Post like Scarface and Sosa with my memosa
All that motion, see my billiongs posted and roastin'
See my villains most of them roastin'
Freshmen chickens get close in 'em
Make one move, she buyin' me the Ghost in it
Pass the dutchie
You know what it do man
We in Wonderland huh
(Snoop Dogg)
Stealth but get loud like a space shuttle
Catch a case, a motherfuckers got a place for you
And it's 100 brothers like you that's cold with the Typhoo
Slang and things and buck 50 with the jinzu
Draw that line, flip that dime, spit that nine
Homie this Crip on mine
Thought you knew
We cold crushin' bum rush the chef, it's my nephew
The king of the west too, niggas to test you
Let your next move be your best move
Ja bless you

Yo, yo, Iron Chef (gracias)
I need some of that, (slide through the back)
I need y'all to come back to the, (I heard juice)
Back of the store over here (just be easy and tell ya man to be cool)
We got some culinary cats right here, we need you (we'll kill him if he
Fault)
(Raekwon)
Ayo, rappers stepping to me, they want a brick, son
But I'm the Chef, my price is 26, son
Move up, about 32 of those and open locker dough
Soldier got locked up, blow killed the doctor
Flamboyant police is X fives, watching my lofts
So many leeches I just left it and walked
My flow wicked, Miami money, moving and ridicly
Geico on the arm froze, rose gold with me
Take baths with white women, lingerie see-through
Taking trips to Iran, my Spanish nigga people
Selling drugs to Flatbush, call my nigga Cecil
Snub with the black gloves, on half-moon Greek do
Killed him in the Bahamas, his wife ran, white van pulled up
They caught him out in Brooklyn with a white man
Slutted out, rosed out, sister was gone, she geeking
She threw the rifle in her mouth and said 'good evening'
Yup, Paul Wall grill line, be getting money, crime thief
I know her from Africa, pretty smile, nine teeth
Gold joints, frames only, Louis Vuitton, Pony
Leather with the matching sweater on, you owe me
(Chorus: Raekwon)
Knock the ash off the blunt, confront niggas who cunt
Swing an ax, tax niggas rhyme different from cats
Specialize in mic rippers, splashes
We the last skippers, big rocks and the block will stick
(Cappadonna)
Beefsteak Charlie niggas eat and they get fat
Chase heads up and down the block and kill rats
Skilled with the gats, even feds don't know where the shells at
The shell trapped up in nice crib with four packs
Four macs, caught a nice cell for four stacks
Yeah, me and my nigga Arafat
Gotta escape but we'll be right back, real soon
Chef cook it up, we got a date with real goons
Telling you Ghost, my connect crazy with the wreck
Pythons used to talk to her sister named Yvette
I speed it up, me and the Linx, was getting weeded up
I beat it up, yeah I hit that, but I ain't seed it up
Meanwhile, back on the block, we seen two trucks
Then the windows rolled down, we see these two fucks
Soon as they jumped out, see these tools bust
(Ghostface Killah)
Yo, I lit a booger up, rocks is gone, so we bagging up all shape
Binoculars, scanners, we all listen to jake
Ran out of baggies, my mouth is dry
Got them dirty joints all scattered, don't act surprised
Nah, nigga the currency rushes like popping a wheelie
Holding a pipe with one hand, the other down in the Bentleys
You know how it be with the peppermint Clarks
Throwing darts at a hoodrat
Getting slow necked all up in The Bronx
That's all me, thirty four shines, forty four lines
I just chill like Aaron Hall, writing raw rhymes
Like, threw Kool-Aid rubies in a lemonade bezel
When I was 12 in the church, I started packing that metal
A deuce deuce, my supplier was Loose Bruce
Ever since I had the drop, my instinct was to shoot-shoot
This ain't For the Love of Ray J, it's for the love of the AK
'Cause you can get scratched like AJ
Cuban Link Dynasty has emerged, this rap shit stop
I have a team of niggas moving my furs"

Blow hands, the stove is a roaster where bottles whip in motion
May cause 'drop him in the ocean'
Irish blood gangsters, the roulettes
Cooler moving through Texas, grandmother she Mex-ish, yup
Tablets, krills, bath salts, last call, get it
Drugs flying minutes like a fastball
Smash all, I will remain clean, the status calm
I do it for niggas who last long
Last Don's chill, Kings in the chair, cigars in the air
This the last part with snakes that'll break any man's arm
Which way the grass growin'
We've sown enough and now we're farmers
Who come through with lawn mowers and armor

Runnin' trains on them hood rat bitches up in the trap
We used to blow 'em out
Fiends comin' in hike with they seized bite
With residue stuck all on they pipe
4 in the mornin' when the gates start jumpin'
Dustheads lurkin' and the fiends start thumpin'
And it seems like the fiends, he own CREAM, so they jumpin'
Bean told Cream he stole green so he cut 'em
Ditch him Star, souflee'd one half of his cheekbone
Now he talkin' out the side of his mouth
But yo, peep homes, stuck
Fly dust, that's four finger nuggets
With plastic stuffed in the Kangol buckets
Dirty burners on, gloves and scanners
Smart mouth, Teymor bitches in the back gettin' sandwiched
After a dick suck accountant
In the wee hours, backing up mountains

(Turn me up, kid, let's get it popping)
Crazy, let's go get 'em killa (Yo Dre, good looking on this coke, man)
(This shit is official)
Aiyo, it's back to business, making them diskettes, pushing sixes
Rocking wild animals on jackets are sickening
Hear me? From here to Rockaway to Cali, we flipped this
Broad day, Chef'll saute, his lyrics is crispy
Now I got Dre up in the kitchen, Rae stuck in position
Bout to flame broil his coke and get busy
What? Politics, pop collars and drive violent whips
Stay fly, hungry and wise, you know the code, honor it
Sit back, yelling it's nothing, unless his buttons get pressed
We don't stress nothing, we only get dressed
Stretched out, moving professional, frying more fish
I heard it in slurs, them niggas is blessed
While we ball to the maximum, give me the floor, for real
I show off and let my money get stretched
Take it to a new level, new bezzle, few rebels
Few wolves with medals on, you know we get test
Me, nigga, me, that's who, Cash Rule
(Hah, better slow it down, niggas'll smash you, homey, uh)
Me, nigga, me, pass through, rascals
(Hah, half gorilla, half ape in them track suits, black, come on)
Me, nigga, me, capsules, birds, whips
Ounces and fifths (no licking the glass, duke, yeah)
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah (yeah)
I'm here, so it's there, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Here comes the, a lethal presentation taking you places you never been
Deadlier than the combination of coke and heroin
I see the weakness in most of you niggas that be hollering
So I toned it down, so these words be piercing your lower obdomen
What I meant to say abdomen, keep on listening and following
While I'm ditecting a German, hateful niggas, chicks be swallowing
And if you look funny to me, and there's a problem then
I put you under an ultraviolet light or a halogen
As if I was busy deciphering counterfeit dollars and
Hoes in like some kind of Biblical figure, King Solomon
Hah, just for the record, what we do is essential
While I captivate the masses and keep the moments eventful
Doc Dre, Bust, Shallah Rae, see the vision?
Most you niggas still in disbelief, just came into fruition now
Pop the cork up off this bottle and you pour it
So euphoric, document this moment, shit is so historic
King of kings spit blood, all on my apron
Wash a nigga face with the mack, smoke 'em like Steak-umm's
Yeah my dynasty's brolic for real, we hunt E, catch the rat
Blow his waist, float in the stream
You know we all-pro with it, anti auto-tune
Boom, my flow fire, sit by the stove, hit it
Real niggas, official as listeners, gangstas and visitors
Step in the shit, we all prisoners
Might take the hammer from you, know I'm the animal
Rock a spur fur hat, no niggas in sandals, boo
Everyday get money and dress rugged, these are the times
Keep a nine on you, blow off in public
And I will surely feed my niggas the streets
Cop the hottest things to get, and haters they can eat and then preach
And while it go down, worldwide, this the team, this the theme
Me, Dre, Rhymes, my money makers is mean, what?"

Flip papers, fly around, Bugattis and yachts
Holding knots, C.R.E.A.M relations

More money, more problems you gotta be kidding
I'd rather sit up in the Bronx and parlay some shit up
I'm usually breaking down eights and slaying some sit-ups
Boo, it's tight times, let me hustle
'Cause everything you want, I'm near with all muscle
'Cause when I'm in the streets, we eating, more Ruffles
Then we can play the suits in Vegas, all duffles
'Cause you the queen, I'm the king, be a rider
A man with a game plan stressing, ain't a rider
So let me paint picture, stay crisp, we providers
We real, realer than real, word to mamas

Shorty knows better, let's blow, bring the Beretta
Showing off the vault, you walk, nigga, you're welcome
Or you can stay here and be rich with me and help 'em
I'm just crazy, fly slick intelligence
He play high, on the strips, and flip pelicans

To chill with his family, sit back layin on his Dad
Props go out, next thing you know Pops roll out
Moms cussed him out, get the fuck out
Couldn't understand it, feelings turnin' to hard granite
Now she a one single parent
Growin' up on welfare, she might need healthcare
That made me feel no one else cares
Moms is a part of my life forever
Gettin' drunk that's her business guess that's stormy weather
Fish and grits, twelve o' clock midnight pissed
Stop cryin Ma take a kiss
Take care of ya brother and sis
Something happen to me I miss ya better be offic (official)
She meant that shit, every mouthful accurate
Took me to school be emaculate

Damn, Mom going through it
Still holding me through it
Sneaker money fucked up

Strong yourself we make it
Weak minded you naked

Word up, nice sunny day, rainy day
Preferable for you and yours, let's blow, yo

Who would have thought I would have made it y'all
Ten years later, still in the gid-game, the Clan, we was one the greatest
We did platinum back in '93, we painted pictures you could see
We was living who y'all tryin' to be
RZA had a vision, instead of cookin coke in the kitchen
He told the God, hit the booth and start spittin'
At first it was a dream to me, Ol' Earth buggin
Put your gun down, screamin that the streets is gon' be needin me
I did the Knowledge to the Wisdom that you spoke to me
The Wu become us, the world enbraced us
A new day, a new life for the God
Got a hood thing, watchin ""Ice Water"" evolve
Destined to build a mountain - niggaz is doubtin my work
Black millionaire, check what I'm worth
I gotta thank y'all for takin' in Lex, I appreciate it
I apoligize for keepin' y'all waitin

Growin' up, we've been through hard times
Life on the streets, just tryin' survive
Plus my niggas got mouth's to feed
We sold to crack fiends, coke, ice and money machines
Shootin' at cops, them maggots tried to stop our C.R.E.A.M
But it won't stop, can't stop, my niggas locked down in a box
I feel your pain, I know you're tryin' to come home
All that weak bullshit, I had to leave it alone
Heard my mom's cryin' at night, we rap on the phone, I love you
Never meant to stress you out, do you wrong, yo I'm workin
Then move you from a block to a home
We came from nothin', seein' how the world is so cold
Some niggas comin' out of churches sellin' devil their soul, yo
My neighborhood is crime central, sort of like prisons and cops
One on lock, instead of tryin' to defend you
All that bullshit we've been through, time to draw the line right here
Got to stop now, time is the issue

It's time to rebuild, teach our seeds, that guns don't kill
It's the nigga behind the trigger that will
Society's ill, blacks support seeds for their mills
Mentally brainwashed, time moves on, we stand still
I seen life through the birth of my son, I seen it all again
A soldier stuck in these streets, hopin' it's war within
Too late to fall now, I'm on now
Niggas is born now, we doin' good, we on tour now
Elevate your prosperity, I'm seein' shit with clarity
No longer on the low, pa, I couldn't handle thieves
Too much to live for, I just wanna poly and grow
Stack ones and watch my little dun's blow

He stayed the freshest, polo boots, wallies with them colorful low goose
Coming from Medina, we boost
We up in A&S, slipping and dipping to bedstuy
Native, he used to beatbox, thousands'll listen
Yo, that's before, the wu got on, him and allah just'
And RZA, came to the island one morn'
A nigga could dance to slow music, outdrink any nigga
On the benches, while we hitting reefer, he sold loosies
Five foot seven a legend was born, Russel ""ason"" Jones
I know for his braids and lessons
A wiseman with knowledge 120, kept a flag on his chest
A right hand, you quick, serving you remy
Yo, lets toadt to the fallen, lost forgotten
Aiyo, if niggas could hear me, then roll up some broccoli
Ason, the heart of a lion, a purified mind
The way he did it, with a mic and some wine

Sweet lady, BK baby, she taught Dirty
How to cook, clean, singing the songs, say the
Old school dances and O.E., Ballantine, the wine
We sip, while we sat with the O.G.'s
Knowledge of self, good health
The fortunes that came with the game, had my brother insane
It's like wealth ain't enough to live for
But if you got love in your heart, just believe in yourself
That was the black man rap, baby Jesus in the black Land'
Few jewelry pieces with his gold fangs, his fam
(Brooklyn Zu) you know my brother was ill
The first dude to say, ""Yo, keep it real""
Yeah, the lover, the father, the hustler, the rap professor
Now he with Allah, that's a blessing

See, it's like, ok, where I come from
In my neighborhood, my people know me
Youknowhatimsaying? See, if I try to come any different
They ain't gon' respect me no more
Youknowhatimsaying? Because they -- you know people
Got their thing about themselves, you know
If you come from the neighborhood, youknowhatimsaying
You couldn't, you couldn't get out the neighborhood
But you could never take the neighborhood out of the people
Youknowhatimsaying, but if you try to like jump and crossover
To the other side, people understand that, and they don't like that
That's why they don't be buying people music
See, we keeps it real, and we always gon' keep it real

Took off my shirt, murked that away
How many you want? Like 17
Shits is golden, daddy, play ya part lil' soldier
Better beam, and now we start blazin' the place
Coke all in my skin, eyes is burnin' now I'm wipin' my face
The shit's good, right? Best in the town
My little Dominican man and them blessed me
Big prices let me wrestle 'em down
Keys is like 20 a joint, for you, gimme 14
Flood 'em wit dimes and give ya niggas joints
Suge Knight the building, take the town over
Then I woke up, there's blood on my left thumb
I bagged over now I start casin' the crib
Basin', 80 a gram kicked off the Playstation
Now the whole lab is mine
First niggas was lyin', mad hundreds start growin' in line
Yo the shit's love shakes and a dimensional caps
You want sick love, buy like one invincible pack
You get this stuff, you gon' see residuals back
You just a dig-dug, you can't even hit me wit facts
I just bugged on 'em
Played the rug on 'em
2 for 9, you my nigga got love for 'im
He hid it in the pot, said 'Ah yes' and 'This is destined'
Flashback to his culture, he Mexican
You all that, slick politician wit'cha raw rap?
You can sell from anywhere to jail? Nigga fall back
You be stashin' shit all in the mailboxes, all that?
You just as real as them niggas on the callback?
Yo son let it loose man
You got a lotta G to juice son
Here go 4 more, man
Word up, man, go wash ya hands, man
Word up man, go pour me some juice or somethin'

Stupid fool, you're forcing me to kill you!
(Intro: Raekwon)
Yeah, you know how it go
Fresh from the stationary hall of justice
Real rhyming, real movement, real life
Word up, we just chilling, ten bottles of Crug' on the wall
Youknowhatimsaying? Straight up, for real
Yo, RZA, talk to these niggas, man, let's go, man, for real

You better get that money, no matter, what you do
You gotta get that money, and represent your crew
And keep it true
(Raekwon)
As reaper stay sprayed, still niggas is smoked
Four in his pocket, a diamoned up chain and some coke
Champion hood, the goodies in a brown bag, by the radiator
Near the cookies and the bundles of dope
Fishscalers, I live in elevators and gross
All this paper, profit make her lay there and post
With them Adidas that Bruce wore, stay in the juice bar
All I know if you saw me, you thought I was broke
Black, yo, I been hustling since niggas was busting guns
And scuffling, and jumping niggas over some coats
We play the S&S rooftop, Latin Quarter, Polo popes
Who hung out with all the Eighthers and GOAT's
(Interlude: Inspectah Deck)
Yo RZA, you crazy man
This that Black Mozart shit, right here
(Inspectah Deck)
Yo, I used to scramble hard, radio strapped, to the handlebars
Fifty deep, in the lobby large, rocking camouflage
Dark Caesar holding my nuts, played the building front
Fit the Henny, throw a little snow in the blunt
Just growing up, schooled by O.G.'s, holding O's and up
Daily new drama unfold, they popped 'em over, what?
It's so rough, nobody know him, so what?
Aiyo, the money's close by, homey, show me the stuff
Borough hopping, copping bricks, bags, burners and kicks
City slickers, circling the strip, working them tricks
Like Friday night cruise in the Coupe, new valor suit
Fruit flavored kicks, taking flicks out in 40 Deuce
Farmer jeans, hammer swing, tucked in the loot
How they hit Miss Fisher, they was busting at suit
Up in 54, underground, parrot and Q
Made man with the grey shams, wrapping the boo
Stay flam, every day, fam, stacking my loot
Eighty grams in the cake, bam, packages flew
Sipping passion fruit, Alize, in back of the Ooh
(RZA)
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers"
11,Broken Safety,2009,Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II (2009),,Raekwon,"Heh, do you know any other styles?
I am very grateful!
Are you ready?
I'm ready
Uh, down on 40 Deuce, when I was a shorty duke
That's when I first got the Naughty goose
Now I come through in a sported coupe
I know what you better do, stop talking bout what you outta do
My crack spot is still portable
Funerals are still affordable, I'm better than all of you
I'm in the hood scraping 'em, Jadakiss, Rae and 'em
Y'all lame niggas, come uptown, spend a day with 'em
Bigger ones, bootleg liquor runs, blow something, nigga
Let the Earth smoke hit your lung, get your guns
The economy is down, so you already know
It's gon' be a lot of homi's in the town
That's why I'm still bringing the seed back
The sneakers that I can't pronounce, that cost a G stack
Niggas in the yard, got this on repeat, black
Fuck saving hip hop, we bringing the streets back, what?
Player spit snipping, different color wallies on
Bliffen had to take 'em off, they fucked up the soles, flipped it
I'm forever zooted, crushed up glass, I'm just flashing through it
Nine times out of ten, suede down at the Jumer
Maybach bloomers, playing rumors, card shark
Getting cash money, take a loan, hit this tuner
We onion head niggas, the gun gooners
Put us together, he run sea, I run land, with one ruger
Stop playing, you know we run rap, you know we done that
Stop fronting, son, put the gun back
We came with the containers, besides having the flamers
My Mexican man's is famous
Running through the streets, the bulldog
Conehead hoodies on, eighteen five for footballs
Maxed like I'm under a good wall, good G
Good recipe, good status, a hood broad
I used to move brown rectangles
Roll you a blunt, then smoke you with death's angel
Chrome trey pound is making your neck dangle
Blue trey eight is leaving your chest mangled
It's math but the gun could kill you at all angles
Leave the toast home, I'm leaving you all strangled
Louis loafers on the Jaguar, gas peddles
You got the cops with you, you ain't even half ghetto
(Not even half) We neither here nor there
But if, you was over here, you would have been got aired
(Been got aired) Like a pair of white Nike's on a summer day
Pointing the gun away, I could kill you niggas a hundred ways
Mine's in a place that yours ain't, so I'm wearing war paint
For the day that I see the Lord saint
Blowing the purple haze, playing The Purple Tape
Fuck with Chef or the Ghost, get left with a purple face
Too bad, your courage will be the death of you"

I flip the bronze e, watching King Kong in the palm
Smoke alotta cheeba, chilling, 'cause it's all about marketing
Hold the mic, I'm hogging it, handle the goose shit
Word up, mixing the true shit, my niggas'll shoot shit
Trees lean, we get it tight, we get fucked right
We up in the telly, lighting up with the crack light
My mind calculation, attract like I'm counting peso's
Out in turban caco's with some fake ho's
The bling swing, a many mansion, a break phantom
Floating through the town on some old new improved shit
Swerve coming through shit, vandals in coupe shit, yo
Animal blue shit, my scramblers move with
A kingley, getting blunted to nine hundred
Floating through the town on some old --
Coming through the town on some old --

I'm Nasty but fuck bitches, handcuff snitches
Feed they nuts to pit bulls and plan more business
Got sluts on leashes walkin' on all fours
Have 'em eatin from dog bowls pettin' they heads
'Cause they love playin' that role they sexy in bed
Smokin' bud' I'm outta control wish death on the feds
Cup spills with Grey Goose watchin snuff films
Laughin' with dykes that wear patent leather with spikes
My cheddar is right, Miami beach playin' it low
St. Barts rent a house and a boat
Two hundred thou' on my throat
That's only half of what my wife ice cost
Phonecall, hearin another boss got his life lost
Well, wipin' sand off of my toes
Read a book called ""Catcher in the rye"", I chose
Some Bob Marley then I plotted a scheme
To make me and Bump Knux more rich
Then I got me a team, he got 'em a team
He tryin' to buy G-force with missile launchers
Tired of walkin' around with beef, with that pistols on us
C-4's better I'm callin up some B-More killers
To come and bleed you
As sure as the sun's in the sky you'll surely die
You washed up, fuck your people
Your money ain't as long as mine you dumb and you foul
Who you tryin' to squeeze all this fuck with Alzheimer's disease
We the new breed, nigga, turn up the mics

Yeah, you know where I'm from, I'm from Staten Island, man
Word up, y'all know it as Shaolin, I call it Staten Island, man
'Cause niggas get they legs broke, when they try to front, man

More money on this rhyme right here, boy
Take y'all back to the front of the muthafucking 1-6-Ooh shit
Yo, lord, that first Wu shit
You know what it is, it's that muthafucking
Special made, high powered, special made forces
What up what up what up, aiyo, aiyo
Chef that fly with a meat cleaver, swing on a young nigga
Smack flames at him, no gun neither
Leave him with a bump, what the fuck
(""They say he's a swordsman"") Get that little, nigga
Who give a fuck if he's a swordsman, I'm a gunman, I run from nothing
Chain came from rent days and pumping
Wire cell with valors on, drawers is colorful
I do this, forever nigga, raw style
Lighting Phillies, fly by willies, can't come through
Unless your vehicle three hundred chain, silly
Laying in the park with the killas, the coupes, the villains
No rims, we just ball for the millions
The emperor of slang lords, kings get clapped in they dome
Get your throne rushed, and I ain't got a gun on
High power ninjas who touch you, lay a gun on
Drinking with the best of the hustling
(Chorus: Raekwon)
I got butter knives, like you got butter knives
Come through huddling, run through the spot thirty times
All my niggas old school robbers, do what it do
I got a sixty-two, a black pair of goggles
Fila approachers, the Bee Hives, the vultures and the roasters
Can't come through with cedar toasters
It's going down, only in the town
Your heart get tested, and gunplay is only an investment
Flying shooters, eyewear rugers
Stars and swords in front of the building, five thousand students
Cocaine cops they know him (""They say he's a swordsman"")
You already know that, man
Diamoned up, double O sevens, come through, 1-8-7
Back to the Hill in a second, yeah
Sons jump in front of them bullets, push me up in the bullet
Stay cool, I got shit, where ya weapon?
Hurricane slammers, earthquake clips and cannons
Back of the building, with the jammers
Live well, eat well, welcome to the Terror-dome, sleep well
Who don't like beefing? Keep shells
I flow with the souls of sharks and criminals in they heart
Play parts of this in detail
Well carried mannered, blampers, ninjas black down
Pop up on spots and vanished (""They say he's a swordsman"")

I got butter knives, like you got butter knives
Come through huddling, run through the spot thirty times
All my niggas old school robbers, do what it do

It's the remix Son
Can it be, act like you know
Check it
Yo, check what happened out of state
I'm knocking off a half-a-cake Cash Rule, flying at a fast rate
I smoke the black dust kept my hands clutched, I'm fallin' in lust
Spore plush I played my hand like a royal flush
Baggy jeans, Wallabee Clarks, pretty woman
I put it in him, shot up in him, deadly venom
I hung around the big time bosses
Illegal force exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources
Spades tried to bag me, like Cagney, and Lacey
Chef had that bitch Stacey slippin in Macy's
I dose off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped
And got licked like Papsy in a mob flick I got hit
Stumblin holdin' my neck to the God's rest
Opened flesh burgundy blood colored my Guess
Emergency trauma, black teen headed for surgery
Can it be an out of state nigga tried to murder me?
I should've stayed in Job Corp, but now I'm a outlaw
Ray Cartegna, carry a fo'-fo' nigga
{Can it be that it was all so simple then?}
Dedicated to the Gods and Earths
Dedicated to babies who came feet first
Dedicated to Up North and down state
Dedicated to rich niggaz who sell weights
Dedicated to projects with black kids
Dedicated to man who build pyramids

It started off on the Island, AK Shaolin niggaz wildin
Old folks scream : stop the violence!
True layin up yo, watchin these crack niggaz
Playin' nuff crap games for what see?
Back in days, crime pays in mad ways
Sportin Tommy Hil with caves 360 waves
And no searchin for loose ends, now flex 300 Benz
Mad 10's with mad diamonds
Now that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggaz act trife
I paid the price throughout my hood life
Remember I got blasted, now that's in the past kid
God forbid I lay in the casket
But now I'm all about G-notes, no time for weed, mixed with coke
I wash my mouth out with soap
And I got my act together, 'Lo sweaters and better
And fat leather, so whatever, bring it on
{Can it be that it was all so simple then?}
Yeah, for real
Murderous material stacked up
Peace to mazes, for real
Meditating on life
Gold, word up y'all
Crazy fly, dedication, to my people
Word up, peace to all my brothers that I ain't gonna see no more
Peace to brothers on the Island, up North

Take that, just smash the shit out
Bout four-five niggas gon' spit it
Move! Let's go. police, come on son! They right down the block, nigga
Y'all got that? You check the train station, one son (Good!)
All of our fathers is bank robbers, holding techs
Eighths of heroin, shooting in the steps
In the 60's, niggas was poor, check the revelation
Now we rock six fifties in the snow
AK's, AR's, wire jaws, say ours
Wirecell frames in the rain, Marvin Gaye on
Goose bubbles on, stuck in the huddle, trynna transform
Every gram action to a sandstorm
Fly through my block you live, make a bitch stop
Have your shit cocked, yo, niggas might dive on you
All we wear is Filas, Guess, suede fronts, beehives
Bally sneakers, big jewels, Levi's
Back to slinging every 45 minutes
G's fleeing, fiends is in the building OD'ing
The drugs is in the ground, burners on the side of our legs
It's gonna happen so you know we low keying
Yeah, can't sell in here, yup, I said it
Yeah, can't tell in here, they won't credit niggas
Just a lifestyle, the holders with the drugs is dreaded
Just a typical day to get wiped out
Broad day jungle, living with the rodents
The goons'll run through, blow a bag and hunt you
Always flaky, calluses hands my man's
Come through the avenue, Swiss cheese patrants
Blood that flood the hall, every head'll drop
Jump in the Maybach, switch the station
These rap niggas is wash, hang 'em on the pole, no head
Pajama top, handcuff with a gosha
We realer than the Spanglers Rep Posse squad that's dangerous
Take it back to the Lee's and Wranglers
Take what we want, explain this
Famous for my kitchen knives, reigns and the fifths are stainless
Gun down your trooper, grenade your coupe up
Plain and simple niggas is poo-putt
Fuck with my crew, what? Either you shot or you cut

A young man handle the game like Merill Lynch
3 a.m. breathing, leaning in gates
I mean creaming,
Selling these cakes in slabs like Lanolakes
Fiends beaming, steaming
Associated wit' names and demons
All apparent reasons
We live here the gate blew in a year
Sorta like time share where crime
Sport it like I shine yeah,
Rainbow dough was the emmo
So many flavours yo,
Buy your neighbour off underwater vault
Then I met him, Colombian name Flako
Had the whole block locked selling tons in Morocco
Wristwatch Fachera Costanti, nigga dead up
Sniff the rawest mist mixed wit 7up
Had a black wiz spoke German
Higher learning burning
Ask Vernon got a bed set bought a black jet
Bitch large percentage on her rich motor lodge
Lost her arm, shot wid a AK up in the south
Paramedics rocked her,
Said she had connections out Anartica
Barrels of juices from Florida
Can't forget live dusthead centerfoldin
Out in Club Med butt ass layin' like she dead
Wise guys fell for her ambiance
Pull it together, black renassaince
Queen Elizabeth aunt
Crazy swift Cristal murderer
Guzzle the shit like she dying kid
Showing off her diamond
Flashbacks now it's me and him again
Last word I caught
'Put your money in we could have the shit bumpin'
That's federalo music
I caught the glimpse from the bitch
When she winched yeah Santa a grinch
She blinked twitched her nose then froze
Check your Rolls by the blow
It's time to roll nigga let's go
I thought about it
Broke the money down
What's the total count it,
No count it over in the mix
Day going slower,
Nope not time to motor
He estimated over me not being a crook
Count it over
Yo only on the strength of my man
We ain't hit him wid the strong hand
Gun him down leave him out in flatlands
He backhand smacked her
Threw her on the table jacked her
I broke out in laughter fifteen minutes after
Police knocked on the door
Looked out the window of my room
As your, nigga yeah that's yours
He opened up the door this nigga wildin'
His bitch is in shock
Start smiling and speaking on Valen
Yo wisen up bitch this from the rich
Immobilize the game get your name right
Envelope came hype
Regards from the mayor you hype
Fuck right, lets fuck this money up
And get large and blow outta sight
Wise niggas wake up
Dead niggas lose

I grew up on the foul side
Nickel-bag valcyte
Purple tops, two for fives
I had seven grams
Outside with my eleven man's
On the corners with a pocket full of contrabands
Running up and down fire-escapes, narcs coming
Jump in the window let your Nikes fly, hide the flakes
Guess up in the hill it was real to me
What a nigga woulda did if you steal from me
All my life around drug niggas villains who want millions
Niggas with them hoodies on with teks in the building
Mad fiends, bags and green, Gillette razors, fly neighbors
All our blazers designer jeans
That's why we live (yup)
Niggas need shit in their crib
Go broke, you go and rope you a Vick
It's just full-time stragglers
Niggas try to take your place
And smile in your face
But still in all backstabbers

I don't know when the toilet gonna back up
And put me in some shit that I can't get out of

Bags of money
Trying to stay rich and fly
Keep it cool, silks and dungarees
Krug glasses and food
Grilled salmon, trying to make a move
Those who knowing they be dapping they dudes
How it do blow a lot of crews stay in the cut
Pacing from here to LA and Hawaii and Cuba
Blue new oozie too serial numbers is braille
So when you rub against it feel on (?)
Now I'm with some special niggas, next level niggas
With rubber bezels who drive Exeleros with jewels
(?) Boots on, olive goose, calamari soups
And noodles that spell out ""Y'all niggas the truth""
What it is baby boy, reclining in a big Benz lazyboy
Endsed up, lenses on, Chips Ahoy
Shipping triple, niggas try to stop the issue
And cock-block but can't stop the official

I'm just trying to get on
Leave a couple mil to my kids when I'm gone

Trying to get to my glove box and shit
Got the door open, gash in my Caesar, my sneakers got red on it
Know that's blood, he threw a piece of a chain with a long blade on it
And a nigga was buckwild, I'm ducking and dodging
Trying to stick 'em with my little blade, Rae in some trouble
I got to the glove box, I threw two shots, he disappeared
(Chorus: Estelle)
What are the true keys to being a ninja?
Dressed in all black, perfect vision,
And that movement is in silence, ah
What are the true keys to being a ninja?
Dressed in all black, perfect vision,
And that movement is in silence
This is Shaolin (Shaolin) this is Shaolin (Shaolin)
This is Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin
This is Shaolin, this is Shaolin
This is Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin
I stay there like it ain't nothing to face fear
Flowers by the grave of the niggas who say where
I'm straight tear, tell them don't play fair
Then retaliation, I'm a shake 'em just for scraping my suede pair
He told me ""Yo, wait right here, son, I been there""
Rip your pockets off plus nut in your dame hair
Broad day, even with Jake there, serious
Last time you saw me I was rocking the same stare
Do or die, you or I, cousin, I pray for you
Forgive me for my sins, father, this is what they made me do
Nonsense cause me to slay the fool, rather than play the fool
I resort to waving the gauge at you
(Chorus: Estelle)
What are the true keys to being a ninja?
Dressed in all black, perfect vision,
And that movement is in silence, ah
What are the true keys to being a ninja?
Dressed in all black, perfect vision,
And that movement is in silence

The year of the bullshit, why me? The nigga had Asics on
A three hundred dollar pair, B
You don't scare me, wiping blood, hear me?
He laugh with a sinister grin, the sun went down, this is grim
Now I'm sweating, still repping my square, you probably under a chair
Black hood on and sporting a gray beard
Respect mine, or there go your head line
A nigga got caught up, and left naked sporting a necktie
Skip town slide to west side, CSI riding on my hides
So I'm out till next time

One nasty unit of murderers, all type of Goons'll watch
Then four minutes later they burgulars

Elevate the name up, this gift gotta reign and his game went up
And now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics
Go against it and it's instant vendettas
He run things, gun down Kings, check the joint the kid flyin' in
Crib in Africa with two lions
Somethin' like the Prince of a jewel thief, so smack the millions
Came back wrapped it up, too sweet

And he pleadin' for mercy, bleedin' from his dome and he thirsty
The first week we made him eat shit!
Videotaped his wiz and I fucked his bitch
Made him watch me on the couch havin' fun with his kids
So what hurts more: is it me showin' love to ya fam?
Or you in the box laid under the floor?
Or keep you alive blow torchin' ya balls?

Cause divisions, they separating, laying cacoons
And they can't wait to come home soon
While bodies get found in lobbies, chopped up, decaying in rooms

Clever, more like a fox and ox together
Two stainless glocks, rocks and a feather
Yeah, I'm from the lead era, shoot at
Anything that move, and move out America

And start melting the street up

Y'all know that I ain't the one to start with
Cause once the fuse is lit and we strike a match and the spark smell
My fangs bleed and we nam them up like ox tail

Somebody please ask Shallah Rae why he making me do this

And the silk shirt was ripped off, Punch cut his hair
Razors was bloody, he kept hitting, dread grabbed his shirt
Showing his stomach, the kid had zippers on him
Bitches was flipping, they grabbed Tasha, caught her for a Louis
Snatched her titties right up out the bitch bra

Can't nothing rock me, I'm legendary
(Outro: Raekwon)
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what
It's on you bitch... word up...
Back to that ice rocking shit
The muthafuckin' good sneakers on
With the persian muthafuckin' scarfs hanging on
Catch me flying in that muthafuckin' XO
It's on, with the shit on the other side
The steering wheel on the other side, my nigga
You know what it is, it's going down

It's on, thoro, do it..."

Yeah, yeah, straight outta jail
First time nailing me, realer than the obvious
They never said it was gonna be easy
Who can y'all put up with?
The streets... why you coming at me like that, man?
You payin' him? You taking care of me?
What's the matter with you, man?
See this the shit that make a nigga don't come over, man
(Chorus 2X: Raekwon)
Aiyo, fly shorty Penelope, fresh female chick
Straight outta jail, first time mailing me, God
Realer than the obvious, livelyness was on the line
I mean like, the sweetest thing, most seen her kind
(Raekwon)
Bloomingdale patient, slick finance who got a Benz station
Studying law, buying North Faces
Tried by the police, yo, straight up and down
I hold rollies, size six shaconies, daughter, might name her Water
Son, might name him Rich Porter, style, Law and Order
Copped them quarters, it's real, blowing out in Florida
Displaying a game, frame, I'm adoring her
Blasting music, I'mma lose it, shorty romance the music
Just grind, don't dance to it, flexin' with a sun dress on
Shorty refreshin', less you stressed, stop swarmin' on her
Yellin', it's all made basic, taste it
Anybody lace this here, you can blaze it
Rinaldo stepped up, what, ""Lex, you know I got it lined up""
Bust ya gun from the side, what?
Take this thought in mound, your frame might be a dime
But the brain power might not shine
Shorty had a good head once, rolling up blunts, damn
She fucked up, got caught in the crunch
Now, down go her lifestyle
She on the FDR now, with a Audi J, bugging out
Stop that drinking, you wild, project chick, yo
Won't even tuck her chain, nigga, that's foul
Got caught up in the number run, dunn
I need to get my life back, son, share one
Lex laid it out, but she stunt, enter and still smoke blunts
Shit ain't real, she yelling ""Fuck everyone""
Yup, caught up in the midst, I mean glitz
Went from doorags to rich, now he blue hat and switch
I guess, the live way to rap it, shorty went backwards
Now she stuck with a dirty Guess jacket
Keep on, giving out the jewels wrong
Who wrong? Who want? Who trynna-trynna act like you never knew wrong
Now it's raining, now I'm maintining, gaining
Probably gaming with positive aiming, long dane it
Stepped in, jumped in the car, fuck God
Put the Wisdom for Knowledge, you bond, whine too hard
Shaking her ass, walking out to the garage, you large
Fuck men, fuck who weighing nods
Stopped, took a peak at the stars, the Zodiac, a fine Mars
Or lose it for a chick behind bars
Wash, waking up Lars, aiyo collect call Taj'
Let's take a half a million in the cards
Laying up, at the Laborage, say I need a massage
Stressed, jumping out the Guess jumper, charged
Wifey material, make sure y'all observe the ariel
I'm mailing this through ya stereo

The way the tech dance
On a nigga face
Son ain't have a chance
Seen him high pitch yellow nigga
>From outta town a young mellow ally
Trying to run through
Hell and song called the dogs to get on him
When we caught him the only famous nigga
Was a lord in his forum
Bum nigga fresh outta jail
I used to play baseball wid him
Till he got large son bought a whale
As you're by the entrance
Guess it's real nigga night out
He moving on his own negligence
Yo Lexxy strap up meet you in the back
In the Acura spectacular big key stackeler
Seen a nigga gymed down fresh haircut
Trying to swim now
Aqua green Avias on brim style wild
We walked by eyeing 'im

Spit nozzles on the tools
Might just bust him quiet style rules
He walked out the crib yup drinked

Betta run nigga move out
This nigga liver than fuck

Blood got a salty taste

Laced now it's a case
Threw up vomit on my Kobe
Snatched all his ice now
Chrome teeth boating of a loan key
Didn't know the kid was large

Chill you bigga than the ocean
Slow motion play it off no emotion
But my man in there grossing
What to do they might kill him
We might kill you circulate death
That's how the real do
We sat there 3 live macks of the year

I got to tell 'em, man, I got to tell 'em
Based on a true story, y'all
Yeah... prophets, nigga, prophet

With an iron fist of fury and a mighty sword
To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang
(Verse 1: Raekwon)
In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this
From right in time when I was nine years old
I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers
Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest
I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school
Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox
Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand
Sold three looseys, just to get on call plan
R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers
Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping
All my kins blew up, we grew up with
We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping
Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby
You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby
The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah
Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Ra
(Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn)

Reunited, another LP, we're all excited

My touch like Midas, I cramp your style, arthritis
These niggas is food, I eat they food, nigga-ritis
Your man don't snooze, insomniac
This The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who?
Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you's a cannibal
And stopping me, is what you cannot do
Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through
I ain't different Method Man like you
But you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough
And little kids in my community cuss
Y'all be showing your guns, but the ones in my community bust
And when they do, you give the jewelry up

We bought the crib next to Bill Clinton mother 'cause she fuck wit the Chinese
They hit niggas wit heron, there's 14 of us
Beamers, won't stop pitchin' the Chevron
It's packed kid, black kids don't know how to act

Yo, the system's oopid
Yup, shorty wit the dunks on, the dunks get provided and swoop kid
And bloodhounds is hatin'
They knowin' how the kid get down
Silent shottys wit grenades, I'm waitin'
And everybody love vintage
You see like 4, 5 niggas wit half-moons and wave intentions
What's really good?
The 'dro hit 'em, killed him in the hotel
Heard he had some old chick wit 'im

That's how we break it down

Just know who is who
Acknowledge me all day and understand
Wu is Wu
Yo but on the other side of town it's Tony
Laid up
This white chick wanna gargle my nuts
I put the Bailey's down, tapped the blunt out
Grabbed her by her hair, watched blondie love whip my dick out
Spit drippin' down my balls, she slobber me
That's right, suck that dick, get it hard for me
Pyrex in one hand, large amount of grams in it rocked up
And she pregnant, my lil' man got her knocked up
He popped up (oh shit!)
I'm like a crooked cop, Richard Gere
Big smirk on, getting' my cock sucked
He pulled the joint out, a bullet spun out
But it was too late
Already nutted on the side of her mouth
Side of her face and hair like Somethin' About Mary
I can't front, my son gun look scary
Chill, she's a whore
You knew it from the time we ran trains on her
And you still fucked her raw
C'mon son, gimme the gun
You gonna kill me over this bum-ass bitch you can't resist?
Remember Vell had her in the Telly, takin' the fist?
Watch how you aimin' that shit
You should be aimin' at Trish
She take a bone like a rib-eye steak at Ruth Chris
Yo be easy on the trigger son, you squeezin' the fifth
I only did it just to show you she's the easiest bitch
He came close, had to duff him, nigga gimme that shit

Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd
[Raekwon/Ghost] And I'm a scrape her
Verse Two: Master Killer
Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of pulse will increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal
From the international vocalist
Ya style is too local
To fuck with this
All fits of antagonists
No assistance movin motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperments
Uncountenance dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Chumped by the drunken punches that punches the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries start
Verse Three: Ghostface Killer
The treasure is the glaciers of ice original man
Posess the power of hold G's guns and grams
Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them check castin chain snatchin gun flashin
Niggaz in the hood bubblin good
Analyze stocks, we'll be buyin lion heads and cloths
To all my house bitches, Starks will be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch you Ninety-Six in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips to settle this, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daquiris and max swimmin pools
Fly jewels Wally shoes blow stacks relax kid
Black kids got a cravin for grapes until we get back
I'm packed leave the Mac that you're with
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, foolish, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and aure-al
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then we out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Blow like a steroid pat Dan's they're Akyroid
My seeds growin' his seeds marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggaz for comin' in my fuckin' face with that shit
All right cool yeah, go ahead man...
Poisonous
Poisonous paragraphs, smash ya phonograph
In half, it be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class leavin' mics with a cast
Causin ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter
Rhymes runnin' wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp I sliced the mic from the cord
First they criticize, but now they have become
Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the rest is I, Rebel INS
Ya highness, blessed to electrify
With voltage of an eel, truth that I reveal'll
Crush the amateurs who screamed to keep it real
Caesar black down hoodied up and fatigues
Part time minor leagues receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack, once I pull back
The God-U, and bust through like a fullback
Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tappin inside my rap vein causes blizzards
Do I like the kills for ice trife like botta digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The Earth spins ruins, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggaz gaspin swallowin aspirins
What a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives my post-its hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole Clan is on the run like Natural Born Killers
Record-breaking the album Thriller
Now access the jig who has bombs and rocket launchers
Float like dope killer bees is what I sponsor
Ya entrepreneur, pens and gear like shakespeare
When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souveneirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career is based on guns, throwin' cats in wheelchairs
Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken and passed like leathers
Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter ya feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Blew my family overseas in mansions
If rap was crack, fully packed I be tour cats
Tax the kingpin of the rap drug traffickin'
Village niggaz get slapped in Manhattan
For rappin', big Ghost steps off laffin
(Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me)
Sit back relax, fake niggaz don't get turns
Watch me massage ya brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who is that? Thousand dollar chains and techs
Focus, the brokest niggaz of life shit
These mics is like cocaine Sun, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes
Keepin' up on fakes outta state for cakes
No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off of
Puttin' fifty on the Land and Allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up black, matta of fact just adapt
Tie up, ya black Nike's and tight hats
Corners, stay surrounded with foreigners, whattup dread?
Feds caught you grudgin for his bread
But regardless, peace to jail niggaz with charges
Unify layin in the guard with La
My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta, with stamina
Clingers and gamblers, and gram handlers
Tical like the Isle, so God, let's get steamed
Infrared guard yo' Beem,
So seek nuff respect Rude bwoy you bet,
Keep it movin par shallah Pro black like tar
Designin the fly shit and stay shinin and
The RZA pours more beats than Cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to black
With 50 other niggaz on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want some
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pullin out Macs for fun
The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguin emcees, I keep 'em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggaz are timid, and nobody knows
How we move like wolfs in sheep clothes
Producin data, microchips or software
Undaground and off air, the Land of the Lost
Notorious henchman from the North
Strikin niggaz where the Mason-Dixon line crossed"
39,Have Mercy,2009,Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II (2009),,Raekwon,"You have to learn mercy
Otherwise, you will learn bad ways
You have been confined here, for one month already
But you still haven't grasped this basic principal
I feel sorry for you, my boy
I've been living in this world
Not knowing where I'm going (knowing where I'm going)
This world ain't showing
That it's gonna get better, better (yeah, it's gonna be trouble again)
My days getting shorter, my nights getting longer
My cell getting smaller, my son getting taller
I exercise my mind, my body getting stronger
But my blood getting colder, heart getting harder
My chances for appeal, getting slimmer
My skin getting brighter, my hair getting thinner
See, when you stressed out, you could age fast in here (have mercy)
I done seen weak niggas not last a year, so before lights out
I write my kids every night, kiss the stamp on the kite
And say a prayer, I hope it lands safe in this flights
I pray they sleep safe through the night
Try to teach my son right, give him some jewels
But it's hard to raise my boy from this visiting room
Many cells turned to prisoner's tombs
I just pray I don't die in here, and last night I almost cried a tear
(Have mercy)
To all my gun holders, stand up, get it
'Cause when the killas come around, it's on
Bullets get blown, warn 'em and they re-up fast
Say some back shit, your flagship gone
Can't play the building no more
Can't hang around by the store no more
It's really on, you a dickhead
Now you a dead man with no hand
Now you can't believe you jammed
Between my six niggas, sixty years, stay in the crispy airs
Hundreds, blunted, we up top, switching lairs
Money equal power, horror equal real when borrowed
Ratchet barrel under your ears
Mean streets in the middays, they robbers, but life's so hard
Even the cops clutter us to starve us (have mercy)
The killas is star struck, look at the cars and trucks
Rambo guns, it's hard to get luck
Whether fail or a come up, your number is up
Period, make you bleed Caesarean
Chop through your body, leave you right in the lobby
Hear me, kid? Extra holes right in your derriere
The blitzes, the rushes'll touch something, back in the cells
Two days later, yup, back in them cuffs again
Or leaning on the customers, hustlers, my hood illustrious
Marvelous raps, screw on mufflers (have mercy)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
It hurts my heart, to see what's going on
Young men dying now, children going when they're born

Benetton sweaters, Kangols and guns

Sellin' ounces of oregano, free lunch, the spot
Thinkin' all better, can't wait to bag this block
'Cause when I get on, my ass is just rock
Do a few 1-2s and shop
I get whore who's runnin' through 5th Ave, a Glock
I love Polo Gear and top
A few Woolrich pieces, yeah the [?] was hot
Dreams and schemes to make a knot
I sat on the stove and wrote ""C.R.E.A.M.,"" one blunt 2 o'clock

Tryna stay away from the jail gangs and letters
My time is now, bread box is startin' to pile
Homegirl got no style but I'ma lace her
Catch me in a Blazer with a P9 laser
Drunk get 25 thousand a razor
Meet me in the mess hall, you crazy, I'm out in Jamaica
Breakin' up black weed, chillin' with gangstas
Fuck around high, might die on vacation
Better have respect in the right place like Mike Mason
Everybody smooth when the cake flip
Niggas start snitchin' on the team whe they say shit
Get your face lit, it's so hard to make shit
Can't sit around jealous niggas, that's gay shit

Yo, so now we connect doors, meet me at the airport
Tell golden arms maintain the fort
Get in touch with that West coast Cali crab you stabbed
And meet me at the bitch lab
So word up kid, we slid like a fat four to twelve bid and shit
Couldn't even rest, I need the vic
And when I slept, I dream G's, Son I need some
Keys roll self, call up Son

A fake nigga faked and they killed his click
Gimme a minute and I'm with it
Yo niggaz done did it
Rock your vest
Keep your whip tinted
So now we see him up in BoJangles
Stranglin a forty ounce, with ten G's worth of gold bangles
Diamonds, what, all up in his face
With his man's mace, medallions the size of dinner plates
Yo, he knew we knew him so we blew him
Took thirty G's worth of jewels of that nigga
Do him!

I pop off like a mobster boss
Angel hair with the lobster sauce, summertime can't top the scorch
Check my hot broad, I dropped the Porsche
FBI wanna watch the force, trying to lock my source
Where I'm from, hear the macs, techs, glocks and fours
Hide the safe, nigga, lock the doors
No respect for the cops and laws
In the land where your own blood brother still plot for yours
Seen things that'll drop your jaw
My soldiers got dropped in war, see the mural on the project wall?
Won't stop till I copped them all
Wanna block me? You gots to brawl, tray shots and all
'Cause I ain't on the clock for talk
The Spot Rusher, blow down the spot for sure
Still break off the block with raw, my stock is more
The General, watch your board

Deep pockets with the eight on me, sleep with the safe in the wall
The cameras on with the make-up and all
Swap six 45's, twist reefer in the flicks, papi whoadie ride
Bolt his gun off, from know your horse, she lied
Fly criteria, bury me in Africa
With whips and spears, and rough diamonds out of Syria
A true don, only I could do wrong
Rock fitted hats, get crack money and drive a sick blue joint
Retard-less, I'mma blow regardless
Resume is straight up live, I shank niggas up for larger E's
And speak with the youth in the spot, eat the fresh fruit in the crop
All these hip hoppers eat cock
You can see me in the street or the yacht
I'd rather be promoting your block or buying fresh sneakers with gwops
Yo, I'm an ill dude, always been a real dude
Don't fuck around, I will spill on you and kill you in the field, boo

Treacherous bank robbers, the plan gold up, we pop guards

To dump on niggas, our guns is chunky
Usually we bust niggas down with bats, swell up they joints
Elbow, wrists, they shins get cracked
We still humiliate, brutalize, Ruger pop, pulverize
Still got gear in the closet, that's stupid live
From Benetton rugby skullies, Oshkosh conductor jumpers
The train hats fit me lovely
Rae job is to make sure the coke is fluffy
While I politic his birthday bash with Puffy
Bagged Nia soon as I linked up, the kid ain't inked up

Man, is Staten in this bitch or what, don't get it twisted, we
Twist it up and even mixed with dust
See these fans can't resist the rush, they Wu-Tang for life
Scarred for life, they can't forget the cuts
Got a whole line of classic joints, and while you at it
Pass the joint, let's push this music past the point
Of no return, till they crash and burn, down the ashes
Then placed inside Ol' Dirty Bastard's urn

To send shot like forget me not, at any nigga

I kick it with my niggas in the building and move packs
The money I be making kinda sacred, don't say it
Just make sure you save it, thank God that you made it
Taxes, pay it - the bullshit, save it
The blueprint, I laid it - the radio, they play it
So relay it, replay it then rate it but truth debate it
Relate it, best way to [?] it, but you too afraid to say it

Well you know why
I do, we're not supposed to trust anyone in our profession anyway
Knock niggaz out the box all the time

Big ones, yeah, big fuckers
Straight up, fuck your whole team

Yo, yo, fly G.I. niggaz
Now yo yo, whattup yo, time is runnin' out

We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace incarcerated scarfaces
Thug related style attract millions Fans
They understand my plan, who's the kid up in the green Land?
Me and the RZA connect, blow a fuse, you lose
Half-ass crews get demolished and bruised
Fake be frontin, hourglass heads niggaz be wantin
Shuttin down your slot; time for pumpin
Poisonous sting which thumps up and act chumps
Raise a heavy generator, but yo, guess who's the black Trump?
Dough be flowin by the hour's Wu, we got the collars, scholars
Word life, peace to power and my whole unit
Word up! Quick to set it, don't wet it

But this time is for the uninvited
Go head and rhyme to it, big nigga mics is gettin' fired
Morphine chicks be burnin like chlorine
Niggaz recognize from here to Baltimore to Fort Greene
But hold up, Moet be tastin like throw-up
My mob roll up, dripped to death whips rolled up
Ya never had no wins, slidin in these dens wit Timbs
Wit Mac-10's and broke friends
Ya got guns, got guns too, what up son, do
You wanna battle for cash and see who Sun too?
I probably wax, tax, smack rap niggaz who fax
Niggaz lyrics is wack nigga
Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank bustin' Scud missles
You rollin' like Trump, you get your meat lumped
For real, it's just slang rap democracy
Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees
Check the status, soon to see me at Caesar's Palace eatin salads
We beatin' mics and the keys to Dallas
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
From staircase to stage, minimun wage
But soon to get a article in RapPage
But all I need is my house, my gat, my Ac
Bank account fat - it's goin' down like that
And pardon the French but let me speak Italian
Black Stallion, dwellin on Shaolin
That means the island of Staten
And niggaz carry gats and mad police from Manhattan
Now yo yo, whattup yo, time is runnin' out
It's for real though, let's connect politic - ditto

Word up, peace incarcerated scarfaces
I do this for barber shop niggaz in the Plaza
Catchin asthma, Rae is stickin gun-flashers
Well-dressed, skatin through the projects wit big ones
Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one
Upstairs, switch like a chameleon, Hip Brazilians
Pass the cash or leave your children, leave the buildin
Niggas, yo they be foldin' like envelopes
Under pressure like Lou Farigno on coke
Yo, Africans denyin niggaz up in yellow cabs
Musty like funk, wavin they arms, the Arabs
Sit back, coolin like Kahlua's on rocks
On the crack spots, rubberband wrapped on my knots
You bitches who fuck dreds on Sudafeds
Pussy's hurtin', they did it for a yard for the Feds
Word up cousin, nigga, I seen it

Gettin' diamonds on the low
Splash me a boat
Hook: Kim Stephens
What I'm gonna be
Is something more than anyone could think of me
Do what you want I'm still gon' live my destiny
I've got one chance to live my life
And as long as I'm alive I will make it
Hard work a nigga was sold yo
Just trying to take control rock me a Roll
Glock be the goal take my time and build
Into the 36 got real people wanna see us
The word Steeles, your work reflects your life
Your earth respects you twice
Commodity advice chill wid the ice
That's when I caught on
Sell these niggas the illusion
And plus live it out on spite
Yo the block is draining and scary
A nigga might die out here
Or be in some jail law library
Unlawful entry a century
Fuck I wanna live in jail?
I'm already in ghetto penitentiary
Talent made me be involuntary to y'all now
I just add on and teach one of y'all
Don't get exiled caught up in the mix
And loose sight focus burst
And you're forced to go wild yo,
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Aiyyo,
Prosperity endangered so many of us
All the bullshit has got away with murder
That's why we can see who's real and who's fake
And who bit off the last nigga tape stole his state
Wake up we running outta plans
The devil inside of him
Tricknology is in one hand
Future's so far to see
The present's how will it be
The past don't even ask just believe
Looking in the dictionary
Trying to spell out hard words
Define 'em and design 'em
I shine and curve
Take this jewel in and conquer me
I blend it in wit ganja
Not for the babies it's a mind sponsor
From the 17 million God raised
2 million lost slaved
19 million may we all praise
So when we wake up
Let's straighten up and get it together
For real and keep all getting paper
Do what you want I'm still gon' live my life"

Yeah (Word up, let's go)
You know how we gotta come at this niggas, man
Yeah... come on... yo.
(Havoc)
Stuck, y'all like gum underneath my kicks
Better move little fucks when the heat I'll spit
The hammer clap like the ass on a meat-out chick
Dump clips like a trifflin' ass bitch to drop
If you short you're a chance in the box
But I ain't lettin' you play with the guns in the club, I'm boothin' the ox
Got my eyes on the ho's and I'm a peripheral
Got you cowards poppin' that Moe', my hand on the 'istol
Wild out, have a ball, you could drink till you 'url
Thought the Firewater was strong, the pound'll leave you curled
On the floor, like a new born baby, God
What you mean ""Is he dead?"", what type of shit is leakin' out of his head?
When you cowards see the drama and it come to a head
I'm hittin' Rae up on the jacket, it ain't much to be said
If it's on, go without sayin' somethin', deliverin'
Visa verca, this is Havoc, baby, we those niggas (we those niggas)
(Chorus 2X: Raekwon)
All that money is us, now what's fuckin' wit' us?
Eh yo all around hungry, that's us and can't get nothin' get it
Eh yo all that money, all them niggas
All them shorties, everybody yell ""All lovely""

I chop meat out ya face, Daddy, gladly
Mad breeze on, rubberband currency and I splash ya visa
You know the code, yo caesar low straddlers
Front Streets, cracks all in the front seat spazzin'
Imperial wizards, Staten
Knife game off the chain and I'm with four hundred with wagons yo
Live wires, shoot darts for bread
Any map, I assist that, I'm holdin' it, all niggas dead
What? Battle for cake and fuck wizzes
We do it straight business, all mount ride, ain't no fake niggas
Reminisce, spit faces
Pissin' on the fake little swindler's list, Rae gave them niggas cake
Battle the gun, you're wildin'
I might levitatate well, I might take ya shit, push up, stylin' it
Oxes, reefers, police need us
The regime of Shaolin with Queens re-up
Fuckin' with the poisonous hand
Remember y'all, no commercial, I hurt you, yo go get ya man's
(Raekwon)
Eh yo select me, Gucci sneaker recipe
Not the S dot Carters, no disrespect but respect me
One of the top five gangstas alive
My element is just the Elliott Ness, niggas who hide
Yo I ran from some niggas that was police
These niggas heard about me bringin' marked money in, I had the whole East
I've been the greatest, been flippin' the latest
Somethin' like the new haggler on the Ave., ham it up, pullin' haze
And all the young niggas praise me
It's like the talent of the Six Million Dollar Man, 'yana pace
Come on, banana squeeze, aim at these Caravans
Heard he had his man and that ugly Keish'
Comin' from a galaxy of hood, hard real people gettin' ki's
Fuck wit' the media, it's all good"

It's your night! *bottles popping*
Yeah, mad bottles! Playboy! We out of here, man

La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it
By the time you read this letter
Your head gon' fly off your shoulder for lying
And I'm a be in bed like holders
Blood from a horse on your spread, you tried to play me now
I'm coughing up, dough on your head, you just a baby
See me in the flick as a Rick, I had to maybe with me
All these niggas stay in the 90's, getting rich
Rick Ruler robe on with rings, walking to the throne
Fronting like I know I'm the king, I live alone though
Buying up, China's Beemers, taking it to Simon's in Medina
Only just to blind you and leave ya
These young boys is crafted with aim, I bought 'em all
Fly ranches, 'cause they all stand beside me with flames
Regardless, yo, to making the classic, you gon' witness some of the tactics
Some died, live in the action
A live general when he walk, if he died, then we slide
Ninety thou' in the coffin, and take the child
Black Jesus, check my walk, check my talk
Legend in the flesh and I rep New York
Crowned king, been down to bang, I'm House Gang
Knockout specialist, in and out the ring
Got dinner tables long as boats with old kitchens
And Wu-Tang logos splashed on all the dishes
You know how I speaks the truth, how I teach the youth
I'm an animal, I beast the booth
Been grinding, banging out for food to eat
Your boy still eating good, check my new physique
Since the world is mine, I'm a write my name on the clouds
So that ol' yee faithful, can praise it and bow
Now he's an old Mafia don, from back when
He managed to survive the game, ducking fame
It's how he maintained, the State of Grace, kept his lab laced
Ladies of a fine taste, kept his place guarded
While the young charted, found acquitted, all charges
And his heart loss and, marksmen take the contract
From the contact, waiting for the right event, it all made sense
He left no prints on the weapon, and he was blasting
Came home from prison stashing, still stacking
His whip still matching his kit, steel flashing
Hands quick, nice with his shit, three holy foods
Drops jewels, from a street corner level, young brother, I'm a rebel
Here to instruct private soldiers to buck arms
Y'all rap cats had your last win, toast the kings
It's Wu-Tang, it's our thing, kiss the ring"

Hit a store owner named Mike Lavonia
Italiano, slanted-eyed bangin' them fat Milano
Selling coke right out the bottle
Sometime, a nigga brought nines to test with minds
Crazy peace, buying keys in Greece
Was a rich nigga, picture the nigga without dope figures
Condo with his chick, rockin' a gold Vigor
Mafia flicks, tyin up tricks was his main hobby
Teachin his seed, Wu-Tang karate
Mixin drinks in clubs, hairy chest with many minks
Night time rollin' with spics
Extra live, he claimed he couldn't die, top rank
Sixteen shots in his fishtank
And his pet piranha, he named him marijuana
Smokin' ganja, callin his weed paisandra
Claimin New York was ancient Babylon
Where the sky stayed the color of grey, like her-on
I can't front though, truck loads of indo
Soon to blow slow, his ass is out now, tally-hoe

Verse One: Raekwon the Chef
Lay on the crime scene, sippin fine wines
Pullin nines on, UFO's, takin' they fly clothe they eyes closed
We gettin' loot, no doubt, check the word of mouth, unheard about
Guns go off and now a murder bout, I'm out
My raps play the part like a Get Smart secret agent
In a maze and, styles blazin'
Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in a daze and
Rhymin, my nigga Lou Diamond will wrap it up
We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles
Havin' them poodles on the lockdown buyin me
Amarett-ahs, and chewables, stackin pharmecuetical
Rap niggaz on dust and wools
Yo, I told you, some kill rob and fold
The gold's untold, fuck it it beats parole
So stroll marvelous, soul controller
Of the whole globe, god damn I got it sewn
And yo, whattup pop, pop the suitcase high
And we can talk, you can walk out the fuckin' building and get caught
Save the fully inflatable, rap relatable, drug relatable
Niggaz here to play with you
A hundred dollar Rottweiler goes to spot sellers
Guns and glocks go to niggaz who got props
Off top, jail niggaz get mad bigger
And yo, mail a guy about a hundred pictures
Word to momma, this rap wonderama team got drama
Comma, plus smoke realize marijuana
Chef may resign to boat across the Verrazano
Immaculate plus all my guns so accurate
They get CREAM and the cuisine in Queens
I told you, money stated with the night beams and two rings
Crazy fat, gettin' ready to do this shit
[Ghostface] Sniff mad shit man, what the fuck
*Car peels and crashes*
Verse Two: Ghostface Killer
Who's the Knucklehead, wantin respect?
Chop his fingers in the drug game, money well known
Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath
Here's his photograph, run up in his lab, take off the mask Chaz and think fast
Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas, and place it in his face fast
At full blast
...
Then skate to the next gate further upstate
I heard they got crazy weight, bagged up by the kegs in
Crates like disco breaks, yo look out for Jakes,
Give it all it takes, let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo Blake, niggaz don't fake, rape his mate
If the bitch scream, for God's sake, grab the grey tape
It's by the plate, with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floatin in lakes
Drug related, paper talkin' 'bout the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the Big C Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sip an eighth
Verse Three: U-God
The rap scar is on rap chrome, put it on seal it on
We're silicone, Spark it on your Talkathon
This rap phenomenon, to word is bond to the arms
Hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars tone, bar throne, war tones, raw tones
Blowin' out the door bones but your rap's fraudulent
Plug in these rap quarter inches, reinforced with suspense
Be on your rap sword defense, these microphone professional
Sensational, fully operational,
I got NIGGAZ here to play with you
You know the steez you know my whole program, brothers from the No-Lands
All we want is the G's, guns and grams
Livin' fat like the Hoffa, Mafia, sippin eatin pastas
Layin in the house tellin' the seeds about the sagas
Before we got Germanic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the belly put tones into the telly
Sucker tried to knock me out the box like skelly
I smoke the weed dreams I drop top two degrees
Honeydips spendin G's on nails and hair weave
The crime boss, takin' no loss, excessive force
We can play the A-Train, back of the iron horse
Yo man, knahmsayin? Fuck it man

""Niggaz got mad coke inside a Luvs... Luvs Pamper box nigga""
Ya niggaz is stupid
That nigga pussy doin' pig Latin
He can't come to the hood
Might kill him off top up in the Staten
Son think he better than niggaz
I think his rebels is resentful
Tried to kill him in his rental
He had an Idi Amin approach
Hittin the roach, had a hunger face
He drove his mom's 7 in the ocean
He's a wild cowboy slangin' heron
Who rock a dead arm
Knock a DEA agent out his Chevron
All of his Eli's machette'd up stainless
(Sample)
Never heard nothing, all you hear is the guns bangin'
Rockin' pastel blazers with a shorty from Iceland
Who old dad put 'em up on white sand
Starving to make a wack debut he came through the lobby
Three culture Devilles with him, a whitey
This pathetic, braggin' monkey face faggot deaded
Comin' through the stairs with blow in his mouth, desperate
Watchin' him lookin' stupid, son know we on foot patrol
Come through the hole, niggaz is swoopin'
700 shots, all leather gloves, 6 thugs
Two had a mask on, they took 'em off what
We got you now nigga knowin' you down
Niggaz is foul, this is trauma king, by any means baow
They pushed his face in, fell out his Saconies
Snatched his homeys, took his Glock
You gonna be my Tenderonies?
Metal exchanges, the hoods a gun range
Everybody's a target, depending on how you aim
Dice games and ice chains, pennants spellin' your name
OG's settin' the wrong example, tellin' the same
Look at Shorty Shit Stain, grew up to be a fuckin' mess
Before his clique came
He banged and never tucked his chest
Project full of them thangs he caught the gun connect
Ridin' round with A and Lou, Nino when they want respect
Son cold, Nino want to show
Everybody know they straight shippin' hood bitches to the bungalow
Pillow talking led to birds talking
Chattin' bout what happened and when and where they comin' back in
Champagne slackin' traffickin' while they travel
Word got back at old time friends and snakes rattled
Two different 'burbans but the one that dropped the birds got tailed
Information for the ones who light the steel got mill.
Pussy power made the plans sour
Apartment full of party powder outside a stakeout for hours
Click clacks from big gats and rags
Soon as the door squeaks they runnin' up on the grass
BANG FLASH shots right on path, broken glass
Comedy of laughs while they haul ass with the bags
Legends in my hood play back
Twin Benz's whippin' in black
And that was like the old Maybach"

Bloody out, his ear was ripped, they know he loved his music
They poked him twice, his gear was ripped
Ninja style, niggas whipped him with a Benz belt, broke his arm
Crushed his Audemars with whelps
On his face, they was slappin' him, fake ass rapper
Old ass gun, pussy get Tinactin
Medicine face, nigga, they opened his mouth
A few gold fell out, wheel him out
He thinkin' he a gangsta? Quit playin', listenin' to Sid and them
Because he sat up in bed to bid with 'em
Fishcakes, bubblegum shrimps in his Timbs
He had 12 and a half on, only wore 10

All that hard, no damn frame, how you playin'?
Thought you bubble with the big Willies, flyin' in fast cars
And get busy, now he sittin' there lookin' dizzy

Niggas got love his bug
He had on one glove
Rollin' up drugs
Him and his Vikings ran through
Stopped played the back
Then they walked through
Live from New York
When niggas hug you
Gettin' money and laced up
Live from New York
Gettin' reefer to blaze up
Live from New York
Gettin' Niggas to dance
Aiyyo and throw both hands up
Wont pull their pants up
Live from New York
Yo Yo
Madonna money in our pocket
Boating in a rocket
Bout to blast off
We charged like a socket
Whips be cleaner than a fuck
Jewels basically struck
Strait up Brolox style
Layin in the cut
Bottles strictly done
Ring the alarm
Rollie on the arm
Arms crossed two sneakers on
Fly shit
Nikes the majority
NYC state of mind
And we talk with authority
5 borrows is sterile
Still out of town playin' mellow
I thought I seen Shalon swade yelow
Rippin' it
New six flippin' it
Shorty is drip dippin' in it
When she sit through dick in it
Came to conclusions
What's the solution when your losin'
Respect mine
Now from the foul line
Streets is a part of us
Teaching the seeds through the heart of us
Some get locked that's a scar on us"
58,Masters Of Our Fate,2011,Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tang (2011),,Raekwon,"(Sample: Winston Churchill)
Now we are the masters of our fate
That the task which has been set us is not above our strength
That it's pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance
As long as we have faith in our cause and an unconquerable will-power
Salvation will not be denied us
Salvation will not be denied us
Salvation will not be denied us
We are the masters of our fate
Long as we have faith, an unconquerable will-power
Salvation will not be denied us
(Verse 1: Raekwon)
The time has come, I've just begun, this is designer rum
My wallet got flowers on it, kill it cowards
From the land, the stolen land, where gold chains control a man
Three hundred holding hands, stolen grams
I play the phantom, waving,
Leave that nigga for dead, or should I save him
Spitting out phlegm, no, just grave them
I remember days, I used work for niggas, eat jerk with niggas
Buying whip, is laughing and joking, trying to flip
Clip is loyal, fly spoil on the block, display royal
Even though we go back to royals, black oils
Live as ever, can't tell me nothing, whatever
This thing of ours, is empowered by my niggas who pumping
Twenty four hours of slang motion, wave brush
Ya knew my hair was the ocean, running through the building
Just negation, some of the creeps
Knew me very well, knew he would sell, knew he was potent
Now we are the masters of our fate
That the task which has been set us is not above our strength
That it's pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance
As long as we have faith in our cause and an unconquerable will-power
Salvation will not be denied us
(Verse 2: Black Thought)
OK, bridges I burn some, lessons I learn some
Money, I spent some, lent some, earn some
My eyes tell it, tell her the hell I return from
Spark up an L from the homeys I haven't heard from
Burn when the herbs come, I'm living large
Never chilling on the curb, just a villain on the verge, son
My tenth shot is as efficient as the third one
Second one, first one, worse come to worse run
When I was pushed out the womb, the Earth spun
The only way to describe this is inertia
Some rappers think they can try me, who the first up?
I don't guarantee no survivors, niggas, surf's up
Yeah, soul on ice, courage is sacrifice
Hold on tight, and save your laughter for the afterlife
These chumps thinking they good, ain't even half as nice
Your fate'll be a one way ticket to paradise, what?
Now we are the masters of our fate
That the task which has been set us is not above our strength
That it's pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance
As long as we have faith in our cause and an unconquerable will-power
Salvation will not be denied us
Salvation will not be denied us
In the words of the Psalmist
""He shall not be afraid of evil tidings
His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord."""

(Yeah, man, I gotta give you the 411, shit is straight 911, word)
It's $2.50, nigga, back the fuck up! Talk to me...
(Word, them blue ninjas is everywhere
Word, watch ya back, Protect Ya Neck and all that shit, man
Thirty nine motherfuckers already got scooped up
Indicted, word, I'm bird eye viewing it right now
Out there out the motherfucking window)
You got the strong scoopers out there?
(Word, five book store buses out front
All them young boys are certified, they our rentals)
(Chorus 2X: Suga Bang Bang)
For these mean streets from Cali to New York
Who could ya trust? Niggaz they do talk
Running from the feds and out of state troopers
Look up ahead, you know we got sharp shooters
(Raekwon)
The blocks is molded, step up ya sword piece
Moving through them housing with more ki's
Rembrandts is fresh from Scotland, crisp hats, Cristal bottles
Niggaz want the problems, we back
It's time to take over the game, it's nothing
I live on the line, from corner to castles with pawns and capsules
Scramble and find, my money's up, I'm praying for war
I do this all the time, all the time, all the time
Faces of Doom, sling in the lobby
Swinging cooked raw, if you played the field you was not leaving
Fast pace of a CREAM chasing team
Trying to come through the hood and lie, get left for dead naked in Queens
Let them other niggaz wear that, we take the credit
While we was shopping for more Nikes and off-whites
Heroin stirrers, the crib, cracked mirrors
Career thugs who serve only judges and jurors
Got to make my money this year, whether it's through rhyming or criming
I'll be on the line with my iron
Promised them llamas'll fly fast, quick at pirahnas
Trying to intervene, get caught dead, no head in pijamas
You live like a slouch from vouchers
Nobody mad, you was a fake, dead, die with no trousers
Cause you crossed the line like Miller's Crossing
Off with ya dome, I walked you through the woods, we both smoked a bone
(Inspectah Deck)
Mean streets...
Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in
The streets stay flooded with crack rocks and Mac shots
The scenery's money, guerrillas in the back drop
The livest'll pop, the weakest get chopped where they stand
Singing the judge's name, dropped in the stand
Drug money kills, blood on my bills, mud on my Nikes
Only buying with the couple that I trust with my life
Twenty four sev' ducking the feds, infrared with lead
Gamble with off track betting instead
In my hood anybody can get it, and everybody want it
Cutthroat executives, the corners, the office
And the thought is to be boss of all bosses
The cost is ya life, swimming with sharks and orcas
So keep ya guards up, or get scarred up
It's a Cold World, I told you with Allah Just'
The bigger the funds, the bigger the guns that's blazing
It's sick in the slums and niggaz are stunting for nathin'
(Ghostface Killah)
Aiyo, my gun been in more niggaz mouths than a whore had dick
With creamy nuts on the side of her jaw
It's Rigatone, nigga, sliding through airports
Riding on niggaz like MJ, same day I rocked you, comprende?
Yeah, I'm kinda off 'cause my guns was dirty
That last joint that hit you, kid, you made the top thirty
Early, walk with me and strap with a vengeance
More or less Ghostface Killah'll stretch you out like mad words in a sentence
Smell the gas burning (yeah) feel the fire (word)
Real talk, it's not that bullshit from The Wire
It's them disco kids that clap iron
Champion hoods, if ya coke don't freeze, my face is not worth frying
We crack eightballs with pool sticks
Bungee jump off a mountain of bricks
Fuck you up if you slinging those nicks
Toney Starks from the octagon, my ox is on
Snap Matt Hughes' neck with my boxers on"

Then my niggas gon' react and that'll be a problem
Eighty-five thou' gone we got a fuckin' problem
Ain't nobody leavin' alive until we find 'em

Excuse me, Miss, no I ain't havin' it
I smacked him with the four pound, bitch hit the ground
Then I stepped off, dropped out the shit
Equipped with the dipped courdouroy Bailey's with the cream stitch
Powerhouse biscuits that blow roofs off
Rae watch is missin', you take ya boots off
And take off those chaaaaaiiiiiiinnnns
The fat fuck thought I was playin' so I started sprayin
Chicks hit the floor, bottles broke
The owner slid through beefin', duke threw the toast to his throat
We brought the noise like we here to promote
My man don't get his shit in four or five minutes yo we're leavin' with the
Vote
A gangsta's lotto, thirteen bodies and still climbin
Big shotties, bodied when they sniff body
We did our thing too we got to the Envy lobby
Our last four or five shots we see nobody

Eh yo shit got real that night
Power grabbed him, 'Vine smacked him dead in his head
(Oh shit, nigga he got a magnum!)
Yo we all holdin', rollin'
Grab a nigga, search him if he front, fuck it, blow him!
Watchin' niggas foldin
The bartender got a shotgun in his hand
Let off, the wheelchair nigga got him and ran
Surround the Don, full body armor automatically on
The faggots passed off the watch and gone
(Yo y'all niggas ain't searchin' shit!)
Yo where the big mouth at? Niggas step up
Matter of fact nigga, lie the fuck up
Nigga tried to swing on G's but he a gentleman
Son, he dropped the dead arm but failed to see it
Two shot G's pealed his meat {*starts to fade out*}
Let's see, niggas tried to front like my niggas is weak
Corey pulled the truck up, C-4ed this bitch, blew it the fuck up!

Word to the gold panamaras, and to the wood grain in my labo

When niggas catch visions of killing capos
Palestinian armor, golden rocket launcher, my aunt
She copped it from me, bought it in Rwanda
See demons scheming, niggas get live in the Beacon
I'm 'shaw' to 'shank' shit up like Morgan Freeman
Pussy getting rapper, rich nigga, one-on-one rents niggas
And incidents, my fingerprints been tore up

Feds try to tap us and plus clap us, niggas'll grab Bust'
Throw you in the rassle, yo, clap ups

With me, me and Britney, a dancer
Know your shit authentic by the way your hat fit on you, with it

Curtains in the five-seven, chunky and short
Bagging dope up in the backseat, your packages walk

Flow freely this is all graffiti, the cloth I'm cut from
Is straight from a rich nigga genie

Sparking purple once a nigga done spaghetti slurping

We just left Un's, straight up
And we standing over the stoves, in denim Gibaud's
Bought a Dairy Queen in Queens right next to Lowe's
IMAX Theaters, Astoria Waldorf
Philip Drummer suite, pretty young thing sucking my balls off
Bubble baths, hash, zooted up, eyes closed
Silk drawers, fronting in my key lime pie Wall-o's
And I still got a half a key indeed, Frank Lucas shit
Hidden in coffins, flying over seas
And if you ever try to ruin my night
I'm a make sure my best pawn put like three in your kite

Rock of Gibraltar, my pinky joint, killer like Orca
Daytime hawk, a nasty street author
Me, Rae and Rick, Uzi'd out in the Porsche's

(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
You understand? And follow that destiny, follow the light
And it'll set you free
(Oh, G-O-D's my reality)
'Cause I've watched you baby
You my main man
Yeah
(We're elevating strong and we're going on to the highest degree)
Now that could be the Wu-Tang production
Start to knuckle up and, gun shots start to click the block's ducking
Could it be, and would it be, that we was babies
Catching rabies, niggaz seem to act crazy
Day one, in my spot July the 10th
I had a mint, stickin up Devines hittin them with nines
I was toxie, from layin up in Roxie's all night
This nigga bust a shot, lick my man's wife
It was havoc I contact the Abbot
He shook the shoulder though, then he passed the phat chrome automatic
We goin' to war, you know we headed to the floor
He woulda did it for me, fuck it, let's mosie
Schemin dough, with the P.L.O., wrapped on tight
Sayin' in my mic ""Yo we gotta go""
My first impression was to add some lessons
Question, one, what made you even show your gun and blow the session?
He replied and rocked the green eye
And yo, he started, yelling ""Them niggaz sellin two for fives!""
But he's a goner and I got my corner
What, I'm feeding my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters
Yeah, Rae baby
Feeding my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters
Only God is the son of man
(We've got the powers to ressurrect the dead)
I'll say it one time, and be ceratin that fake God does not exist
(Oh, G-O-D's my reality)
(I'm elevating strong we're gonna go on to the highest degree)
This is why the universe, has itself balanced the scale
Of devine knowledge, and it was measured by the portion
Of solid knowledge
No man, can judge for another
But each man must weigh all facts and circumstances
And find truth in his own judgement of righteousness
See, the way to evil, balance equality in no man
For no man is good and bad at the same time
Either you good, or you bad"
67,Once Upon a Time,2003,The Lex Diamond Story (2003),,Raekwon,"(Intro: Raekwon (Tekitha))
Chill, nigga, chill.
Get some rest, man, come on, man
Stop playin' wit' me, man
(Oh oh oh)
(Chorus: Tekitha)
Lately... I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately... you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another
(Raekwon)
Broke the top of goose-down sheets, kissed her on the neck
Real love, hope this ain't the last time we meet
Felt like a King who had a Queen want him
I usually deserve hotels, this one's the gift, slick
On our eye-to-eye contact, body movement, all on the grind
A lady's starin' at me, all in my mind
Sayin', ""Boo, I gotta live with you, let's connect and be a bridge""
You stay three forths and I'ma wiz you
(Tekitha)
Months ago... you came to me
Told me... love me forever
See... time has passed... and lonely days
Have rid his head now... stormy weather
But out of the rain... came some delight
I ain't ashamed... I know that it's right
The way that I'm feelin'..
He touches me... in ways I like
Says things you won't... won't day or night
Givin' me healin... I'm leavin'
'Cause you wanted to know... that is the reason
(Tekitha)
The only set back in my state of grace
Is that... the love is real... for you and him
In different ways... and.
You're out in space... yes here on Earth it's fun to play
I wish you were present so my love wouldn't go astray
And he gives what I need.
Quenches my thirst when you say ""Girl, please""
That's a waste of my breath
It's funny to me... that you get upset
And I told you quite often
I'ma fill up the space... did ya think I was talkin'
Out the side of my neck...
You left me alone, what did you expect?
(Raekwon)
I'm dead in my sleep, she's standin' over the kid
I'm terrified, shorty was deep
I had my hand in her account plus livin' in a lab
Like a Count, I had to go six shorties was pink yo
She had the yolk on me that's when I went broke
We used to flip coke together, get boasted and float
We split real bread, we was large
We had our weddin' in the garage
And then she stopped reviewin' my bars
Hold up
(Tekitha)
Heeeeeey... yeah
Forever... oh bbbbaaaaaaabbbbbbbby
Oh yyyyyooooouuuuuu yyyyyyyyyyoooooooouuuuu

Six degrees all the way to the black Lee's, the mac squeeze
Catch you in the open, click-clack, pass the keys, homey
Moving through the town, we there, out of towners get the stare down
Clap you for your blue Nike air's
You a wild comrade, well I'm a wilder one
We've been pumping crack since nine, I run foul with a pile of sons
Moving through the city getting thousands
Digging them wallets, slide in to Olive Garden, wilding
Fourty cal's and eagles, buying teeth, gleamy on the set
Fly to Union Square, we legal, pussy niggaz jet
The old code better blow to the death, get ya niggaz out the yard
No behind bars, we buying niggaz jets
It's just a movement that came right out of a blueprint
Two bents, this is how real we gotta roll, think Cuban hit
This is how a general remains, always be a soldier, don't tell
When real niggaz die in reign, while we come blow shit now
Moving in them fly roses, it's all old to us, dick, rubbing our noses
I should of bought my momma a plane, matter fact
Two helicopters and a motherfucking chain that stay built
Your son is your man, let him do what he provides for you
Buy you some land, ride for you
Jet to the highest estate, cake out and just bling on it
(Outro: Raekwon)
Yeah, lord, that's what I'm talking bout family
Word up, we need like, forty more of them, lord
And we gon' just let you get in, youknowhatimsayin?
You know you that nigga, Daddy-O, youknowhatimean?

Hug your right hand, jumped off the plane, kissed the white man
A steady act, curly hair, chubby, fly mustache nigga
Money was long, and plush hat, shit cost nine thousand
Picture me in the housing, serving much crack
Cat look at me, I'm real, lobbin' on the field
For real, I shot niggas shakin' their hands, I'm ill
Damn, one of them business man's
I just seen 'em murk a nigga, but he jerked him at the same time
(That's fam... (Polite: oh shit))
(Raekwon)
That's fam, one of those Columbians who got money
One of those niggas might try to get up on me
Yo, damn, I need to eat, and I'm a man
I'm a stand up, nigga, I'mma handle when I'm makin' my plan
Pop, I'll take two hundred bricks, hit me
One helicopter had the super bungalo with the van
All ill technology to watch if I ran, he only gave me
Woody gave sixty eight other black man's

Now... if Pa-Blow would've kept it gangsta
None of this shit would've never happened
(Raekwon)
Now the DEA was on his ass
Slick Saucony's on, big homey takin' a blast or somethin'
Handsome big niggas around him
Surroundin' him with big glasses on, drinkin' on lances, fam
Most them niggas fastin'
'Cause when he fed niggas after that, pussy and grass
Had made backs, eight labs, his date was Miss Mass-
Achusetts, Cap eatin' fruit, tongue in his ass
You can't fuck with the cartel, you barked at it
Jabbed her and shot her in the back, I can't stand the bird
Word to furs, I need big wizes
He looked at me, ""Huh, exactly, Chef go after big bitches""
Frozen burner henchman, flash the great
Lookin' nine on me, rhinestones, no, them shits is dime stones
Hold a million dollar pound, bust something, don't trust nothin'
I'm in shock, starin' it down
(Interlude: Polite)
Now... here's where this shit gets crazy!
(Raekwon)
The killas increase, he fell, but
Maybe a little bit, the Mediene Cartel will fail
Diego his horse, with George Young
Yo, will argue over large sales, hittin' Cuba with lumps, yeah
Call them niggas drug barons, eighty billion workers sniff
Gettin' lift ownin' Miami yo
Flips got bigger, makin' more trails
Set it out of nowhere when coppin' a jail, I'm eatin' fresh veal
Pa-Blow, the largest nigga involved
The arsenal will have sixty three hundred murders
Livin' in apartments, wild he violated flight a Bianca
Took two hundred niggas down but two men houndin' him
The fuckin' cockroches posin' the on six million dollars sold
We're eatin' enchilada, goat cheese pasta
Yeah we're drippin' it with more salsa
And then they rushed in, found him on the roof dead in his boxers
But it wasn't him.

The watch she had was Bulgari, golden, Spanish kid let him hold it
He said he hit him with three cartons of menthol, the kid let him roll with it

Now he's acting like he ain't rich and po' in it)
Crock pots are steaming, Jasmine rice and Jack Mack
With cornflake batter, it's cold in here
10:45 we lock in, pull out the headphones, jump in the bunk

Two C.O.'s is on the cat walk (Yo, Spoons, what's popping?)
Yo, it ain't nothing, baby, you cool?
Yeah, I'm getting that rest, you know that G.E.D. shit with the school?

Mop wringer magic, mess hall murder's the best
Come through the yard, getting fed lead burgers
Testing anything with bling
Fresh sneakers, we the best teachers
True, watch me move in the cling
Six A.M., the cells unlock
Horn the child, I'm half sleep, yo, hearing the pots
I see the same ice grills, bum niggaz talking to me
With coal in they eye, I can't finish my meal

Then Spoon had left, we got guns though, we trying to chill
Big Will walked in, him and Seville

Pit bull fights, niggaz is bustin' the lights
Undercovers gettin' killed for drugs - yo
Fiends is basin, runners is licensed to fight
Young gangstas chase sneakers and snubs - and yo
Elevator's broken, pissy stairwells and shells
Old men gossip with tales, you know?
Police burners with bodies on 'em, bury 'em
Worry for minutes then we fire them (blaow!)
I see firemen, ambulances, narcotic mansions
So melodic, rock chronic, pop tonic scramblin
See all these niggaz into gamblin - yo
Just give me square feet, uniquely I'm handlin niggaz
Done danced with niggaz, plus yo, threw niggaz in vans
Left him on trains, his veins got ham in 'em
Take a message, he ran, it was a quarter to four plan
He had me on the floor with my man
We both drugged out, scholars with grams
Tri-colored rocks, follow the hands, full sorrow in plans
Make one false move you blam
Eh yo take the globe right out of ya land
We broke out in Iran.
(Chorus: Polite)
Eh yo it's eight million stories in the city
Niggas actin' shifty, Ice Water back on the grizzly
Brand new handgun that hold about fifty
It's a new boss in town like Mauseberg Mickey
Eight million stories and six is from the hood
A real live hustler up to no good
They needed more yae-yo to ease they habit
They said we fell off, the streets don't believe you faggots!
(Raekwon)
Where all the wolves live, sub-machine guns and big beamers
Yo circle the crib, you see teamsters that try you again
Little niggas is blind, the nines fly out and slap a few men
That's mine, let up off 'em again
Take seventy more shots, the remedy, Wu through the fence
This bench God, lays in gents
Eh yo pop the head off right under the tents
This is more current events, pay attenti
The legend is here, as long as you know him he coffins ya men
What? Bulletproof pimps, big hammers, multiple flips
As long as it's bread, you know you was hit
Eh yo let that stack get rinsed
Play the back, sharp as a fuck, ownin' my own shit
Grown niggas get moments to vent
Give 'em the real Lex Diamond Story, welcome 'em in"

You more frauds, you see? I'ma live bossy
Way out on Fantasy Island with Mr. Roth, B
I gotta play the ghetto, everyday the hood endorse me (Q.B.)
I'm destined for triple, left hand crook and the right hand fury
Will block the shots, that's simple, I dented a tomb for style
A toast to the death of my foes, respect violence, the criminal codes
Hammer smack a nigga out his five senses
Leave him dumb, deaf and blind, I ride on rinses
Interest so tight, strobe lights follow my grace
Bang bullets by the gates, might hollow ya face
Me and Chef smark massive murder, kill 'em!
I scramble anywhere in Shaolin, right in Castalano buildin'

White tee on, a light G. on

Money too long, the case won't stick

Tough guys and all that but I know that you pay

Come up, pluck niggas, pop niggas in chucks, it's business
You in this? We non-shoulder style, son, relentless

Bust off quick, and then, guns go back

Waiting on these raw teats takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay thee
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship
Many heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now, talk, shit, nigga, what??
It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane
Insane...
Past sunlight, more gunfight
...Time to get the feeling, word up
What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes
The beat breaks, cause all my niggaz to break son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once though the mind stays infinite
Travel in the church, nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and macs
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu son, and maintain it's all real,
Starvin individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats, cats and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-ville
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keepin' my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, layin in mountains countin'
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill Dunn, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to Tims ten ways, Wu blends
Now I'm starin' you, the true buckle up, now who's a legend?
It's raining, he's changing
Word up Dunn
It's raining, he's changing
Peace to Philly, VA, these days
My man is going insane
Word up y'all
My man is going insane
Word up
Insane
The sun moon and stars
Fly cars, word up y'all
No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life
Street life
No cash flow, no more dough
He's someone I don't even know
Someone I don't know
Rainy Dayz...
Gettin' through those rainy dayz
Gettin' through those rainy dayz
Gettin' through those rainy dayz
Gettin' through those rainy dayz
I lost him to the street life

I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done, give me my ten G coat
To perform another song, 'cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up, the scene I wet
I like to stand in the crowd, and watch niggas wonder
Damn, then think about, then you wonder
Clan, they just rag shit, rip shit, bruise shit
Maybe that's the rap shit, I gotta prove shit
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
Now flip the beat up, convert it to a hip hop joint
Write a rhyme and graffiti in, every show you see me in
Deep concentration, swift like the beamer, kid
Go with the crowd, while my lyrics spit flames
I flow-tate the vowel, 'cause it's all in my veins
Another remedy, fly niggas is enemy
'Cause I'm live as some rap niggas with energy
Now do it, 'cause I'mma put the nine on pause
My sharks beaming, catch you on the side of the store
Call your bluff, make you stare in my face, ya team suck
Remember me? The one you got your ideas from
How soon you start to suffer, until you get stuck up
When you start to fuck up, that's when you get bucked up
Bitin me, you think you dope, I smash your boat, with bad coke
You should of wrote, because I ain't no joke
(Chorus 2X: Ultra)
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have let you
Without a re-up to connect to
Think of all the weak product you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
(Raekwon)
I was a fiend, before I was seventeen
I melt the microphone like blowing some evergreen
It's all in the making, from where hip hop was originated
Peace to the streets, the bubblers, mark and dated
'Cause I grab the mic, now I say ""yes y'all""
Y'all yell 'scrape it', then I'mma say 'let's ball'
Come on, cool, 'cause I'mma get on rep
Twist a 'dro on the speaker, pull the snub and then flex
Back to them crabs, y'all niggas had y'all laughs
And then I spaz on the rhymes I splashed
From back to your brother gun, then I grab the double pump
Then this the opposite, and ask if another come
'Cause I'mma get busy, get dough with my team, yup
I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, rip up the stage and don't it amazing
'Cause every line is laid in
Caught up, thoughts are sort a, an addiction
Bags of pies, smell of bricks, kid
Vocals vocabulary, the stage is a suction
The mic is a draino, volcanos erupting
Lines overblowing, gradually glowing
Every thing is written in the cold, slick and coin'
Slide... my thoughts'll glide
Forty-eight MAC's and knives

Spread the word, 'cause it's on

Moving through the town, with brown on us
Clowns don't love us, discussed and ropes on
The oath, the big mold bread, the stages is red
You never reapproach, bulletproof down in diesel shit
Lethal with the pen, the sequel, bitch
Rich will deceive you, flying at 90, the boss
Red Porsche, this the time when I get mine
I rhyme till I'm hoarse, good weather, caught in the cross
Break porcelain when I rap, it's only right
I flash on the source, extra my curriculars major
Register this, we miss you will die later
Caught in a bliss, this stormy weather winter hat
Moving in with Benz jackets and action
This is all about who get endorsed
This for stabbers, night time paper Mick Jaggers
Jag Benz Maybach braggers, caught up in the sport
Speak French and eat with the chimps, the underground academy
I rap rapidly and clap at the pimps
One shot'll blow a hostile's wig off
Me crafted by the mobsters, Vatican's blast ya shit off
I'm caught up in the level of largeness
Chef Oliver, a denny boy, getting money, we mob kids
Pushing through Paris, lavish lifestyle with no marriage

I started it, you need to just pass me the chain
Don't give me that ""I respect your work"" bullshit
I shot the same game, shot niggaz in planes and stole niggaz wizzes
Yo, that's my ninjas, catching bodies a hobby
Sit back, doola hits, more, listen
Twisting, wrist glisten, slang lord, handle my position
Is to sit back, and kill all fake niggaz

Jumped out big nines and some hard bottles
Eyes of hate finally meeting up wid the stakes
It was who I thought it was

Wit the hardbottom nigga wid the snub
Cocked it, where rock at, stop that
Violate this cipher pa we'll definitely strike back
All of us right there slight fear in our heart
Blink we take it right there
Doing our thing apart
Broad jumped out tryin' to run shit
Spoken loud words all we want is his head
He did some dumb shit
Beef from Miami now
Damn yo big head Lance in some wild shit
Noodles caught the stair down
Now it came back to me yo
Handle it wise and brutally yo

And where I'm from it's even Guns 'N' Roses
And fuck with me you need a bunch of roses
And Lord knows I keep the Led Zeppelin
A nigga front and then we bag wrestle
And you can tell them bitches feel at ease
We got that white girl, nigga Cheryl E

Dust blunts with heroin, servin' up Steak'ems

Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze""
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting parmagane cheese
And I won't stop moving till the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me

To learn our Wu-Tang sword fighting
The Shaolin would never do that
Wouldn't you?
The Shaolin have always looked down on us
Are you afraid the Wu-Tang would become more famous than you?
You?
So you used your Shaolin poison
To set up my master and deliberately frame me
That's nonsense
It's not nonsense, I saw it myself
Nonsense
The Shaolin have nothing to fear from the Wu-Tang
But our sword fight
Yo, aiyo
Villagers, gangstas, pillagers, paintbrush
New whips, blue fifths, Louis Shallah, shit
Ostrich turtlenecks, the Chef already reps
Lean off the petty jets, we buy the very best

One bump, two lumps, a shotgun, a new jumps
With flying bird, buying herb, new kick, designer birds

Jake's hate it, Rae made it, clientele, we gon' sell
You gon' starve, he gon' jail, night boots, swim with whales
Better snub, surgical leather gloves, never loved
We gon' kill, take it to the Hill, we forever real
Old records, old luggage, you ill with no budget
You shoot and we spray, kill off them old buzzards
We love it, can't stand it, you read, the Wu Manual
We found it, stay grounded, we will, we still scrambling
Hey, hey, hold your fire, stop
You two traitors, you've mixed the Shaolin and Wu-Tang
No, we have not, it's just that they're the same
That's right, my Lord, you misunderstand our Kung-Fu work
It doesn't belong to anybody, it evolves
Kill 'em

The jaw twister, open the vault, call your sister
Pyrex her up in the file, live as Twister
Blunt rolling, only a robe on, some whiskers
Knee slapper, the gat packer, black jacker
Extortionist, friendly as shit, Bob and Back-lur
Ones folder over the stove, gold rover
The gear dresser, the chop bagger, Marvin Haggler
Rap stabber, eat you alive, gold tarantula
Sixteen paces and blow, hold the heckler

Out in Egypt with the wrists of fury
Spanking bracelet, rocking Asics

At the U.S. Open with my whole len, slapping up fifty scramblers
Niggas said the II was classic, a lot of crack is in the game, yo
But your shit is the only 'lastic
C.R.E.A.M. rap, militant flow, combination with Swahilian dough
Guaranteed we do'se that, in the beast like pizzas

Traveling the continents with confidence

Suited up, smelling like Fahrenheit with jeans on
Knock the rice out a wedding, come and get your bling on
Next winter we in Allah cabins, small baggage, more savage
Central Park killas, that equals more stabbings
You read the papers, more horrors like Amityville
Profanity kills, you like lint on a raggety silk
We rock bulls, rock jewels, you heard the interludes
Blow up beds in a fifty yard swimming pool
Jumping out of planes for dough, Gucci parachutes
Abdul Raheem written across is the attribute
Suede loafers, 'Lo scarves, my little grandson want
The 20-10 Mercedes-Benz go kart
So he can pull out the lollipop keys on 'em
His pops'll push the Bugatti drop V on 'em

Better shoot something, if not, niggas won't salute nothing

Corner filled chains and Gucci glasses
The was the era when we flipped all the shh, on the store, splashed it
Had Dominicans runnin' and eatin' steak and cheese sandwiches
They in the back, braggin', the fifth slut
Fuckin' with a few niggas nieces, take it back when we would
Rock for a leases and stand on the speakers
I got the shit locked, I'll battle you, you, you and your whole gridlocked
Little shit, supported the beef
Fly Pierre couldn't tell me nothin' with a brand new beard
Couldn't wait, but kept survivin' the years
We sold crack daily, crack mad bailey's, crack faces and skulls
Sit back, watchin' the mack, twist carefully
It was them horrifyin' times, spit dimes
Police sneak up, I hope he know the time, get mine
Just livin' the ghettos, where we suppose stand loyal
But the game'll get you trapped when it's time, yo

Crack was what's in it, the vehicles was 1-90's
Young shorties be gettin' their bread, haunted by Jamaicans
Them niggas had their corners on red
Map the laws, runnin' cards, playin' bars
Mask the coke in the cars, twist the gan', mad, crackin' cigars
Smokin' through Queens, bitches stealin' Guess jeans
Get the scope on our stars, little did we know, we folow they dreams
Now we get around in live limosines, flash stacks in cuisines
Combat, get to smackin' the fiends, just max for a minute and lean
All the shit for the moment, slick omens, my opponents would scheme
We were shot downtown, hit trains, buy cables and remain
The illest villains, walkin' in spots
Playin' the corners, baby, vision or not
Said yo, and when it's on, we gon' rep and rock, nobody call the cops

Where all the major swingers, yo
Where all the live fresh, came home, up state livin' fly rangers
We rep them niggas and we love 'em
Sons, we hug 'em, they make it home and be gone in a week
That's some letters, all my niggas live together
Baby yellin' whatever, we all write in hands, nothin' but creeps
Hold me down, love, I'll hold you fatter
Watch me catch both of these actors, it's Ice Water throwin' hits in the cling
Bloodhounds is on you, goons is beamin'
Take it to the team to team, plot thing, blew you a bean
It's just a young poor hustlers thing

From which all kung-fu springs

I met him by Snake Pond, my hand on the flamer, my bomb
I park, Rae, Ghost, then lit up the bong
It's nightfall, nothing here, nothing to fear
Just got things to touch on, then he walked up weird
Walked in frail as stale, his eyes were soft
His face was pale, I looked at him kneel
Just wanna talk, you a deer, starting chasing him
He jumped in the tree, had grass in his ear
I'm a kill you nigga, you gonna have to come down
Little did he know I was a leader, a full bred eater
Jump in new V's, shopping, had the fever
Next stop Starbucks and Spiegels, Jags had diesel
Then she walked in, fly little diva
Niggas on the scheme for you gleam, they come from your school
A bunch of snake bites, they bitch smacked Shareen
She slid in the '09 Beemer, with that sex whore Sabrina
Fortune checks, live in Medina
Thanks for the info, my kinfolk, listen, Ms. Window
With the big pimple on her temple
Any more knowledge is college, you gave enough to be bounced now
She shot up in Chipotle, don't quote me
917, 646, you know it's war, bitch,
Can't dress for nothing, she fronting
Took a piss, roll up, let's twist, pulled down my pants
Good look, and shot through her tits
Now I gotta picture who I'm looking for, fake ass Brooklyn boy
I know his fucking family, fuck 'em all
I used to love brothers, now I hate 'em
Mostly them gator boys, who stunting and they never seen Nathan
Me and my real soldiers who started it, won't play part of it
But I'm a get to the bottom, I got 'em
Newspapers saying they shot 'em, but on the low
I heard he shot himself
A trip, yo, the poison me, I come from the poison peas
Where mothers run old nightclubs with tons of ki

And terrors on fat shit clique they rock Lo sweaters

Call him up on the strength of the Wu
And watch me game, yo grab the cell

At the end of the week, I'm buyin you a L

Cousin had me laced out, skeed all outta my face
We gon' get dat cruchy chump for all of his lump
Don't try to front, you was sweatin this Hilfidiger
Guess who walked in - Abbott and his man from Farragut
Confront him wit the Ruger on his back, walk in black
Where's your man, where's the sky blue Land at?
Stop playin' Wu in the back, smacked him wit the gat
(Yo, money said he be here in fifteen!)
Stop lyin', wait for the Millennia green to pull up
He got the Donna Karen shit on, two rings
Six carats a piece plus the chain swing
Like anchors on ships flooded wit all diamond chips
Back pockets: two clips - four-fifths wit rubber grips
Layin, two bottles of brass I was slayin
Meditatin, red dot be waitin for my payment
Heard the key in the lock, cocked the glock
Turn the lights out, dip behind the couch
Kion, gag his mouth
Infra-redded his head when he entered
But a soft Perry Ellis leather with Dorinda
A friend of, Kion's wife, Kenya, the bitch larger than life
Yo, shorty be fuckin' mad Columbian niggaz
Fuck it, get on the floor meet the black Lex Luthor
Stripped fast, the bitch had on Claiborne drawers
Yo Rae, you about to scrape her, chill Ghost

Foul and fucked up, niggas know I spit ugly
Jewelry trucked up, niggas know they can't fuck with me
If you my target, you probably wouldn't wanna be 'em
My legacy royal with statues in a museum
With numerous artifacts, hanging in the mosoleum
Type living room setting is bigger than the land of freedom
I'm parked on the corner, while pretty bitches holla ""hello""
I'm another breed, different species from you fellows
Technically, it's kinetic, I'm genetically better
I'm something you will never see, far as you can remember
My buzz exceding rapidly, no matter how it's measured
Like an unstoppable machine in the Mohabi Desert
So hungry I smell it, success up in my after taste
Still spit till it's painful, despite the money in the safe
I see you resentful, stay up in your place
And while they be morning your death, we in a State of Grace
Designing, I'm perfect with timing, take it back to Rucker
RZA, it's hard to stop rhyming on this muthafucka!

CREAM vanquish, my queen keeps it's stainless
Cracks and Brussels, screwing everything famous
Love to hustle, my ring, call it big Uranus
Cats that scuffle, crawl on you and break fingers
That's what's up, you saw me and them Lone Rangers
Me and my homey, we bought like forty things up
Long as you owe me, you won't get a damn thing, son
Shoot off your kangol, while you in the plane, fronting
Stop, admirin' me, y'all should of fired me
'Cause when I come back, it's me and my diary
None of that bullshit, few men got tired of me
My niggas is wrong, they hated, and they lied to me
Explain the saga, fuck yo, your chain liver
Fuck the blinging, have my money by five, to me
Y'all 'pose to bring it, fuck you and your whole variety
I'm bringing my hammers, I beat it like, five to three
(Chorus: Raekwon)
Jealous ass niggas can't see they man prosper
They'd rather see me in a broke down fuckin' Mazda
Don't disrespect me, son, you will get popped up
My resume's off the hook, now, check mi casa
Yeah, call it, what you wanna call it
My bread is larger, nigga, you can never spoil it
Thought you was loyal, now a nigga can't support you
Blastin' you up, and off me, now you look rewarded

Bloody ya blazer, take all your man cush weed
Yeah, I'm coming just to claim a title
Rap is boring, niggas need another idol
When I'm gone, just let off like forty rifles
Aiming at rappers, biting off the God's bible
I destroy you, lyrically, I spit oil
This is war, you can never escape, conio
Y'all some lamesters, never seen a yard soiled
When it's on, now we gon' see who's loyal
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, yo, we get it from you
Place that crown in the garbage, or you sitting on
A few things mattered, you was just a corner don

Long chain hatchet flooded up, you knew that
Baby blue mack, stones on the nozzle stick
Bulletproof brocco's with the Jew bitches, all I got is two cracks
Gazelle lenses, clear rude wraps, bagging every ziplock

My life is all in your soul, daily, since nana left us
She took all of your blessings, 'cause she been there
My life change, yo, could never though be without you, yo
It's strange when I want it to rain
On my best friend's grooming, we all had visions of you
We broke nights, God, knowing you cared
Peace, nigga, only for a minute and I'mma break out
Come back and kiss you on your feet, here
I love my hood, I love my niggaz, there, yo
The older we get, we understand, you might tear
(Chorus w/ ad-libs)
(Raekwon)
You keep the little young ones, happy, true
Graduations occurred, you look so pretty and new
Look at the sky, all blue, all old people with you
Facilities mailing, jail brothers miss you
Wow, it gets crazy when I think about the money you made me
Slipped me away, but Jakes tried to rade me
Nighshifts, smokin' on spliffs, you kept yellin'
""Carry your fifth, the down the block niggaz is gay""
They keep police invadin' your space, we can't live
Plus, they gassin' the mayor, them niggaz wanna give you away
We won't have that, suburban people mad at the fact
That you be gettin' more company then them, they just be scared of that
""Hood"", look at your name, spell it backwards
Yo, ""Dooh"", that's what they yellin' in vain
You the realest, the most livest, flyest, you part of life
I gotta give you love, 'cause you gave it God and life

Who ever said you ain't do right by me, they frontin', yo
They couldn't understand that we was a team
I used to come out, hear you words, talk to me, walk with me, brother
Cool, try to be successful and dream
The city lights is on, now, they wanna turn 'em off
Try'nna start some shit, actin' like you never made a penny for 'em
Dun, they doin' you dirty, we had Summer Youth for that, though
No need to cry, never get worried
You gon' live forever, word to mother
'Cause she raised you right, and you got fifty-one brothers
I sat with the trees and had conversations at bees
We talked about throwin' money up, landscapin' your knees
You forget that, something to talk about
Show me where to take the check, pay these suckas off and be out
The'll never be another place, everybody happy to see
That's why I keep coming back to you, peace

Yeah, word, similar story, you know?
Regardless, we all ninjas, and got money,
But the theme of the story
Is yo, checking how they came for me
(This is it, B)
Kinda brief from the gold teeth era,
Bro dreaming on C.R.E.A.M.
Complimentaries and beef
I'm from the wild side, a militant was made by the foremost elite
It sound good, brung my rifle shit, clean
Met the others, lit a blunt, begin
I'm like Nicole Kidman in the wind, niggas is wild, niggas is eat
Then I chanced it, blood can always beat mud
Mud is part of being thug, I guess it's advance, we from the street
This is me, I'm ready to beat, whatever, we gon' off' it
One time alone, yo, they pricked up Unique
Meth standing there, rare hustler hair, right in front of the building
Them niggas do them killings out there
This is deep, me, Rebel, U-G, he walked in the room
Scarf rap, pair of Timberlands, beat
This the potion, roll the scroll out, speaked and another walked in
Knowing now this is a thief
We from the same voc's, this is like a pot roast
Hottest niggas who rhyme, I know them from the time,
This is not 'posed to happen
Peace Black, we wasn't cool
Threw the piece back, everything good, I lit the leaf, captain
Got a mission, to make sure the world recognize our position
I'm standing near the kitchen
Shit just might work, I lit the stink, this could be the realest shit
This could be the realest flip quick
Everybody stand up in militant, army jackets down
I said to myself, this the realest clique
True champ, we gon' rep it through, keep it cool
No boot camp, no hard work, just some loot, family
All in, ball till you fall, loyal as ever
I grab my leather, I'm a lay till you call

Caught up on the ropes, let's team it
Everybody seen it, Zenith, what you mean?

When we came a long way and shit, man?
(No question)
Supposed to be blessin each other on our physical days and shit
Yaknowimsayin, it's like basically
I wanna hit my family wit like land and all that
Diamonds and all that, we ran through that chamber dunn
Mainly stack mine, indeed it's been a long time
Let me feed y'all, fruits of life, shut up and eat y'all
Flavors for neighbors, Wallee's down to gators
The whole configuration stackin paper
Yo we do this, on the low though
If so, we runnin' John dolo
First thing, you need if you don't know
We carry 'cause it's a real world, show and prove
In ill words, all my herbs know the slurge
Dress nasty like fuck, keep my bird on the job yo
You got to straighten up, do the worst thing to hurt her heart, damn
Took care of that, shared, even shed a tear for that
Bust my gat to throw gear on her back
Damn son, why she takin' you through that?
She's a part of me, pardon me flow Allah, we sworn we
Wisin up, take care of home bases
Then we slide to another part and start more hatred
Life is sacred
The other side of that paw, you lie naked
Clothes in the box, go 'head take it
Flash back Jew status, salute moms and get ya boots splattered
Batting average, ya moms had it
Just a broke young dumb, full of cum
Ready to haunt something, takes something of yours
Here you want something
Growing up around fifteen
Watchin how the big niggas rollin' wit big cream, big schemes
Quick to flash ya gat, laser beam
Pool table action black, hundred stacks made my niggas leave
Some be sayin' ""Let 'em breathe""
The others wanna deceive, how we gonna make it if we don't achieve?
Right now, catch it from a vertical degree yo
We startin showin our asses, committing burgularies
One got caught, threw us all off
Threw us in the hell section near the boardwalk
Wonderin how the sword talk
Did he fall off? Did he stand like the hawk that he was in New York?
Kept the waves spinnin on the cross, of course
Come back a little cutty endorse
Risked it for his kids the pain is lost
We sittin' back on a better note
Yellin' ""Peace god, I love you love you to death, you thoroughbredable""
The Robbin Hood of the hood
Sit back, it's all good, won't spoil it if we call it, we all hood
Ha ha

I make knowledge born to save self, you know?
Who gon' live it, gon' live it
Be is to be a born, knawmean?
Soaked in degrees of knowledge, polished by sun rays
Carving by nine swordsmen to a needle point of perfection
It's a blessing to deliver this lesson
While travellin the planet, extending development
And vote for the mind, never ended
We now send it long winded, descended
Infital, Bobby Digital, Abbot of the Shaolin now
Wit knowledge and wisdom
The original sword style begin, birth of the Wu-Tang Clan"

Fucked up New York Yankee hats on fronting
Niggas know Cuban Linx when they hear it nigga
Huh... I'm the muthafucking Ali of the game, bitch
When I sat back and crafted Cuban, it was a classic
When you told me you had giant beef, we brought the hatchet
What it is niggas, gangstas that live in the grizz'
Play the kitchen, coke bagging, this the life that we is
What it is, daddy, slow heart stepping, plus repping
Blinging necking, our fucking regime, protect it
That's right faggots, turning into actresses
Niggas is soft, wack, and broke, what packages?
Yeah, yeah-yeah, call it how I see it, this is all metamorphic
Awkard, walk with the four-fifth
This is all crack money, cli-clack, move back homey
You will get a quick slap, we rap, not now money
What up, what up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces
Stay on the end, with dip dodge, play the yard chasing
Paper, this is like everyday street caper
Me flying offa ya face, yo, you can eat later

Wth the long chains on, my nigga, you know we heavyweights
Feds latch on us, we catch amnesias
We rich, stay clean, looking, rocking dark caesers
Nigga Chef back, wood back, he in the good Ac'
What's hood, me in your hood, we got the good crack
Don't violate me, I hate, I'm like Star and Buc
In the morning, I'm mourning, wild on the fake, yo
Stay dropping bracelets, cases of Cryst' and Cru'
Don't even move duke, take off your shoes
We hardbody action packed, keep a baboon
The jewels is back, with strappers on, come take it
Shoebox with nothing but hash, alotta old ass

It's like a cycle; niggaz come home, some'll go in,
Do a bullet, come back, do tha same shit again.
From tha womb to tha tomb, presume tha unpredictable.
Guns salute life, rapidly, that's tha ritual.
Perhaps bullets bust niggaz discuss mad money
True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes
Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
Pyrex pots, we break, fiends lickin' plates
In the building niggaz building, like little children starin'
Them older niggaz ain't carin
Sirens circlin fiends are lurkin in your baggage
Oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage
In the woodwork, crack cells bubble like Woolworth's
In the projects, richest niggaz rockin' all the real worth
Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
Tradin in they Lexus' GS's sendin messages
Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour
Gun wars my crew phantom like swords
With the green leathers, hunded pound snakes and cakes
Fiends found in lakes, jeolously Jakes we shake
What I strive for is what I live for
Infatuated by material things, and it's wild like for war
Like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold
Future stacks yo I hold
Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox
Don't keep jack in my lap, don't wanna see Tupac
Got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks
Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops Bad Tony and the ball drop
In the Now, I'm bangin' niggaz for slide time
Hurry up Duke I'm next, show 'em mine

Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindlin
New jacks surrenderin, come home not rememberin
Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
Lookin' gay in the yard, and you got hurt
Flashbacks, of the day room, mop ringer style
Your faggot ass got bashed tryin' to turn the dial
You told your boo you was whylin
Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin
High class cooks, throw on vestes out of phone books
Infirmary niggas are screaming, ""I got drugs!""
Sharpen toothbrushes 190 mixed with baby oil and shit

Your master must be an ignorant idiot as well!
(Uncle Ricky, would you read us a bedtime story?)
Nah kid, but I'mma give you one them old Raekwon crime joints
Feel me? We will, we will...
We will, we will - here we go
Well it was late one night, walking through the park
With my leathered down coat and wallabee Clarks
Getting my step on, big shit, big six, big wrist
So much excitement in the air, I was crisp
Money suitcase, Louis joint (yo, Rae, I'mma get some shit just like yours!)
Go make it happen, black God and get rich
Saw the D's fly by, in a New Yorker, yup, tints and shit
They made a right on me, them last two dicks
Know I seen 'em, Max loaded, jog right back to the car
They spun around again and blast they shits
I dropped a Backwood, a puff and then a 6-4-5
You'se a live nigga, you almost smashed yo shit
I'mma don my way out the bitch, moving through the car
Nice and slow, two hoodies on and a golden pit
Nigga had a white eye, they both blacked down
What's the clown shit for? The dog jumped in the whip
It was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze)
I told the Chef Raekwon, pump the breaks
Slow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates
Release the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead
Then the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said
""Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car""
""Put your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar""
He was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher
On top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell
Of his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell
Beef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth
That was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs
Same cops known for exorting pimps and booking whores
Aimed glocks at me and Rae, 'cause they was looking for
A few MC's wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen, wearing long minks and snakeskins
We will, we will, rob you
We will, we will, glock you
We will, we will, what? who? (not you)
Here we go...
You know my Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta
With stamina, peace to Chef, Mr. Meth
Move it on your left, with the Iron Lung breath
Ghostface Kill', U-G ill
Deck so real, Dr. Ason Unique, the medic
Ah, Allah Just, The Abbott, y'all niggas can't forget it
You might catch a Cap if your shit ain't Street
Allah Mathematics make the cypher complete
See knowledge is the foundation of existence
To know starts the spark of the flow
Wisdom activation of the Nation moving
Wise words, show and prove or understand the 13 letters
And the Masta, culture be the way of life
Freedom is reward, who will pay the price for the power
Spending hour after hour, preparing his self
For the hour, now look how refined
When the mind and body is one, every part of me
Supreme equality, manifest the nature of self
G-O-D, now build and add on to the truth
Destroy the bullshit, born incomplete"
109,What's Goin' On,2006,"The Da Vinci Code Vatican Mixtape, Volume 2 (2006)",,Raekwon,"Days that fly through the mist, so young and so rich
Powerful minds, the lines get intense
Wall to wall, cats in hell, so many trapped lost
Some will prevail and get clapped off in jail
Families mentally dyin', the roads is narrow
Jump out, bow and arrow, hit you with science
Huh, we've been livin' this daily
The wiz know what it is, that's why the vision is more clearly
War between money and lust, trust me, I hit enough dust
Suade fronts, color schemes, truck rings, stuck kings
Suade fronts, Balley's and blunts
Living amongst thieves, all we did was robbin', we won, Marvin
(Outro: Marvin Gaye sample (Raekwon))
Hey baby, what you no good? (That's right lord)
And trusted and back with, it's me I want
(Niggas gotta cut this faggot millennium shit out right now)
War is hell (War is hell, and get real with life)
And will it be (start teachin' y'all brothers, man)
When will people start gettin' together again"
110,Wisdom Body,1995,Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... (1995),,Raekwon,"Intro: The Mack
No man all bitches are the same, just like my hoes, you know
I keep 'em broke
Wake up one morning with some money they're subject to go crazy you know?
I keep 'em lookin' good, pretty and all that
You know, but no dough
When I get a bitch, I got a bitch (right on)
Lyrics: Ghostface
Word up, that motherfuckin brother wise
YouknowhatI'msayin? Teachin the uncivilized
Yeah, runnin' the streets, know it's deep
Word up, check his technique, yeah
I be Ghostface
Flippin the, marvelous track
Yeah
You know the steelo, but yo, yo
Check the bangin' sounds that I invent
Fake niggaz who tried to flex hard came and went
They couldn't match up with the fly nigga
Wit his back against the wall
Heads clapped once I came in the door
I played the speaker, sippin on Kahlua
Saw this bad bitch wit a switch
And yo, I had to step to her in a manner
And rather wished the current was warm
When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on
Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself
Yo, I'm the man, and Honey, you've been rated top shelf
Yo, what's your name hon, hair wrapped up in a bun
Your eyes sparkle, just like glass in the sun
Never diss em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss em
Especially, when you're browsin, goin' fishin
Your wasteline, bangin' like a bassline
Physical form is well complexed
And yo, I love your outline, Boo
Your whole body is wild, wit your rugged profile
Enough to make a hard rock smile
You can't strikeout, tell me what can really go wrong
You rockin' labels - Tommy Hil down to Claiborne
Show me some love hon, show me some love boo
Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through
Aiyyo peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret
And lovin' all the marvelous slang on how I freak it
Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash
Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass
Your body lotion is the potion, the shit got me open like dust
And yo, your stee is high potent, yo
We can go the distance, I put you under wings
From this convo we can spark and see whatever brings
I walked a hot Arabian desert, barefooted
I grabbed your hand, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it
Word up, yo, straight up and down yo
Check the joint, baby
It be the Wu-Tang production
Yeah, yeah, and all types of shit
And brothas catchin repercussions
Yo, straight up"

They'll never let me by though, 'cause I'm always tryna beat
Beat my worst enemy, me

Ayo, a better platform for all to listen to me
We out in DC deep, ain't got no sleep
The ride bumpy, who jetted out the country to buy D
Came back, [?] ain't nothin' sweet
My dome is yellin', ""Go home!"" but I ain't through
So many years in my career, it's a long route
Thinkin' when [?] skinned his face on the plaster
We was dusted back then, I smoked the last of it
And jumped into the Acura, sleepin' at [?], what it do?
Stew, beef, chicken, where my boo?
Had a quarrel with a hood rockstar, I broke his arm off
'Cause he was pointin' his fingers at Ivanne's daughter
What's next? Dreads want a piece of my spot
This my crib, I pay here to live, fuck the pap

He'll prolly do mine when nobody's there
Cause the only way to score, leave no witness
A thug on my shit list, pay him to slugs back
The slickest and remember that I built two graves
I wasn't stupid, I was ruthless
Check the bazooka crew, they bookoos
Broke the glass slammin' my rings down
That's doofus, don't mess up, you got the longest clip, use it
Yo you see 'em in the lobby, they right there
Headshots only, kill him, he right there

Yo, there's a rumor, that an inmate heard
Salesman hiring, a convict of murder
Bodyguard, who used to do physical fitness
His business, is catching to terrifying the witness
In the gym is where he gained his powers
Boss was the pizzeria owner that rolled flower
A made man, felt good to be made
Turned murderer, extremely quick to upgrade
But he still baked pies, and his cake would rise
Like his enemy, he watched to take dives
Allies, would retaliate the least
Even the score, had a thousand guns, they would calibrate
He sort of loss and double crossed, moved on them
Swiftly, if worlds away, sit and shuttle off
Horror in the 'Ville, without the Amity
Scars upon the grill of your friends family
Workers utilized and brutalized
Informats scrutinized and crucified
Wakes firebombed, functions shot up
The jakes was not alarmed to damage the product
(Raekwon)
Shoot his man's, grizzly stance, up in the GT, Clansman
With the sword that'll blow up a van
When them peoples come, blow right past, mind your business
I don't know nothing, they found his ho in the trash
Barbeque wings, blings for my niggas that's true kings
Sit up in the crib, catch supper and screw fiends
Yeah, watching me, next time, scotch me
I drink Crystal liquor, I'm a version of Hitler
On wax, no 'dacks, just water, a doorag on
I scratch waves, saying 'niggas is trash'
Yo, learn how to write, beware, I pull up, he here
I should of known, I had a clone, see weird
Niggas'll get hurt, merked, dropped off in a new turf
Trunk full of Siamese rats and gnats, yo
I do it for the cats in pits, and all the bitches with big tits
Five hundred shoe game switch
Shake that shake, I bake, I live in estate
That kill niggas over grits and steak
You might get smacked with a mack eleven, or run off the road
Or shot in McDonald's for fronting with fake niggas
(Killah Priest)
Aiyo, Saladin, vivid Wall Street sixteen
Muslims, kufis, uzi's, the Wu is supreme
Ferociously, I rank general, a world's above self
Conspicious, crime make me grab the nine off the shelf
The dark hallways, amazingly convenient, the Phoenix with Jane
Juggling cracks or playing with ninas
The law of the streets, gangsta crave the beef to feast
Fiends with plates and snake wanna eat
Gazed at the spectacular rapper, niggas is Dracula
Rap tours, Priest the hood ambassador
Passion for war, Wu-Massacre, threats, they never worry me
Plots to my death, mic jack conspiracy
Lyrically, I'm only afraid of my own ability
Words that shape into nuclear wars, we shooting through walls
Bringing down the mall, I ring around the store
Planets of the Apes, bandanas on our face
Hammers on our waist, cameras out in space
The nickel plate, fake armor, will harm y'all snakes"

Who wants to kill him?
No information, say yes or no
One point five million
All right, you get what you want -- money's no object
They're all clean, no serial numbers, untraceable
And there are explosive head bullets, in the clip

Chorus: Method Man
Who come to get you? None. They want guns!
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun 'cause he shine like one
Verse One: Method Man, a.k.a. Johnny Blaze
Check it
Scriptures hit the body like sawed off shotties
Like my hair notty and my nosepiece snotty
Fuck a nigga hottie, that whole pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mogabi, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah
36 Chambers of fear, huh, you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmmmmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the ground
There's a new sheriff in town holdin' it down
It's the two holster, shit shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath, we still paying dues
And the last one is death, back to the essence
With that shit you stressing, this rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin
Isle plus my style, Criminology pays
The last times and days, Johnny fuckin' Blaze
Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef, a.k.a. Lou Diamonds
This goes for niggaz who know
Wu will grow like llello, ley no, plus coolin in Barbados
Ricaans be givin' me much shit, the dutch shit
Stay cool papi, seize it with enough shit
Back at the lab a, crack's bagged up
Yo niggaz act up, what blow up the workers if they hafta

Suckin his dick, up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme prime nigga jail time jiggas

I call my brother Sun 'cause he shine like one
Verse Three: RZA, a.k.a. Bobby Steels
Solid gold crown is shinin
Solid gold, check it Sun yo
Solid gold crown be shinin and blindin like some diamonds
I be pioneering the style in the cloud with silver linings
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart the rib cage the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch yo' ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with dim pones
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard oh is it
The Ryzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Lickin' shots to Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happen millennium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin
Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for boutin
It's a mileage resemblin niggaz who like followin
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle
Verse Four: Master Killer
God steppin forth upon holy down of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact
That I'm the Master, for what lurks, is an expert
That hurts the individual who tries to visualize under
'Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggaz couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killa tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and glocks my
Clan is hoss and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his muthafuckin dome
Piece, deceased, laid to rest
Verse Five: Ghostface Killer, a.k.a. Tony Starks
Yo, aiyyo I got to serve them my way, move give me room
Holdin' up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf outta breath
Sold only new vocal cords I heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My teammate, enhance cells well like a pharmacy
Fuck horado pablos plan growas bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellas become novels
The man rockin' head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's british rock, playboys, mocks, and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with 8 million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavillions
Them flower heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggaz get caught wit all that loot kid
That's jet money, undaground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies

Ice Water! Yo... yo.

Try me, P.C.'ll put a clip in a nigga
Fuck a hole, my bullets'll dig a ditch in a nigga
Listen, I've been reppin', only pack big weapons
One shot to the stomach, you missin' ya midsection
I'm off the wall, dog, I could off ya balls
Stick his ass to the rooftop, toss 'em off
Hit the Ave with the rooftop off the porch
I get money 'cause it costs to floss, nigga you feelin' me?
And if not then fuck what you gotta deal with me
I've only been here for a minute but haters wanna get rid of me
P.C. creep with at least three heats
And a shotgun stashed underneath the backseats
(Stumic)
Niggas actin' like you don't feel a draft
You seen ya man? Tell him I'ma kill his ass
And I don't, wanna talk I want a mill in cash
I come through 'tards shittin', lookin' ill in the past
'Cause it's the, Ice Water, don't get it confused
And one false move'll cause me to spit at you dudes
It's Stumic, motherfucker and I'm pickin' ya food
And ain't no one out you know that my niggas'll do you
Let's spit on 'em, rush these niggas
And crush several fuckin', will leave a dent out ya liver
Only kid in the hood with a mustard ninja
Heard you broke down good, well I fucked ya sister

All it takes a phone call and they ready to ride
Get ready to die

Eh yo the cards are dealt, the words are spoken
Nigga, welcome to the Hell, the gates is open (uh-huh)
Gatekeeper, first degree murder through the speaker
Who deep enough to flow with the reaper?
Stuck in the middle, I spit a little riddle
Leavin' niggas crippled, my niggas ball 'em like Kerry Kittles
You niggas makin' it hard, it's really kinda simple
If a nigga gotta pull it out I'm puttin' it in ya temple
(Ultra)
Official I do this, rude maneuver
I use the Rugers to keep the bullets movin' through ya
Weak anatomy, fuck the small talk and flattery
Ya power is weak, to beef you need much more batteries
Keep it genetic, or dead it, Ice Water Inc. we said it
Whoever so-called did it or said it, promote it and spread it
Fake it or front it, get ambushed and confronted
With slugs in ya head, back, chest and stomach
Niggas don't want it or ask for it, so we give it to 'em
Dead in the club and let them things spit and rip through 'em dead in the club
Is you gon' fuck around and be the nigga dead in the club?

Poured it in the Pyrex sizzling

He took it off the stove run the water
Trying to work me yo
Knew I shouldn'ta hit the nigga's daughter
He mighta showed more love
Than went in the freezer
Broke the ice down, pour it in
We both looking at it on the twirl around particles grew
Fly Khaluas is mad sliding Coronas through
Feeling like Castro's cousin
Gave them niggas all of my life
All of my paper all my judgement
It droppa only like an ounce worth
Should I just come out my shirt
Go berserk and let the Macks burst
Skate off body in the Bronx
Same shit Gotti was on
Shallah they gonna get your's play it calm

Posing like a king, I'm rocking New Balances, new silencers
Glass table'll choke, twenty four challengers
Half of my niggas is slow, but they dough island
You know the pantries is full, ranches with bulls
And wolves there, who sit around, fronting in Wu-Wear
I slam a Noodles hat, pull hair, two tokes and Ghost
In a ghost, I be back in the wrong year
Long sleeve, one cuff up, rugged gold teeth
Fronting with Colombian niggas who gave me raw meat
Due to the gangstas that died, forever ride
To the rats in the manholes, who hate, niggas live
But it's all good, you from a poor hood, I guess
Back in the Guess with the Champion hood, what?

Play the couch, posted, count your money, hide your toast in

Pay a cop off, fly you your coke in
My house is worth 2.9, my Benz is worth, he want mine
Nowheres, we call that shit high heels
Dedicated heat rock sprayer, spray your mother and your lover
Better pay up, these guns is from Grenada
Wild fight, customized dice, get nice in the Trump Tower
Drunk bitch, spaghetti and sliced
Everybody features is that mean, never leave the lab
Lacking, always in the red, blacks and green
Drug slingers turn into slug singers, one of them snitch?
It's just a gut lingers, laying in the mud

Slimeball ass, nigags, man, for real, man
Stay away, man, knowhatimsayiing?

I got to admit that Shaolin boxing ain't that bad!
But, now watch mine!

Y'all niggas food, I peep that shit a long time ago
Dick rider niggas trying to front like they grimey, tho
This is my world, I just let you live in it
But the lease is up, you faggot niggas get evicted
How many times I gotta tell you cowards, mind your business
Oh, you still yapping? Time to catch 'em slipping
Doing dirty, we don't mind getting our hands dirty
And you can't fuck with any bitch because her ass dirty
'Cause when it pop off, we just up in shorty ears
And you just stuck with it, and how us niggas got you there
That little bad caramel with the long hair
Got you lined up, and caught in the crosshair
Nothing but bosses here, we enforced the fear
Always in the hood, my office there
Blow a bag with my comrades, polly my next move
And have you niggas bugging, how I wet 'em and crept through"
