0,03' Adolescence,2014,2014 Forest Hills Drive (2014),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Yeah, yeah
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I won't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I, could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? Aye who am I? (Yeah)
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see
I always did shit the hard way
My niggas slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let em' hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, ""What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on,"" he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, ""Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn't my man's, I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?""
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Aye who am I?
I never felt better"
1,1985,2018,KOD (2018),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Jokes on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya'
See if I can paint for you the larger picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light 'cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on

2,4 Your Eyez Only,2016,4 Your Eyez Only (2016),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only-
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you're hearing this, unfortunately
Means that I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not-I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance, at a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up-drug-related-mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a time sheet, that slow money
Picked up the family business
By the age of thirteen, six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina"", the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand-
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only-
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only-
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing when times was hard
I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your Momma, nigga; send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects-""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I've been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think this segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law"", although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only"
3,A Tale of 2 Citiez,2014,2014 Forest Hills Drive (2014),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched
But now I see my nigga
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah can I get a glimpse?
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shits not always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know
How could you know? How could you know?
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not, last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Father forgive me for me, childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me, miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but
Before you go I've got to, warn you now
Whatever goes up surely, must come down
And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command"

I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag

The loneliest orphan
I flipped my misfortune and grown me a fortune

Escape with your bitch like we turning your heart in

This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there
There is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through, how could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way
Because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together

Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat 'em up, and regurgitate me
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me
Nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga
Uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like thanks for the view
Waiting on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

""What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said ""Democracy is too fuckin' slow""
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
8,Born Sinner,2013,Born Sinner (2013),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to be
'All you can be' posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know that the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you would find it
And knew one day that you would come back and rewind this, singing...
I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better tonight)
If you ain't fucking with that
I don't care (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: ""Don't let me slip""
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: ""You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane""
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change
You Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go with me damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Don't you ever go expose them
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's a tutor for me
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except
I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better tonight)
If you ain't fucking with that
I don't care (yeah, yeah, yeah)"
9,Breakdown,2011,Cole World: The Sideline Story (2011),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Look, I just shed tears homie and now I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
And when I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left them I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of lettin' my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowin' through our veins is the same
My mama left you and maybe your anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be tellin' you fuck you cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help it
I break down, I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down
I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit man
It's fuckin' with her body, now she sick damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothin' like real life
You made a milli off of servin' hard white, yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shootin' niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bullet proof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruitin' niggas
We tryna stand tall when it gets to crucial niggas
Break down! We break down, we break down, we break down...
Servin' time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know, his daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt, she love him yeah that's fo sho
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know?
Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freakin', but them niggas holla
But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in 7 seasons
Damn! She do the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please
Stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!
Please... stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!
Don't break down, don't break down, don't break down, don't break down...
Break, break down
Steady break me down

Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing
Probably 'cause I never could so if I had it, never would
Then I got my first little taste of paper, and I splurged
I guess its just the nigga urge, this is the Boondocks
I swear yo I'm like Huey mixed with Riley
Thursday I be trynna save the world, then on Friday I hit the club
Hoping that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses
Niggas get to scraping then you hear the gats blasting
Damn, older niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see I can, but I won't
Plus I'm saying what I won't
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep
As the throat, on a certified freak, will she choke?
As we headed to the crib, yes I let her give me head so she won't remember where I live
My game is tight, baby no need to bring pajamas, you ain't staying the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life
Like Hov said it ""Can I Live?""
Aye dear Lord, ""Can I live?"" -Hey
Breakdown
Now am I Living to get paid just slaves for a wage (all week)
I can't do no 9 to 5 told my momma (""sorry"")
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the (glory)
If you knew me know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked (for me)
I ain't pissed, naw couldn't give a shit (hardly)
I be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me
If I go I know the ones that's pouring liquor for me
And I know the fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was bout' to blow so they was waiting on me
But Oh-No, Lord
See I'm smarter then they know-oh-oh
So hold on, Lord, 'Cause I ain't quite ready to go-oh -oh
Can I live
-Somebody told me that its only one shot, so I'll be God damn, If I'm ever gonna stop
Promise to my momma Imma make it to the top
So Imma keep climbing to my heartbeat drop
Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude he was young like 21, straight up out that city that I'm from
A real smart Nigga, but his niggas they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breathe nigga.
His partner screaming ""Don't you fucking leave nigga!""
Took off his shirt trynna stop the bleeding nigga, ""Don't you go!""
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?
Did I tell my baby sorry from befo'
Wont get to see my son grow
Lord I ain't ready to go
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?
Can I live? -Yeah"

Said soft niggas can't last hard times, yo,
Believe that shit,
Yeah, (yeah) ay (ay),
Real niggas don't cry,
Look,
Yo-
Was just a youngin' with that fresh fade,
Bird chest, legs skinny,
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny,
Fresh pennies on my feet,
Momma paid for everything I'm wearing,
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world.
Aw. nigga, but shit done changed since ""Mayne"" was my nickname,
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game,
Now I'm a man worried about my fam.
Let me explain,
It's like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shit's sprained.
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle,
Feeling like the world's on your back so you stumble,
And it feels like a quarterback get sacked, and then you fumble.
Jobs don't call a nigga back, so it's back to the hustle.
Niggas praying for they moms,
At the same time they moms pray for them.
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way,
But damn a nigga been a lost fate.
It hurts on the usual,
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral.
(Damn)
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
I won't cry (no), I can't cry.
And in this life times getting hard my nigga,
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,
I won't stop- try till the day I die,
And I won't cry (no), I can't cry.
(Ay, ay, ay, yeah)
(Listen, yo)
I sit back and watch the news every now and then,
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash,
Even the weathers bad.
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted,
Like, ""Damn it's '06 and niggas still up on that gang shit? ""
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split,
Only seventeen, he was finna to graduate.
And like, three weeks some stupid niggas got him for his chain,
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement. (uh)
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped,
Some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop,
Wait, man she just eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world?
Got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us,
Every week be blasting us, on accident- or so they claim.
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain, (right)
They killed her only son,
Make her wanna blow her brains out,
Change the channel nigga, I can't watch this.
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,
I won't cry (no), I can't cry.
And in this life times getting hard my nigga, (yeah)
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga, (yeah, uh)
I won't stop- try till the day I die,
And I won't cry (no), I can't cry.

Niggas lying, still get high, they ride and kill,
Money hungry, tryna find a meal.
Can't stay inside and chill,
Little niggas thinking: 'fuck school, I'm finna sign a deal!'
Hunting hoes, trapping niggas,
Lying like they on the pill,
Preachers say we blessed,

You mix greed, pain, and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors I'm just paintin my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped the range rover my girl got the mercedes
Iced out crazy I wanna shine like baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way that people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch yo chain, I bet it still won't free you
'Cause I'll be right back grinding till I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, ""Here go your chain my nigga""
This is chaining day
Chaining day, my chaining day
This is my chain today
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
The same shit a rich white mo'fucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home where niggas sit today
You rock a chain and they always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', ""Fake it till you make it""
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And actin' like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
And copped a crib that's gated that hundred racks, I gave it up
For what
This is chaining day
Chaining day, my chaining day
This is my chain today
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair
Lord
This is the last time
Told my accountant, It's the las time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my Chains from me
'Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me

Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the father for forgiveness-God, I'm overwhelmed (Please God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if he's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, he'd never judge a man
Because he knows us all and therefore he would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother's life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife
I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (come from inside)

Doin' dirt hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel 'cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God; I'm going hard nigga
I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide

Yeah, prodigal son got a new gun, this one
Don't run out of ammo lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star, and remain my self
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt I evolve
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth
Until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little

Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches disrespecting dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, 'cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, poor...)
(I swear to God bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God-nigga, I'mma kill them niggas man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is-this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse fro-"
16,Cole World,2011,Cole World: The Sideline Story (2011),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like, hey hey
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, it ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle, take the proceeds go to gamble
Ha! Bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit
She be askin' ""When?"", bitch, when I feel like it
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
Uh, turn up the 808's for me
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
Bitch I made this in the crib watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me
They say I'm takin' long, I tell 'em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got 'em feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
Come pull me outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here
We outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like, hey"

I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round
Look
They tell me I should fix my grill 'cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show them kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?""
What it's like to have a crooked smile
This crooked smile
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim 'cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
Cause you see that no one wants you back and it got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care
'Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be, and that's you
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
(You're the one that was trying to keep me way down.
Like the sun, I know you know I found my way back round..)
We don't look nothing like the people on the screen
You know them movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation, or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, 'cause we in hell already
I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
Yo one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hell naw
I ain't snitching cause
Man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)

And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin'
But them whites ain't. (hmmm)
I brush it off like, ""fuck it, it's motivation,""(yeah)
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating, (uh)
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take 'em. (yeah)
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan,
But fuck it man, I ain't hatin',' I gotta go for mines.
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime,
On my grind, yeah, just like the nigga making Fortunes,
I'm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I'm tryna get my Oprah on.
These hoes is crying 'cause I won't pay 'em attention, (nah)
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin' tuition, (ahaha)

You couldn't get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please,
I'm chasing G's tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze,
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves.
Ease to the top and I'm not finna leave till I'm hot,
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga,
Boy, I'm shining without the diamonds in my mouth,
Out grindin' while you reclining on your couch,

Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
Its dope, then you should know the suppliers name
Its J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco wanna text-us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for!?
Some next niggas almost slide in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kid-in?
These big weight niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress
I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow
Or you catapult
Not if I had a ladder or not even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!

Freedom or jail, you lose

Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these hoe-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be Lebron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies B's but them hoes swarmin'
Now honey, Ay is it destiny or is it money your feelin'
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin' a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin' in the mirror livin' in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself 'cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, ""hey can I last in this?""
Ay five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these whack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they trynna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm trynna live it how no other nigga ever lived it!

I was raised in the F-A-
Why a nigga never gave me nothing?
Pops left me, I ain't never cry, baby, fuck him, that's life.
And trust me I'm living,
Look what a nigga made out,
The shit that I was given,
Look what a nigga came out
Momma sewing patches on my holes,
Man, our hoes couldn't put this flame out.
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall,
I'm from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols.
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y'all,
I thank the Lord He let a nigga make it this far,
A lot niggas don't, a lot of moms weep.
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me.
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me.
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee,
I pour liquor, homie.
It's foul, but yo the world keeps spinning,
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen,
Nigga Imma eat, even if it means sinning,
Niggas want beef, Imma sink my teeth in 'em.
Pause, I go harder, I am all about a dollar.
You niggas street smart? I'm a motherfucking scholar.
So trust me, I ain't stopping till my money is long,
So much dough, them hoes will think I'm rocking money cologne.
Have a model at the crib waiting, ""Honey, I'm home.""
Cooking greens for a nigga, give 'em plenty, a dome.
It's funny, we dream about money so much it's like we almost got it,
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality,
The ville is a trap nigga now,
And if you ain't focused you gonna be here for awhile, yeah.
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun,
Type a nigga know about every car, but don't got one.
That's hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils,
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal.
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?
This money coming soon, dog, I'm tryna get my cake up.
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself,
An E&J sipper, but my shit is top shelf,
Young J, the rawest shit you niggas ever heard of.
A journalist nigga, call me the Fayetteville Observer.
You know the routine, man
Fayettnam
Real niggas can relate,
And Ville niggas can relate, man.
My niggas know about the struggle, man.
What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit.
I was in like first grade man, I swear
It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes.
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad.
Darryl what up man?
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo,
I wanted that shit so bad.
I begged my mom for that shit, you know.
But she couldn't afford it, yo, she gave me,
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha
But that was all good tho, 'cause uh,
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits,
Some all black shits, haha
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?
But you know back then niggas didn't,
Niggas ain't even know he was broke man, no worries and shit.
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills,
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?
College loans and shit, nigga
Gotta get this money, ma"

Of better days, when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle nigga I say what they never say
Whenever they, spit that bullshit they spittin',
This that pool pit I'm hittin niggas with the gospel
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dolla in my pocket, plus a dream

Every nigga ain't no dog, and every nigga ain't no king
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, so white man can jump
They shooting niggas fo' they even tell 'em put their hands up!
Crooked cops, got a nigga scared to drive probably thinking
That I'm slanging man I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dolla plus a dream
Yeah you swear your girl is faithful everything ain't what it seems
See I seen how she glance and look away like she want it
I ain't saying I'm a fuck her but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirts with a nigga this is worst
I bet if I was to hit men, I wouldn't be the first
This is church, this is gospel
Spit it like I get from the Bible, for your survival
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems

Check it
Ay Salle, I know I ain't been answering your calls, but shit, let me explain-
It's because times been hard, been runnin' around trynna find a job
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o'clock
And it's you, can't even front I press ignore
I still got cha letters laying in my dresser draw
You telling me about all the things you did for me
When I was broke, you sent me doe and that was big for me
See you was there every year when I needed you,
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my momma cosigned
But in no time, a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl I'm sad to say it
But I was using you, you gave a nigga major stacks
And I know one day in my heart that I'm gonna pay you back""

I got a dollar and a dream
That's all a nigga got
So if it's bout that cream
Then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream
Just a dollar and a dream
Walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
'Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowing it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em
They say he wouldn't leave me yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress and this mess you're in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin' now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Cole!

Then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream
Just a dollar and a dream
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
You paper, confetti, small time, y'all on one, I'm on mine
You logged off 'cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares where niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies; who infiltrated my team?
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
You never, have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If you don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
Cause this life get hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? My fans, and my man's
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' ""God damn, what's her name?""
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like ""Bitch don't be so fuckin' lame""
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those praying for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will

Heerree man
Like, when I say this shit is crazy, I don't mean its crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it fucking its actually crazy
You know what I mean? Yeah
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fucking with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated with the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait,
Is fate procrastinating?
I can't take it 'cause I might be right,
This is the girl of my dreams
Ay, is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lying to myself?
Ay, should I try and get some help?
(Repeat 2x)
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Ay, tell me is it stalking if I follow her like all the way home
Without her knowing
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occasionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she wave at me,
Imagine what she'll say to me, this ain't no time to be afraid no more
It's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy,
Look, I spot her walking in the mall,
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my god, I'm walking towards her
My mind screaming stop, but my legs keep walking forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you coming for her
My heartbeat racing, and my hands keep shaking
Say something, you shy motherfucker, she's waiting,
""Wassup girl, don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women
But you from my dreams, ay will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch, some R&B and rap, ay you should
Come through""
She said, ""Uh, I love to, except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would
Like that""
*Damn*
""Okay, you say you got a man, I mean, I definitely understand,
I'm happy for you, really am, I couldn't of been the only fan
In the world Of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie, well I'm sure that I'm gon' see you around the city
Only thing I ask if shit don't work out for y'all, then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene""
I came up with a world-class scheme to get the-
So I find out the nigga name, know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work, hold up nigga, is you sane?
Imma follow in my car; Imma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall, maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time, then console her while she crying
She gon' take that as a sign; finally she will be mine!
I'll be king, and she'll be queen when I hit her with ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?"

Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated with powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

My Saturdays are the loudest

To my nigga --- I hope you listening
--- I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking 'ville I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got perscription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-Tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got twelve slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, 'cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, blaoow
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?

If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure
My inhibition's fighting my intuition, premature premonition
...Showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me! Blaooow
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it
Listen
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n' Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem, and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds, one verse at a time
And claim 2-6, and fuck it, if the shoe fits
Who's the king?
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
But in reality he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize
The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same
Are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved"

With bananas and some almond milk

It's the simple things, it's the simple things
Now say, ""I love you""-it's the simple things

We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say:

Just trying to make it dog, somehow
Peaking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like maybe
Everything is gon' be all right"

All in my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-
Seven, way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
At 12, trying to get that taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home ""baby, don't yell""
How many record do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the double X L
Or fader, fuck ya magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'mma drop the album the same day as Kanye
Just to show the boys the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what next the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and the pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this the kiss of... death
Blah
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip (boom)
Little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
T-T-Took a little, took a little, took a little sip (uh)
Uh huh
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Don't shit last, and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King (and you know that)
Started with a dollar and a dream (and you know that)
Never give a bird bitch a ring (you should know that)
Bitch! Bitch!

Hands up, everybody run

Niggas like ""man that's what everybody said""

Everybody scared of the nigga
Aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter
Never bitter
Niggas is faker than anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, whoa
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good nigga we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe
I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way

Get off my dick, whoa

Get off my dick, bitch, whoa

I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody
(This is the part that the thugs skip)
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through
(The break up)
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won't be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
No more
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more

Driven by some people up in Ariel Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga I'm very sure
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out

And a nigga fear nothin' but god
Fuck a facade

What up with them wads and shit
Hundred thousand dollar deposit shit
Been dreamin' bout millions since a nigga was 5 or 6
And so strive, ima god, this some bible shit
Tell 'em geppetos my niggas is ghetto with scarface dreams
At the block with that hard rate, that's all they seen
Niggas killin' niggas on broad day on all they screams
Watching cops love car chase scened
Niggas arrested
Treat us like roaches, the prison niggas infected
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggas invested
All created equal, looks like to a less than
Depending on your race or depending on your address man
I been blessed, was given less and but still progress man
I hate to see the position my niggas left in
Slay dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage
Ashamed
But we livin' in a cage, so nigga get paid
How could I tell a nigga not to hustle
Yeah it's a better life my nigga, but it's not for us though
Instead they wanted us to break
They never wanted us to make it yeah

Two years later bitch we made it on, onto the Blueprint

Same broads, used to hang up on my walls
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned

Put money over bitches but we still underdogs

Woman baby wouldn't put his hands on a nigga
I ain't bitter boy that's all you
Plus I just fucked her 'fore she called you
Dry your eyes baby, I'll drive you home
Older hoes sayin', my how you've grown

I was fein'n for the meals, I ain't talking Burger King
Some of my niggas in the Ville' all they did was serve feins
Fuck scales, I had skills all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals, spend their time flirting
All the wanted was some waves, like they fucking surfing
Hold up now don't get it twisted, I ain't hating do your thing
I was like a young Simba couldn't wait to be the king
Now Nigga it's the prince, hopped over the fence where the grass way greener
Look at shortys ass way meaner
Something like Serena mixed with Trina, have you seen her?
She fine enough to be Miss Howard, word to Adina
My money like a senior watch it graduate
Now its time to eat I'm letting all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me now they acting like they know me
Keep on saying
Where you going nIgga?- Shit, there ain't no telling
Ay, where you going nigga?- Ay, there ain't no telling
Yeah, they keep on saying where you going nigga, going nigga?-There ain't no telling
Can't tell you where I'm going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top
Pardon the interruption; a proper introduction is necessary when your shit is legendary
Man, greedy niggas wouldn't let me in the cafeteria
'Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian
The hoes is librarians, they looking me up
She got a jones like Marion, she licking me up
Then we cut, look how she say my name
I got her moaning J. cole, they used to say Jermaine
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin, 6 feet, shits deep
I was low, just a dolla and some hope fixed me
'Cause I was broke plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser
Lord, please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercier
I'm a star, Conversers, conversing with them girls, with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains because my shit is unheard of like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me though
Now they yelling-
Where you going nIgga?- Shit, there ain't no telling

Told my niggas, ""Ay I'm finna' put the Ville on the map""-I'll be back
And I'm coming with a deal and a plaque
'Cause I'm ill bitch, they couldn't make a pill for the rap
Pouring liquor for my niggas that was killed, send 'em back
Came home shit is real niggas still in the trap
Hold up now don't get it twisted if you slang do your thang
Me I'm like a young Simba I can't wait to be the king
Witness the dream
Straight out that Carolina water I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas trynna be the ballas
Ain't no fathers but the skinny niggas trynna hit their daughters
Sneaking in her crib but her momma never caught us
What they taught us men them bad bitches only want the ballas
The starters, we hoopin now the hoes wanna guard us
Uh-Okay, so play D... know what I mean?
And I-I-I put you on the team

Or will these hatin' ass rappers try to steal my thunder
Aye this is big shit poppin', you gon' need a plunger
To take me under, niggas in trouble
You lookin' at Lebron James of the game
I could do anything that you name
I could blaze any rapper in the game that you bring
Pour gasoline on the brain, got the flame for that

To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch
These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit
But Cole's flow so cold, Bet the devil get sick
How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit
These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it
I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach
Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it
So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest
No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it
Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded
Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated

'Cause life is hard mentally
And everything is meant to be

It's hard to tell
Oh well, sit back and sip this Hennessey
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
'Cause plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why?
I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my mama I'd make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know there's more to life
Than macking hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sorta like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they balling like the dream team

We grew up
I went to school, you went the other way

I'm sitting reminiscing on
All of them bitches we was tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink
We trying to bag some new hoes
And if I needed gear you'd let me hold your new clothes
And vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man
A nigga slow caking
I'm broke trying to chase a dream
You just got probation
And I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant
What's next?
Oh shit, my mama doing drugs
At times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness
I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when your mama tried to beat you with that bat?
Shit, remember your chick Nina?
Man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina?
Yo she's still the baddest

Ain't balling but I have better
A woman with an ass and a strong mind
It's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit
Sometime I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart you don't want me to be no star though
There's groupies after every show
You scared I'm fucking every hoe
And girl I ain't 'gon lie and say I won't
'Cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength
I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids
The love is real
And if we ever part, God forbid
I love you still
So when I'm on the road don't trip
You know I'm down for you
Keep it tight and don't slip

Can't wait to see my niggas and fuck with my old chicks,
Can't wait to cruise the city, be catching them old grins,
Same niggas, same place, doing the same old shit.
Yeah, so nigga watch it!
A nigga been in NY tryna get some bigger pockets,
You still up in the ville, tryna make it in the trap,
I'm finna put us on the map; I told you I was coming back, 'Cause,
Yeah, so make way, the prince of the city, ain't a street I can't stay,
You niggas is hatin',' just be happy I ain't changed.
Blunts rolled to the murk, we all want the same thing,
And that's- money to feed us, yup,
We pray to God, but, we ain't tryna meet Him yet, haha!
Yeah, If I never...
Nigga, man,
Actually that is a bad idea, my nigga,
'Cause uh,
Now Imma always come home,
Its where a nigga was grown,
Where a nigga was shown,
How to scrap, yup,
Shown how to mack, yup,
Sold a whole lot of crack, yup,
Juggling them hoes,

Momma work to the bone,
Putting clothes on my back,

Yeah,

Yeah yeah,
Shout to the whole ville!
Of course, so real!
Uh,

If I never went home again,
""Hello?, chill out nigga, what's up, boy?
Yeah, I just touched down man,

Aiight, well look,

What's jumping for tonight?
Oh the Live? I'm in there, nigga."
42,How High,2001,Return of Simba (2001),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"What's love got to do, go to do with it
I get a little taste then I'm through with it
Then I send it right back to you with it
(How high)
What's love got to do, go to do with it
I get a little taste then I'm through with it
Then I send it right back to you with it
(J. Cole - Verse 1)
Visionary play your position, no missionary
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope
Now picture that
My poetry's deep now fish for that
Only real niggas catch something, phoney niggas fail
Shit you gotta feel like it's only read in braille
Both did the crime but his homie didn't tell
So he f-cking bitches while he sitting lonely in a cell
Thinking well, what the hell I been on
They gave a nigga five then they threw another ten on
By the time I'm back on the streets like a bachelor
I gotta play the clubs like an old ass woman
Life is a movie, pick your own role
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole
Sit around crying that's like sitting round dying
You wanna touch the sky bitch you figure out flying
Nigga how high, so high that I could touch the sky
How sick, so sick that I could f-ck yo' bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G's
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees
Nigga how high, so high that I could touch the sky
How sick, so sick that I could f-ck yo' bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G's
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees
(J. Cole - Verse 2)
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl
My niggas hit the trees like squirrels
Tryna get a nut with your girl
Think I need to quit trying 'fore some nigga out there try to hit mine
Karma for the karma sutra
A lot calmer when the ganja's through ya
You need ya armour cause them niggas out here tryna shoot ya
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda
For stashing that marijuana
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed
I broke the law but look I'll never smoke or steal again
In your courtroom wylin' out, I don't mean to keep smiling
But right now I'm high enough to probably steal a plane
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn't read?
Would you throw the book at me
What if I'm feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy
It's been a long time coming
Tell my nigga roll me up something
(J. Cole)
No I don't smoke, maybe once in a blue
When the tention gets thick than there's nothing to do
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind
My eyes get shut but I open my mind
How high, la la la la
How high, hey hey hey
How high, yeah yeah yeah yeah
How high, la la la la
Is that a shot that you threw little man?
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned
Make it worse, you're friends, now when they talk rap
All you hear is ""J Cole this"" and ""J Cole that""
It must be hard for your projects to take all that
I know your weak heart gotta break off that
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear
I'm burning you n-ggas and I'm only in first gear
I'm serving you niggas this is only the first beer
12 months from now, you'll be having the worst year
No tears for the haters, I'm still counting money
Cole ain't dropping, that's real f-cking funny
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a nigga raps
Something like a mummy
But I'mma wake yo' ass up
Something like your mommy on school day
I smoke two l's with ya girl this is Cool J
How high
How high
How high, yeah
How high, yeah
What's love got to do, got to do with it
I get a little taste then I'm through with it
Yeah I send it right back to you with it"
43,I Get Up,2009,The Warm Up (2009),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Ha-yeah
Carolina stand Up! (humming)
I'm good to go yo, yeah
I woke up early in the morning hoes blowing up my phone
Ain't no use for small talking when they know I'm trynna bone, fuck em'
I holla ""lata;"" man right now my minds else where
My moms healthcare, get her out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail, frail nigga wont prevail here
We seen it all men niggas can't even spell ""scared""
A fresh prince but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you excel I'm worried bout' my welfare
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
So as my doe strait I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up, look out the window hope the sun shining down on the niggas out there frontlin'n
I hit the street and seem them boys out there locking up some older heads
Said ""God damn homie hold your head"" and hold your head
I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way
And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl Imma make it to the end though
Until the top if I climb my way, and tell em' imma rise
I'm on my -headin for the sky-I'm on my way
Verse Two
Yeah paint a picture and show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell the blind man what he missing
For all my niggas doing time man up in prison
Thought you had to resort to crime man fuck the system!
We raising babies up in Haiti where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollern' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
Keep talking bout' change till we floating in the same old boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel what the president spoke-never-
We he ain't never had to struggle ain't never been broke-never-
Ain't even rode through the ghetto ain't never been close-never-
Trusting this government like trusting the devil in oath
A rebel with quotes- I Get Up!-
Lifestyles of the young, black and wreckless
A generation of niggas strapped and asking questions
Like, ""Tell me why I ain't got shit""
I let this liquors fill my liver with them toxics (as I sip)
I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way
And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl Imma make it to the end though
Until the top if I climb my way, and tell em' imma rise
I'm on my -headin for the sky-I'm on my way
Verse Three
Yeah to all my niggas paper chasing I pray for your patience-please-
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cake'n
Taking this shit one step at a time
That real shit is stuck in my mind
But to that bullshit, I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine, Imma find a way
'Cause hey, damnit these jobs out here ain't trynna pay, I pray
Granted, 9 to5 is how you survive I ain't trynna survive
I'm trynna throw my momma in rides
Imma provide for my seed I'm the soil
Ill teach em' bout loyalty
Ill teach him that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
Ill show him all the things that my pops was never showing me
Treat him like a growing tree
With this poetry I get up!
And show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seeds got tomorrow
So please niggas raise your kids
And hope them overcome that bullshit they dazed us with
I blaze this shit and-
I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way (I get up)
And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way (I get up)
And if I gotta crawl Imma make it to the end though
Until the top if I climb my way, and tell em' imma rise
I'm on my -headin for the sky-I'm on my way
Talking
Take em' to church nigga (laughs)
Uh-uh-uh (bunch of Uh's)
Yeah imma take 'em to the top!
I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way (and Imma take 'em to the top!)
And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way

Stupid ass mother fuckers (New York, what up? Queens)

I told y'all niggas that I'm getting my bread and going home
Imma show you all stupid ass motherfuckers (Coming soon, nigga)
Dumb ass niggas
The heir to the throne
South nigga bred to the bone
But haters say he fled from his home (please),

Moved to Jamaica Queens, like Prince Akim,
But ain't looking for no queen, (nah)
Came to get my c.r.e.a.m. (yup),

45,Immortal,2016,4 Your Eyez Only (2016),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin', dollar and a dream with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BoFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a car time vibe
Summer Rain come again, numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears, thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt
Real niggas don't die

Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cried?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin, nigga put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean?

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch make it quick if the Lord take me
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas sell dope, rap or go to NBA
In that order
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain

But well, I'm wondering what type of shit you wantin'

Would you drink with a n-gga, do you smoke weed
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but sh-t, I might get high with you

So I threw 'em back, now all my n-ggas hollerin, who was that
Oh boy, she bad n-gga, what you bout do with that

I'm trying to make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work, I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love big women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get those kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking
I got bath water that you can soak in
Things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, well lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning
I roll over and ask if...

Hey, hey, God Bless the child that can hold his own
God Bless the woman that can hold patron
God Bless the homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached, like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you is clear
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wears
Therefore, you shouldn't judge a n-gga off of the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headin from here
Just say you're scared if you're scared but if you through frontin' we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talking about, tomorrow you'll be calling out
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn'
Cooking n-gga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my way and you think about me all day, that's just a warning

Let it be know I'd never fold
I took my time
I gave my soul
I watched you shine

Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, ""Look where I came
Look how far I done came""
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing

I mean, all you dreamed about was this one thing
I mean, you know it’s coming
You have faith in all that
But sometimes...
Sometimes you second guess yourself...
That’s human nature, I suppose, second guessing
When life seems to take you through more downs than ups
Seems like it gives you more losses than wins
But do you stand tall and be bold
Or do you fold?
Do you believe?
See, me, I came a long way
Way too far for me to stop now
Not that I would stop anyways, but…
I’m so close, I can feel it
Can you feel it..?
Warm up…"

Yeah
Art of seduction
Hoes jump like Vince Carter backstage like they apart of production
We talked about her dreams you gotta start off with somethin'
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustlin'
Found it funny 'cause now they daughter is stuck-in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga
Well, movin on
Funny 'cause I only know a couple of your songs
But I love when they come on
Word?
Ill take it, Baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot you not wasted, ?look in the blocks with mindplay?
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick
Girl, How could you not taste it?
That's a little egotistic, my amigos be hocking in Toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's all G though,
'Cause he know bitches can't get the Michael so they settling for Tito
We know, yeah nigga we know, hot bitch fell in my lap like cappucino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me, you keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though,
Nah nigga, the game is to get, a bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit,
I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass into a craft, now you'd be famous and rich,
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch, while you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick,
She thinking she got a first round pick, she thinking bout all the things she can get, she thinking you got a Range for a whip, and a fly ass cribbo, and it's not that simple cause,
All you got is a phone full of bitches, and they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word, wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs... Aye
Ill take it, Baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind embrace it, do not fake it

Flow bananas here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
And turned to the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossin' the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights, cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me 'cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide
It's just physics, please let's put our egos aside
You my niggas, and should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
'Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' 'bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said son
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God

Lord please forgive me for my sinning, I ain't saying that I'm finished but I'm praying in advance
'Cause they way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants
Yeah ball game-I swear the hoes wasn't in my plans
When a nigga took a chance and came to the big city
My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me
Like, Bobby had Whitney we were cooking up crack!
But them 15 credits had a nigga off track
Picture that!-The best rapper since lil Wayne in classes
The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his Bachelors
Remasterd this rap shit you hear the words coming from my lips, bastards
I never crack, I got that chapstick
I practiced till that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter
Now where's the ladder?
'Cause either you gonna whine or climb, I choosed the ladder
Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though
Before you get tossed like a forward lateral
We never tattle, let God handle that
Or let the mob handle that, No soprano
Half Black, half white I'm a piano
I'm an animal my video on discovery channel
I'm a beast when my shit hits the streets these niggas seize to exist
Like a beach in a tsunami you'll find me in The Ville in the state of NC
Bitch if I ain't back home I'm up in N-Y-C bout' that money probably
Like a fucking robbery but I ain't Jacking
I'm chasing dreams sort of like jeans
Boy I ain't slacking, I'm chasing dreams sort of like Jeans boy I ain't slacking
Ay take a hard look at my drive nigga no hacking on my shit

You've been suffering 18 years yourself
You've been going through pure hell but it can be over just like that
This is pastor Kerney Thomas and I literally have tens of thousands across the country
That were hurting for God to heal them
And God could work a miracle for them
All you gotta do is either log on to our website
Or you can dial the toll-free number
And place your order right there
For the Personal Prayer Package
I want you quickly, to place that order right now
For the Personal Prayer Package
Pick up the telephone right now
I said pick up the phone right now
You're past due a miracle"
58,Kevin's Heart,2018,KOD (2018),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time
Slip me a xanny at once (Somebody)
I got the herb from the blunt (Smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (Skrrt)
I get the skirt when I want (Skrrt)
Due to the money aroma (Somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (Smoke)
She got wife written all over

All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
The only advice, the only advice for you

Momma I just killed a man
My body still trembling can you feel my hand
Don't shed no tears, it won't be long before they find out it was me momma
This may be the last time you see me free ma
Don't spend it cryin'
You did your best, me I was blessed, know you were stressed tryin'
To keep me out the streets, me ducking police
Tryin' not to make a peek to wake you up out your sleep
A drunk and high fool
Skip a class, fluncking high school
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned
Said I was playing with fire, somehoe I never burned
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed
You tried to show me right but somehow I never turned
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you sane dummy
Dry your face mommy, your not to blame for me
See I'm a man, I gotta take whatever came for me
At times I wonder 'bout my father
Would it change for me if he was around?
Would I still be running round with the lowlife's
Bum ass n-ggas no jobs, no life
Seen them n-ggas killed for no price
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light
I pulled the trigger momma
Tryna be hard, I ain't mean to kill the n-gga momma
But what's done is done
I'm on the run, I live my life like a movie now it's way too realer
Who woulda thought your baby boy woulda grew up to be a killer
Yeah, now I'm a killer
Guess I'm a killer
They got me in here with the killers
Yeah I mean the killers
(J. Cole - Verse 2)
I wonder what's in store for me
Lately been stressing, pray for blessings, hope that there's more for me
Than just a simple life
N-ggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life
Gave up the jump shot
Work on the john shot
Who woulda thought I used to block this n-ggas lay ups
Now he's in a cell laid up
I wish you well, stay up
Like insomniacs
This life can make a n-gga fold like a laundry mat
I sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain
And so that I react slow, in this fast world
Slow n-ggas, fast girls
Hoes give up ass while these ho n-ggas hold triggers
Blast on 'em
Hold up that old checker flag for 'em
Chalk lines by the do not park sign
It's deep, all these cold hearted n-ggas holding heat
I'd rather blast before they steal a n-gga
Tell 'em now boy, don't make me turn into a killer
Yeah, into a killer
Don't make me turn into a killer
Yeah, to a killer, yeah yeah
(J. Cole - Verse 3)
To those who had love for me in the past
Who woulda thought time would fly by so fast
I remember back in class we used to make believe
Like it was draft day
Swore that we would make the league, be rich
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, awww shit
Watch how they pile up
Seem like a mile up
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend
Skating ring is where we headed tonight
And if a n-gga disrespect, yes we ready to fight
In retrospect that shit seemed petty
At the time, the shit was heavy
Cause life was all about your name
You had to scrap with any n-gga that would call you lame
Ashamed no doubt, so many n-ggas go they brains blown out
Snatched a n-gga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries
Another body in a cemetery
Another young n-gga in the penetentiary
And he don't give a f-ck no missionary
Rap visionary, paint a picture n-gga pictionary
Tell you what it is, I'm a dictionary
I knew a n-gga that threw his d-ck in every chick in every city that he went to
Went hard like the rent do
Till he met the wrong bitch, man just came home ex-convict
And he stay on with that Thriller
Shit, f-cking around with them killers
Yeah, with them killers
F-cking around with them killers
Say I'm a killer"

Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all this old gear
This is flow here, this is no fair

You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here

Avoiding the snakes, AK's, and coke yeah
Get my dick wet but I never let it soak there
Man I been thinkin' bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city in New York nine years
Ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, ""Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you""
I told her, ""Aw baby don't start! I ain't looking for the way to your heart!""

Damn real shit nigga no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy knock it off
I seen your mama in a Benz when she dropped you off
Damn now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, ""What mean the world to me?""

A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her 'cause I tried to hit
On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfuless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative, nigga is to hit and never commit
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call
She was hurting, now she staring dead in my face she was smirking
Like, ""Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga""

Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo

64,Let Nas Down,2013,Born Sinner (2013),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end, so far as rap goes
It's only natural, I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin
I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who thought that I would meet him on tour?
I'm earnin' stripes now nigga, got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let him know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though, 'cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning feeling fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said you the one, yo why you make that shit?
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach, I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone, resentment was in my tone, fuck it
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made ""You Owe Me"" dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts, you mean tellin' me
That I was not up to par, when I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind, I kept on sayin'
Where's the hits? You ain't got none
You know Jay would never put your album out without none
And dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with their outcomes
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I study the shows, the fans, study their hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number 2
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game but on the way
I let Nas down, I got no one to blame, I'm ashamed I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open a door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall like the son of the Lord
On the cross, dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade, if I should pass please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose, I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that hip-hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it, how could you fail to respect it?
Lettin' Nas down, I got the phone call quietly I mourned dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight may I never lose sight, fuck it
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin

Like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down for
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin' you feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause
She be healin' that shit
And nah that ain't your girl dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the mean time it's lights please
Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be all right
Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be all right
Lights please
(Verse Two)
So now we in the hotel
Mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's
I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke well a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke well I'm tryin' to put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they'd love to see us all go to prison or die
Like baby look at how they show us on the TV screen
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it she workin' jerkin' it non stop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin' the more I grow the more y'all stay the same
Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin' to play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make
Coward nigga you a fake
How gon' look in your sons face and turn your back
Then go start another family dog what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay
Rubbed my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin' tracks
Said I know you wanna change the world
But for the night please
Just reach over and hit the lights please

If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don't feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally
And everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself if I was gone who would remember me?
It's hard to tell
Oh well, sit back and sip this Hennessey
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
'Cause plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why?
I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my mama I'd make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know there's more to life
Than macking hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sorta like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they balling like the dream team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm trying to get
Follow me nigga I'm on the prowl
Headed to the top
You watching me nigga?
Then hold it down
Hold it down
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call
It ain't a problem
I can be there
I ride for
Lie for you
I know you'd do the same
I would die for you
So hold me down
When the times is hard I'll be around
So hold it down
And it don't matter how far
I'll be around
(I hold it down)
You was my nigga from the younger days
We grew up
I went to school, you went the other way
But still my brother man
I'm sitting reminiscing on
All of them bitches we was tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink
We trying to bag some new hoes
And if I needed gear you'd let me hold your new clothes
And vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man
A nigga slow caking
I'm broke trying to chase a dream
You just got probation
And I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant
What's next?
Oh shit, my mama doing drugs
At times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness
I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when your mama tried to beat you with that bat?
Shit, remember your chick Nina?
Man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina?
Yo she's still the baddest
I'm just glad that I can holla at you
It's been a while
Until the next time I hear from you
Aye, hold it down
Hold it down
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call
It ain't a problem
I can be there
I ride for
Lie for you
I know you'd do the same
I would die for you
So hold it down
When the times is hard I'll be around
So hold me down
And it don't matter how far
I'll be around
(I hold it down)
These is tough times baby
But we'll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top
I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling
Ain't balling but I have better
A woman with an ass and a strong mind
It's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit
Sometime I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart you don't want me to be no star though
There's groupies after every show
You scared I'm fucking every hoe
And girl I ain't 'gon lie and say I won't
'Cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength
I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids
The love is real
And if we ever part, God forbid
I love you still
So when I'm on the road don't trip
You know I'm down for you
Keep it tight and don't slip
And hold it down for me
Hold it down
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call
It ain't a problem
I can be there
I ride for
Lie for you
I know you'd do the same
I would die for you
And hold me down
When the times is hard I'll be around
So hold me down
And it don't matter how far
I'll be around

To come up to me talkin' bout abortion
This my body nigga so don't think you finna force shit

Said you love me, oh, but now you flipping like reciprocals
It figures though, should've known that you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claiming that they love you just to get up in them draws?
Knowing all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw mothafucker
Now I'm pregnant you don't wanna get involved muthafucker
Tryna take away a life, is you God mothafucker?
I don't think so
This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife
This new life here imma love it
I'm ain't budging, I'll do this by my muthafucking self
See my momma raised me without no muthafucking help from a man
But I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back?
Bout your father and you told me that you hate nigga
Talkin' 'bout he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
'Cause he left your mamma when she had you and he ain't shit
Here you go doin' the same shit
You ain't shit nigga!

And people change like the seasons

She put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh oh, she tellin' him she missed her period like typos
He panicking, froze up like a manikin
A life grows inside her now he asking ""Is it even mine?""
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant dawg?
Could she be lying?
She crying, crying 'cause he acting distant
Like ever since I told you this nigga you acting different
And all his niggas saying man these hoes be trapping niggas
Playing with niggas' emotions like they some action figures
Swear they get pregnant for collateral
It's like extortion, man if that bitch really pregnant
Tell her get an abortion
Uh, but what about your seed nigga?

Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleeping on your level 'cause it's beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way

No such thing as a life that's better than yours

Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons 'cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours

Don't trip nigga, they just words

Niggas don't see the preachers till we dead in the hearse

I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat

Ballin' in the night spot

You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot so
You can look but don't touch
I'll stay on my toes like them White Sox
Cause it cost me a lot
My chain and my watch
They say time is money, but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, than time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can make that back so
Let's ball while we here
Let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year

Nice watch (I know)
Nice watch
No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch
Stack on black, I ain't never been a high roller
Now it's racks on racks
Never thought that I would ride Rover
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
Cole World but I'm hot as shit
Do that mean that I'm Bi-polar?
Young black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas eve
Coach wouldn't let him off the bench, no wonder why they quit the team
But, I'm cut from a different sleeve
Cole World so the wrist'll freeze
Hurry up with your pictures please
I gotta make history
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch

Meanwhile I'm just chopping off doors
Put the front on the back 'cause I'm back and forth
Put the front on the back of the 'bach like a boss
So I fronting on niggas when I'm backing off
Uh, what up Cole, It's your time
Let these niggas know

Whenever you ready, go!

I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologized if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune-well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though, the fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' you do you and I do me
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Well motherfucker, I am
Some things you can't escape; death, taxes, and a ra-
-Cist society that make every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate, even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn it's late
I can't sleep 'cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn
Don't follow me, don't follow me
Don't follow me, don't follow me
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope

I see you cryin', what's wrong there
He did what? He fucked who?
We know the story, what's new?
See I could probably, rush you
Tell you that he should have loved you
Take advantage, fuck you
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same
On different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna score
You got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers
Pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off
You bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like an episode
Why we cheat? I'll never know
Is it 'cause we rap? Heavens no
Lotta niggas rap though, never blow
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be cause my father let me know
That he cheated, and somehow I never told
I never told
""Hey, you wanna be a man?
Yeah I wanna be a man.
A man don't run tellin' mama everything he see.
I ain't gonna tell.
All right then man. You're a man now.
Okay.""
OK, that's what it is, I see the game
The hoes come, the seasons change
The hoes go, we rearrange
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same
The old G's that beat the game
Forever young, Peter Pan
35, still playin', child support, still payin'
Jugglin', bill payin'
Been runnin' round, field dayin'
Wine and dine, meal payin'
With hopes that she'll land
The bed and, get wet then, give head then
You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man
One night stands, no best man
No bridesmaids, or reverends
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts
There go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark
Just to have that shit torn apart
""You know what? I need to talk to you.
About what?
I don't think this is, working out for us.
Why?
I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that's all.
What the fuck?!"""

Come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money of sins by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter
In a city where niggas will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once
My nigga visibally stressed in a mess he's smoking his blunt
What could I say, I can't relate to that
All I do is pray for that
This the city god told me : 'go and make it' at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that

They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York
Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocal sick
That's how success came
Once kings now we pawns in this chess game
Wall street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparation for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world, free from pain
And we no longer scared at night
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind

Till eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake
Should've been in the States, property of the Jakes
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake
Let me properly immigrate you to it
Show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen
City's you never heard of, from the streets where they murder
Police observe us till they reach the verdict
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all
If you can't send 'em till the pen, send 'em to the morgue
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad

Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was 9-7

Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that,
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpacking, that's hip hop

By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her ""Hey, what's good?
""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood

Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""

Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily

83,Nothing Like It,2001,Return of Simba (2001),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Yeah, Pistol Pete flow, smoke like a swisha sweet blow
Cole world, get ya Pea Coat
Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so
Ain't no mystery why there picking me for
I've been hot since '97, I ain't Mr Cee though
I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy
I'm skinny, didn't eat so I'm hungry like a hostage
Finally seeing money so it's funny how they eyes lit
Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on
I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn't get on
One time for my city bitch I'm putting it on
Like a condom when I'm with your girl, ballin' like it's intramural
Back in middle school, hoopin' to impress the girls
We was young and disconnected from the rest of World
I reminisce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl
She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves
Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned
From her, wasn't nothing like it
We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back
I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that
Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that
If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her
But was just a virgin, couldn't make it past flirting
Now I'm taking baths with their naked ass jerkin
""Make It Last Forever"" playing in the background
You can take it as whatever I was laying that down
She gon' hate my ass forever, I ain't bring her back round
But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected?
Sending all them text'es, spillin all your stresses
We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast'es
I never disrespected, I'm clever nigga check it
I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message
This is Cole, ain't nothing like it
So girls don't wanna fuck him, now they wanna f-ckin' like him
And hope he fucking wife em
Yeah, nuttin' like him
Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh
Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas
A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me
Rappers throwin' jabs but it feel like nothing hit me
Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me
Scratch that, can't impersonate perfection man
But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan
Now uh uh apparently, some of y'all comparing me
Either you blind as hell or either you just don't care to see
Don't make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me
Go fuck around and get your new favorite rapper embarrassed, see
I'm the supplier of that fire and the kerosene
Don't wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired
Just know the shit that I'm dropping, take you a lot higher
These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs. Doubtfire
How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire
The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes
You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies
I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it
I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it
I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it
Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it
Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret
Until the world find out and then y'all gotta shed me
Till then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me
Yeah you fucking hear me, nigga
Yeah, yeah"
84,Once an Addict,2018,KOD (2018),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work it the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know
Why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals""
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be-
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go

I got bigger problems babbay
So why ya talkin' about the money that I owe, like as if I didn't know man, it don't mean nothing to me
Cause right now I got my lil boy crying, and my grandmother dying, could you please stop fuckin' with me?
Listen here, I ain't lookin' for no tears, but my brother got a year, and my momma keep smoking that shit
On top of that, I'm broke, please put that in your notes for the next one to call me up talking that shit

Is it this black Mercedez? (Oh now I get it, I get it, I get it)
Or 'cause I'm black? Hmmm, maybe
Hey, tell me why my hands start sweatin' and I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down, so you won't hear a sound, man I'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me

My teacher said, ""Impossible"", but I'mma fuckin' try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules
There's niggas dying everyday, but we don't make the news
Instead they talkin' bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole, top story, Tiger Woods ""be fuckin' all these white hoes""
Anchorman stop snitchin
Cut the commercial, he be texting all the side bitches, hey my goodness
How ironic, on trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding? How you sit above me?
Are you perfect mothafucker, how you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us

She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night
Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
'Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' 'cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', ""Please play!""
For pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

I'll still kill it nigga

You know what they say,
The window to the soul is in the eyes,
So disrespect a nigga, I will close a nigga blind,
Yeah who can hold us? Super focused
Shoot them hoes with the super soakers,
I got 'em so wet, fuck that, more wet,
I'm Hennessy drinking
Wonder what my enemies' thinking,
Nervous? nigga, please.
I'm finna be caking with dough-
So much bread, it's like a nigga be baking.
Walk that's so cold, this shit will need blankets,
Money coming soon, tell my niggas be patient.
We gonna replace those whips with some sicker ones,
We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones.
Hit and run, bigger funds,
But still can't forget to pour liquor,
As I reminisce on them niggas that couldn't come.
Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny,
So I do what's best for me.
I know you think niggas well, ain't no test to me.
On my plate is a meal, ain't no recipe- for that,
Some nigga chill on the tech, no speak, blaaat,
Some niggas will put your chest to feet
I'm talking reckless.
What you expect nigga, I'm flexing,
Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted.
Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted,
'Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted.
What up then? Niggas ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!
Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in.
Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is,
Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus.
About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us,
Looking for model divas that barely speak English,
Fuck 'em while we rich, 'cause when we broke, they gonna leave us,
We earn stripes, looking like zebras,
Y'all looking like Adidas.
We do it for the streets, 'cause they need us,
Got beef? Come meet us.
Ok I thought so,
Y'all niggas are so mad 'cause I floss so bad on bitches,
And with this stroke, I'm Picasso,
Niggas told me good afaso,
Now she yelling out God so much, thought I had her singing gospel.
Shit, shout out to my apostle,
Shit, you know me, nicest nigga in the south,
Yeah you can quote me!
Woo Shit!

At the time of this rhyme, five years till I know thirty
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, 'cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin' jumpin' jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin' laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin' strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, 'cause no father figure
Means you don't got a nigga comin' 'round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin' home these rotten niggas
Blowin' reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo'
To give the young niggas somethin' they could reach fo'
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but I'm a li'l more realer
When it come from the heart, don't it feel mo' iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I'm a li'l gorilla
So pardon me, man, y'all gon' have to pardon me
They say I rep that 'Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It's flowin' out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I'm varsity
No field trip, ain't hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie wit' yo' bitch in it, and listen it, was starrin' me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter that Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I'd fail
It's Judgment Day, I'm here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
Wit' dessert to take, wit' dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin' over
It's like I'm fuckin' Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, I'm ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin' my prime
'Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds?)"

I hate rich niggas goddammit
'Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit
Who you had to kill, who you had to rob
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top dammit.
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator no ladder money
Escalading new caddy money
Worst fear going broke 'cause I'm bad with money.
Crookest smile nigga momma never had the money damn
I ain't trippin'
A nigga Jordan I ain't Pippen yeah
Up the steps I ain't slippin'
Tears blood sweat I ain't crippin, Pierce
A song you can sing along with when you down
On some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home 'cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas you think she out there getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga plus dawg I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crash and only it killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund check she used that to float.
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
On crack use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope
And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Sing,
You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh
How much for your soul and uh
You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh

I hate rich niggas goddammit
'Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now hear my shit and tried to switch now.
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't it more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power
Fuck it more to you, saw through you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for more money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but it just ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watching little Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got now the nigga don't paint the same thang.
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Thinking old school niggas like Dana and Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you're just afraid of change.
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you.
And I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
'Cause I can't maintain no more.
Tad bit extreme I know.
Money can't save your soul.
But there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
Sing,

There's a nigga right now somewhere
He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks
And he's reading the back of the cereal
And in between the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit
And he wants my spot
I'ma find him though, I'ma sign him...
I don't want no problems
Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed
Took my time, crept from behind
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine!
Cole World, same nigga used to drive around with yo girl
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't got a mimic
'Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit
I ain't got a gimmick, I just flow and niggas went nuts for
The boy that set fire to the booth
In a game full of liars it turns out that I'm the truth
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof
'Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose
Let these words be my bullets nigga, I don't rhyme I shoot
Bang!
Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take, my soul to take
Lord I been dreamin' 'bout the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life caper
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker
Our hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan
More than a rapper this a natural disaster
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina
""Shut up, Cole!"", this is for my niggas back home
Homes, waddup bro?
This is for them bitches that played me, waddup ho?
No I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad
2 kids that don't even know their real dad
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic
It's Cole still at it; y'all be talkin' about the same shit
Than how I feel about it, mama was a real addict
That's why I don't respect that lyin'-ass white shit you talkin'
Cole plannin' funerals, you might fit the coffin
Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take, my soul to take
Get on your job lil mane, this ain't Saturday!
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it
But it's just a nigga God invented
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it
Word, this shit ain't vibe nigga, why you noddin' with it?
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me
'Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga
You saved so many hoes, you a hero nigga!
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac
When he slept with Madonna
Hey, this is death before dishonor
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama
She got enough to stress about
My niggas gonna get me out
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set
It goes tick-tock, game on lock
Son gon' shine but the reign won't stop
Oh no!
If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take..."
92,Royal Flush,2009,The Warm Up (2009),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Yep
Da dump dump
This is the... warm up
Ok I roll up, hold up, look at how I showed up
I blowed up had a hole up in my pocket now its sowed up
They feenin for that crack, you know that rock, I got that product
You niggas tryna stop it betta load up
I hang my coat up
Ah I'm goin' be here for a while so I smile hatas
I'm on that green like a flower like a alligator
Now or laters, I'm serving niggas Imma sound waiter
Just tell me what you want, I bring that back an hour later
Look how how I cater, dog what you fraid of, nothing
They talking gangsta, without no data, they frontin
Jackie chan, jean claude van dam straight stuntin, I wish a nigga would say something
Imma carolina nigga boy I got it on my back
Piggyback style I ain't talkin' 'bout no tat
And Imma rep the ville in every city that I'm at
And I guareente I'm bring home plaques
Shout out to my brother zach
And my mother
I love you
Yeah, look,
Ain't that about a bitch this nigga on his own his dick
They say I'm like the human body I produce my own shit
And I toot my own horn, a star when I was born
My name ain't james, my word is bond
Yeah
Shout out to cannibus had a similar line ninety-eight ninety-nine
Damn them was the times
Nevermind dwelling in the past, your listening to the future
Them flows get tighter, them hoes get looser
Then they wanna suduce you like medusa be cool
I said ""I got a girl"", she told me ""me too""
So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood (shit)
Baby don't be foolish, but call her I'll watch her do it
You know
And this is only the warm up"
93,Runaway,2013,Born Sinner (2013),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they?
You see them with their wife, like, ""what's up Tony? Hey man, how's everything going brother?""
""Just taking it easy, hanging out with the lady""
""Alright, take it easy now, God bless you""
You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, ""What's up Tony?""
""Hey, yo, where's the bitches at, nigga?""
Yeah, give me my space, Lord ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, I mean I got no time to wait
Love my girl but I told her straight up ""don't wait up""
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked then made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feeling like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wanna be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowing when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wanna let her down but you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Oh shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying: ""Baby, why don't you throw these bands on me?""
And I came to spend
She pop a molly let the motherfucking games begin
I'm running...
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher says we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: ""Are you sure?
Even the murderer? Even the whore?
Even the nigga running through bitches on tour?""
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit
She losing faith in him and he knows and shit
Like what the fuck is a break, don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got till it ain't no more
No more tears it's been ten long years, damn near
I don't know if I can wait no more, and who can blame her
You complaining 'bout every time you out, you come back she pout
Sleeping back to back, this is wack
We 'bout to go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out on account of your guilt
She's has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evening
And even then, your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you...
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on
Yeah, unbelievable seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age 3 I knew this world was three below
Listen, even know my ego low achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent, yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me: ""Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color their face is""
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
9 months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, cause you
Know your wifey loves you, does you refuse to accept it?
That's that type shit that tell why my granny light-skinned
Rich white man rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains still concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from 50 mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know...
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on"

We came a long way from sticking move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning

Ain't nobody else I'd rather be, not even Oprah's son
Momma's youngest getting paper like the oldest one
We living better guess God felt he owed us one
Closets barely had no clothes in them
So you throw my niggas in hoopty', but we still bag hoes and them
These niggas give they heart and soul to them
I wonder if they know we doving them
Ass fat so when pinch 'em (pincher) like a Doberman
Run up on 'em politicing like Keith Olbermann
What's your name? Where ya from?
Ya got a dream? I'll sell ya one
Come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won't stop, won't stop
Hey and don't stop

There's so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out
But as of late nigga, it ain't been shit to pout about
I turn up the news, my blues seem petty
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out
I'm blessed nigga, I'm blessed
When I'm all alone these words just flow out of my chest
Turn 'em into poems, they worship, I'm the best
And though I'm taking long, they f-ck with me none the less
Yeah, enough sleeping, I put you niggas to rest
The only one saying shit is like a nigga got tourettes, (chyeah)
Unimpressed with you niggas
You the shit only 'cause I digested you niggas
But I digress, boy you bout as G as a f-cking tie dye vest
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest (out her nest)
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won't stop, won't stop
Hey, don't stop

You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself

""With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!""
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us Bama
Laughin' at the grammar 'cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like ""what the fuck you got a deal for?!""
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I knew they gon' feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause ain't nobody tell me why there ain't gonna be no more
Thinking I'ma fall? Don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines
I made it to the Roc, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don't understand is this is all plan
It's a bigger picture and you can't photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I'm supposed to give a fuck
Don't you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb niggas, y'all been lyin' from the start
My life's like a move, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you'll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gon' say was more importan'
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who's to say that who's greater, all we know, they ain't the same
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I knew they gon' feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause ain't nobody tell me why there ain't gonna be no more
Thinking I'ma fall? Don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines"

That's word to everything!
Nigga life a scary game but I'm playin'
You sucka nigga lie in everything that ya sayin'
Shame on y'all, you tryna ball with the game on pause
Ay nigga pull the thing on y'all, y'all stain y'all draws
Fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog
I got protection, lethal weapons, and they aim on y'all
I'm like the man on mars; I'm high as hell
Watch me blow like I exhale I excel in this rap shit,
Cause y'all spittin' that wack shit
And every nigga suddenly be rappin' bout that trap shit
So while you niggas copy cat the cats who made classics
I just massacre the streets, I'm a master of the beats and the rhymes
I'm rappin' for the freaks and the dimes and shine like a mothafuckin diamond,
You shine like a mothafuckin dime
That's word to my mom
I don't mind if you niggas hate
Just know you hatin' on that nigga, nigga get it straight
I'm spittin' hungry like ain't shit up on my dinner plate
The kind a flow that make a nigga hyper-ventilate (ugh)
See let me demonstrate, I grew up with nothin', it hurt me to see my mother poor
The only pops a nigga ever seen around was Huckstable
And so the muscle flow is something you can't get no muzzel for
Look how the buzzer grow,
Ballin till the buzzer blow
Man I'm hungry, does it show?
Ain't nothin' funny, fuck a joke I'm gettin' money till my pockets need a tummy tuck
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanentely
Send you to hell, you meet the devil, sign a permanent lease
Word on the streets is I'm the prince nigga, check the splenda
And I can't wait to be the King, nigga: young simba!

You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me
Down for me, my homie
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave
Know you as tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this on
Thought they knew me, well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell

She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those word hoping that,
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you

Yea, yea, yea
Ay, believe in God like the sun up in the sky
Science can tell us how it can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughed
The beauty of life, the pain never last
The rain always past, the sun don’t always shine
When its gone I'm lonely, but when its there Im fine
I hate the winter time because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think Im a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
Its funny, 100 years ago I woulda called this nigga master
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
Im looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You say Im easily distracted I think the problem is Im easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm tryna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing
I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken hearted pain
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail
Maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard
Nights with no progress
Mane im thinking like I'll probably find a Loch Ness
In the projects before I find this
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Guitar strings have strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sinking this ocean
Leaping through the badness hoping Im reaching for closeness
Feel like the devil keep following me

The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it, ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first the sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard ""Can't Get Enough""
Now she fuck a nigga thinkin' that she may hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, ""The Things Hoes Say""
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
I take you to the promise land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right
I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life
And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off of her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like ""Don't you know this shit already?
Nigga, ain't you rich already?""
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jumpshot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And theirs man's don't know, man's don't know, fa show
Had a nigga's baby, little man's don't know
Mama, was a freak, got it in on the low
12 years later when my song come on, he ask
""Mama, did you fuck J. Cole?""
Whoa
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right
I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life"

How long can I survive with this mentality
Trials and tribulations, I'm facing in this age of information

Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that it faces
How long can I survive with this mentality
How long can I survive with this mentality
How long can I survive with this mentality
My dad died, he got shot 'cause his friend set him up
And I didn't go to his funeral
And sometimes when I'm in my room
I get mad at my mom when she mean to me
And she say, and she say, clean up, I say
Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show my pain, never

Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough
Look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers trying to steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet
I'm real life hot
Homie, get your weight up
Fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot, okay faggot
Don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass
That's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya
Boy Meets World
I'm trying to find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James
Wait a minute that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck
If the hoes like it
I love it nigga nigga nigga
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga
Rap nerd even copped Rah Digga Digga
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like eleven so forgive me
A decade later I be all up in the city
Trying to get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it
It was, fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know
In a year he'd be fucking paying me
What can you say to me
I beat the odds like Vegas
I use to rap about haters before niggas was hating me
Now they hate to see a young Black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free
Pardon me
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov

Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
I'm prince of the city
I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parks where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
So I'm wondering really
What could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops 'cause he's sorry
Fuck the education
Would ask for reparations
But I'm probably just gonna buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in him
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil but now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul
My nigga
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again

I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
This next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati
Is you stupid nigga
Young Black millionaire
Old White billionaires
I'm sure that they could do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would have been a summa cuma laude
Beyonce told me that she want to cop a blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth
I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see them at the Oscars
Re-adjusted my target audience
'Cause it's obvious
I've gone astray
Losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timberland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind
Just the sound of my whole career
Crashing burning
The thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years
Until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here
Mask my tears, but I
My nigga
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again

Yea, yea, yea
Hey, yea, there's no way to turn me up?
If not it's all good
Yea, hey hey hey
I bet they never seen him coming, like a blind bitch you fucking from behind
It's the mother fucking dime, bitch I'm fucking up rewind buttons
My shit is jumping like the prom
Fayettenam on my back like some scratches from your lady
On your mattress where they gave me that
I bet niggas can't wait to pay me back
While they relax, I stay in tip top shape
And I stay up on my toes like some gym socks
Flip, flops
Tell them hater to rehab, kick rocks
Game tight like Ziploc
Hlaf black other half white like Kid Rock
Try to tell it to a Cizz-op
Thought it would work, it did not
He told me ""Nigga stizz-op
You know you is not"", wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked
Fuck, this is for hip hop gassed up like a quick stop
They light a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot,
Even if you squatted under volcanoes niggas your shit not
I'm raw but I kid not
Your shit flop, I give props to the legends
Praise God but I give not to the Reveren's
Looking up to the heavens like,
""Where did all my blessings go?""
You chasing dreams but then you stop, guess you'll never know
I got a show for you to watch heres an episode
Professional, set to blow any minute now
Many women smile, look the lights and the action
And the cameras be calling
You niggas got to log in, bitch you fantasy balling
I snuck up like I planned to be
This ain't randomly recorded
Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that twitter shit
Thought I get a deal then head straight to the dealership
But looking at my deal
I probably can't afford benifitis
Medical, dental shit
Left but I always came back like a rent a whip
Dirty ass game, dog I can run a kennel with
All these bitch niggas who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with
Me I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'
Start talking that ""we"" shit, I pause Nintendo on them
Start talking that beef shit, I turn the Kimbo on em'
I got no words for these niggas I'm instrumental on em'
Yea! And I'll still keep going, keep flowing"
114,Welcome,2009,The Warm Up (2009),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Im sipping liquor for the pain, pouring liquor for the slain
Nothing else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent
In my mind trynna figure where these twenty G's went
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow
Second thought I think I need to speed it up and make more
Time to build, lego
In the Ville' laid low, counting days still waiting on that shit I prayed for
Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick
Feel a vibrate-hold up, I gotta call, old bitch
How she get my new shit? I swear this city too small
Type of chick wont take her shirt off 'cause her tities too small
I can give a damn girl, lift up that pretty blue bra
Now I'm in it deep, seeing just how pretty you are
And that kitty go hard
Lord, I'm up in that, got that type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love with that
At the door with a towel on and nothing under that, saying ""Welcome""
I let these words flow out, like water from a spout
Like rain from the clouds, rush the pain from the crowds
'Cause these words go deep, from my soul when I speak
Then the flows hits the souls of all those that I reach
If I die before I wake, hope my songs live on
Will they miss me when I'm gone?- And if so, for how long?
So much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain
Sit and analyze my thought sometimes wonder if I'm sane
Man, its hard to trust friends, when the paranoia blends with the marijuana
Wonder would this high ever end
Swear I never smoke again, y'all niggas blow the weed, let me take another shot, Man this liquor is all I need
Just to put me in the zone, so far away from home
Nobody truly know me got me feeling so alone
They wonder what's on my mind, what's lingering in my dome
I tell em' ain't nothing wrong, I deal with it on my own
I deal with it on my own."

Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothing like that
Man, it wasn't nothing like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started digging it
I was a youngen straight crushing trying to play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
'Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinking how she ride on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deep and
Wet dreaming thinking that I'm smashing but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said ""have you ever had sex before""
Damn
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I wrote back and said ""of course I had sex before""
Knowing I was frontin
I said I was like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know that
So she done wrote back and told me
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin
Baby you done woke my lil man up
I'm thinking how that body look naked when you playing on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like ""Yeah baby sound like a plan""
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin
Fuck
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
You know that feeling when you you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying ""God don't let me bust quick""
I'm watching pornos to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in her crib now a nigga palm sweatin
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practice
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you a pro, but baby be gentle cause""
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

'Cause now a nigga hot enough to fuck with one of Satin's hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishin' for air conditionin', feelin' God was never listenin'
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy, you failed the mission
Speakin' of positions, just witness how I elevated
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
But then I redecorated, that means my tables turn
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Is try and fail clientele, the only way to earn

Cloud told me, ""Ain't you Roc? Well, where the fuck yo' chain at?""
Guess it's somethin' like your girl, nigga, it ain't came yet
The man make the chain, chain don't make the man
How many niggas do we know with hella ice, but yet they lame?
The cloth from which we came, me and them is not the same
Like we all headed to Spain, they took the boat I took the plane
Dang, that boy sick, now ho's on his joystick
Heatin' up like May weather, dog, I'm on that Floyd shit
Boy stick to yo' day job, said you was hot, well they lied

Ain't sayin' names but we not the same

Straight up now tell me do you really wanna love me forever?
Oh, oh, oh
Or is it just a hit and run?
Well, straight up I tell ya I just really wanna cut when we together
Oh, oh, oh
Come here girl let's get it on
(Work out for me, work out for me)"
121,World Is Empty,2009,The Warm Up (2009),Hip Hop,J. Cole,"Yeah, like I said man, you niggas need to be out there and smoking something man
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, it's Cole, won't lie, won't stop to the race is won
Niggas who be rapping how real they are, usually turn out to be the fakest ones
Carolina where I made it from
Cold world no blanket son
Girls fast how Jamaican run
Puffin on the city where the Lakers from, L-A, L-A, la la
So high everything is a ha ha from me
Dreamin' of the days of a Drop 500 and a bad bitch that will go to Popeyes for me
You can never tell me that I'm not hungry, if you ever felt what's inside my tummy
My mom wanting out, is my time running out?
Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me?
Hope not... hope not... hope nothope not
(My world is empty without you babe, my world is empty without you)
I'm just trynna make it my nigga
Yeah yeah
A wise nigga told me don't chase that cash
Follow your heart you'll make that fast
Does a stripper love to shake that ass or does she wise to erase that past?
Got a nigga in her face just gassed like, baby girl why you take this path?
Stack in his hand trynna make that last, all she thinking bout is how to take his last
Rub tities in his face and laugh, gotta try not to look fake in fact
Alittle more money like a few more 20s and you let that nigga grab your naked ass?
Okay hes gone now
Roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear,
This ain't the life for you baby let me take you out of here cause.
(My world is empty without you babe, my world is empty without you)
She like, Nigga yeah right, do you know how much mutha fucking money I'm making?
Yeah my nigga sit back blow in the air
Only getting high 'cause we close to the hell
Nigga trynna like like Hova oh-well, we broke and that doe coming slow as a snail
Hustle hard till there no inhale
Hit the block like a postman with mail
My brother got knocked now the hold him in cells
My mom broke but she posted the bail
Someway, some how niggas feelin' like the sun down even when the sun up!
Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust
And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked
But, this how niggas was brung up
A mother just trynna raise her sun up
Till a stray bullet got his lungs struck
And the Governor could'ntgive one fuck
While she sangin
(My world is empty without you babe, my world is empty without you)
Damn, told you niggas cold world no blanket
Tough Luck, yeah"
