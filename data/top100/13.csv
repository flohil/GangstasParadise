0,21 Questions,2003,Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003),,50 Cent,"New York City 
You are now riding
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile, I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I gotta ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me? Girl
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers in Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
And in the bed if I use my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a li'l drink you know a nightcap
And we can go do what you like, I know you like that
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me? Girl
Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad 'cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at ya' trying figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl, we make mistakes
To make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me? Girl
Could you love me in a Bentley? Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley? Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us"

'Cause I'm still down,
To get down to let off rounds

My ASCAP check got a nigga new haters.
The condos in Vegas - cause NY freezin',
My strap is the reason that you on the floor bleedin'.
??Coke and?? Young - WATCHIN' 50!
And learned the dope game fast ask Bo-Diddly.
Automatic Mossberg in the all white fur
Shotgun pellets out of snow white spur. [shot] {DAMN!}

Must be goin' crazy.
'Cause I'm still down,
To get down to let off rounds.

2,50 Bars,2002,Guess Who's Back? (2002),,50 Cent,"50 bars of pleasure 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and gone niggaZ gonna remember my name 50
Yo black is flashy like Alpo gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka remind me of nigga that clap me
He ain't the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you try'na get your ass laid out in gilmore
Yes we soldiers, remind me of Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollad like ""What up Conrad?""
Grimey niggaz they loved to get gully
Summer time still had on black gloves and scullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggaZ from Philly would of called him an old head
But he an OG remind me of ChaZ and Bump real low key
Sounded like he didn't know nothing about drama
For this money shit many men do trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled up on the S-Class
Heard in DC he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this a young nigga gettin' it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit
He got knocked, he on lock still controllin' his spot from constop
Pop pulled up in the CL5 his project changed
His man just got fucking murked by Salene
Heard he got it in the range nigga came popped one in his brain
Over some-thing took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there in Richmond main.
In the black 740 I sat, my hat turned back
Bow down baby nelly singing my wrist blinging What!
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise we lost for two pies
Son he smokin' that shit I can see it in his eyes
Comin' up wise emotions closed
An' most buying round looking for wisemen toast
Benny hopped out the Esculade with a few thourough men from B-More
They sellin herion in Maryland reverse back to diesel
Killed like 4 fiends his popularity grew that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to living the dream
City pulled up Goddamn you know his format
Bentley is all marble in the door and floor match
Get the hats out the stash box popped two glocks
Peace ""All eyeZ on me"" 2pac
Everybody knows he a boss he still gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Dime in the blue TS stunting like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max haitin cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peep his style son I know his steelo, He on the d-low
He smile at niggaZ mumbling fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horiZontally and send shots throug h ya
Few niggaZ tried to murk him, most them got found
Some turned away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a Black Hummer he blew 90 on that
Poppin' mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that lets go"

4,50/Banks,2004,50 Cent Is The Future (2004),,50 Cent,"(*Starts off with the beat of Tweet's ""Call Me,""
Then changes over to Bubba Sparxxx and Jadakiss' ""They Ain't Ready"")
(Intro - 50 Cent talking)
Uh, yeah, G-Unit, uh, yeah 50 Cent, uh, yo
(Chorus 1 - 50 Cent, imitating Timbaland)
Timbaland sounds so good, but I might not be ready
I don't know
If I spend a 100 grand on the beat, then we done bumped already
Now here we go
(*Harmonizing over the beat - doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo) (Pee Wee Herman)
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(Niggaz look down to Pee Wee Herman)
(50 Cent - Verse 1)
50, lefty, no gun in my right palm
Bronx niggaz love me, like they think our mics on (WOO)
These rap niggaz not like me, they too soft (yeah)
Get shot down, I get up, shakin' shit off
You know white collar crooks, do jokes on lap tops (uh huh)
Real niggaz snatch glocks, and run up in spots
We can talk Trump talk, real estate, stocks, and bonds
Or gangsta shit, my Rugers and glocks in palm (uh huh)
Danger, ring the alarm, kiss the ring of the Don
I conquer like Genghis Kahn, I said song in this song (god damn)
I won't hesitate to put a knife or a slug in you
And watch you bleed out, that little bit of thug in you
You don't want to bump heads with me, and get hit up
You, you ain't got what it takes to fuckin' get up
Holla niggaz names on records, that shit is played out
But holla mine in your next line, and get laid out
(50 Cent - Chorus 2)
My jewels look so good, and my chain is so heavy
I don't know
If I should stunt for these hos again, 'cause I did that already
Now here we go
(Lloyd Banks - Verse 2)
(Lloyd Banks) I don't give a fuck if your favorite rapper dies, to me that's my spot
I'll celebrate his burial and eat at Haha (yeah)
I've been hungry since a little nigga weed in my high top (Woo)
Face burgundy red, in need of a eye drop (uh huh)
I had the black Delta Force, blue in the front
Back when Jordan was flyin', and Ewing could dunk
Of course, you can fuck now, you was buyin' the shrimp then
Me on the other hand, Don Bishop and Pimp King
(*Harmonizing of ""doo, doo"" plays in backgroud until G-Unit is yelled)
I'm runnin' from a digital Munster
I do this for the hood and every kid in a dumpster
My name is poppin', and I ain't been at it long
My neck's 16, and made Flex drop a Benz latin bomb (G-UNIT!)
I'm the best thing to happen to hip hop
Since (uh huh) ""Life After Death"" and that Tupac shit drop
I'm even good to a white boy with a slick top
Stuck up in the mountains with a gun and the wrist pop
Who? where?, Master P says our watch don't tick tock
I'm cleanin' out my 6 shot, watchin' the Knicks flop
Damn near the whole damn passenger green
That's how my bedroom, look like the World Trade after the scene (smoking)
Breaking news, hijack, bus passenger scream (yeah)
I'm your worst nightmare, I crush half of your team
To me your line up is pussy, three wet Pampers
The uzi will have you shakin' like them G-Dep dancers (damn dude)

5,8 Mile Road (G-Unit Remix),2003,The New Breed (2003),,50 Cent,"(50 Cent)
Yeah... 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo
G-unit!
(Lloyd Banks)
This rap shit plays a major part of my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right
To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'
Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggas rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money
You lyin' your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin' your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!)
By the way, this feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
'Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through my ambition in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, it's probably sendin' out to prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards
(Tony Yayo)
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me ('Cause what?)
'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggas hate when you do good
But when you broke, your friends and your enemies
They love you, they love you
""Cheche, get the Yayo""
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
""Cheche, get the Yayo""
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!)
You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country
Wallstreet niggas, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man into a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustlin' backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you movin' forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
...In PA all day, on the corner of Third
(50 Cent)
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?)
'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you
The shells hit you, you screamin'
Think I'm playin'? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols
Let's get it poppin'
Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon)
Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like ""50 nice chain""
Bellagio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga you see me!
I wonder if you mad, 'cause I'm doin' good
Or 'cause niggas feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood
And it hurts 'cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
'Cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat
You pussy
Yeah, explain it to niggas in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga
Niggas know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga
Read the ""Daily News"" nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
Pussy, let's get it poppin'

Intro: She loves me, She loves me not - yeah - She loves me not...
The fiends need me; I ain't around they bones ache
Detox, Rehab, cold sweats - watch 'em shake
I'm not that ""genie-in-a-bottle""; I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of 'H' man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now you tryin' to leave me. You'll never live without me
Girl I'm missin' you. Come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to your arm, princess stick it in
Relapse I'm back, bitch don't ever try that again!
All the shit I did for you I made you feel good
We have a love thing; you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart you dirty bitch I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen, I don't give a damn if your ass start smokin',
But we have a bond and it's not to be broken!
We got a love thing; girl you tryin' to leave me but you need me - can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing; I can take you higher girl, fuckin' wit me you can be all you can be (2X)
Baby you know on the low your sister been eyein me
I'm good lookin', so you know, soon she'll be tryin' me
I heard she bisexual; she fuck with that girl
But boy oh boy fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world
After the first night she'll fall in love and then chase the feelin'
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote ""Sexual Healing""
Kurt Cobain... we been good friends, Ozzy Osbourne too
I been with Rock Stars - see you lucky I'm fuckin' wit you
I chilled with Frankie Lyman, and Jimi Hendrix's crew
See, this is new to you, but to me, this ain't new
I live the lavish life. Listen, if the mood is right...
Me, you and your sister could do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong; you hyper I make you calm
I'll be your incentive, a reason for you to move on
Let's make a date; promise me you'll come and see me
Even if it means you'll have to sell your mama's TV
I love you, love me back - no one said lovin' me be easy
I love you.
I got you bare-footed on glass, chasin' a dove
That monkey on your back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me bitch... you sit there and listen to 'em
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up; you down they got nothin' to say
But when you call I'll come runnin', I'll always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down; they crowned you prom queen
They know about me; behind your back they call you a fuckin' fiend
Can we just be alone? So I can kiss and hug you
Push me inside you. No other man can love you like I do
Call me Daddy; I'll make you feel good - I mean real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us; it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter - what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes."

But I'm on a mission, you see, there's money that I'm missin'
I got 'em posted, so the move and I'm gonna murder y'all

Other than that, shit, y'all won't get served at all

I went from oodles and noodles to lobster and shrimp
I went from bare bubble coats, to brand new minks
And yo my neck upgraded, my wrist's upgraded
I stay C of F, I ain't got time for Jacob
I'm still on the strip, tryin' to get my grims off
Nigga tryin' to flip and it's a Mexican stand off
I put a hole in your grill, with the nine mil
Dressed in all black, lookin' for souls to steal
Little bit of dust, little bit of cocaine
Little bit of dro, little bit of heroine
A littlE bit of ecstacy
That's why your bitch want to be next to me
We sell a little bit a everything

We got these fiends pourin liters, and they shootin needles
Need to be takin' your connection, 'cause we got it cheaper
Shit I ain't new to this, I met this air stewardess
Who knows the ins and outs on how to get it in and out, nigga

Ya if I put a dress code all black, nine how's and a laser
And the party is an ink pen, bottle, or a razor
Your hollerin for praise ya, catch me in the hood with a model named Taysha
And the swallow game major
These cowards ain't gangsta, they tellin' you lies by sellin you dreams
And they ain't fill ins, they fiends

If you don't got no skills, I get your some more

Got anythin' you want, play us awful hard

My 22's bling, so niggaz scheme
745i clean, this little shell nigga, fuck a triple beam
Coffee pot to cook coke, Joe to smoke, I was born to loc
Method cut the coke, 50 no joke
I ain't ""Scarface"", no women, no kids, I don't give a fuck
Better teach that bitch, and that little nigga to duck
With a P-90 Ruger, I put shots all through ya
If you survive you gonna feel what talent do to ya"

I gave you your style Gucci this Fendi that
Burberry bag shoes and the hat to match
I like the way it look but bitch I ain't buying that
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but no more Prada shoes
When I just wanna chill you wanna go out
See me parle with some other chick you wanna show out
You say I'm wrong when I dog yo ass like I should
Now you reminisce about all the time I treated you good
(Lloyd Banks)
When you think about me grinding my fans
You even got more watch on but it's to much time on your hands
They say behind every good man is a woman
So tash pull up stash the cannon linen
I'll never be your chofuer to the mall
You'll learn to appreciate CD's and posters on the wall
Fatal attractions is mad real
Last bitch I deaded got mad and swallowed 50 Advil's
(Tony Yayo)
They say money make the world go round
Material things make a hoe go down
I see you in your Prada Gucci and BCBG
Bitch I'm rich but I don't trick on GP
That's 5 dollar dresses and 10 dollar skirts
Bitch play the strip and put in work
Birds wanna have my baby since I signed my contract

(1st Verse)
Good evening ladies,
I'll tell you from the start, I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park,
There's lots of activities fun things to do,
And I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you,
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow,
You fear heights when I'm high, hell yeah I go low!
It tastes so sweet, that's sticky cotton candy,
You get carried away, we can start a family.
It's a perfect time for a magic trick,
Girl you know its no fun without the magic stick!
Now watch me, as I pull a rabbit out the hat,
And you can use the rabbit all over your cat.
Applaude now it's the first half of my act,
Started out a pimp, now I'm more like a mac.
I don't need your paper, just don't fuck with my stacks,
Yeah it's like that!
Shorty you ain't gotta take your panties off,
Just pull 'em to the side,
If you want to ride on the roller coaster baby come on and ride,
They go up and down, and round and round, stand up or get on the floor,
Its on tonight,
I know what you like,
I know just how to break you off.
Now you can ride the horse around the carousel,
Exploded trojans all in the hotel,
Put me to the test girl I don't fail,
I work it out, without a doubt!
(2nd Verse)
There's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park,
Have you lust and seductious considering a knot,
Throw a loop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear,
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care.
I really want to thank you for attending this affair.
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here.
I smile when I speak, but I'm being senciere,
And your pass is valid all summer my dear.
So at your convenience you can always return,
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn.
Suck that,
Lick that,
Swallow that lollipop.
Forget that,
Grip that,
Ride it nonstop!
Shorty you ain't gotta take your panties off,
Just pull 'em to the side,
If you want to ride on the roller coaster baby come on and ride,
They go up and down, and round and round, stand up or get on the floor,
Its on tonight,
I know what you like,
I know just how to break you off."

Admit it I made it, I can't be faded

Every hood I go through they fuck with me you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Damn scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me I'll be catching a case
New York is a concrete jungle, where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and your dead
You should be very afraid
I don't know how to behave
I'm tamed fresh out the cage

Think she double jointed from the way she splitted
Got you're head fucked up from the way she did it
She's so much more than you're used to
She knows just how to move to seduce you
She gone do the right thing and touch the right spot
Dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop

In her fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking
All into my set sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watchin' her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, let the ride break it down-down-down

Different style, different move, damn I like the way you move

Beep the air horn, hop in turn the heat on
Pick you up off the streets get your feet warm
She giving sex cause the Lex truck takes unleaded
Big thick thighs, eyes browner than Sahara deserts
Deuce-Deuce, bitches, yeah they caught your eye
And them loud system full of bass and highs
You see that X5 BM
Packed with Puerto Ricans
Bad mommies on the low, just creepin'
Niggas be frontin like they bubbling coke
But they really struggling with a high car note, ha ... (Yeah)

Might see me in the Jeep
Rollin' 'round 4 deep
And you know we on the creep
Nigga, I'm holdin' it

Back seat of my truck lets swing an episode
Fuck a hotel we have sex on the road
I pull the seats back
Put the sheets in the luggage rack
Pull out my balls
And play an Aaron Hall track
I tell a chick ""Bend over, mami""
Hit 'em with the Henny Dick
Now my windows foggy
Its time to party, I got TV's, CD's and DVD's
Now bitch, get on your knees
You could be a model chick or a silly hood rat
Don't cum on my leather, don't stain my floor mats
Where's your baby mama?
She in the truck and I'm blessin her
Undressing her
Make hop out for air re-freshener
I ain't stressing her
'Cause my rims keep checkin' her
She's 21, my rim size older than her
Twenty two's

Niggas say they want beef

They don't slow down to speak

Round here bitches walk round here that the horses have
Rap it get your face stuck on them bricks
I don't really like to exercise but I'll push up on a bitch
Y'all sweet like 99 bananas
That's why I got 99 niggaz wit 99 hammers
They all want a nigga to stop
'Cause I rap slick enough to slip the ring off of Vivica Fox
I'm just a playa that found out where the cokes know
That's why I'mma be around longer than the Oprah show
You and your man y'all both should know
That all it takes is a finger to send you where the ghosts go

Now you got the drop, know their daily routine
So the 2nd rule please leave the crime scene please
3rd rule pick a day, 4th rule pick a time
5th rule pick a fifth, 6th rule pick a nine
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet
So when the shootout you leave him 6 feet deep
8th meet in a fast car with disguise
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
9th rule don't say shit cause Po-Po listen
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system
And the 10th rule don't put a tag on a broken heart
Just put a toe-tag on your mark
And rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend
You better watch where you heading

Better yet like nigga Bookers that made bail
From day one I came in the game they said I was hot
They got scared, ""Cent got money"", and I got shot
You so much pressure on me when you compare me to Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot
What little niggaz say to 50 cent don't matter
I'll fire shots at the ship and watch the seas scatter
My enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
You scared then get the fuck around me

I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga, ugly nigga

I got no friends, fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars, they lay around flowers

And who flip when I call a bitch like she Queen Latifah
Not all the vehicle's is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker

Soon as spring break ho's home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckas

You reach and I'll put a dot on ya head like its part of yo religion
Why party wit a pigeon?
I'm blowin' a 10 'cause Bush handin flyers for a party in a prison
I'm in the gucci vest wit the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
And there ain't problem gettin' dressed 'cause my closet got more aisles than pathmark
Run, move startin a wave
And leave wit 12 shells in ya mouth like a carton of eggs
I'm the young pimp pardon my age
I don't got long hair but if I did she be puttin' my braids
Niggas find what club they at
Take 'em wit us, and run a train on 'em like a subway mac
Get advances from grey agra
See these record labels got most artists gettin' fucked like the gay rappa'
I go the college on the tour
I'm goin' down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
I keep ya ammo clean, text polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hamper that mine into the floor
By now, you probably heard of me
Fresh outta surgery, flashy as a fuck, you gon' have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leavin' wit cha nike's bergendy, White T, bergendy
You match now, back down
Niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
Catch me on the boat wit weed smoke and official gear
Heavy when I toke, C notes from different years
Besly in the robe, re-motes for liftin chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to crib like I'm a cab dispatcha

Like I ain't the next nigga to wear the crown or something
You gonna talk about your chips till we run in your crib
And you gone ask dumb questions like ""Can I Live?""
Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous
If you shoot me your brainless, you said it yourself
I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
Swift enough to snatch the mack and pop that at you
Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell
I've done told Ton and Pok? they better have my bail
But if it's over a mil don't put the crib up dun
'Cause if 50 get free nigga, 50 gonna run
It's best you be a gentleman

But when they see me they say search him

He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne""

And since you said it was nothin' to sweat (what)
That you was outta line so here's what you get
A verbal ass kickin'
Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
Let's see how see how he act's under pressure
Till Makaveli returns it's 'All Eyez On Me'
Till the feds build up cases and find pie's on me

When you puttin' on your lotion I can help you wid that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
The slang I use when we bill may change how you talk
And if I'm focused when I'm strokin' I can change how you walk
It's the swagger that you come for but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin' you, I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nutin' to hide baby I tell you my secrets

(HOOK: 50 Cent)
Bump Dat
Niggas try to stunt on my click
Then when I get on that shit
I bring it to 'em where they pump at
12 Gauge mashberg
No shell in the head
Before you put in work, you gotta pump that
You done hit a nigga with it and you runnin' to polices
Come and take my advice, nigga, dump that
This is serious, these rap niggas, I'm just havin' fun with it
50 Cent, nigga, Bump Dat
(50 Cent)
My son ask ""Daddy why carry a gun, you ain't a cop""
Looked at him and said ""Sometimes you gotta shoot or get shot""
Wanna go to show-and-tell and show the class my glock?
Show 'em the clip
Show 'em the beam
Show 'em how Daddy lean
In the convertible Jag
22 inch mags
For a high school drop out, shit, that ain't bad
I'm not a blood or a crip, I'm doing my own thang
G-unit
Shit, I done started my own gang
I don't go that funny dance
I don't throw gang signs
But I'm a gangsta to the core so I stay with a nine
Think all I do is rap, then you don't know me good
Have Smurf hangin' out the sun roof to light up your hood, man
Cause Lethal ain't never seen Blaco comin'
But if he did ... you think he woulda started runnin'?
And I move with the Doublemint Twins and two macs
And leave you flat your back
Brrat
Take that
(Tony Yayo)
I gotta half a mil deal with no diploma
Ice so blind it give your ass glaucoma
Its hard to live, but its easy to die
So I'm going through life lookin' death in the eye
These rappers ain't gun slingers
They R&B singers
G-Unit, come through with some gorilla niggas
Minimum wage ain't gonna pay the rent
Cause the seats in the coupe got the Fendi print
And this shit right here for the listeners pleasure
I'm still on the strip with the fifth and my ever
Its T-O-N-Y
Stay with a semi
Milk your crack spot - till the shit be bone dry
You think you pump hard? Nigga I pump harder
My phone ring so much, I walk around with the charger
When the D's come around, I'ma swallow my crack
Shit the work out later, and hit 'em with that
If it's a direct sale
I'ma change the bill
Tryin' to push the new Range 'cause they changed the grille
Look nigga we icey thugs
We stay with them things so we stay with some Nike gloves
(Tony Yayo)
Just havin' fun with this rap shit, man
It never stops
My man 50 done put out, what, three albums on the street?
And y'all ain't even hear the new shit
Just keep goin' and goin' and goin'
Motherfuckin' Duracell Battery
It never stops

Built the bullshit, sense of pride inside of me

Look, I don't need no bitch niggaz surroundin me
Get caught you better stick to the codes that you provided B
If you don't plead the 5th you get your whole shit split
So call kingpins, get real money to snitch

I know it sounds hard to believe this bullshit
But sometimes you need money to see who you cool with
See niggaz hustle hard and cop 'em a few whips

Summer heat, hot, murder plots, niggas getting shot
Chrome rims for sixes
One Wheel, One Gixxer
Throw it up, one hand
Wave back at the bitches
I'm silent
Right before I snap I'm violent
I call myself the tussle
Boss in the muscle
Boy I feed your ass brass knuckles
A nigga come creeping through the four
You scared, get a dog
Get a male, because a bitch'll get you both in the mall
Now peep the punchlines I'm punching these are knockout blows
I'm cyber pimping I got sci-fi hoes
This is next-level mack shit
That's why my money stack quick
12 V's V12 half of them triple black bitch
Lust, gluttony, greed, jealousy envy me bitch
Your blinds blurring your vision, see I'm where I'm supposed to be
On top of the underground
Still gritty
Still running cities
Still Em', Dre, and Fiddy
Fuck with me, I'm an usual suspect when it's a hit
Turn up the volume and hear my voice, yeah it's the shit
Pardon me please, can I speak to you
Feel this is something
I'm compelled to do

Pistols and bad bitches
Hustlers and bad business
Rapping was just a hobby, that hobby turned to a million
Had that oxy on sale
You can get it 50 a pill
Sniff it or let it grill
Rap the foil you know the drill
Money, power, and drugs
My only reason to love
Never played cops and robbers, nigga we played Crips and Bloods
Like to the pimps saying who the sluts?
211 on hookers purses
Another double up purchase
Slanging a hundred meters from churches
God forgive me, but the steal was worth it
Man I swear I needed some change, chains and golden rings and thangs
Niggas watch videos and think them dudes went from rags to hardest
For real lokes know that type of thing makes you a target
Either the pigs or I'm gonna get you while you playing boy
Hold you like an animal
Strapped with a bean that's Adam Braun
50 told me ambition wins when your talent ain't working
I say I'd rather relapse
Than reenact Curtis and put that work in

Temperature risin', okay let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho, I'll be a nypmho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I gotcha
Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem
Get on top then get to bouncing 'round like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat you can play with the stick
I'm tryin' to explain baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hands, ha ha

Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch her in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As long as she ain't stoppin', homie I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle it's on
And we gon' sip till every bubble in the bottle is gone
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' till you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got

I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes
Money in my jeans, pockets turn her eyes green
She's seeing dollar signs, I'm seeing reasons why
Never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind
Pretty nigga with a gorgeous gun
You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt, look
There ain't a bitch more dime than me
The thirst is real, she knocking over drinks to get next to me

You outside chasing them hoes throwing your Henny up

Catch him all after the club, tell him to ante up
Anyway, each and every day, I'm looking for a better way
You owe me, you better pay
Ghost, let the Beretta spray
Hood want uncut dope and some better yea
I ain't chasing pussy, never have
Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass
Still robbing, still rolling, still need a mask
Still popping, still slinging, still need the cash

You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man

That means I copped and I went outta town

Feed her mind with knowledge,
Gave her street smarts,
Sh-t you can't get in college,
She's a reflection of me,

I tell her stay she wanna go,
I tell her go she wanna stay,

Because you got your nose up your ass,

I'm smelling my sh-t too now how you like that,
You coulda had this dude and anything you choose,
And that girl you lose 'cause I ain't f-cking with ya,
Shopping sprees drop top hat blowing in the wind,
Coulda been you, living lavish,
Instead it's your girlfriend,
But you tripping while we sipping,
In the back of a big ...

House, cars, kids and a pet name for ya,
P-ssy cat, I told you I'll make it you ain't believe,
I guess coming up it was hard, it was easy to leave,
I think about it maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong,
Either way shorty life goes on,
When your around my smiles a grin,
My thoughts are a sin,
You asked can we try again,
I ain't f-cking with you,
Its on the club jumpin',
I'm tryna to get my liquor in
You want sometin (?) again
I'm staring at your thicker friend,
I guess I'm like Will Smith in the Pursuit of Happyness,
In my hood we all hustle in pursuit of the same sh-t,

Thinkin' I wish I had a gun I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife, I'm finna poke me a nigga
Wishin' I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the caddy
Now those were the days, where crime really pay
9 milly spray, got the xx out the way
The shootout, the shootout
The bricks went fast, robberies went bad, niggas got blast
Niggas kidnap Drew granpa kid
Came through and shot Ms Leak in the head
Wonder why I got a gun so I can get down for mine
You need that, out on the grind all the time

Woke up broke, gun in my hand

Have to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say ""Give it up kid, before I put one in ya wig""
Picture me thirsty, ridin' round foamin' out the mouth
Sayin' ""I don't get on"" I'm'a lay a nigga out
Now diamonds are beautiful, pearls are precious

Why smack a nigga silly, when I can squeeze the nilly (squeeze that shit)
A slug'll split a niggas ass, worst than the philly

It hurted when I left, but I knew I didn't need her
If it wasn't for my seed, I wouldn't even hafta see her
She tried to front like she don't need me, she miss me, believe me
It's that soap opera shit, the bitch watch too much TV
Aight you niggas tryin' to do too much (STOP FRONTIN')
Them little bit of chips you got son, (AIN""T NOTHIN')

You spent your last on that (YOU AIN'T HOLDIN' NOTHIN')
Rap niggas, they actin' like they ready to flip
When I let off a clip, it ain't a part of the script
It's like tradition, rap niggas, dyin' they whips
So I spent a little chips, to bulletproof my shit
You a 6 coupe nigga, but you gears behind
Nigga yours a 92, mine's a 99
Your not in my league, the ghetto taught me tools to succeed

Shorty stay fly that's why I keep her,
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa,
She good if I leave her she got her own visa,
Think about them when you about frontin
Think about stuntin when you think about me,
I'm the boss bentley or the porsche,
Overseas see jet skis slide across,
I love the way you dress,
Now take it off,
Put your legs high on my shoulders across,
I'm racing through your mind but you already lost,
I'm at the finish line and your the friend of mine,
Come on lets ride
Just a lil bit
Everynow and then
God damn girl we used to be friends
Just a lil bit
Just a lil bit
Just a lil bit

I'm thinking 'bout a shipment,

So she thinking bout commitment,

She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread,
That's some f-cked up sh-t
Think about that kid,
I'm thinking what this b-tch thinking when she take me to court,
I pay my child support, what the f-ck she want,
This relationship, shit it's too much for me,
I wanna f-ck be friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees,
She should have what she wants just not for me,
I'm thinking bout my future she part of my past,
She don't care 'bout me she just want some cash,
I'm thinking damn girl, we used to be friends,
How did sh-t become all about ends.
Do you think about me,

In these beanies, in these rags
Live in fantasies, frontin'

Till the shoot-'em-up, bang

Fake love's when your friend fuck your bitch
Don't think with his head only think with his dick
Fake love...
So my friends enemies and my enemies be friends
Don't show no love, don't pretend
Now your man ain't your man if he extortin' you nigga
And your man ain't your man if he shortenin' you nigga
Listen money talks, and bullshit run marathons
When your money's gone, that's when them hoes gon'
Fake love is when a nigga sets you up
How he knew about your chain when your ching was tucked
You know the type that rats you out, sell you out
Get locked, your man ain't gon' bail you out
You got a brand new whip, your shit is lovely
Yeah it's aight, but its rims is ugly
Fake friends, show fake love
You know the type of nigga that'll leave you in the club
Fake love...
Fake love's when your homie give you dap
Smile in your face but he wants your ass clapped
Fake love...
Fake love's when they never be around
But once you get rich, they all get down
Fake love...
Fake love's when your friend fuck your bitch
Don't think with his head only think with his dick
Fake love...
So my friends enemies and my enemies be friends
Don't show no love, don't pretend"

The Hoover Crip, I grew up on Figg I had to dodge them County Blues
Live my life behind the rules
Running from the cops, smash the rocks up under my shoes
Spit out the eighth that once, hid in my face
Bounce spring over the gate, didn't get caught
I guess my escape, nigga was fate
I love the block and all the dogs that kept me safe

I got a gift, I communicate with the afterlife
Apparently, your bitch ass ain't acting right
Niggas killed your man, you ain't gon' get him back?
What? You is tired out? Why you ain't get around to that?
You wander, I travel, I have a destination
I'll be a street legend new version of Pappy Mason
My style? It'll never die, boy I'm immortal
You shoot me down, I'll get back up and keep coming for you
Man on fire, hitman for hire
Them niggas got happy they thought I was gon' retire

Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see
(Verse 1: 50 Cent)
Don't listen to the rumours they say 50 fuckin' crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady
They wrong, I like you a lot I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I call you a bitch then hang up
Probably call you right back and shit
And I have to say baby I apologize, cross my fingers God forgive me for
Tellin' lies
Like Janet Jackson say ""I miss you much, I really wanna feel your touch""
As Bobby said ""Baby I could pass the day, watchin' you model Lingerie""
I wanna spend the night tonight shorty If its okay
You can be my Beyonce I'll be your Jay
I gotta great sense of humour, questions make ya smile then I whoo ya!
You know how I do ya, or do ya?

Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead

Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see
(Verse 2: 50 Cent)
It's New York, to London, you wonderin' what's gonna be the next stop
I told you, I'm'a Don you goin' on ma'dam
After you shop till your feet hurt in Malones
Now take a picture these are moments you can cherrish
They say the scene of me was made for lovers out in Paris
The risers and the believers sayin' ""50 we love you""
But out there, there's no me so I love them
You may not recognize this, the reason I exist
Deliver best than the best so perfection I guess
Just like I miss the stress, I'll pass the test
Everytime I drop, I'm burnin' hot
I don't care If she loves me or loves me not
As long as I enjoy the time that we spent
I don't care, baby we could fuck and be friends
Matter fact we can do it right in the back of my Benz
You know it's me...
(Chorus: 50 Cent)
Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see"

Swords and lords yo but really
My Mac milly spray niggaz lay niggaz
Yo the Cognac make you feel unbeatable
Yo especially when that ass drunk too much
I call up Tony Touch Tony Touch bring the next dutch
Yo I'm all fucked up bent and can't think
While you both stink, don't even care that you sink
Yo impulsive, exclusive, high explosive
Can't even get with, shit I dealt wit
I'm on some other shit, my main script describe the foulness
Panama Canalness, what, yo, I, don't even talk so I'm far from the loudest
Kid, nigga, can't touch this, rush this, yo what
(Talking: yo, switch the beat, now, bless it)
What, I'm bout to fuck shit up, what
Fuck it up *repeat 3*
FUCK IT UP FUCK IT UP FUCK IT UP, what what!?!
We on the lines like the internet
Many will come but few was chosen
Against my set, there ain't a nigga yet
Smoke so much niggaz say I need Nicorette
You say bogie, but you used to say cigarette
Now I know, a new religion, a new beginning
I own women, three-fourths rock and linen
This Middle East shit, father beat shit
Release this, the only place in the world, that pull out cracks pieces
We rock camels, split that ass in text
Yo we bag bitches after we fuck 'em and say thanks
Yo thanks for havin' me, next week your straight grabbin me
Swearin they homeless, sayin' that the havin' me

Runs the play for Seton Hall
Now, outta the blue, you got thug in you too
Yo I knew you, your size shoe was ?due in voodu?
Always, smell like shit, used to call you doo-doo
Never came oustide, in the crib you hide
Scared to death
While we played manhunt, to our last breath
I never chose this life, it chose me
What, LFC, heavy amount with jewelry
Crime Syndicate, nigga livin' this
Never mention miss?
Smoke rain bodies, you had to saw before, before
Yo, you on my dick, I had the lime green on
With the string on, with fatigue on
Fresh Avirex's, cockpit, now from the outlet
Jose Luis Emperor, two shots I blow ta Dillinger
No real Kings like John Dillinger, the politic
What, I'm on some ides in the militant
You either with me or against me
That in between shit make the money stop too intensely
So what the deal is, the generals what the deal is
What the deal is, the devilish thought you can't kill this

So, keep it on the low
But everybody who's somebody already know
A few words for any nigga that get hit the fuck up
My advice if you get shot down, is get the fuck up
Let's go

Man
I told niggaz not to fuck with me they still push me
Figured they'd get away with it cause Tone and Poke pussy
I been gone through static, shot at with automatics
Since 90, when Nas came out with ""Illmatic""
If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
Cause Tommy Matola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny
Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny
With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here
My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
That's why you bitch like me, so I'm a heavyweight
How dare these niggaz take me lightly?
I ain't come to make friends and niggaz ain't gotta like me
My own homie said ""50, you done lost yo' mind""
'Cause I shootout in broad day, run and toss my nine
(Chorus (Different Variations))
Can't find a nigga in the hood, that say ""50 ain't hot""
When I drop, I'm sound like Eminem and Kid Rock
Play the block, with the watch all rocked the fuck up
Jukes me, A week later y'all be shot the fuck up
Born a healthy baby, I wasn't always crazy
This ain't how moma rasied me, this how the hood made me
The D's call me by my government name
I be dumb and shoot up parks
Have niggaz runnin' like ""Jesus Comin'""
There's wet pillows in prison, niggaz cry in the dark
'Cause if they did in the day, niggaz would question they heart
So when they come home, the come home
Walking that tough walk, talking that ""Rockavalede""
Talk'll get you shot in New York - BBLLLLATTTTT
Sex, money, murder, I gotta eat
But I ain't tryin' do Hard Time like Pistol P
See, niggaz uptown understand me in the street
You niggaz uptown'll ""Stan"" me in the street

But dude if you try me, I'll have your ass hooked up to an IV
I'll leave no witnesses when I ride, B
You fuck with me, you see
I react like an animal, and tear you apart
If the masterpiece was murder, I'd major in art.
Niggas knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts (whoo)
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber
Will daint ya, anger will change ya
And make ya aim there and squeeze

Got a money scheme I'm plottin in the county and I'm with it
You cross me and you gon' make a cemetery visit
That's gangsta, you know me I told it, 'cause I live it
Shellcases drop, when that chopper chop
Way up the block, get hit with copper tops
When drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops
This ain't new, niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it
It's not a game, perfect aim, you feel the flame
Up against ya brain, man it's so hot I'll make ya wish it rained

Backseat of my jeep, fuck till I fuck up her make up
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob
Tell her if she like me she should keep me icey
My game fuck with a bitch brain till she think she wifey
Spent a life savings in a day, 'cause she likes me
Committment for me, uh nah not likely
One hour, Vivica, I thought I was onto somethin'
But then the next week, nah man it was nothin' (*gunshots*)
Look into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie
They blood shot red, its gaunja in my system, I'm high
First its pain when you lust for love, then its smooth and calm
Feel the rush, like a needles in your arm
It's a cold world baby girl, lovin' me is not enough
Find out when you fuckin' broke, love won't get you on the bus
Man you should see the pretty bitches that be sexin' me
They suck cock that make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me
Hundred percent thug, freak too, I'll taste your love

Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty south?
One time
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again, just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again
For all you slow muthafuckas I'm a break it down iller
See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
This here get ya seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with Easy Rider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects workin for fifty on five-hundred
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize cat
Heart me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pat, how he go out like
That?
Rumors in the hood was ?? was snitchin
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSX-R
Had the four-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I thought of names of games who dealt with pies
Like L-A-N-Y's, L got shot in the neck, then told us connect
Them niggas who shot 'em got 'em for ten bricks
Fuckin' Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Quran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Remmy and Joe
And Prince and Rightous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles through the hood, I started learnin
Life's a bitch, with a pretty face, but she burnin
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through wips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facin
Go against crews like B-Bo and killers like Patty Mason
A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizin, but son I'm dead serious
Montanna was no dummy, brought Benice to watch the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
FEDs couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about yo
The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy, Jamaican Pauly, Ducky
Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick, shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Comin' up I heard sippin to much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
I'm forgettin Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin, and started robbin diners
Shout out to Clanvis and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will

Thinkin' bout nothin' more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard, when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A OLD G told me God's favorites have a hard time
You out the hood, that's good now stay on the grind

From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's staying the same
How many of them boys is with you?
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with the snub
'Cause, niggas do alot of slip talking in the club
Till they coughin' on the rug
I ain't ever had much but a walkman and a bud
My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug
I've had enough, they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an R.I.P. shirt and my coat
Now I'm seein', reminiscin'
All of my weed here, never listen
If I see him, then I'mma lift him
And maybe I oughta even the score
But if not, It'll be me on the floor
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
I started out at 15 scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and I made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that Lou Deuce Deuce and my Triple Phat Goose
Sippin' Easy Jesus, rockin' the Leases
Mama whip me when she find my pieces
I look back on life and think God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look Mayne, It's a hood thang
That's why I'm loved in Brooklayne
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time, homie I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout born to die
I take the bullets out of 50, put 'em in my 4-5
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven-figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me"

You can't body the kid, you know how I rock
Went from pumpin packs on the block, to straight to the top
So the money ain't a thing now, yeah that's right
Mansion after mansion, next stop the Hampton's
I splurge with it, I'm so absurd with it
Got the hunger to go get it, 'cause I wan' go spend it
You know how a boss play a play, nigga I'm ballin'
If there's money to be made, I'm all in
Catch me in the cherry-red porsche, bay seats, red pipe, and
You want me to teach ya how to stunt, aite then
Tattoo's on the arm, 30 carrots on the charm
'Cause the flow be the bomb, learn to respect the don
First night if I don't hit, second night I'm on some shit
Third night we call it quits, I ain't fuckin' with the bitch
Success is much of a choice, I'm high off life
Another move, another mill, let's get right aight...

Ma I got a fetish, fuckin' in them porsche trucks
Curtis got one so when I finished I tossed her
Y'all in to wifin', we ??could throw?? wife in
Only fuck with bitches that got their liquor license
Shot high prices, shook all vices
Imfamous nigga, got the game in a vice grip

Anything less, we rollin' them dices
Nuts in the sand if you ain't bumpin' my shit
Shorty wanna rip to my sound in my ??light booth?

If there's beef, cock it and dump it, the drama really means nothin'

There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you wit them thangs out (thangs out)
I do what I gotta do I don't care I if get caught

I'll kill you - I ain't playin', hear what I'm sayin', homie I ain't playin'
Catch you slippin, I'ma kill you - I ain't playin', hear what I'm sayin',

In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch that's a good 'nuff reason (wooh!)
I've seen gangsta's get religious when they start bleedin
Sayin' ""Lord, Jesus Help Me"" 'cause they ass leakin
When that window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya lil handgun until you run out
And you can run for ya back-up
But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up
God's on ya side, shit I'm aight wit that
'Cause we gonna reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck, ya luckier then Lady Luck
Look nigga, don't think you safe cause you moved out the hood
'Cause ya momma still around dog, and dat ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
'Cause I'd get tired of lookin' for ya, spray ya momma crib, and let yo ass look
For me

My heart bleeds for you nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in yo eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga you know the streets talk
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind, I'm down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today, I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts that I've been in I'm by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now, shit changed motherfucka I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shootin' fin'nin to get get shot it won't do 'em no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fuckin' hurt when it rain
Oh you a pro at playin' battleship well this ain't the same
Lil homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers and up in shackles and motherfuckin chains
Or laid out in the streets leakin' out they brains

After the fist fights it's gunfire boy you get the best of me (best of me)
If you don't wanna get shot I suggest you don't go testin me (testin me)

Fin'nin to run rap 'cause Dr. Dre got the recipe (the recipe, recipe)

From Wichita down to Queens, fella controllin it
Holdin' it, get what I'm supposed to get
Check out to check a lot of hoes in it, add another O in it
Up to par a nigga loves gleams with the glow in it
Twenties on the Caddy truck, ask me how I pose in it
Ride past Jake, doin' 80 in the rain, pah
Stupid nigga follow me, now we in the graveyard
Send dogs to sniff powerful nilli (?)
I send 'em back stiffer than notes special delivery

Shit I'm gettin' hotter and hotter, when I rhyme
50 Cent, southside, niggaz know how I rock
I post up on your block with the glock like a beat-walker cop

Niggaz go against the grain that, fuck is they thinkin'?
I'm bout to jump-start a head open to see what they thinkin', c'mon

You get cooked alive and dropped off on Kelly Drive

I'm the board of beat, big like Shanique from up the street
Now after dark, the shit starts, I plays my part
I see the NARCs stash my coat then hit the park
Don't wanna get knocked, for sixty rocks in a sock
You know the ghetto's red hot, gots to shot that on my block
I keep it strictly business, it's unfinished if there's a witness
I take it personal when bitch-ass niggaz start to snitchin

Rich as a motherfucker, and ain't much changed
Open my eyes, no surprise, I'm with a different bitch
Different day, different ass, different tits
Strap under my pillow, I done went legit
I'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget
The true principles of life are supply and demand
Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand
My man got knowledge of self and my back, God
Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off
My temper volatile, grew up a violent child
Fuck a boy scout, I air your ass out
Nigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck
Shoot a couple head cracks, leave wipe you up
I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage
Gold medal around my neck like I won the Olympics
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on
These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on
Hold on
We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view
Instead we get the D's in the rear view
We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played
And so you know, you violate, you supposed to be sprayed
It's not a big deal to me, stay calm
I'll shoot the shit out of a nigga, then call it Barrel Bonds
But, if I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done
Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we of one
Used to do graffiti, now look we major
Don't make me write my name across your face with a razor
Re-Up, new coke, they say this sample the bomb
This shit can take a two and we cut this bitch with a one
Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency
No lactose involved, pure coco leaf
You can sniff that or cook that to my belief
That money coming in like we run the streets
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on
These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on

This shit go how I said, go when it's time to expand
So say it's over your dead body and that's the plan
You a gangster for real, you ready to ride?
Nigga, you gonna die a bad case of too much pride
Check my DNA, homie I'm a different kind
Hit the speed dial, that quick I'll get ya lined
We don't want your block, just cop your work from us
Those niggas you call allies can't be trust
That Rollie all gold, I got the Midas touch
Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff
On the phone I heard 'Ya smacked the shit outta a kid
Now Jimmy got life, gonna smack him again
When it's war, it'll be war to the very end
If they ever say we lose, I start it again
Let's sneak the niggas spray that Semi at your momma crib
With a silencer we couldn't even hear that shit
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight

R.I.P B.I.G, R.I.P P-A-C, R.I.P niggas that wanna OD
Aiyyo the bottom line is I'ma crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize nigga I'm straight from the street
These industry niggaz startin to look like somethin' to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ""You wanna see her again?""
Get your ass down to the nearest ATM
I have dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch
And I'll wake up early and bounce with all da shit
When I apply pressure, son it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweatin starin' down at the barrel of my nine
Since these Harlem World niggaz seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, ""Tell your man""
Mason Betha, haha, come up of that watch now
I mean right now""
The only excuse for being broke is bein in jail
An entertainer can't make bail if he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plottin to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold like 4 milli, got something to live for
Don't want no nigga puttin' four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll man handle Mariah like ""Bitch get on the ground""
You ain't with Tommy no more who you gettin' chipz from now?
I been skeamin on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto nah for real son I'm sick
I'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gon catch me son?

Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger

Don't wanna be a playa no more

Tell Sticky gimme the cash before I empty three
Ill beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Cannibus wanna battle while I'm stickin them up
Fuck the can get capped coroners pickin' 'em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, nigga try to saw ya
He said ""Why you robbin me I got _Nuttin But Love_ for ya!""
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep
One at a time get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep stickin niggas until I'm livid
I'll rob Boys II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens
I'm hungry for real I'm bout to stick Mister C
That nigga still eatin off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enuff I told him ""Gimme Some More""
Is you feelin' this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbin Gods People
(Madd Rapper)
For real yo you know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas got to get stuck up that's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga
It don't matter, if you got it and I need it I want it
50 Cents ain't fuckin' around
Track Masters ain't fuckin' around
Crazy Cat ain't fuckin' around

From the beginning, it was written I suppose
I break a whole on the 36 ounce
And move it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes
But dig it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
Get on my level, bitch, I'm careful who I kick it with
We talk market and distribution and politics
Got a chip on my shoulder, chip off the whole block
I sell the chip of a whole rock, 10 dollars a pop
I'm a magnet, the bitch can't help but watch me
Socks, drawers, undershirt, Versace, Versace, Versace
Designer threads in every form of fashion
I express myself so the question I'm askin'
Is this flip or the next flip tailor 50 shit?
We ain't promised tomorrow, nigga, go on and get the shit
That skull and bones, that Alexander McQueen thing
In case you ain't notice this a Queens thing
From the beginning, it was written I suppose
I break a whole on the 36 ounce
And move it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes
But dig it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
Oh, it's cold out here
It's my kind of weather, I'm cold blooded
It's 50
When I come through you see me
In the Suburbans that's bulletproof, bomb proof, leather six, what else?
When I go hard I go hard
When I don't want you to see me I switch it up
I'm in that black on black Porsche Panamera
In the back like ""Ooh wee!""
We rolling
I hustle, man, it's what I do, man
Wait, niggas gon' try and tell me how to do this?"

Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
You know, it's real shit, feel this!
America's got a thing for this gangsta's shit, they love me
Black Chucks, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take spills over raymo shit, I'ma fan
Got that silver duck tape on my Trey Eight handle
The women on my life bring confusion shit
SO like Nino from New Jack, I'll have to cancel that bitch
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze up
I build an empire on the low the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that coco leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homey I'm just triple beam, dreamin'
Niggaz be schemin, I'm fiendin to live a good life
The fiends just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way when while I'm tryin' to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want to find the thing that's in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
Black talents start flyin, when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
Man my cold days, they called me chef boy are 50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed shit
Send me them seeds I'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib that's chronic
And I'm sellin them 500 a pop god damn it
I sold everythin' I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA of a crook
What goes in my mind, it's contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If the rap was the block or spider, I'll be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin' money man
It's a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin'
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
In the jewels with your chains
I upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Played it perf and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender and make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he don't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey they can't stop me

Na nigga I don't know
I don't know who got you, I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know 'cause you know how my squad do
(Verse 1: 50 Cent)
Now a days niggas snitchin' so much in the street
But you gotta talk to them like they the police
Na, I don't nothin' about poppin' the heat
I don't know nothing about settlin' no beef in the street
Na, I don't know nothing about baggin the grams
I ain't neva had no spot over hand and hand
Me, I don't know nothin' about taking a stand
I ain't neva get a nigga ass stuck in the can
Na, I don't know nothin' about dro or hash; coke, dope, X, dust, or crystal meth
Na, I'm just tryin' to rap to get me some cash
Keep the hip-hop police off my ass

Na nigga I don't know
I don't know who got you, I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know 'cause you know how my squad do
(Verse 2: Prodigy)
Ayo, that's my word on a stack of bibles
I don't know who did it, I don't know who resbonsible
Though I know who spit and all I know is who givin' me this cash just to down 12 to get in yo ass
Listen, keep it far away from me, I ain't got time for sittin' in the penetentary
All I know I'm rich, all I know is that g-unit work, when the album drop they go bizzerk
Mad Video play, crazy radio spins, Number 1 all the time, our reign never ends
Don't point the finger at us, somebody shit hangin', they had a beef with us 'cause we don't know anything

But you think I know 'cause you know how my squad do
(Verse 3: Spider Loc)
I don't know nothing about jumping out, splittin' homeboy head
It's really fucked up 'cause they say that homeboy dead
I can't even think who would want him dead
Have no idea what type a gun they have done him with
You see I hear no evil and I don't see no evil
They tryin' talk to, hear from, and see those people
And I ain't have them little homies burn up no regal
I'm just tryin' to do this music thing and just go legal
I don't know why my name in yo female phone
But you really starting to sound like a female homes
Don't know why they told you we sell stones
We in the internet tryin' to get our e-mail on

Na nigga, I don't know who sent the young boys through
To air the strip, this shit just ne happinin' out the blue
I don't be around here, I ain't hit the news
I don't know now why that man be clutching on his shit when he move
I don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewles
You know how easy it is to get shit confused
I wasn't even in New York, I was just on a cruise
Somewhere way out in the islands, with yo bitch in the cruise
Oops, my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze
They get hit with the uz, ooze all over the street
I don't know why they say what's up, I don't know who's in that jeep
He talk about me all day but I ain't losing no sleep

I don't know, why my chram about as big as your palm
And why the diamond chain I wear is bout as long as yo arm
You tell me, how many diamonds in my bezald
There is one, for every time I had to grind up in the ghetto
I can show you how to do it, you tired of ridin' Buicks
I don't know why niggas rap for years and can't make hotta music
Even when, I don't do chicks release, body fluids
Body drop, shotty cock, and niggas wanna tie me to it
I don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy
Why these Harlem CB4 niggas just keep, comin' at me
Got as many beefs as 50, and a nigga go to church
Could you image if my hands was in work
I don't know
(Chorus: 50 Cent)
Na nigga I don't know

It is what it is man
Sirens flashin', you know the routine, the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin', course full of diamonds he bought
Grindin', his foot slipped off the ladder of success he was climbin'
The D's came through, asked the niggas if they knew what happened
Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin'
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a line up last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, a little crack
Figure, I push it to the limit, take this shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm, fully loaded fire arm
First to let off, last to run, every time its on
I tell niggas to suck my dick
Get the fuck out my face
'Cause I don't need 'em
'Cause they're never around
When I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'
What, niggas yeah
Is there a muthafuckin' problem nigga
Oh yeah
That's what I thought so, pussy
Niggas be talkin' about me, they always callin' me crazy
Fuck them O.G. niggas, they stuck in the eighties
Sayin' they gonna do me somethin', now you know that's a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong, I'll let that hammer fly
I'm rich, I still wake up with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move or get caught in the cross fire
Up a fence runnin', cut my fuckin' hand on a barb wire
Shits crazy, just a different day, it's the same shit
Hollow tip part in ya head, leave ya whole fuckin' brain split
They sit, they see me in the Ashton Martin
What's the matter, they can't get that Hoopty started
Thought they was grindin', well goddamn where that money at
Thought you was fucked, cause you was lettin' paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter of fact, you's a busta
I don't trust ya, I shoulda sent niggas to touch ya
I tell niggas to suck my dick
Get the fuck out my face
'Cause I don't need 'em
'Cause they're never around
When I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'
What?
Who said they gonna do somethin' to me
You must be out your rabbid ass mind
Fuck around and kill one of these niggas."

 I'm rollin' in the dough, I'm caked up
 I got swag now, I got paper
 I'm swimmin' in the dough, I'm caked up
 Gettin' paper's my objective, yup, now your chain gone
 One false move and clap, now your brain's gone
 You like me, you aight with me, me? I'm into me
 I destroy my enemies, even if they're kin to me
 Do 'em like the Kennedy's, ching-ching that's mo' bread
 Say somethin' slick out yo' mouth I'll come for yo' head
 She likes me more than you can imagine
 Bad bitch, look like she fell up out a pageant
 Closest I'ma get to heaven in this lifetime
 Is right below her waist, in between her thighs
 Call her Pussycat, that's my nickname for her
 And I ain't got to buy shit or run game on her
 See when I stunt she stunt, we stunt together
 Oh, you don't like how that sound? Aw nigga whatever
 We both rock Bugarri, both push Ferraris
 I go so hard in the paint, I'm sorry
 I don't really think she want me back then
 She want me now
 She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend
 She like my style
 I got swag now, I got paper
 I'm rollin' in the dough, I'm caked up
 I got swag now, I got paper
 I'm swimmin' in the dough, I'm caked up
 You want me? I want you
 Plug one? Plug two
 I'm infinitely special, girl the Lord's gonna bless you
 If you do what I tell you to do
 You want me? I want you
 You want Benz? I'll buy two
 You should want me like you want success
 Girl with us together we'll be better than the best
 Why settle for less?
 I don't really think she want me back then
 She want me now
 She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend
 She like my style
 I got swag now, I got paper
 I'm rollin' in the dough, I'm caked up
 I got swag now, I got paper
 I'm swimmin' in the dough, I'm caked up"
98,I'll Still Kill,2007,Curtis (2007),,50 Cent,"(Chorus - Akon)
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the 'hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga but I will
If I got to, kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around, if niggas get to fuckin' around
(Verse 1 - 50 Cent)
Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire if you can catch one in ya wig
You see the Testarosa the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal a infantry, I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga I'll be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what'cha friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of ya ass off
I'm not for the games I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain, when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit' words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah
(Chorus - Akon)
(Verse 2 - 50 Cent)
Where I'm from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prauers for me
I come creepin' through in the 'hood wearin' teflon
Hit the corners muthafuckas get left on
Niggas know, if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I fill ya back wit' mac rounds
Ask 'Preme nigga 50 don't back down
I keep it funky like fiends in a crack house
Cross the line boy I'mma air ya ass out
Screw ya face at me I wan' know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business wit' 'em I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it 'cause I grind
All across the world like the globe's mine, yeah!
(Chorus - Akon)
(Verse 3 - Akon)
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a mac aimin' at'cha head mayne?
Before you know it life is flashin' reminiscin'
And ya body is drippin' and full of lead mayne
I done been there, I done cocked that
It ain't never been a question I'm 'bout that
Don't go there, ya can cock that
And if ya plan to fuck around then reroute that
You never catch me ridin' around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit' dumb-d's
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Seabreeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I'll be long gone like the Ripper, so

There is the coke, the cash, the combo and the safe
But she don't know it, damn, ok go away
I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone
Put a gun to her head sayin' daddy come home
You was rollin' poppin' bubbly, didn't think it get ugly
In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin' you
When I'm not in the jam, I write in my hand

Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waitin' we can startin' waitin' on tomorrow

Ah man
You know where the niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em
(Chorus- 50 Cent)
All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
I'm down to ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm down to ride tonight
We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded
Somebody gon' die tonight
(Verse 1 - 50 Cent)
This is nothin' new, I been in the position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old mac, new clip
Thirty two hollow tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I have 'em tongue kissin' my tec
Wanna come test me, pussy boy don't try
Police responds, never fast enough, to satisfy
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' wit son
'Fore we find out where ya bitch gets her hair and nails done
Its elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row ya boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper, you take a life or ya life get took bitch
Sometimes, I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel
(Chorus - 50 Cent)
All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay

We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm down to ride tonight
We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded
Somebody gon' die tonight
(Verse 2 - 50 Cent)
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall, I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that keflon vest shit, that wild wild west shit
And eighty one 1 carrot stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make mothafuckas wanna kill me
Every projects and every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, had my mom been with me
You could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me will shorten your life span
Hold the mic with my left, the knife in my right hand
(Chorus - 50 Cent)
All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
I'm down to ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm down to ride tonight
We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded
Somebody gon' die tonight"

Rule number two give respect where respect due
Rule number three if you get knocked play games and say names
(Gun click sound) the 45 will tear you out the frame
It's like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fuckin' thing
To me ain't nothin' changed but the things my money bring
My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
Whos peoples got pleany money actin' like they ain't got bail
I feel for you niggas gettin' shot while I'm sayin' this rhyme
Or niggas in the mess hall gettin' shot on chow lines
An old timer schooled me said don't burn bridges my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo ass gotta swim
I watch the fifth melt a nigga on the sidewalk of New York
Me and shorty saw from afar and had a talk
He said I told 'em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word
Look at his head its still shakin he had alot of nerve

I'd probably have to double Back bubble crack)

Yo when the fed come in the game loyalty is limited
Hardcore niggas start actin' feminine
With the feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke you get ten you'll damn near do nine
Hate a liar more than I hate thief
A thief is only after my salary a liar is after my reality
The streets I know'em like my ABC's
Stay away from the D's and stack ya cheese
Try to see three hundred g's fore you see three hundred C's
Tree top to feel the breeze co connect for key's
Yo bitches sexin me take me to ecstacy
Once I nut (ah oh shit) I don't want 'em next to me
If its on mother fucker believe I'm gonna ride
I'm the type to swallow my blood fore I swallow my pride
Letters on my shirt read DKNY
Got grimy niggas runnin' with me from BKNY
They say I don't sound like a killer well how a killer sound
I bet I grab a foe pound and back that ass down
See many men live baby and many men die
Many men get drunk puff lah and stay high
Here's a jewel love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same friends always change
I don't quit that there's more that one way to skin a cat
You can get him in the face dog or down his back
All bullshit aside now its time to be honest
I fear no man for death is all that's promised
I got niggas standin in line waitin to hear me spit
From eighty six to ninety six the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin' to shine
I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
Don't nothin' change in the game but faces and names
Skate to wait to date and the jake"

Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's up's and down's, so I stay on the grind
Niggaz on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
They ain't nothin' they could do to stop my shine
This is God's plan homey, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma; who always gotsta put in her two cents
I'm the drop out who made more more money than these teachers
Ruthless like the Coupe but I come with more features

Catch me in the coupe - on the lean
Wit' needles and samples and diesels for the fiends
The money stay on my mind, so I stay on the grind
Plus niggas like to stun, so I stay wit' my nine
I ain't the type nigga that be out, runnin' his mouth
Talkin' gangsta and shit, with my gun in the house
Now homie, you better get to know me better
Before you be bleedin' pints of blood into Iceberg sweater
When the tails come flyin' up out the beretta
You gon' feel like it's yo' fault and say ""Man I knew better""

I pull that thing out I'ma spray that shit
That how I get down

If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned

Country came around, hes into clappin

The cycle never changes, shit just starts again...

My niggas hungry, they hit a lick
Fuck who you're with, niggas'll dump a clip
We by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid
I caught a A1 felony on my last bid
Kept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit
You think my rap shit a gimmick, I ain't seen parole in a minute
Truth be told these niggas is hoes
Once the shit set off, man, anything goes
Through the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie
If you ain't scared to die, nigga, why would you cry?

See him in person, say something, I doubt that
Rather get caught with it than get caught without that
Trying to back peddle and stumble on the curve
You stayin' at the ground, you mumblin' your words
Literally I can see your heart pumpin' through your shirt
Pussy your whole life, you always been a bird
Scared for so long it's all up in your nerves
Screw 9-1-1, you probably call up the reserves
And I'm killin' you first, if we ever do a purge
And you know what it is, kid, whenever we emerge
And I'm tragical, traumatical, no match, incompatible

Dead or in jail, Heaven or Hell
FEDs on my coat tail, snitches given court tales
Kept fate when all hope fail
Niggas rattin', all they missin' is the tail like Mickey Mouse
Call me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth
I bring them hammers out, we ain't trying to build a house
Niggas on them songs rappin' shit they ain't about
I'm from the N-O, we don't scrap, we bang it out
Bang, I'm the one that came in your house for the chickens
Left a nigga brains hangin' out like we chillin'
Stankin' like shipments, over my shillings
Hump your security, Rida gang in the building

BLAT! Wutup homie
For niggaz who don't know me
...They wanna blow me 'cause the shit I floss wit sayin' a lot for me
I came into rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
I Serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown
Coke price go up, cats is come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
The bitch who hustle for me, they don't even stash cracks
They keep it on em, right there in they ass crack
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin' head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't goin' nowhere, so get used to me
Old G's look at me and see what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to soap
The thug, they pop shit
The thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to whole brick
Nigga ain't in his right mind, goin' against me
My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see

Make me catch her on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six
I'm not a marksmen while spark it, so I spray random
Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear ""He say, She say"" shit
Unless he say she say she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggas who fuck wit me get shot up
I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up
You soft dawg, don't be puttin' up a crazy front
I stay wit the Mac, 'cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood they be like, ""Damn, 50 really spitted on em""
""You heard that shit?"" ""Yeah, 50 really shitted on em""
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You just a small player in this game, play a part son
These cats always escape reality when they rhyme
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt wit dimes
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
Nascar, truck wit a crash bar
And TV's in the dash, pa
See 'em in the five wit stock rims, I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't tryin'
I ain't lyin', I sit Don P till I split up
Keep my wrist lit up
Get outta line, I get you hit up (Woo!)
Now if you say my name in your rhyme, watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MC's that can kill you in eight bars:
50, umm Jay-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playin', you get killed like that
Actin' like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me nigga, (what, what)

D's tryin' to plant a murder on me
In the precinct they sayin' I done murdered homey
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homey
And e'rybody know my niggaz buried him fo' me
You see Hamo on your crib it ain't a burglary homey
They fin' to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the stickin when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait! I'm gettin' sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksuckin detectives got it in fo' me
They flash the lights they wanna rough me up
Frisk me find my burner and cuff me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new people who gon' behead burns
Huh, we'll find out when niggaz let off the rounds
And his partner's screamin officer down
Police get in the way, I'll murder dem
I'll murder dem
A nigga already got three strikes, I'll murder dem
I said I'll murder dem
Any motherfucker touch me, I'll murder dem
I'll murder dem
You don't believe me wait and see, I'll murder dem
You see I told you I'd murder dem

They sayin' I'm an accident waitin to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waitin to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies, from sellin that crack shit
And the third one, came from showin niggaz my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggaz crawlin under cars when I start to cappin
So they don't know what to say to the Captain
But they know if word get back, somethin' gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitchin where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown

Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
'Cause I'll come and take your life away
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Sunnny days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block, twisting trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock, doing life behind bars
I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psyic says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
Hamo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fukcing breathing
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men

I've been wantin' to fuck wit' you for quite a while
Is the money makin' you wanna fuck with me?
The money gonna make you sell your soul

Whoa... if money's gonna make me slam these hoes... then all right
Whattup Shorty, I ain't seen you in many moons
Talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good I hope
You got a smile that only a fool would forget
And a figure that'll leave a nigga droolin' and shit
There I was, kickin' my game, pickin' her brain
Buggin' 'cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
She wasn't feelin' me, I pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the whip
Uptown girl, she feel like that's some chickenhead shit
But on the sidewalk we ain't play games
We exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin' ""I know that nigga, he rich""
She think I got six whips 'cause me and my Man switch
Anyway, her name is CeCe
She said she go to BMCC
Push a '98 328 with chrome BB's
She said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
She liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin' to G me.

Type that'll hold down the Tre pound for ya
They into diamonds now, to Hell with pearls

Hey Shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way I spit?
Oh, I hit your girlfriend, she told you 'bout the dick?
Nah for real, am I the type that you wanna roll wit'?
Platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit
I love my lifestyle, you too, you love it
That I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin' of it
Know you wouldn't fuck with me if I had no ends
Probably wouldn't fuck in the whip if it wasn't a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not
Long as I rhyme hot I'm gettin' head in my drop
It goes on and on and on and it don't stop.
(Verse Three)
One thing you can always count on is change
And a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
Had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range
Would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change
Now it's hard to find us or stay behind us
While we on the 900 double R Hondas
Watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
While Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
All these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World
You can find a material Girl
I sip Dom till I earl
Take 'em two at a time
Quick I get in they mind
Have 'em thinkin' they mine
Bust off then tell 'em ""Bust a Uey, on mo' time""
I'm like the reason y'all niggas can't eat this year
Got your bitch breakin' her neck to peep this here
C'mon... uh huh... c'mon

More than hurt,
Bring the beef where you hang out,
Bang out,
Shots ring out.
Hit your shoulders tryin' to blow your brains out.
Hit your homies in their legs,

You know tomorrow's just a day away,

Here's what to do if you see him approach me,
Pop that nigga, ""I don't care if you know me.
Half the niggas hatin' on me used to be homies
I don't trust 'em when they smile or when they frown, 'cause they foney
Everytime I come around they call the police on me
That's why the D's in the precinct know me
They know 'bout my rap shit, they know bout how I clap people
I'm like I'm in a track meet, swift wit the mack, B

Quick to make examples outta niggas fa sho man

Niggas know how I get down, see they know when I'm around
Haha, my soldiers around in this,
Some shit go down, and a nigga get laid down
Its no surprise cause niggas know how I get down
Black tint on the Testarossa,
Hammer out the holster, gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggas swing through my hood, we on that gorilla shit
You clap off and miss, we come back and start killin' shit
Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit
We organize discipline, plus we militant

I'm in that coupe phantom, and the bodies kitted
Waves in my head, lookin' like tsunamis hit it

My boy was a dolja, now he a soulja
My lil' son ?? lettin off the ruger
In a whip mashed up, lookin' for his enemies
Ridin' and gassed up off double D batteries

I ain't tryin' to be dirty, still on the strip
I'm tryin' to be dirty, filthy rich
Give a nigga too much rope, he think he a cowboy
Give Tony too much dope, I'm pushin' the big boy
V12, SL detailed
I rap and wait for them checks in the mail
If you hatin', your due time life will expire
Cause my guns speak jamaican, they be like ""Bloodfire!""
Where I'm from, niggas be on some sleak shit
They hungry, use they lighters to cook their beef stick
And this 'dro and this nestle got me right
So my lungs be as black as Wesley Snipes
I'm on first class flights heading towards Vegas
Ya slot machines niggas, we crap table players
I roll a seven, 'cause we crap table players
Nigga, you won't deny that I'ma fuckin' ride out
Then you'll bump heads wit me
I'll put a hole in yo ass, you'll see
That it ain't cool to fuck wit me
(Lloyd Banks)
I know a lot of niggas want Banks gone
My kind of beef will fuck up ya grill and not the kind you put franks on
I'm hidin' out, so my meals is home cooked
I deal wit more ho's than a Chinese phone book
Your high with your messed up ratchets
I'm out blowin' haze bags the size of ketchup packets
Fuck who's in ya ride, there's tools on my side
By the females standin' with tattoos on they thighs
There's a lot of cats losin' they wives
Cause next time I see 'em, they got black and blues on they eyes
Nah, I ain't ready to die, but I'm prepared
But I'd rather grow old with grey hairs in my beard
They know me in the field, the kid with the fans
That argue over my balls like Kobe and Shaquille
If you talkin' bout millions throw me in the deal
Big city, stadium tour, ruining the bill motherfucker"

I... I owe you for this one
I've been patiently waiting
For a track to explode on (yeah)
You can get stunned if you want
And yo ass'll get rolled on (it's 50)
It feels like my flow's
Been hot for so long (yeah)
If you thinkin' I'm a fuckin' fall off you're so wrong (it's 50)
I've been pacing in my head
Like a baby born dead
Destination heaven
Sittin' politic with passengers from 9-11
The Lords blessing left me lyrically incline
Shit I ain't even got to try to shine
God's a seamstress who tailorfitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain
I can spit at your dame
Straight out the good book
Look niggas is shook
50 fear no man warrior
Swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand
Write lines knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die they'll read this
And say a genius wrote it
I grew up witout my pops
Should that make me bitter
I caught cases and cocked out
Does that make me a quitter
In this white man's world
I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut
Wit a nice but to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggas ain't friends
They know how to pretend
You've been patiently waiting
To make it through all the hate
Debating whether or not
You can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table
They operating to save you
It's like an angel came to you
Sent from the heavens above
They think they crazy
But they ain't crazy lets face it
Shit basically they just playing sick
They ain't shit they ain't saying shit
Spray umh 50 [gun shots]
A to the K get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem
You staying wit me?
Don't let me lose you
I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose wit this Uzi
And just shoot through your Izuzu
You get the message
Am I getting through to you
You know it's coming
You motherfuckers don't even know do you
Take some BIG and some Pac
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a lil ""BIG L"" on top
What the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers
Tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not it's like a fight to the top
Just to see who die for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is
Soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats
'Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was 80 seconds
Away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
Nuclear showers there's nothing spookier
Your now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50
It's the Gun Squad here
And you hear the shots go off
(It's 50, They say It's 50)
You see a nigga laid out
Wit his fucking top blown off
(It's 50, Man that wasn't 50)
They don't holla my name
You shouldn't throw stones
If you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw
You should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face
Have you ass runnin'
Mumbling to the J
Your going against me dogg
You makin' a mistake
I split yo lip
You lookin' like them
Michael Jackson jackets
Wit all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat
You can call me Skipper
The way I turn the money over
You should call me Flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch
Your callin' her wifey
I fucked her feed her fast food
You keepin' her Icee
I'm down to sell records
But not my soul
Snoop said this in '94
""We don't love them hoe's""
I got pennies for my thoughts
Now I'm rich
See the 20's spinnin'
Lookin' mean on the 6
Nigga's wearin flags

He don't want it with me, he in PC
I can have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo, bring the condoms, I'm in room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgeory
It's an emergency, a Michael Jackson see
Looked at a picture and said she looks like me
Kelis said her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean that way out in Cali, niggas know these guns
First thing they say about you, is you a sucker for love
This is chess, not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I'll give you what I got

You get the same shit for ten bodies, you get for one 'cause
I live life in the fast lane, 100 miles an hour, chrome and some wood grain

Make a lil extra money on the side mayn
I ain't playin', I'm up early with the birds word
Puttin' that work in, pirrellis on the Porsche chirpin'(I'm kaing movies)

I keep all my big bills, give my wifey the ones

Niggas who know me, know how I get down, I'm fresh out the pound
NYPD crit the flip, get on some New York undercover shit
Fuck wit dogs you ain't familiar wit, and get bit
Niggas scripted through the hit, for some paper and shit
It's all about the cash, keep it in a stash
Some niggas talk shit wit they ass, I see through them like glass
Popo lookin' for me, for some shit I did in the past
If you don't like me at first, I'm gonna grow on you like a rash
This rap shit, I got it in smash, I'm built to last
Feel the wrath, I bust that ass, sit back and laugh (haha)

You don't have to respect a nigga, but respect his cash
Cause for the money, niggas will murder that ass

I run the spots, extort your pops, flossin' drops
I'm ""Livin' Off Xperience"" like Lox, I'm hot
Check what I got, shorty got knocked
Comin' up out the capsule spot
On the uptown block, he couldn't run from the cops
So my man got shot
In a jet black Brasada, across the street from his mom's crib on his block
I told him get them niggas that cash, they murdered that ass
Niggas told 'em slow down, he was movin' too fast
Heard the shot, went through his face after the glass, he crashed
Hit the three on his niggas grass, the cattle said it got low fast
The kid who had it done was a crude fella
Who woulda thought he wile out over that mozzarella
We ain't know them, but now we know better
Not to fuck with his cheddar, his man pack a beretta
He won't hesitate to squeeze that, over that green back
Believe that, now niggas know that he's back
I ain't got a worry in the world, if it's beef, don't sing it, bring it
Parents warn their kids, about people like me
I'm out of order, I turn your only daughter, into a transporter
Before I die, I'm gonna see more blow than Rich Porter (woo)
50 Cent, don't get it fucked up for greens, I for greens
Let it go back to Smith, I dissect it
I check and correct it, flow perfected
I make shit hectic, I wreck shit, nigga check it
If you ain't tryin' to feel the flames from the blast
Respect a nigga cash
My smile will rock niggas to sleep, pack heat
Fuck the police, handle beef on the street
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm a 9 with 2 MM's
If your man want to get involved, I'll bring it to him
Niggas been wantin' me dead, I'm still here kid
They send their dogs to come get me
They wet shit, but they ain't hit me
Word in the hood is 50, shifty

The holla tips'll hit ya chest, you cough up blood to EMS
Come pick you up, You know you fucked
When you get on a stretcher
'Cause I'll come in ta ICU, to see you off to heaven
The system I done been through. If there's nothing you did to me

Man these are average raps, I'm keepin' the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady Aftermath lid
You pop off the top it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octamom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnate her then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac 10s
Triplets, quadruplets and a couple of back to back twins
Dead fetuses fallin' out all over, Jack is back again
The Rippers at your service, girl I can see that your nervous
But I barely scratch the surface, like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fuckin' backyard. Still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out
It's past your curfew when its dark, I'm searchin for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month. They found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter top.

My appeal is to serial killers, what a pill is to me,
Killing so villainously,
Still as maniacal on the Nyquil and psycho as Michael Myers,
You know what we're like on the muthafucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers.

It's operation time they got 'em hooked up to wires,
Queezing, he bleeding, wheezing, breathing he half dead,
He must say no, but now he know how shady the Math is,
Even murderous tactics, get better with practice,
Lead showers, gun powder, fill the tellers burn burn,
Truly ours Julia, you better learn learn.

Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah homie turn turn,
I'm debating, mutilating the lady,
You've been waiting for shady
And Fif. Ain't no duplicating it baby,
There's a baby in the drive, there's a torso in the washer,
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her,
Arms and legs in the garbage 'cause the rest of her, I lost her,
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her,
And put her through the ringer and hung her over the wash tub.
(50 Cent)
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that'll cough up
A hard rock, a soft fuck
Get caught up and get washed up,
In Detroit or Northfolk,
When it's disrupt and nauseas,
Look deep in my eyes, see Many Many Men die,
I swing gym stars faster than Samurai."

Made a Southside nigga get a pocket full of bread
Got that Bentley Mulsanne to match that boat
Beige leather seats in it, they match that dope
Kush smoke same color to match that coat
I'm chin-chillin'; Mo' spillin
Dom poppin', party rockin'
My beat knockin', your bitch watchin
My feds clockin my shit
Blew a grand apiece on all of my kicks
Get your ass whipped you step on my shit
Nigga you blink I'm all in yo' bitch
Put her in the club, teach her to turn trick
Jack'll be nimble, Jack'll cum quick
This pimp shit, break the paper off bitch
That shit fake, Audemars don't tick
Them ain't diamonds, what is this shit?
I'm confused, this bill don't go and pick
I'm a match that deal with my hat
They said I fell off, I snapped right back
Nigga my money can't fit in no safe
Got a mil' for e'ry lil' bump on yo' face
Tryin' to count mine, I'm walkin' up in the vault
Better have a pound if you niggaz wan' smoke
HUH! 50 Cent, look what you done did
Took a Ninth Ward nigga from the hood made him big
Now every hoe want a kid from the Kidd Kidd
They tripped, slipped and fell on my dick
Give me brain like I ain't got no sense
I got change, dollars and lil' cents
I got rich, they ain't seen me since
Now it's all startin to make sense
I pull up in that brand new Benz
All of a sudden I got brand new friends
Brand new chopper, bitch go blakka
BRRRRRT, like I just broke wind
(I roll the shit, I smoke the shit)
I forgot she was in my bed
(I roll the shit - I smoke the shit)
Damn! I blew through all my bread
That Lambo ain't got no top
Man I'm hotter than stove top
Rider Gang, we on top
And we havin' a smoke-out
Eyes low but I'm so high
Don't ask me, I don't know why

Don't play wit' me, I don't have patieeeeeents

If they try an runaway, I'ma chaaaaaaase 'em
Now with the pound, and I'm a lay 'em down
That's how it's goin' down
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down

Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids don't live long in New York
**** Around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slippin', then get hit wit' like three
In every hood in the US, I'm that**** they feelin'
Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villan
I play the bar with 8 bottles all night gettin' right
Teachin' the hoodrats what Cristal taste like
I put 60 on wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck
We in the hood nigga schemin', what you expect?
My S on 22's leave ya hos confuuuuuused
On the track ready to choose, like ""Daddy we want you""
My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me
Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me
Now Nelly told you how them country boys talk
I came to teach you how we put it down in New York
That's how we get down
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down
(50 Cent)
In the city, a young buck'll tell you how the mac spit
O.G. give 'em the word, you gonna get yo' ass hit
I don't know why niggaz like to talk bad about me
I'm the richest nigga they know without a G.E.D.
Man it could be the money, it could be the ice
It could be they'd like to be me and can't live my life
You should here they be sayin' man ""50 be flippin'""
""Shot my man over 7 grams, that nigga be trippin'""
I know death is promised, I don't fear gettin' murked
It's when a nigga half-way killa ya homie, it hurts
Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with
The pump, you can have it how you want
But I know you like my style (Uh-Huh)
Ya like how I break it down, wanna get rich?
I'll show you how, take this pack, pump these pieces
That's how we get down
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down

It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right.
It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right.
Everybody know that
Doin' good in front of niggas in the hood cause problems
Tre, trade pounds and (?)
I hate when hoes get on some loudmouth shit
Your man gangsta? Me too
Go on and get 'em bitch
I just bought new toast to spit
Next nigga gettin' gully gettin' laid out quick
Where ever rich touchin niggas is gettin' hurt
Cause a broke nigga always down to put it in work
Don't run up on me, I don't know you nigga
So what you bought my CD, I don't owe you nigga
I know you love the way the goutti beat bump
Got you license plate rounds and all over your trunk
Don't confuse these trucks with my style dog
I'm from Queens but I'm mother fuckin' B.K. hard
I sound like I move bricks uptown
More like a thug from the Bronx who stay with a 4 pound
Shook nigga (shook nigga, shook nigga)
I'm a Guinness Book nigga
We don't play that pussy shit round here
You can get your fuckin' wig split down here
Don't rep where you come from too much around here
You can get your fuckin' cap filt
If I can't get my gun in the club, why whould I come in the club
So them niggas I done stuck up could cut me he fuck up, nah
I'm outside to jump off in a benz jeep
4 deep strapped with all kinds of heat
Niggas think they want beef
They don't want beef
They find from somebody that love playin' in the street
When you rap, keep it gangsta dog it's all good
Just don't go coppin that shyt in the wrong hood
But I'm from the young boy, come and try ya nigga
Shell will make ya feel like your on fire nigga
If you thinkin' we thristy 'cause, we right
We lookin' at your watch and chain like that's a S-type
Murder sayin' don't play 50 in the club
Last time it came nigga tore the shyt up (what)
I don't where you from and I don't care
But nigga we don't play that pussy shit round here
(Spanish talkin')
No ingles, No ingles, mother fuckers will shoot ya
The Latin Kings don't like me, I don't care
We don't talk that mida mida bullshit round here
Man, I done so much dirt in the hood
Niggas heard I got shot they was all sayin' good (do it for em)
Fuck y'all, ya ain't got to like me
I'm gettin' knocked, y'all nigga ain't got to like me
I'm on the same bullshit I been on
It's the same bullshit ya niggas need to get on
Ya shit sound too commercial
Come cruisin through the hood mother fuckers will hurt ya
You shouldn't them flash jewels
Cause niggas will run up on ya if that's true
They want your money, the watch, and you tenis shos
I ain't gotta tell ya not to move
Ya know the rules"

Yeah
Yeah we can ride to this
Just lay back, crew
Here's a taste of my life, its bitter and sweet
I put my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my teflon on and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In a race for the cheese, I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker wear in stores, Reebok stocks sore
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas can tell
The east coast crib, the size of a small hotel
The shit journalist write about me, get me confused
Have me feelin' like the heavy weight champ when he lose
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic shiiit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now we can get hostile or we can do this smooth
T&T around, I can still make blow move
This is what you call ryder music
All the gangstas are ridin' to it
Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it
When we ride to that ryder music (let's go)
(Let's go)
Last year, I woke up, a good look, damn it feels good
On the low, I done fucked like half of Hollywood
Had your favorite actress from your favorite shows
In my favorite position, you know how it goes
In my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit ""This is When Thugs Cry""
This is what it sounds like when hollow tip slugs fly
Homie, this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made
They make you wanna run across they head wit a switch blade
They point their finger at me, sayin' I'm bug
My flows crack you listen, your fuckin' brains on drugs
Look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on the tec
Fool trippin' through the set, you can get ya ass whipped
Cards missin' out my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid, your ass better come correct
This is what you call ryder music
All the gangstas are ridin' to it
Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it
When we ride to that ryder music (let's go)
(Let's go)
My mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win
Pray to Lord, forgive me for my sins
Still thuggin', cruisin', rims gleamin'
Like the stones on my wrist
Zonin', guess this is how it feels to be rich
Homie, you hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch
Stupid, chase the paper, they come with the shit
I'm fallin', in love with success
Entrepeneure, kinda sewer, I maneuver the best
Rowin', ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunt I'll have ya homies burn a rest in peace candle
As wise men speak, I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my niggas the world turns
Rappers, I make 'em sick when I say I'm the shit
They mistake my confidance for arrogance, they hate on the kid
In '99, I had a vision and made a decision
Bein' broke is against my religion, now picked up
This is what you call ryder music
All the gangstas are ridin' to it
Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it
When we ride to that ryder music (let's go)

So it's a 100 grams or better when I'm going to cop
I never hold the toaster 'cause I use my little soldier
And my down bitch as a holster, like I'm supposed ta
Heavy pistol sales for living
My gun rip through lungs and tear through tissue
While I'm out for the ends, you out for a rep
That's the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
See me in a black lex, hard-top
My mink drop-top, fresh out the carlot
I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches (?)
So I'm gon sell like the box office features
Niggas in the hood can't see G-UNIT!
But deep in they heart they wanna be G-UNIT!
'Cause we got them three b's: benzes, burners and bitches
And plus we on the road to the riches

As long as you don't get in the way of my money

Lately I been going through a phase
Hope they ain't tap the phones
'Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones
Therefore I'm on the move with the squad
I'm stingy as ever, known to trick fast food on a broad
Picture me putting jewels on a broad
I'd rather put shoes on the car
A pool in the yard
You don't really wanna fool with the god
Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards
In this game, you only make it far if you loyal
And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled
Why swing, you gotta be strapped to get rid of me
Ill leave you in water like the statute of liberty

Blowin' green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school
Keep rappin' for your hood, I'm rappin' for benzes
And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses

Life in the hood so hard I done lost some of my cards
Instead of praying before I sleep I put my hands on my heat

Spike Lee don't like it that my money come fast
I hate it when a nigga get to countin' my cash
Now I can give the kids a positive message like Farrakhan
Or I can give 'em pistols and targets to squeeze 'em on
I'm tryin' to make a decision damn, leave me alone
I'm like Martin Luther King people listen to me a lot
It's non violent, non violent till I'm hit with a rock
Then it's Coretta fuck this, go and get me my glock
Wanna call me crazy? Okay it's cool
I'll have your kids tryin' to be, crazy cool in school
Truth is they like me, more than they like you
They watch me and emulate, everything I do
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I have days when I feel like everybody's against me
Sharpton ain't comin' when the feds snatch 50
Just my luck Johnnie Cochran passed
Right before the crackers come snatch my ass
I'm the Don King of crack, the Pretty Floyd of rap
Put Southside on the map, I did that
Bill O'Reilly can't stand me but his woman think I'm cute
I bet she wanna see me in my birthday suit
Met Al Gore and his wife in them first class seats
She said she didn't like rap until she met me
You gotta understand I'm a charmin young man
A whole lot has changed since I went hand to hand
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

My money right, ya nah mean I'm good don't worry 'bout me I'm good
Ya know? This is about you now, is it 'gon make you happy to see me gone?
Are you gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Are you just gonna forget about me? I meant nothin' to you?

Hahaha, I mean you're really breakin my heart"

'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke
(All they smell is smoke)
Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba
Blue sapphires on days when she feeling Hoover
She hood and in the mood when I'm in the mood
Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it
I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample
That product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb
She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burning, we smoking
My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing
She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back in case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearing the word is
Me, I'm a P.I.M.P
I let Trey hit some, then Dre hit some
Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done
Niggas can't comprehend what this shit 'bout
Police coming, you like, put this shit out
You like smoke and you got me high
(You make a nigga want to get down)

100 degrees, that's with or without the top down
But when she get to working her hips you know the temperature rise
Oh lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs
She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinking damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation pimping ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumping crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs
Luther said it: A house is not a home without her
I had them panties on the grey hound filled up with powder
But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits
Her wanting is temporary like some smoke gon' get it
You like smoke and you got me high

I'm from city to city to shop the show
See me I been glidin' across the globe
I hustle hard to get the grib fa sho'
So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone
Tell me, what's on your mind when you're alone
Have ya touchin' on yourself, girl all in the zone
Now if I told you all
What things I say would I be wrong
Well then I wouldn't be right
Matter fact I'd be on the next flight
Tryna get it on with you tonight
Do the things you like
Touch the right spot, have ya piped and hot
While the wind blow through your hair in the drop
Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex
And let me to what I do until you climax
You can go straight to sleep after it's all over
In the mornin' roll over and we can start over

Summer, winter, spring, and fall

(Verse 2- 50 Cent)
Yeah I called just to say hope you havin' a nice day
You're special, I get into you, oops I mean I'm into you
Every chance I get, I find time to spend with you
Jet to bring you to me, just to watch a movie
Better yet to watch you climb into the ja'causezi
Bubbles in the bath, don in the glass
Funny how time flies when you full of laughs
Its fun but before long, a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash
To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots
I like jeeps and coupes, so I grind all the time, just gimme some loot
I put a spell on you, I like to call it a spell
In the bedroom, workin' it well, I don't kiss and tell
But I don't care if you kiss and tell
You can tell your girlfriend the details
(Chorus x2- Olivia)
Summer, winter, spring, and fall
I'll be around to catch ya calls
'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And I adore you
You always right, you're not my date
I never ever let you wait
'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)

I'm so disrespectful,
So so so disrespectful,
I'm so disrespectful,
So so so disrespectful,
You daddy f-cked your momma then f-cked your sister,
Then climbed in your bed playing with your sh-tter,
Go 'head take your belt off and hang yourself,
Matter of fact grab your strap and bang yourself,
Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond,
Imma big d-ck you know the one everybody on,
Your gon make me sing murder was the case
Pull this trigger sh-t ping ping, should start at the face,
I'm international, I'm never home mayne,
I've gon so long my accent changed,
Better watch who you f-ck with mayne,
Or you gon make me carve you up now straight
Come on Game you'll never be my equal,
Your homie shoot dogs, my n-gga shoot people,
See me I'm what your never gon be,
I'm in that tax bracket your never gon see,
When you cross me...
That n-gga Buck like Game tell momma he don smoked the TV,
I didn't know he f-cked with more dope than BG,
Plus a n-gga sipped more syrup than Pepsi,
Man keeping these muthf-ckers rich ain't easy,
Especially when a n-gga wanna stunt like Jeezy,
And his cds didn't sell like his CD's,
Man that n-gga blew all of his chips like breezy's,
Mad 'cause the world won't treat him like Weezy,
I don't give a f-ck n-gga please believe me,
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
No n-gga in the vocal booth around can see me,
It's crazy how I make this sh-t sound oh so easy,
They say fifty not on Buck with him he oh so greasy,
Yeah he used to share that paper now he oh so greedy,
Its funny how they sh-t on n-ggas then they need me,
See me I'm number one I'm loading up my gun,
I catch ya if you dun, you p-ssy n-gga run,
They say first comes love then comes marriage,
Instead I got Shaniqua in the baby carriage,
Then came the cash then the baby momma drama,
I gave the b-tch a half a mill,
She blew it on prada,
I remember when I met da b-tch and she ain't had nada,
Now got my son on some fly sh-t,
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
Now I got to buy sh-t,
Man I can't even flunk sh-t 'cause everybody want sh-t,
Everybody mad, damn even my dad,
And I don't even know him now how the f-ck I owe him,
I ain't giving nobody sh-t Imma show them,
I gave Game hits, he told me to suck d-ck,
Start screaming Wesstside and Dre ain't say sh-t,
Now we just eat of 'em and when I talk to Em
A smile comes on his face,
He told me what's the case,
Enemies stay enemies,
But friends they change,
N-ggas go crazy over money my mayne,"

I'll run up on your punk ass squeezing the bird
Now what New York niggas know about country grammar
Not much, but we know how to bang them hammers
When I pull out that thing, you better break yourself
Or win a trip to ICU, and you can take yourself
If you lucky motherfucker, I'm solider I told ya
Push ya shit back, put my knife through ya six pack
Gat bust, adrenaline rush, blowin' the dust
Five point O, burnin' the cluth, while I'm burnin' the dutch
You thought them other niggas was hot, I'm turnin' it up
This the blueprint, nigga are you learnin' or what
You done told me you respect me, now tell me I'm the nicest

Don't make me send the piece at you
I'll have your man walk around with another rest in peace tattoo
Look creampuff, you can get killed here
Nigga you ain't invincible, even Superman in a wheel chair
I've always been a picky man, but I ain't a flowered star
So I'mma fuck all fifty fans
Look, whether you like it or not, right in ya spot
All in your grill, wearin' the crown, airin' 'em down
We're in the pound puttin' fare in the clown

Your records can't sell, your company is buyin' em
Give it up, Burger King is hirin'
You shoulda been a cop, cause you snitch a lot
Talkin' to the jakes, you bound to get shot
I used to watch Big Bird and Scooby Doo
Now I'm choppin' big birds and them bundles too
For that Master P money, that shoppin' spree money
That coke, that dope and that ecstasy money
I'm tryin' to build empires across the state line

I hear niggaz runnin' they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man 50 fucked up, I mean real fucked up
He left us in the hood we fucked up
Still actin' like he in the street tellin' niggaz they can't eat
You know this motherfucker went and bought Tyson's crib
Got Bentley's, Ferrari's, and all that shit
He don't even come through to try and help niggaz out
That's the bullshit see what I'm talkin' about
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin' they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
That's my Grand baby I love him I raised that boy right
He ran to me cryin sent him back out to fight
Put a battery in his sock go pick up a rock
You ain't a chump, you want your Grandma to think you a punk
Look at my first Grand baby, he is a big rap star
Bought me a house, diamonds, and a brand new car
I tought him what it takes, to go this far
Boy I'm the reason you are what you are
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin' they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin' they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me"
162,That Aint Gangsta,2000,Power Of The Dollar (2000),,50 Cent,"How you gonna take this? like a Man or a bitch?
You gon' get it on nigga or you gon' snitch?
I represent niggas in the hood gettin' rich
Man, I stack chips and I unload clips
After 3 Summers in the joint I thought life was hard
Some niggas started fightin', some niggas found God
You know me, started sellin' leek in the yard
Yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
Big as Hell in the joint wearin' '86 numbers
Damm Dog, you been in here that long?
You could think that, but say that and yo' ass is dead wrong
A convo is only three words, ""yo whattup""
You ain't gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
Let a nigga find out you on some goin' home shit
And you tryin' to bounce without payin' a loan, shit
Some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
After the witnesses disappeared on the strength of they team
I'm hard as Hell to get along wit' so it never fails
A nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
He had a L rolled in bible paper blowin' the lye
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin' his high
And when I shot you in NewYork why would I box you now?
If I catch you in the yard I'm'a ox you down
Niggas you think is real really can't hold they own
I'll have 'em on some E.T. shit tryin' to phone home
In here a gemstar is like a Nine Milly chrome
It's similar, infact they'll both split ya dome
Scars are souvenirs, niggas always take 'em home.
You got blown over the jack? (that ain't gangsta)
Your Man ran when you got clapped? (that ain't gangsta)
Rockin' a vest with no gat? (that ain't gangsta)
You only a thug when you rap? (that ain't gangsta)
Niggas jooked you for your track? (that ain't gangsta)
You ran to other thugs to get it back? (that ain't gangsta)
Niggas ran off with your packs? (that ain't gangsta)
If you ain't bustin' ya gat (that ain't gangsta)
You'd call me an Animal if you seen me livin' on lock
I stay in a box cats be shook when I'm visitin' pop-ulation
When I walk by, niggas like ""Fifty don't play Son""
""Yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga...""
Max out, I'm goin' straight for the glock
Bust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block
The things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat
Down goes the window... out goes the heat
I'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' trackmeet
Some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
Some get it in the foot, bleed all over their airmax
Nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
It's extortion, it happens in the hood often
Claim more lives than choices, free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
'Cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit 'cause I stay on that block shit
That 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
See the difference is I'm real and you not, kid
I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
Y'all niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
Leave with your blood on my mink in the drop Six
Guiliani and Pataki can't stop this
Since '86 my whole clique pop Criss.
5-5-1 blllaaap blllaaap!
1-3-4 blllaaap blllaaap!

Right now my life movin to fast to stop and pray
See every now and then I smile just not today
In my hood they let the choppers spray
Somebody probably got shot today
I named 'em pop when niggas surfboard
You ain't stoppin' me dawg
Only time you left ya hood is on Monopoly boards
You grimey as birds shittin on the top of ya fords
You will, die by the gun if you ain't droppin' ya sword
I got tattoos as well as lead marks
To me fucking is kinda like racin and I always get a head start
My opinion of a sweet dream is a dead NARC
Just yesterday guns is blastin with red darts
Beef, you a target
'Cause when we come at yo ass, Aladdin wont be the only one the carpet
Man you wanna play wit a ringer?
I ain't a peoples person
I'll give my next door neighbor the finger (fuck you)
Even though I got the shit in the stores
I'm like a nigga that borrow clothes
Bitch, I'm tryin' to get in ya draws
Man I'll dump a whole clip in ya man's braids
Pussys love Nelly, he made it look cool to wear bandaids
I'm blowin' on damn haze
All of a sudden I'm gased, 'cause I'm on the radio and I can't wait
If you ain't up on thangs
Lloyd Banks is the name, G-Units the game
Now I know to keep low when the heat blow
I'll have niggas post up on ya block like I'm shootin the free throw
Still get the green from P-dro, better known as Pedro
I'm ghetto like a patty ya egg-roll

Ain't nuttin sweet about me
Nigaas talkin' in the pens and in the street about me
Some jake, tryin' to watch every move I make
Cause my Deez'll make fiends do the up-town shake
I'm a pro, far from a amateur, holdin' more keys than your fuckin' janitor
They say ""God bless the child that could hold his own""
You pay cops to hold you down, I just hold the chrome
Every breath I take, every step I take, every move I make
I got a ruger on my hip
You ain't gotta like or love me but you gone respect me
You need a fifth and 2 clips to try and check me
12 in the afternoon we can start the clappin
Look homie I'm down for that day-time action
Keep thinkin' it's a game time in front of ya home
Get the drop on that ass and shot shadder ya bones (yeah)

Listen boy, Tony be the real McCoy
When hoes see the new toy, they jump for joy
And even though the kid rappin'
I still got fiens in the hood puffin on that Magic Dragon
My guns under my pillow, I sleep wit my shoes on
Every single night me and my mack get our groove on
Don't get moved on
'Cause I shoot through your bicepts your tricepts
Then breeze through ya projects
When the coke come back
It's the China White
And the d don't sweat us in a bag a rice
Let's ride O T
And burn the tape
I got this bad mommy, her mouth's a sperm bank
Since Yayo be a fearless man
I donate my heart to them niggas that ran
And, those niggas in the hood don't wanna see me famous
They rather see my moms make funeral arangements
I got enough rhymes, to fill 6 notebooks
I been spittin' that shit ever since coke crushed
You can hear me on your TV and radio at the same time
I never ever say the same rhyme, it's Tony 2 times
Beware of my wraith, I'm gone school you niggas
Prepare for class
Yo I peep where your puns at, peep where you pumped that
Money you tryin' to stack I spent it on blunt wraps

Leave me alone,
I ain't f-ckin with nobody,
Keep f-cking with me you gon turn back to booboo,
Had me casing out your crib,
Tryna pop your f-cking noodles,
She was 20 I was 12,
Man my nana said she raped me,
I just smiled from ear to ear saying take it baby take it,
Since high school, n-gga I ain't got no friends,
I got 2 3 80's like the ying yang twins haaaaaaaaank,
That's spot clickin till the D's run in
Then its bail money and lawyer fees you got to have ins,
In freshman year I had that CBR hurricane
And an ill herrin bone I got 'em slinging heroin,
I shoot a n-gga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump,
Then you can run forest run, retard when I dump,
Don't take kindness for weakness, n-ggas don't respect that,
So me I'm with that ruger, that pump and that tech at,
So look at me I'm on that,
I thought we was rich then,
Shipment man, you had like 20 bricks in rich man,
We was in cocaine heaven,
I was fishcal dreaming,
We just got into town,
We was strapped up scheming,
First country caught a body, then country got a body,
I popped a couple n-ggas then country shot everybody,
Its cold blooded,
Its real shit you got to love it,
Tree eight snub it, and don't think nothin' of it
It's the way of the wolves
That's how they train us to move,
Get it poppin' when we shopping, n-gga hold down the tools,
I see niggas getting rich then days went by,
Then days went by,
Then days went by,
I was tired of not having shit,
Then days went by
Then days went by
Then days went by
I see niggas getting hit
Then days went by
Then days went by
Then days went by
We was slangin that sh-t
Then days went by
Then days went by
Then days went by
I bin sure since we was lil n-ggas,
Son since we was seven
Armed robbery, first degree my man did seven,
N-ggas popped his whip up,
Hit his cab when he was sittin',
He a lucky muth-fcker I bet he make it to heaven,
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
My grandpa drunk, my uncle rock drunk,
My uncle champ on crack,
Smoke my f-cking stash up,
I had 250 grand stashed on the porch,
I mean how much you gon smoke man,
How much you gon snort,
First the vcr went, then the TV went,
He stole out of mommy purse,
She thought it was me kid,
I ain't ask for no money son 'cause I was out hustlin,
She was looking at me sideways like Imma thief or something,
That hurt me, come on son that wouldn't hurt you,
I pistol whip that n-gga till his face was purple,
I need anger management, see I hold onto a grudge,
The same way I hold onto that nickel plate snub,
The lord don't have imperfections baby,
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me,
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy,
Some say I ain't sh-t some say I'm amazing,
Here I am,"
166,The Funeral,2014,Animal Ambition (2014),,50 Cent,"You forgot my style
Flowers, a funeral service, a kid's in the coffin
It sound so familiar, don't it happen so often?
The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy
Couldn't help but think 
.38 ain't got no safety, that bullet ain't got a name on it
But it's hard to miss when that thing got a beam on it
First shot, pop off, everybody popping shots
The glass at the store front, we forgot God was watching
Run, run, hit the gate, D's yelling 
Niggas getting jammed up, better that than a jammed up
His momma said a few words to her, he was innocent
She might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits
So in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby
But he was outside talking to niggas crazy
In a room full of people came to pay their respect
I just came in to get a close look at nigga to check
That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail
And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail
ROR, trust me nigga I know the law
Release on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it
That's his first taste, I mean his first case
Got knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped
This nigga here we still got that, yeah
First law in my hood is show no fear
Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying
Oh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron
These some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures
Trying to come up, still eating around roaches
Cookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions
Lucky charms, stay armed, niggas won't clap you then
We watch the side bitch talking like she a main bitch
His wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit
Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave
This type shit a nigga got to see to believe
These bitches acting up in here
Police they don't fucking care
Homicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit
Cousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit
He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball
You play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off
I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split
Hit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit
Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor
All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga
We all can't win, some of us got to lose
Envision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves
Cause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened
He just went on and on till niggas started attacking
Acting like he was the only motherfucker packing
50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and I'm gone niggas will remember the name
It's 50
50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and I'm gone niggas will remember the name

I think my shit is hot, I think I'm hot
You hot but you crazy...
Why they wanna?..man... I don't know...
It's the money that - makes shit get ugly
It's the money that - makes these hoes love me
It's the money that - makes niggas wanna slug me
Man... I thought the money would make it all lovely
Yo, I actually write what I do or see
The felonies from day to day make me say what I say
When I die my art will be worth more than Picasso's, don't cry for me,
Smile for me
And if you see them niggas that wet me, wile' for me
Remember the good times, the chips we stacked
The clips we packed
And all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack
Let my tombstone read I Tried and from the start everything I wrote
Was from my heart
So it'll always be number one on my chart
I get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art
Sometimes it sounds like I'm playin' but I'm sayin'
This shit is real, it ain't a game.
They say the good die young, I guess these grimy niggas live a
Long time, sit in fancy whips, sip champaigne and shine, keep your eyes
On yours while I keep my eyes on mine. (Repeat)
First it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big
I'm convinced it can happen to anybody kid
So I get vest up when I get dressed up
In the hood it's messed up, niggas runnin' 'round shootin' shit up
If it's Dom that you drinkin' fill up my cup
If you got somethin' to doubt me, shut the fuck up
Why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?
And gettin' robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck
Duke listen, if you move I'm'a hurt you
You'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue
Right now what you need to do is gimme the cash
Forget about your Boss bein' mad, just save ya ass
Be a good Boy now, go and get your stash
I seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash
All right run along before I shoot ya ass
I hate to do this to you but I really need this cash.
I know we all gotta go, but I'd hate to go fast
Then again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last
Man listen, if you really really like this shit
Nigga call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit
Call him now before I drop for real 'cause after I drop
I'm'a be chargin' y'all niggas like Forty a pop
To each his own, me? I got it while it was cheap
Typical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street
1999's the year of the predator, I'm killin' to eat
Niggas'll treat you like a egg, you come to cop you get beat
Gimme your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? what a treat
You're a generous guy
Take 'em off or die
Man, we hurtin' 'round here, ain't nobody slingin' pies
Look around, ain't nobody 'round here fly

 Nigga, we from the same hood, we come from the same shit
 You got gonorrhea too, we fucked with the same bitch!
 Gettin' money is necessary so me, I'm a visionary
 And I'm sayin' that house should be a crack house
 Now see it how I see it, or I bring straps out
 The Tec and the Mac out, the Sig and the Taurus
 The Koch and that Heckler then nigga, we warin'
 I let my pistol speak for me and all of 'em foreign
 Click-clack, comprende? I'm criminal minded
 Toss money in the sewer, bet nobody find it
 Till it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun, what?
 You want some? Come get some
 Nigga, it's murder one when I toss my gun
 You might see me let it off, you might see me run
 But you won't see shit time the police come, huh?
 You want some? Come get some
 Nigga, it's murder one when you see my gun
 I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
 You just bleed and bleed 'til the police come
 Huh, you want some?
 Come get it, I'm strapped now, with it
 Come get it, huh, you want some?
 Come get it, I'm strapped now, with it
 Fuck that nigga, huh, you want some?"

Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem
(Spider Loc)
All money ain't good money, this I know
But I still love hood money, I gets my dough
And as a youngster, a nigga went to so much church
And still turned out fucked up, I did so much dirt
Chose to bang the neighborhood, I put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time, caused mom so much hurt
On everythang, that boy wasn't gunned on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bullshit, just runnin' the streets
Without some type of beef the week wasn't complete
It's like a nigga feel better after dumpin his heat
On feet, just to see that body slumped in the seat
Was like a whole nother rush to me, bustin' was sweet
Now I'm smarter, I'm all about somethin' to eat
I'm on the road, spend 30 days a month in a suite
But I'm still gon' hustle and cheat - let's go

Yeah, uh, now walkin' down the block without'cha weapon
Is a first class ticket to a lesson
I thirst cash, kick it to perfection, me and Bang got a connection
That's why I bring the Benz to impress him
{?} My zone, all alone homes rattle in my bones
'Cause he yappin off his lips and if I hit him I'll be wrong
'Cause he ain't never gon' be shit, and I done worked so hard
But I will make you a corn on the cob, you'll be performin for God
Either that or rob you on your boulevard
Bet you never thought for a second niggaz'd pull your card God
I'm on my job, scarred since my nigga gone
HP tatted on me so his memory lives on
Engagin in drama without your bomber'll
Be funeral arrangements for your momma
I learned that when I was in pajamas watchin Michael and Madonna
Now I got the appetite of a pirahna, nigga

What nobody knows, all the roads you go through
You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to for crumbs
Damn, tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin' to Pro Tools
There's not too many that ever walked in the Loc shoes
Or tell the tale that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
I'm clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that kush weed sparks the brain
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when I pulled up and parked the Range
Your damn right I got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the art of aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, till you found out I caught the chain"

Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga.

Niggaz wanna shine like me (me), rhyme like me (me)
Then walk around with a 9 like me (me)
They don't wanna do it, 3 to 9 like me
And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Hey yo, you think about shittin' on 50... save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David
I teach niggaz sign language, that ain't def son
*Click* *click* you heard dat? dat mean RUN
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stun on, pa
Pull through, I'll throw a fuckin' cocktail at ya' car
From the last shootout, I got a dimple on my face
It's nothin', I could go after Mase's fanbase
Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out
I don't smile a lot, cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war, and I ain't never left the City
Hos be like ""Fitty, you so witty""
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me, dope, you not like me
Moma said...
Everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk him, I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy, 'cause I don't fear man
'Cause I fear when I kill a man, God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan
I been coulda killed these niggaz, I'm still waitin
In the telly with to whores, a Benz with to doors
32 carrots in the cross, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got at least two guns
I carry the glock, Tony carry my M-1s
Hold me down nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waitin for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga don't knock me
You need some shit with banana clips to try and stop me
I'm the one
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me dope, you not like me
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
The good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggaz, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range, with a glock, I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standin' next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch gettin' in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a 38, it's special yoooooo
A country boy tell ya, I'm fittin' to blowwwww
I'm more like a pimp, then a trick, you knowwww
See, I'm in this for the paper, I don't love the hooos
Niggaz broke in the hood, worried about mines
Grown ass men, WEARIN STARTER KEYSHAWNS
You know them little pieces, with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit dog, why don't you stop it
Shorty, I been watchin you watchin me
Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me dope, you not like me"

Man if I get a shot, I can make it to the top
Damn... what if?
If I got on some pretty boy shit like Puffy
Niggaz in the hood man they jus wouldn't love me
If I wore a suit everyday like Jay-Z
Niggaz would think I bumped my fuckin' head and went crazy
If I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby
I wouldn't stand a chance of tryin' to sell like Shady
If I put out bullshit joints like AZ
Every chance niggaz get they try 'n' play me
But I move around with a lil 3.80
A nigga try to stunt, a nigga get sprayed B
If I smoke weed all day like Snoop do
I see the world different through my dialated pupils
If I buss dance moves on ya like Usher
Niggaz would say 50 that ain't gangster, fuck ya

And all the backpack niggaz love me like Mos Def
I probably be a cool ass nigga like Ice Cube
Picture me in the flick right now lookin' so cool
What if I was a low-key nigga just laid back
Hustle to keep a homie around somebody to hold a gat
Man what if Halle Berry was my nex baby momz
Shit I get that child support up with no problem
If I caught a case and jump bail like ??get caught??
'Cause I'm that nigga everybody know from New York
What if I was a new rap nigga you didn't know
You be sayin' damn that kid got a sick flow
But if I just cruise through your hood on 22's
Bumpin Curtis Mayfield and Marvin ""So Smooth""
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach, I'm sure

(Lil Fame Verse)
You got these young niggaz hollerin ""Murderer!""
Copper chops on my block like, blaka blaka blaka
Niggaz don't give a fuck...
I seen a nigga shoot my mom'z, right in front of my motherfuckin' face
See in the 'ville, ain't such a thing as a straight bullet
When your index finger on the trigger and you pull it
Slugs ain't never outta season (uh huh)..
All you gotta do is give a motherfucker one reason (Uh!)
Blood stains on the ceilin'..
Same place he stood, that's what they leave um
Don't black it out, lets just squeez'in off with your gun (uh huh)
'Cause you gon' get your punk ass robbed with the young
You know the drill...
I'ma give your ass 3 seconds to bounce and you better not ??chark??
1... Fuck that... [3 gunshots].. Ah bitch!.. Rest in bits!

There's nowhere to run to when death becomes you
Some say your soul may burn in the flame...
So front if you want to (uh huh), but niggaz who murk you

Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow Tips and Talons, when it rains it pours
You caught in lead showers, just because
Niggaz ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggaz get set up, 'cause when it rains it pours
End up wed up, 'cause when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie, in my hood, when it rains it pours
Ain't nutin changed, niggaz doin' the same old shit
Them new Hollow tips and them same old clips
In the projects niggaz fuck with the same old chicks
And somehow they still think there game so sick
Now I'm finna rip, niggaz know I'm about my grip
I don't trick man I barely even feed a bitch
She say I'm stingy, I said I don't need you bitch
Go ahead leave, see if I chase you, shiit
Tell your mami, I catch her on the street I'ma get her
She know I'm on parole, why she call police on a nigga
She jus' mad, 'cause a nigga pockets all swoll'
When she asked to borrow sumthin', I said hell naw
I was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit
So keep your mind on your money and don't trus no bitch
Keep your head high notes when them pigs came
But her ass kinda fat so niggaz treat her the same
This is real...
Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow Tips and Talons, when it rains it pours
You caught in lead showers, just because

End up wed up, 'cause when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie, in my hood, when it rains it pours
It was blood stains on my stoop when ??Eyeball?? got shot
When homicide outside, nigga I'm not
It's the third time niggaz dunn circled the block
Its money out now, yeah, but damn its hot
They love to catch a nigga on a direct sale
They say tell us who caught the body or you goin' to jail
Look if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge
Say what's happenin' to the captain and what's up to the searg'
Fuck bein' in a cage man that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk drinkin' While Irish Row's on the curb
I know a spot fulla niggaz tryna get a few bucks
Hopin' then nutin' come out they gon' have um some luck
PH to the deuce, they stumbled off Matt
Lost his re-up money man that's all he had
Magazine from the store so he can look at the cars
And do pull-ups in the park on the monkey bars
Man it's fucked...
Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow Tips and Talons, when it rains it pours
You caught in lead showers, just because
Niggaz ain't playin', when it rains it pours

Had talked to the rich ones who flash and floss
Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north
Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exsist
Only wishin we could bring 'em back with songls like this
Old flicks of us chillin' with the old time cliques
Hold the nine start some death not our lives we risk
How it used to be, early morn pumpin in shifts
Jakes with pale faces and the night is the scariest
They handcuffed me, they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin us
The deeds in the marked vans and cabs in our land
Hood rats get stabbed by niggas who forty
Turnin' out young ladies and makin' athourity (?)
Got 'em coked out
The hood is bugged out thug babies
Famous in they strollers
Before they walked they knew the hood talk
Its in the air of New York
So everybody would pick 'em up, kissin' 'em up
Treatin 'em like they own, in this hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown, then these guns come out
Cirlce of life, its kinda deep how we turn out

Peep how I use words to paint pictures
Peep how I got niggas with bodies askin me for 10 cent to go hit ya
Look my name up in the law book: Curtis Jackson
Known for creatin' action, by rapidly clappin
Nigga I stay strapped, so much I nick-name gats

I put four, QB rugged and raw
I got sumthin for the rap cats
Fish tailed back gats
Scope with a beam on it
Loaded put your cream on it
Shine on scheme on it
I make 'em dream about it for ever
Whatever whatever
Get gullied, shots through your leather and cloth
When you scurry off, wake y'all clowns up
Yo hollow tips will fight yo jacket
I don't give a fuck who you be
Millennium thug, now who the fuck wanted beef?
I master the art
Of slap boxin niggas in the dark
QB's big man horse of the braveheart
I'm the sasquatch of rap
Collector of gats
Test the macs on your bullet proof vests and hats
How bout that
Guns bust off I bust back
When trucks backfire I bust back
How bout that?
Stomp a mutha fuckin' rib out your back
Y'all niggas ain't gansta rap
Your clique like josie and the pussy cats
When we come around the front stop
Y'all can't fuck around you'll get dropped
When guns pop, whos tellin'?
Twin barrel nines wavin and yellin'
QB nigga what?
Two time fellon
Straight for the mellon, straight for the dome
Send a nigga back, get the shells, go straight home
Never slip, my ill will to survive is so deep
Can't sleep cause of the death, makes me week

After that 5 hour flight from New York
I start spitting G at a bitch like a pimp man
Tell her meet me at The Mondrian so we can do our thing
She can bring the lingerie with her I suppose
And we can go from fully dressed to just having no clothes
She can run and tell her best friend bout my sex game
Her best friend could potentially be next man

We don't trust ya"

You already know, my mind is on my dough
A millionnaire, don't spend a dolla on a hoe
And I'm still in here, tryna get a model out the door
How am I bother with the bottle of that dro
Slidin' on a roll, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know
And if I wasn't Banks, shorty prolly wouldn't roll
From the Benz to the lobby, from the lobby till the door
If you ain't with the program, now you got to go (go)
(Lloyd Banks Verse)
I move like there's popo behind me
Cocoa inside me, so cold and grimey
44 beside me, hoes know where to find me
Where ever there's money, yeah I'm the shit honey (whoo)
Hood nigga with that rubberband brick money
If I go broke, I'll make you and your man strip dummy
Yeah nigga, you don't want it with them, there bigger cross us
Your on something, weed, their liquor, scared nigga, here trigger
Teflon, chest con, G'z Up, freeze up and you'll end up in your lawn
It's the protege of Fitty (uh huh), inspired by Biggie (uh huh)
Burns more then Ziggie (uh huh), the lil' niggaz dig me (whooo)
I've been stressed out lately, so I'm smokin' more than ever
Then smacked in the hood, good pumpin' out my lever
I'm a goodfella in a G-unit hood sweater
If your bitch give me a sign, I'ma get her
(Lloyd Banks Chorus)
You already know, my mind is on my dough
A millionnaire, don't spend a dolla on a hoe
And I'm still in here, tryna get a model out the door
How am I bother with the bottle of that dro
Slidin' on a roll, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know
And if I wasn't Banks, shorty prolly wouldn't roll
From the Benz to the lobby, from the lobby till the door
If you ain't with the program, now you got to go (go)
(50 Cent:)
There's always folks, moving around with the toasters
Push the rock through the smoker's, warnin' do not approach us
We in the club with the pokers, steppin' in Gucci loafers
Stuntin' in testerosous, down in front with the vultures
My clique be the coldest, baddest bitches they know us
After the show they blow us and do all types of shit for us
Now I can speak for me, 'cause me everywhere I be
Niggaz know I'm a G, got it locked, got the keys
We movin' bundles of D, sippin' on Hennessey
Buck rollin' the trees, Banks countin' the cheese
We get the paper then breeze, nigga we overseas
You stuck in the hood, ah that ain't good
Different town, different tour, different telly, different whore
Triple x, wet sex, who's next, latex
Condom, condo, I'm tight, my money long though
You lookin' for a drink bitch, I ain't what you lookin' for
(Lloyd Banks Chorus)
You already know, my mind is on my dough
A millionnaire, don't spend a dolla on a hoe
And I'm still in here, tryna get a model out the door
How am I bother with the bottle of that dro
Slidin' on a roll, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know
And if I wasn't Banks, shorty prolly wouldn't roll
From the Benz to the lobby, from the lobby till the door

(Young Buck:)
I'm out on bond, but the '40 still on me
Bouncin' round like Lil Jon, thinkin' 'bout my dead homies
Watch I hit me a lick, and go get me a brick
I keep on losin' shootin' dice, and I'm sick of this shit
Clienteles still poppin', so the druggies keep comin'
And my neighbours is watchin', but we still gettin' money, on this block
Till the sun drop, I don't have a home
I will not stop sellin' rocks, thug till I'm gone
Got a couple old schools and some iced out jewels
Some G-Unit shoes, body bullet tattoo
About to stomp me a bitch, put the pump to his lip
Tell him talk that shit nowww, y'all wanna trip
I keep it dirty on the Eastcoast, dirty on the West
Jus' a dirty lil' nigga with a glock and a vest
Banks tell me you don't like him and you know what I'ma do nigga
(Lloyd Banks Chorus)
You already know, my mind is on my dough
A millionnaire, don't spend a dolla on a hoe
And I'm still in here, tryna get a model out the door
How am I bother with the bottle of that dro
Slidin' on a roll, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know
And if I wasn't Banks, shorty prolly wouldn't roll

199,You Know,2014,Animal Ambition (2014),,50 Cent,"Cee-Lo, we know
I'm sitting on leather, I'm a winner
If I crap out the strap out
'Cause I snap right back to the beginning, nigga
You know I will let it pop
Front if you want bitch I will make it hot
You know, you think you ill, but you not
You will need a tombstone, you will need a plot
I peep what niggas hate through my peripherals
Boy, if I leave this club back to the car I got some shit for you
Wanna party? We can paint the town red
Them bottles ain't shit to me, a nigga got bread
I'm big money, big business, I love it
For the bad bitches with big asses and the budget
I'm the boss, until you know shit is going how it got to go
I don't want talk tonight, I might just buy the hoes
My pleasure principle spend no expense
First I'm happy then she happy then she can pay the rent
It's nothing to a nigga when he up
But when they down I bet you he won't give a bitch a bump
Flip and catch an attitude like 'Bitch, what the fuck
You want from a nigga, huh? You fucking up a nigga, huh?'
Look, girl, you know you sitting on a gold mine
Fuck with them other niggas think you so fine
You know I will let it pop
Front if you want bitch I will make it hot
You know, you think you ill, but you not
You will need a tombstone, you will need a plot
My flow hotter than the gun after that clip done
Don't care about the set you claim, motherfuck the gang you bang
I hang around with hustlers and hoodlums
That party get the popping then we beefing and we shooting
Let's party like it's 1999
Flat top Gazelle, the swag going back in time
I got it locked, they can't ignore it
Man, nigga, know some bullshit I'm all for it
Heroin Don seven sixty leaning
Chrome clean, spend a nigga scheming trying to hit a lick
Them victim niggas thinking, 'Damn, why me?'
I'm thinking why these niggas never try me
Maybe they feel the vibe, they know a nigga live
I let it off inside and outside
The club rocking, it's on tonight
Them bottles popping, we getting right
You know I will let it pop
Front if you want bitch I will make it hot
You know, you think you ill, but you not
You will need a tombstone, you will need a plot"
