0,(Hit U) Where It Hurts,2002,Man Vs. Machine (2002),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"(Xzibit)
Where Rock at?
Rock here yet?
It's all good
I done came too far, can't turn back now
Pull it out, get it up, can't put shit down
Best believe to achieve gotta struggle to get it but peep it
It's like you got a body somebody just to keep it
Ain't no secret how the west coast do it
Stick a fork in it, done deal disputed (yeah)
Holdin' two black aces for the smilin' faces
It's a chess game nigga, better count ya spaces
We gon find the weakest link, fuck what you niggaz think
Pump gon repeat and grind y'all to mincemeat
I can't retreat, refusin to lose (yeah)
Walk one day in the X man's shoes
Make shit happen, stomp and smashin'
On and crackin', who want action
Pistol packin, fuck relaxin'
Hit you where it hurts
Make you feel it, can't conceal it
If it breaths then I can kill it
Come and get it, custom-fitted
Hit you where it hurts
I might as well buy a suit right now
Put money on my books downtown to get ready for trial
Look, ya only gotta tell me once
Better wake up and smell these blunts
What's really behind the front
Ain't no parts about me punk
We can thump, don't get too close
Because you might get slump kicked
Front page material, I serial kill shit
Only that real shit, we can scrap or slap clips
My tactics range from Attila the Hun
To Genghis Kahn to the rice fields of Vietnam
Atom bomb my name tag across the sky
Eye for an eye, somebody got to die now
The points that I make be hollow
X a hard act to follow
Disappear in front of your eyes, besides
I switch up rides at least five times
Dangerous minds, caught behind enemy lines
Read the signs, better yet you pick your place
Got a 4-4 eagle to split your face
Nigga you be safe we invade your space
Beat you, beat your team, then beat the case
Poker face, niggaz can't read me yo
Green light a mothafucker fa sho, let's go
Stay low, we the unforgiven
Hard to touch like pussy in Britain
Can't stop me from living, muh-fucka

1,1983,2012,Napalm (2012),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"I had the right to sublurr, because they ache one stick
I saw five to six million but, yo, that ain't really shit
It was supposed to be different, we were supposed to write out
But tumach shot his girl, then shot himself in the mouth
Then the steady game form very soon fell apart
Because when you just doing all, the loyalty in your heart
Slight catch a long hymn on all these niggas
Forgetting where they're coming from
And they're slowing down, wait a minute, what we're running from?
This what we're supposed to do, here's where we're supposed to be
I hated MTV for trying to play me like a mockery
But that don't bother me, I just fulfill my fucking contract
Small price to pay just to take a piece of my back
My back, backfire, assassination of my character
Just demassing me in the America
My younger sister, Erika, just adopted a child
My older brother served fifteen, he made it out
Even though my father loved me, I ain't seen him for a while
Had to fight my baby, bitch, give me my nigga now
'Cause I'm running out of time and I need him to understand
The way a superior man had build a brand
Niggas talk about my taxes, had to pay, I consemn
I'm surviving cause the lines ass crooked in the hand
Heartbreak, disappointment, my mother died when I was nine
I just wanted to join her
Now I miss to join her, get to California
I got something for you to do, it was like I was annoying
Resurrected, found my purpose, I remember being dragged
Being nervous when I would kick my verses
I was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus
I was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it
Got a call from Paul, told me shit isn't working
Exchange words, told me tell me that shit in person
He probably told him, and by the way did he said it
On a prolijetic twisted made about him
I see Slim and he said he didn't recognize me
Was it that or did he let another man to find me?
I don't know, but now I gotta get this all behind me
Follow my calling when I used to follow niggas blindly
I wish I had a better relationship with my uncles
Blood relatives I could turn to when I'm feeling trouble
And talk about my struggles
My uncle John Nail, he only put me on the phone
With different females
And this is such a such, nephew, tell me, what's up?
Ain't even ask about your man in Cali, growing up
Fuck, I drink it all and I smash the bottle
Self medicated numb, but I'm a feel it tomorrow
It feel like pain and sorrow was like a second skin
But now that pain was gone I got my second win
Only the strong live long, you better settle in
I'm fighting for ever, I will never let the devil win
1983, that's when my journey begins
I searched every word for stritting, only find it within
This for me and my kid, still trying to live
Living life to the fullest till I see you again"

What, yeah, yeah
Black John McClane, Harold the Menace, and the Waterproof
With my nigga Bud'da, on the track
Golden State Warriors...
Eatin every rapper on the plate
Huh, feel me
I got three-oh-fo's in three-one-oh
On section eight, with multiple one-eighty-sevens
Sport a Marilyn Manson t-shirt when I die and go to heaven
Smoke a beady, scrape my lungs, smoke the resin
Remember the name Ras Kass-ciano
Get to clownin y'all punk bitches, 'cause I'm a Mac, like Ronald
I make Mac make money, and mack murder wack rappers
My Makaveli verse Bomb First, the Mac-11'll gat cha
When I get at cha, the situation tenses
Fatality before you ever reach your senses
Got so-called writers, crashing into brick fences
Like my name was Al Fayed so you die, like that white princess
If you lookin' for sympathy, you better look
Between R and T, in the fucking dictionary
See the object of the game is to win, stack some ends, sippin Henn'
Whip a Benz and leave it to your next of kin

The un-edited medic, on the cut, with a degree in metaphysics
A doctor, with a lot of patients/patience
And perseverance -- flows like an ocean liner
That sails/sales like a clearance, I'm bilingual
Fly like a flamingo, I'm a pitcha, everything I freak
I eat like Al Pacino, you don't like me baby
You ain't happy, you need some Ecstasy
Now you in my properties, but you have to pay my equity
For the lowest point in my character
I'll reach the highest place in the house when I rock
Like the Qu'ran, fuse hot, fluid with flavor like buillion cube
Been this way since I was fourteen
And like this I been runnin' shit without the use of Sportscreme
Rippin up tracks like immigrant Chinese, peep the game I lay
I'm grim, I brim over my brow when I rip
Never write rhymes with slim fingertips
Each syllable you choose to use is light as a flower
Keep tryin' to go gold
But all you're gettin' is a golden shower

Look, now if it wasn't for the West
These rap niggaz wouldn't need a vest around they chest
Keep bustin' about where you rest, and what you own, and what you drive
So the day some niggaz come for you I'm really not surprised
Mr. Black Bruce Willis, please don't kill us
I show mercy like Kevorkian, like a scorpion
We sting you from behind and put it in you, so meet me at the venue
Put you on the spot to put you on the menu
Fricaseed emcee, we be the ones that keep the pussy hot
Xzibit livin' life, like a bull inside a china shop
Strippin everything, see you ain't even got a dime to drop
Go ahead and call the cops, you ain't said nathin
Jerry Spring-you out the studio, then Suge Knight you
To the parkin lot, niggaz ain't ready for all this heat we got
Picture yourself crushin Xzibit with your tough talk
That's like Christopher Reeves doing the crip walk
Chorus: repeat 2X

3,A Minute To Pray,2006,Full Circle (2006),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"Yeah, it's been a long time
Welcome back, yeah
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Got niggaz jumpin' out the buildin like 9/11, c'mon
(Xzibit)
Only God could save us
I done burned down the town and killed my neighbor
Do I, come to you for my early demise? (yeah)
A minute to pray, it only take a second to die
Niggaz ain't prepared, too scared to do it
Dippin cigerettes in embalmin fluid
Hoods, special effects bring the drama to it
But sue me if you wanna see the trauma youth
I'm a walkin' time bomb, don't tick me off
Crucified to die, nailed to the cross
Natural transition, foot soldier to boss
The A.K. ricochet put blood in your cough
And you know the whole fucked up part of it all?
Take a muh'fucker's life somebody comin' for yours
It's the get-back gangstas don't believe in karma
Only the strength of the dollar and the body armor
You the bitch ass nigga or a man of honor
My hands wrap around your throat like a anaconda
Then squeeze till your eyes pop out of your face
Then relocate to a brand new space (yo)
(Chorus: Xzibit)
Only God could save us (yeah)
I done burned down the town and killed my neighbor (yeah)
Do I, come to you with blood on my hands (yeah)
Or run away from the place that I stand? WHO THE F**K I AM, Yeah!
Only God could save us
I done burned down the town and killed my neighbor
Do I, come to you for my early demise?
A minute to pray, it only take a second to die
(Xzibit)
I used to snatch people out of cars with a shotgun
Now I give cars to people who ain't got one
Still got the shotgun, whole different lifestyle
Kill you with a crowbar, wrapped in a white towel
Gotta play it smart now, the streets is watchin
The streets dictate the beats so my beats be knockin'
Fuck a Strong Arm, I'll drop your coffin
Yeah yeah, muh'fucker I hear you talkin'
Niggaz so often take kindness for weakness
Heat-seekin' G with the elite on some cheap shit
This my square boy, you can't take me out of it
You want war nigga you better bring a lot of it
I ain't a problem with puttin' my problems to rest
You so pussy, boy you need a gynocologist
The hand, the bullet, the firin pin
Please God forgive me for I have sinned, Amen
(Xzibit)
Huh, hit a nigga, kill a nigga will come back
Murder rap never attached, got too many snaps
It's more than raps, it's actual facts
Welcome back to the West, left side of your map
Been attacked from all sides, it's time for the payback
Lay back, wait for the right time to spray that
Spray that motherfucker, down to the last clip
Last clip you save for the cop on some waive shit
Blaze haze for days; shocked, stunned, amazed
Bitch best behave or take the fade
Blaze Shade-45 in the all-black Bentley
If I gotta go, y'all niggaz comin' with me
Simply put, Mobb Deep said y'all were (Shook)
And when I come through, you just look
We don't change the game, we close the book
I let you go now, I know you got crack to cook, c'mon"

(E) Xzibit!
(X) Yeah...
(E) Ah, ah, E-Dub
(Xzibit)
It's that millennium ridiculous flow, I never let go
Niggaz gettin' knocked out is part of my show
Let 'em know who they fuckin' with yo, a rhyme wrangler
Tri-angular push-up the hillside strangler
Dangle a, nigga by the ankle off the balcony
Now let his punk ass go, look out below (BELOWWWW)
It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down
We officially not fuckin' around
Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box
(Hah!) with my fresh pressed khakis in a slingshot
So heatbox all day in a nigga face
And all you bitches see the dick that you shoulda ate
(Chorus 2X: Xzibit *singing*)
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fuckin' Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it!
(Erick Sermon)
Yo, I'm in the zone, and lyrically gone
Got the spot blown, BOOM! Oklahoma
Watch the aroma, catch those who love me
My underground dirty cats on dune buggies
I be the type to take your watch and flaunt it
Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it
Yo, I bang a nigga head till his neck pop
Do a KRS-One to a ""Black Cop""
X and E's, out for cream
Get the money, while you stay broker than Al Bundy
Uh, give it to y'all, in ""Any Given Sunday""
With J. Foxx name the spot, make it hot
(I hate E so much right now!) Blow it down hooker bounce
Come off the ropes like J. Snooka
(*X*: Two fly motherfuckers) You can't fuck widdit
Backed by +Open Bar+, so y'all forget it
(J-Ro)
J-McEnroe, cam smashin', party crashin'
I eat MC's like a ration
I'm sockin' niggaz in they goatees
I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies
I'm in the room with 10 G's, countin' ten G's
'Cause we need a bag of weed (can you smell it?)
Now we need ten dimes, to blow on deez like wind chimes
Time to close the blinds cause you all in mines
I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it
Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot
You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance
You underground, we under water drinkin' liquid by the gallons
(Tash)
Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin', head rushin'
Since I'm too drunk to walk, I rock a party on crutches
And still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it
Forget it, it's Likwit, Tha Liks and, Xzibit
Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle
I slap bitches on the ass I slap tits up out the muzzle
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent
You whack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the mother fuckin' difference
For instance, ""21 and Over"" set your clocks back
(Tick tock tick tock) Still standin' where the rocks at
Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's +Restless+
(Thirty niggaz, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin guestlist!"
5,At The Speed Of Life,1996,At The Speed Of Life (1996),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"Listen you fuckers, you screwheads
Here's a man who won't take it anymore
A man who stood up against
The scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit
Here is some one who stood up
Here is...
Yeah! Hennessy for everyone music proudly presents
Xzibit, movin at the speed of life
Yeah! check it
Verse One:
It took a long time comin' but we waited
Xzibit went from underated
To now most anticipaded
Never would have thought that I would rock your set
And get love and respect without no special effects
Only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need
Lyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed
Thinkin' how you like to see the next man bleed
Tryin' to glority greed
Livin' life at ridiculuos speed
Indeed, The main goal to achieve, is to succeed
Have it laid out for your seed
But the world gets colder every day by day
Physically, mentally gettin' drained by L.A.
Trying to find piece of mind
Is like trying to find a gold mine
It just wont happen
No time for relaxin
Real soldiers of fortune
The front line of the action
So never show a nigga what you packin'
""You know what I'm sayin'?""
It's too much weight to be juggling
Who do you picture when you think about struggling
Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubblin
Niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin
Movin... yeah!
Yes movin...
At the speed of life
Verse Two:
And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine
There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes
But nowadays the blind just follow the blind
And when I die,
Niggas still recite these lines
To rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns
Bringin' strength to the masses that be holdin' it down
The underground, to upper echelon and beyond
Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond
Nigga wanna trip you gettin' dissed like a blond bitch
Mackin to Farrakhan, I run game like a marathon
It's here today then tomorrow it's gone
It's the law of the land
A straight modern day babylon!
Movin... yeah! yeah! like this
Like this... at the speed of life
Ah! Bring it live, yeah!
Verse Three:
Xzibit lookin' at the earth through wide angles
I found a stairway to heaven in a city of lost angels
Where small situations turn to altercation
With a heavy ass price
'Cause niggas don't fight no more
Before hip hop was all about drama
Anything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madona
Xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma
Just me and my bottle
We shall lead not follow
Emcees be full of shit
But they style be hollow
It seems you've bitin off more
Than you can possibly swallow
Just a day in the life of a man named X
Only blunt and latex for the opposite sex
You see niggas comin' through to smoke and pay respect
Ever since fifteen, I been ready for anything
Whatever they bring in any shape, form or fashion
I live to the fullest and rip rhyme with a passion
But in the mean while if worse comes to worst
Bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first
Yeah, we got it locked down tight
Xzibit bring truth to the light
Shit is movin at the speed of life
Movin...
At the speed of life"

Yeah baby, that's right, you know how we do it
One time, X, where you at my nigga?
Fiyah!

I spread the hate, like Taliban records and tapes
Shoot five times to the sky, gimme some space
I got y'all, runnin' in place, cut to the heart of the subject
(MASH OUT NIGGAZ!) Straight from the gutter you love it
Ain't nothin' above it, we stomp y'all religiously
Watchin paper thugs tryin' to hide behind the industry
From here to infinity, love thy enemy
Niggaz got the knowledge but don't know the chemistry
All inside your baseball hat and kneecaps
With baseball bats ('TIL FAME HIT YOU WITH THE MINI-MAC)
Full body black fatigues, lungs black from weed
In black limo tinted SUV's with Bill
(Billy Danze)
STILL (still) WORLD (world) FAMOUS
The underdogs of rap, back to claim this, the fact remain we're
Heartless and painless, it's dangerous to strangers
That try to change us, knowin' we're anxious to flame 'em
(Chorus 2X: Xzibit + M.O.P.)
(X) Huh, you want problems I'ma bring 'em to you
(B) We cockin them thangs
(X) Yeah, I got a song let me sing it to you

From N.Y.C., the N.Y.G. (IT'S)
M.O.P., and X to the Z
Is a friend of our family (Yeah MY NIGGA)
For you, counterfeit, wannabe hardcore players
I rub you under your face with single-edged razors
Cold street INTELLIGENCE, O.G.'s and REBEL MEN
Grip quick, cock squeeze and LEVEL MEN to SETTLE IT
(From L.A. to) B.K., from B.K. to (L.A.)
Persistant and insistant on doin' it our way
Do you really wanna fuck with Danze? (c'mon)
When he comin' with them thugs in the van
Double clutch in his hands, my nigga
(Lil' Fame)
Make the world flame! Face the Fame-ster, part, Fame-ster
Y'all niggaz akin to God and gangsters
(YOU SEE IT!) It's the M dot, to the O dot, to the P
With X to the Z hot, what's happenin'?
(Interlude 2X: Xzibit)
Hunt down, hurt, hang and hate the hater
Watch how you rise, fall and thank me later
Look in my eyes, I should not have to say it
Look alive, these streets is complicated
(Lil' Fame)
AOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! You got problems with us? Start poppin'
I get in yo' chest like anthrax, vaccine couldn't stop it
Let's move on 'em (aoww) must move on 'em
Rush in, gun-bustin', black seven plus tools on 'em
Never snooze on 'em, I'm short, haven't got room for 'em
I send you to God with no shoes
CLUELESS! Real G's run this, we rule this
If you wanna get into some gangsta shit, let's do this
(YES SIR!) No question, no half-steppin
Streets is my profession, heat in my possession
Hollow-tips is the answer; look around you see the signs
Say ""NO SMOKIN"" but our guns got cancer!
(Xzibit)
Yeah 'cause I'm not (I'm not) what you thought I was
Like my career was gon' fade like a fuckin' buzz
Raise the stakes high, I solidify
The grip that I keep on shit, GET OFF MY DICK!

7,Back 2 The Way It Was,2004,Weapons of Mass Destruction (2004),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"Yeah... yo... c'mon
Ride wit me, lemme take you somewhere
(Xzibit)
My father was a soldier, my mother was a rider
I was born wit my fists balled up, I'ma fighter
Inspired, a real rhyme writer
Get past the past the future looks brighter
But, I wanna get it back to the way it was
Exchange blows, elbows and it was still love
A better time, better place in space
Cause nothin' can erase, shame tat' like my nigga Chase
Cause Bigga B will never be replaced, right
And I'ma scream it to the whole fuckin' human race
Get a bar, get a taste
Enforce the muscle to ya hustle and ya did it with grace
Cause real niggaz don't save face, they make movements
Back to the time when hip-hop was music
When N.W.A. got booed at the Apollo
Broke ""Straight Outta Compton"" and the whole world followed
Cause right now hip-hop is hollow
With no substance, X-Man with the roughness
Cause success can suck sometime
And many of us the way we act, we even lost our minds
You can hold your breath, till your blue in the face
But you can never ever take my place
I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong
Through the struggle I will live on (now sing the song wit me)
You can speculate, on every breath I take
But you can never ever take my place
I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong
Through the struggle I will live on
(Xzibit)
Back to the day when +Cooley+ was +High+
Hustle big like Butch in the Y-B-I
We did it 'n' died, the gang still multiplied
Sock yo windpipe, cut yo air supply
Hypnotized, not by the glitz 'n' glamour
So fuck them cameras, all I need is clips and hammers
The X-Man said that the first rhyme out
Were my fans worth my time? The first line out, so
Here we are eight years strong and still movin
Groovin with a reputation ya can't ruin
I wanna take it back how it used to be
Five thousand fucked up, rockin' outta unity
(Xzibit)
Was it the alcohol in you, the money the power the fame
That made you actually attempt to try to disgrace my name?
Played those games nigga when I was younger in life
Till I seen another man's life cut short with a knife
Lose teeth, cause beef, no peace with us
Ya can't hang, and ya sho' can't eat with us
When times get tough, the tough get rough and drastic
Never been blasted, never been an arrogant bastard
But I coulda been a lawyer, I shoulda been a doctor
I never been a actor, I'm nothin' but a monster
I move in silence, speak with violence
Think with science, live free and walk with lions
Cats around me with gats like Yasser Arafat
It takes a nation of millions to hold me back
Pounds of cush to push what I'm talkin' about
It's hard to talk the talk with a gauge in yo mouth
It's hard to walk the walk with ya back blew out
Don't let the things that you can't change stress you out
Cause X take the money and run, and raise a man from a son
And change the world with the power of one c'mon"

Rrrah, uh, bitch!
It's radio radio station, cat Xzibit huh?

Rrrah uh, bitch - you took too long
Caller number two like this...
(Xzibit)
{*BZZT*} Bounce up out of the house close to midnight
Full rack up in the back {*BZZ BZZ*} shit is tight
Full charge and I'm out for somethin'
Mass production, Battlecat bang percussion
End of discussion, hittin some corners, rearrange thangs
And brang change, we expand California
Listen - I lost more than I can ever gain back
From this road to riches, makin' my heart turn black
So I'm cold to bitches, and I never call back
Plus I'm stoned and vicious, lay your whole hood flat
Get your, shit together nigga Big Snoop Dogg told me
'Do music and leave that other shit alone homey'
We came from dust, the X-odus, the hard to touch
Y'all niggaz ain't fuckin' with us, and plus
It ain't nothin' like standin on your own two
So run them streets, but never let 'em run you
(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
Time is steady wastin, steady wastin
Since time won't wait for me, yeah, won't wait, won't wait
Just give me a beat that's bang, give me a beat that's bangin'
I'll bust till I'm deceased, yeah, woo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(Xzibit)
Tune in, witness the rise of a icon
The python wrap around till your breath gone
The upper echelon, and I'm the cat you pull a weapon on
And wanna squeeze till my life is gone?
Back to the wall and trust nobody
Sippin Cognac with Kurupt, Young Gotti
Somebody gotta recognize this
Throw fo' fingers up, add a thumb, then make it a fist
Number one draft pick, lead the league in assists
Give a fuck how you decorate your neck and your wrists
You just settin yourself up for the twist (gimme that) it's like this
Only a few slide through like the Schindler's List
Who's the bitch, who's the mack, what's worse
The niggaz that bring in the coke or smoke the crack?
Metaphor figure four let it break your back (yeah)
It's been a long time, where the gangstas at?
(Xzibit)
Damn it feels good to be back in the saddle
On top of the game, crackin' the frame, the heat of the battle
Been a long time comin' but we waited
Xzibit went from bein hated, to makin' the whole world say it
Give a fuck if the radio play it
Niggaz fall like the domino effect and you can't delay it
It ain't about who you are when you're makin' your stack
It's the look that's on your face when you givin' it back
So picture that
(Nate Dogg)
Time, keeps on slippin, slippin... keeps on slippin away... mm-hmm
My mind keeps on trippin', trippin'... trippin' like ev-ery-day... mm-hmm

This hollow point lead gon' be your last meal
Say your prayers, say your graces
Pieces of your face is found in a hundred different places
Huh, so what we lookin' like? We tryin' to see some hoes to fuck tonight
And you just tryin' to see the afterlife
Make a decision before we have a head-on collision
Makin' me spend the rest of my life in prison
See I can only play the cards I was given
Multiplication division whatever you got to break mines off
Like the U.S. government did to Microsoft
Like Xzibit in some pussy with the lights turned off
It's like
I'm just livin' to fulfill my dreams
I'm just tryin' to have the best of things
None of y'all can't take shit from me
Life's a bitch she ain't fuckin' for free
So I'ma ride till the wheels fall off
While all the rest get weak and go soft
Your petite style, can get you beat down
My heat's loud, have you huggin on the street now
(Xzibit)
Niggaz keep askin me how does it feel
How does WHAT feel? Not havin' to scrape for a meal?
Not bein locked down to a fucked up deal?
The biggest man in Los Angeles is not Shaquille
We had to reinvent the wheel, draft new blueprints
Made a whole album, spent HALF what you spent
Then sent the rest to my people to invest wit it
Custom fitted, if you want it nigga, come and get it
And I suggest you bring a million niggaz runnin' wit it
Split it, feel it, hit it it's hot, look
I ain't gon' stop till everybody's shot
Muammar Khadaf's the dot, X mark the spot
With an infrared to your head, left for dead
Fuck the feds, flee the country then grow some dreads (ya mon)
I suggest you keep your distance, for instance, the same distance
It takes to get to the next solar system, motherfucker
(Xzibit)
Strike one, when a nigga talkin' shit with his hands
Strike two, gettin' caught in the wrong place with your pants down
Strike three, tryin' to fuck with the D-O-double-G
D-R-E, or any of my Alkaholik family
Huh, Xzibit turn your vital signs to a straight line
Never seen a dog bite and bark at the same time
Restless, rugged, never relaxed
Permanently owe you motherfuckers backs like tax
Baseball bats and breaks upside of your head
Homey STILL gettin' swoll off water and bread
I got this, retaliation, for any situation I'm facin
And leave the stage with a standin ovation, it's like"

Fuck them niggaz run from me I don't owe 'em
Why do things for free, you don't know 'em
These niggaz'll load up the heat, they don't throw 'em
Hooks stay floatin in my mind, I design 'em like
Architects workin online, I'm on the incline
Lamp like the heavyweight champ, it took 3 months of trainin
While it's rainin take your brain through boot camp
Fair facts, Nike Air Max, I'm back blunted

Triple trick niggaz get sick to they stomach

Every day above ground is a good day

We get bars, big cars, cigars
12 gauge salute to your face to face God
Icon, marathon mack, where the bitches at?
Raise it back, steady game, came with a gang of gats
I hit your pressure points, we jack the motherlode
Expose your motives like a CSI episode
Output maximum level, dig deep down in the dirt
With diligence and dance with the devil, yeah
Cause you don't know me homey, I keep the banger on me
It wasn't my aim, it came with the territory
Feet planted firm in the turf, plant you six feet deep in the earth

Step for real or I'll leave your grill scarred like Seal

'Cause you females can see it yourself
There are bitches out there
Like there's punk ass nigga
There's bitch ass niggaz
And there's men
There's ladies
There's hoes
There's women
And there's bitches
Niggaz act like bitch ass niggaz
'Cause they want to jock the nigga that got it going on
Just like a stanky bitch!
A bitch ass nigga is a male ho!
That nigga's backstage
Knocking at the door,
""Can I get in for free?""
No, bitch! You ain't got no pussy!
Bitch ass nigga, what you serving in this equation?
One plus one equal two
That will never happen with me and you.
Bitch ass nigga
Bitch ass niggaz will come to your door
And knock and say,
""Remember me?""
No, nigga, I don't remember you
'Cause when I was creating me, you told me I would never be me

Let me light my backport

That's why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown
Yo, I love Los Angeles, you can hear it in my music
Plus I got the scars to prove it
And man... you don't understand what I understand
I'm feelin' like a piece to a bigger plan
'Cause all I'm sayin' is the God honest truth of it all, we fightin the wrong enemy
That's why I'm gettin' invovled, it's just like the end of that movie ""Saw""
When them two chained up guys met with their demise
And the mastermind was layin there the whole time
Remember that? That's why we have to sit down
And speak about the black and the brown
Now I didn't come here to point no fingers
I know over the years that the pain still lingers over past confrontations
Shit we all on parole and probation and fucked up situations
And everybody lose... from the pen, to the neighborhoods, now it's even the high schools
'Cause I was watchin K. Cal News
When the students squared off and one kid wouldn't choose sides
Hit with a hammer and the kid died and now it's a full blown riot
Tck, that's when the fists start flyin
These kids ain't learnin shit about math and science
Man...

Tension is so thick, some are comin' around
I don't wanna see no more of us up under the ground
So now... that's why we need to sit down

They tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet
Dammit... that's why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown

Yo, I got the homey Jose from way back in the day
He came to scoop me up in his all white Six-Trey
And he don't really fuck with nobody outside of the set
It's tatted big on his neck
Y'know? So over the years, built respect and trust
Some black and brown issues we both discussed
He said, ""Homes, it's been goin' down too long
I gotta bang on them fools and it don't feel wrong""
""They killed my cousin over eighty eight bricks
So word came down, we gotta handle that shit""
""Kill all mayatas in white tee shirts
Can I tell the truth homes? The truth starts hurtin""
At first, I remind him of what vengeance do
What vengeance is and who vengeance belongs to
He wasn't tryna hear that shit
He just turned up the volume, bangin' 50 Cent
(Xzibit)
I got soldiers from both sides who really don't care
Who identify themselves by the colors they wear
The homey came through to put one in the air
I can tell somethin' was wrong the way he sat in his chair
He said, ""X, man I'm just gettin' out
From doin' eighty eight months, tryna figure things out""
He told me in the pen you get down to get done
'Cause the brown and black ratio is five to one
He showed me the scar on his gut and his neck
They got him good, said he damn near bled to death
The hate was do deep, I can see in his eyes
When he described what it feels like to almost die
All I could do was just sit back and listen
'Bout how he 'bout to send soldiers on missions
I got hit with a bottle but I'm not dead
I said, ""Think with your heart homey, not your head""
I said

Ooh you must defend yourself (Yeah!)
If you don't, then no one else (Nobody!)
Your homies got to ride (Let's go!)

I really wish I could you know at twenty-one
YouknowhatI'msayin', he he, yo yo
(I'ma tell you exactly why I do the things
I do, youknowhatI'm sayin')
Gotta carry the weight youknowhatI'msayin'
Go ahead
Yeah! I break it down like this
Verse One:
You see I don't like to remenisce about the past
The lower class, no clout livin' hand to mouth
Each and every wrong move the police keep count
Make it real fuckin' easy to get streched out
I was at the funeral when it all began
You know the painful transition from a boy to men
I lost sight of my mother at the age of nine
Didn't understand death nearly lost my mind
But see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it
Age ten, new step family arrangement
At thirteen, I started gettin' hair on my dick
And noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit
I would forever be hit with anything in reach
Then my father would proceed to go to church and preach
About forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked
Gettin' jump when he said and the head gat cracked
Physical contact was in form of a slap
At the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back
Courtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap
Left the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black
Ran away from the house of Teresa and Nate
Into juvenile detention where I built up hate
I don't remember the date of the judicial debate
But legally I was now in custody of the state
And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
Gotta find some way to release this hate
And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
Gotta find some way Xzibit carry the weight
Interlude: Xzibit, (J-Ro)
(Yeah it's fucked up though man)
(YouknowhatI'msayin')
Yo
(The fuck you doin' in jail)
Insane man, I don't know man, he he he
(Yeah wats goin' on down there, gotta get out dude)
Yeah I be out in couple of weeks man
YouknowI'msayin'
(It's popin' man)
It's cool yo fuck that
(It's popin' out here)
They can go on and on for that
(I'm tellin' you it's popin' man come home)
Verse Two:
And that was worse then the treatment I was gettin' at home
But only now I was fucked up plus all alone
My father talkin' all crazy to me over the phone
Turned age sixteen now on my own
Started running with cats who carried gats 'cause they had too
With no hesitation lock load then blast you
Without a hastle we in a town of hicks
Fuckin' all these chicks
Sellin' rock by the bricks
So we feelin' like we mothafuckin' Nino Brown
At the house when the mothafuckin' man touched down
Screamin' demands ""Let me see your goddamn hands (now)""
A.T.F. cause of handguns and contraban
We never kept it in the house
So of course we clounded
Only found one pistol took us all down town
We be out by the end of the afternoon
Gettin' drunk on the strip let the system BOOM!
Who would assume Mr. QK would chill with a wife
Ty and Matt caught bodies
Now they spend there life behind bars
Catchin' scars that will not heal
Niggas don't know the half about keepin' it real
Like this
Like this, like that
Yeah! gotta carry the weight
Like this euh!
Bringin' live
Yeah! yeah! like this
It's Xzibit
Gotta carry the weight
Like that yo!
Like that yo!"

The official representative, LAC
This is phrophecy manifested by X to the Z
Victory, strike a B-Boy stance in khaki pants
Never get along like red and black ants, advance
When your staring and this concrete that move like liquid
Like a nigga withouth legs, I ain't tryin' to kick it
To much to finish, a menace, without enought time
My mind only give punchline, you probably thinkin' of the wrong kind
'Cause if it jokes, nigga know
The kind that drop on your eyes, your ears, your nose, and your throat
I promote self-defense not dollars and sense
Kick it with scholars and pimps, you just the last part over the fence
Assed out in the open, while you was hopin that Xzibit was second rate
But I refuse to make; just another record in the crate
I think not, got bee-bops
I bring it to your house like pizza
""Today we are on the streets of South Central Los Angelos, a fight for
Survival""
""We have people that are conditioned not to expect to live past age thirty.
They no longer. Once they no longer care they're extremely dangerous.""
Verse Two:
Stand at attention, make sure you keep your piece clean
When I release steam, police crime scenes to guillotines
Hit and decapatate the bird case, featherweight
Critical thinking, while you at water that concentrate
Xzibit crash the gate, heavyweight, box 'em in
Seal off the exits, then cut off your Oxygen
Xzibit run with a regiment of veterans
I only like to come out Late Night, like Dave Letterman
Time for some medicine, cause niggas bout to get sick
Callin me a hater 'cause I don't ride dicks
Read my lips, we got problems like Bloods and Crips
Love the sound of clips when I know my shit
Chamber Music, this is for the ones with stone-face
That catch you at the right time in the wrong place
We unsafe, One-fifty-one with no chase and no ice
Take away your life like three strikes
Yeah, come on, Chamber Music
Verse Three:
So now Xzibit got a little money, I think its funny
How motherfuckers think I'm supposed to Cher/share like Sonny
Clarify, you don't work you don't eat, I repeat
You don't eat you get weak, catch a fragile physique
Accomplish more in one day, than you can do in a week
The X-Man, Wolverine, one swing to make the cut clean
And the wrong things manifested in flesh
Fuck the game, I take the test, graduate, pass to the S-Class
Catch a roadrash, all you smell is hash
Chronic mix, bumpin the Liks
And dick you like a Hebron fix
Bear-arm from here to a hundred-tweny meters
Get black-walled, modern day Lee Harvey Oswald
The assassin, brother who came blastin
Take it without askin, rappers is all fashion
Xzibit keep mashing through
Got any lost words? I got two
Drive up, on you like that!
Once again Chamber Music, what what, yeah, what the deal? It's Xzibit.
Get on the ground, get on the ground! Hands on the back of your head, Don'

I know what she like, she act right
She act like she ain't gon' survive the night
Without my dick all up in her ass, so quick, so fast
I see her twin towers and I'm ready to crash
Walk around naked witcha beautiful ass
Who the fuck taught ya how to move that fast?
It took time to perfect the stroke, by any note
Maybe we really don't need to drink and smoke
And just try a new position, perfect your dick kissin'
Bang on your G-spot till your (voice is missin')

I work hard when I'm breakin your back, my lil' nyphomaniac
Suck it, swallow it, down the hatch
It ain't a game when she givin' me brain, she doin' her thang
I'm up all night but I never complain
I don't, waste no time with makeup lines
I just, look in her eyes and read the signs
A lot of dudes wanna pull on her arm
Cause her ass and titties light up a room like a major city
Just look how she fit in them jeans, it ain't fair
She get off too quick, when I pull on her hair
I'm the only nigga that can take you there
I ain't the only one fuckin' and I don't care!
She come through with a couple of friends, a couple bottles of gin
And then, that's where the party begins
And I'm the only nigga that's around for blocks
Baby get on top, and don't you stop!
(Xzibit)
I know you love the way I'm diggin it out
I know it's hard to talk with all this dick in your mouth
Menage-a-trois, for moi, let's figure this out
I drink your Hennesey fifth, let's work the shit out
She don't gotta cheat 'cause it's a waste of her time
She'll never find another dick that's bigger than mine
Hands and knees side by side, I hit from behind
Flip it up, givin' a fuck, we fuck all night
Bottom line, when I straighten your spine
I'm gon' find spots that ain't been hit and blow your mind
Get in line, bitches stay on the grind, 'cause I'm on mines
Redecorate your hips and lips and thighs
Ain't surprised you can be so pretty and be so nasty
Ass in the air like a pass to Grassi
It's a, thin line between hoes and women
And close my dick with a hat and change the linen

Justine, 19, just got clean
Fresh outta rehab with self-esteem
She ain't felt this good in a while
A new leash on life, a vibrant thang, a beautiful smile
Used to run with a circle of friends, who was skeleton thin
Sniff white lines off powerful men
But see, all that's a thang of the past, she got class
And be damned if she'd let herself burn and crash
She ain't from money so she startin from scratch
It's hard working for scraps
It take everything she got not to relaspe
Locked down in 9 to 5, but at the 9 to 5
She get sexually harassed and chastised
Boss is a married man, she won't touch him
Frustrated angry man, she won't fuck him
She's out of her job, at Basket Cakes
Least it came wit an 8, 2 lines to the face
God Damn!
It's a cold, cold, world, and you know it
Niggaz will lay you down and take your bread, yeah and you know it
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it!
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it, yeah

He was on his own, at a very young age
When he learned from the streets, made everything change
See he came up with hustlers, lost his religion
It's funny how money can make a nigga think he livin'
I ain't talkin' paper like Jigga or Dre
It's more like 7500, 9 ounces of lle'
That's what he say he can get for the flip, they thought the deal was legit
But he stuck him and split, in deep shit
Now his mother work for minimum pay
Live a positive way, she the first one at church every Sunday
Blind to the needs of her son, he's a gatling gun
In the streets, jackin niggaz for fun
It's a non-stop search through the hood, but can't catch him
They found out where mom stayed and went steppin
The evil that men do, but still we continue
With death and dishonor, for the all mighty dollar, it's so cold
(Verse 3: Xzibit)
He was 13, brought up in Baghdad
Ate with his right and made money with his left hand
Prayed to the East, 5 times daily
His mother and father just had a new born baby
Now his father was an Imam who carried the weight
And built his family on 5 pillars of faith
Never trippin' off Western ways, it meant nada
Pilgramige to Mecca to circle around Kabba
300 miles away, British troops hit Basra
His cousin waged jihad and died with honor
He heard about the buildings on 9-11
And a man named Bush on a search for weapons
Now here come the U.S., to crush Saddam
Wit 88 thousand tons of missile and bombs
But his family's too broke to move or find shelter
If they all had to die, they would die together and that's cold... damn"

Concentrate, move that weight

Contemplate, demonstrate
Mind over mayhem, no mistakes
Lift some weights, eat some steaks

(Chorus: Butch Cassidy)
I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me, 'cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho
(Suga Free)
Comin' from a cat, that uh
Believe that if wasn't nobody else in the world to pimp
He'll probably pimp hisself, that's me, Suga Free
Dig that, yeah, again? Uh X, man, y'know
If I don't slop her man she feel like I don't love her, youknowhatI'mtalkinabout?
This thing takes all kinds of turns and switches and changes, y'know
It's called the P - Steady!
(Strong Arm Steady - 1)
Woman out the wilderness - bitch!
The homies say you got a wildabeast piece
But she a dimepiece, her mind lost, thrown off course
She been divorced twice, overwhelmed by - bad advice
From a past life, she crazy though
Call my telephone a hundred times in a row
I don't know how to let her go
I'm stuck with this ho - pardon me
But she ain't nuttin but the worst part of me
She even threatened to slice her artery
I gotta watch my God Degree
She tried to voodoo the peas and throw her eyelashes in the recipe
Please, it's more than she's spittin' in my lemonade
And R. Kelly ain't got the right to sing the hook, like Butch
Yeah, c'mon, spit it
(Strong Arm Steady - 2)
Now since chickens of a feather be cluckin together
And I met her through Aiesha, I shoulda known better
She a pro-fessional charger Laker chaser
The kind that'll lie and say one of 'em raped her (trick)
But she in love with a gangsta
And it's been all trivial since the day that I janked her
Swore she wasn't ghetto but I met her at Fairmont
Shoulda knew she was a gangsta when she said that it wasn't her man's car
- But now she crazy over me
Tryin' to OD, 'cause she can't be with me
She'll, fuck with different sets just to bring you beef
Fake a pregnancy just to get you fo' a G, crazy
(Butch Cassidy)
How much can one man take?
Worried if I leave it's her life she'll take
So I'm stuck here livin' life in fear
Situation so severe
I need to change my ways
Pay more attention to her ho-pefully
Thinkin' with my dick every night and day
The bitch won't go away
(Strong Arm Steady - 3)
Girl stop screamin
All in front of my house, tellin' everybody you not leavin'
And just beat it - you're insane
Crazy and deranged and I don't need you
Look, don't make me repeat it
I'ma say it one time, kick rocks or I'ma call the one-time
I shoulda hollered at your sister (aiy)
We went to the same high school, and plus she finer than you
Hey - baby this one's on you
You know it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none too
You dug my man out, your hand's out, askin for help
Hey - go 'head trick, kill yourself, {?}
(Suga Free)
That means you ain't doin' it for free
And that's what I'm talkin' 'bout, Suga Free

But lately I've been feelin' like Will Smith
Why bother with rap when I can get 20 mill' on a flick?
Y'all niggaz just started some shit, the underdog
Makin' songs for them hogs, and them Bloods and Crips
For the shah by the mall with a Muslim scent
After all, who do you call to rock your shit? {""break 'em off somethin""}
Bust the ghetto bird, circle above, reminisce
Of the dust kicked up, the dirt swept under the rug
Duct tape, ski-mask, tape recorders
Cue Kaze, razer blades, and bakin soda

Made the block get hot like lava rock
Got love for the block 'cause I came from that

Now how many really gon' ride, when the war start?
Eaten alive by these hollow-tip darts
My 12 gauge'll tear you apart, don't get caught at the light
The house party or the neighborhood park
Mr. X marks the spot then pops the mark
Turn your whole neighborhood to a parkin lot
I paid the cost to be the boss
And will do my time standin up till I get an appeal
These weapons too real to conceal, so why bother
Semper fidelis, I learned from my father
I always stay faithful to myself and grow
But when I catch that ass after the show - {""break 'em off somethin""}

I'm slick and slippery
On a high-speed chase all the way to the victory
Y'all niggaz is stone cold mysteries
Too weak, can't stand in the ring with me
Put a pussy back in his place, straightlaced
With a Strong Arm Steady gang up in your face
I run a race with the West to my back
While you're the reason why they say niggaz in the West can't rap
Ever since the white Concourse 'Llac, I've been unmatched
A avalanche in the hood on attack
Just hardcore actual facts, never wait
Just react when them killers come at you with gats
Had to dig the knife out of my back, now I'm back on track
Hittin laps, 'bout to widen the gap yo

Bein underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin' but hate
Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows
You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home
But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me (yeah)
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up
Marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?
FUCK THAT, this the fuckin' thanks I get
For tryin' to edutain assholes and feed my bitch
Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down (upside down)
Cause you seein more support than I'm seein my child
It's like...

... Everyday I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up the avenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
Whether it's unloaded full or an un-registered one
No bullet, you're so full of shit
This clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude
Over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit
Don't tell me 'bout the show business shit
I know what this is, bitch

Cause you don't know me, and I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

This ain't business, this is personal BITCH
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very FUCKED UP day, I'm needin this fit
Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the 5th
Yo Em it's time to get serious with it (yeah)
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost my niggaz, relax yo'self
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth
To my niggaz who never seen it I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin your channel, you played like a fuckin' piano
Ridin' slow through Cali like I'm ridin' a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin' dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke, that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn till you motherfuckers tell me the right shit
(Eminem)
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
A front door with twelve locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
And one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place
Tryin' to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not
Gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?
And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin' by honkin your horn
Screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin 'n' shit
Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin' them
That if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters, blow it out of proportion
""Oh, now he's pullin guns on his fans
Just for tryin' to stand on his porch""
And I'm the bad guy, 'cause I don't answer my door like ""Hey hi!
You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!""
Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle
And climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you...
... It's just that I'm not behind the mic
I'm a person who's just like you"

27,Don't Let The Money Make You,1998,40 Dayz & 40 Nightz (1998),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"(Feat. Soopafly and King T)
Intro: (An interview with Xzibit)
(I) I want to ask you, what is more important to you guys?
All the money that you guys are talkin' about?
Or the artform? Or, what is more important? The Lyrics?
Or the leather sized stuff?
(X) I think, what we tryin' to do is device a way that the
Artform and the money is like on a equal level.
You know what I mean, that, that like he said, is a fine
Line where gotta pleas the crowd or pleas the artists
That are listenin' to you. And pleas the real hip-hop
Underground people that, that, that is looking for that
You know, that real shit. It's only a certain way that
That you can go up and doin' it
Verse 1: (Xzibit)
Xzibit keep it on deck
Live, vinyl, CD or cassette
Whatever you select
I keep you bouncin' like a bad cheque
See I should have a trigger tattooed on my neck
To represent the heat that I repeat
Now you can take the highs out of the beat
But never take the rucked out of the rhyme
Or tribalize, look into the eyes of the emotional
Your whole style is promotional
A dead giveaway to me is just another business day
Xzibit here to stay
My life, a tribute to the A.K,
You wanna play
A situation only one man can walk away from
The same way he came
When I spit flame, it spits flames like your middlename
So why do I say fuck the fame
Because it come and go
The industry's a pet without refused to be that gigolo
I put the dope in, got fo's and tatoos
Niggas make ya money
But let the money make you
Hook: (King T) x2
We make, make money, money
Take's money to survive
The meanin' of life with statted chips is stay alive
'Cause it's all about the C-notes
Gonna be fuckin' when you're rollin' this too
Don't let the money make you
Verse 2: (Soopafly)
It's Soopafly,
Comin' with that gangsta shit
That shit that only gangstas be gettin' gangsta with
The pimps, hustlers and the players know the rank I get
Never have to get no money from the bank, I get shit
I Stomp down your whole compound
Takin' all the shots
Device from the few I'm rise
Let the others drop
I elevate
Who drop when a dime never got me straight
I'm still goin' for broke
I push you to the stroke
And one man loc and say high
Smokin' to keep an open, mind
Focus on military time provokin'
The G in me, nigga

AZ you are shit
Now gettin' down with the Pound
Now who can shake it till it break ground
Many motherfuckers are greedy
There's only one thing needed like E.D.I, Amin / I mean business
When it comes to the cash, I'm movin' quick

Fuck type shit

So when I die,
Bury me upside-down
So the whole world can kiss my ass
Live fast
Sippin' from my bottomless glass of Hennessy, straight
So I catch you (?)
Xzibit comin' down like a saint
So prepare for the judgement day
Be careful what the fuck you say
Rhyme these parts

The love for the arts and crash
Paragraphs to bust niggas in half
That's what I fuck with
(?) Time to get my duck sit
Miss me if you try to make a buck with
I mean a quick buck, only got bad luck
Black cash every black trash
Never relax, never get attached to anything

I got Nascar novels, I was build to race
Gone the long hot summer, I was gone through space
It's the next best thing, making soda and base
It ain't the drill at a hun', it ain't the people we're chasing
Or these bitches that you came to toot, is basically basic
I'm getting white boy wasted, I'm waking up with a poor start
She walking around naked like she my personal all star
I push one button and boom
Hey, baby, how can I serve you today?
Pussy wet like a typhoon, ass is unreal, it look like a cartoon
Immaculate back stroll, anal and deep throat
Whatever the fuck I want you get to make it happen
Powder her nose and she never take a break in the action
Shit, I'm about to miss my flight
First class to London, fucking with you all night
Act up in this motherfucker, spending all my money on her
Because I don't care blowing kush in the air, dropping car
Feeling like spaceships, riding with models and stripping ace in the club
Show international girls how to do it with dub
While my chain swing left to right
Came with the party with you, do it all night
My money never run out, we party till the sun out
We have Patron shots, so we know we're about to come out
From west to uncut, working at home
From BJ to YJ, now the J grown
One click of the wrist, I compare her to gun flight patrol
On your turn flight to predator draw more
Not to mention Pitbull bully razor heads
Bloodline, Wu-Tang fans, police
Stupid, get it right, off the chain for a fight
Or the flash green lights meeting at your door sight
Let's go to war now, off the world is steady
Wake up to your nightmare, Freddy Krueger's ready
Want your fingers sliced, now you pay the price
Put your light on the line if you feel get that nice
Running bullshit over here, get you shot
Stupid, I retreat that, everything you're not
Exits more the spot, that's everything that's hot
Walk right upon you and run everything you've got

Get the pussy and they're scared to shoot
My niggas get you with the 21 gun salute, I paratroop to your city
Hit the club, recruit, let's see some titties
Boogie words for shitty birds, I learn from the smartest
Treat the bitch like a bitch, treat the queen like a goddess
I coast it, bum bought it, weighting me down
Sleight the razor to your throat, what can you say to me now?
This is dope out above law, thousands of pounds
Keep the crowd in a chokehold, deliver the rounds
I'm going from living with clowns to rocking a crown
It protect my self silence oppressed the sound
You was up a body violence, working jaw to the ground
Making how you got knocked down the talk of the town
Stick around for the fireworks, apocalypse now
Hear it out, make them dollars work, smoking that loud
Act up in this motherfucker, spending all my money on her
Because I don't care blowing kush in the air, dropping car

Refuse to let you waste my ENERGY

I heard they callin me a immigrant; well this motherfuckin immigrant
Came to yo' city and started runnin' shit
X is like the government, taxin that ass
Been harassed to the point that I'm ready to blast
And spend the rest of my life behind metal and glass
Never seen a nigga move so fast, cut you in half
Sick of all these threats, these bitches with no action
Hog-tie, watch you die and start laughin'
And no longer will I sit back and let you disrespect the fact
That we elevated West coast rap
And bring shit back to the point ""X"" is all that they checkin' for
In the clubs, the streets, the shows and the record stores
What more can you ask for, eat your heart out
Fall out with bitch niggaz constantly callin my name out
I'm really not givin' a fuck, you're pressin your luck
I'm a walkin' warhead ready to self-destruct, so WHAT?!

My name feel like a gat in yo' waist

And I'm not stressin
Your words ain't workin I feel so much pressure
Padlock, chain around, neck no lesser
Sick of niggaz runnin' they mouth
It don't take much to get knocked out, round these parts when I start
Shit full clips get emptied, revenge WE
Move like the Secret Service, I ain't nervous
I just wanna tell the truth... the whole truth
When I'm on the stand explainin how I had to shoot
Absolute domination, extreme mutilation
No hesitation, I'm a movin violation
So don't get hit in the street
Used to have friends and family, now I got nothin' but beef
What the fuck?!?!

So-and-so hate me, blah-blah gon' get me
If I gotta go, y'all niggaz comin' wit me
I'ma walk like a soldier, talk like a soldier
Cinderblock stock, shootin straight from the shoulder
Just too much shit in the air
Burn bridges you could never repair
I slap box with a bear
I can speak from experience, you speak from ignorance
I remove you, have your whole family feelin' it
Y'all hate the fact that X-Man got hustle
""Man vs Machine,"" mind vs. muscle
I drop concoctions, you leave me no options
Have your bitch screamin out, ""SOMEBODY STOP HIM!""

1996, dysfunctional member
Of the Alkaholik family, yo
Rule Number One
Always be aware of your surroundings
And peep all exits
Stay and move to the next shit
Rule Number Two
Love no one that don't love you
And if the shit come down
Then you know your way around
Rule Number Three
Realize it ain't about size
Or havin' gats and guns
Because it only takes one
Handle your business
Don't let your business handle you
It's a lot of motherfuckers tryin' to do
What you're doin' right here, right now
Same color, same style
Tryin' to claim worldwide
And ain't traveled but one mile
In these shoes, I paid dues
With nothin' to lose
Live by the rhyme
But I'ma die by the booze
Xzibit breakin' down niggas
Who got somethin' to prove
Here we are face to face
Nigga make your move
You're in the wrong place
But at the right situation
'Cause I was waitin
Hotter than Satan, never perpetratin
I treat my enemies like friends
So I can reach out and touch
Leave'em in the dust at the very end
You now tuned in to Hennessy and Gin
Ice cold Heinekens and down for whatever skins
Animosity you can reach out and touch
Heavy right handed
Teeth grind like a clutch
And plus you ain't never had this much
Too many friends too close
You might collapse from an overdose
I was raised to never follow after no man
To be my own man
So I can die by my own hand
And never knowin' what the next day can bring
So I gotta make the ends
Justify the means
Yo, I'm on the scene, here to do my own thing
Can't never spend a lifetime
Chasin' after dreams
I got the right shit
For all the wrong reasons
As long as I breathin'
Niggas change like seasons
Never trust a man
Who can't look you in your eyes
Only the strong survive
And that's word to the wise
Yo, when dead bodies get outlined in chalk
Everybody should walk
Cause real killers don't talk
I ain't really concerned
How many bridges you burned
I extinguish your flame
And take aim at your brain
Givin' ligament pain
To have you walkin' with a cane
Wantin' money and fame
You got your fuckin' self to blame
And that's West Coast rhyme
Without no gimmicks
Here come Xzibit to break it down
Like a chemic
I'm spreadin' like an epidemic
And all good things come to an end
Enemies and Friends
I don't give a fuck
About the set you claim
Xzibit easily dispersed like crack cocaine
See I lent my shotgun to Kurt Cobain
And the motherfucker never brought it back
Ah, that's wack
As a matter of fact
This one nigga tried to jack
My squad had his ass
On the run like track
Never knowin' who to trust
In this shit called rap
Here to let you know
My sound surrounds like dat
Never half step
Or play the role like DeNiro
Y'all niggas wasn't down
When we had less than zero
Fuck tryin' to be a hero
Tryin' to save some bitch
Mr. X to the Z
Never play that shit
Yes, 1996, yes
Bringin' it live from the Westside
This is X to the Z
These niggas don't know
These niggas ain't ready

Baby, lift your cup up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night
Amsterdam to Tokyo, longitude only I can know
Latitude is my attitude fall in place like a domino
I ain't come here to make no friends
'Cause I rather be feared than love
Scared to death that I move this mountain
Get to you with this shotgun slum
And I could never turn my back on the ways of life
I'm sparing no expense top down Vegas lights
My flows they verge in tide I do not give a fuck
It's about to jump tonight my crib is filling up
Is filling up, is filling up full of bitches I have never met
And they ain't left like these bitches here on house arrest
Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light but that shit
Don't mix, got a body bag full of pills and shit let's see
How fucked up we all gon' get

Raised in the gutter bread getting butter
Face like her mother ass like she's southern
So much cash I just gotta laugh
Out in Paris smoking grass signing autographs
It's apparent if it's foreign and I'm starring
If it's shining then I'm near it, it's designer then I wear it, uh
Look at these diamonds spend some time on my appearance
You too busy saving hoes you ain't gonna find a dime on clearance
You know me bitch I get straight down to the point
Pop another bottle roll another joint
And all of my niggas OG's and all of that smoke is OG
I'm way too high to be low key, better act like you know me

We gon' get fucked up and that's alright, that's alright
Raised in the gutter, I'm a find a way, everything is okay
Baby, lift your cup up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night
Girl, if you wanna get some drunk
Then cutie it, come and get it from me
I know I shouldn't mix all this vodka with this Hennessy
But we gon' get fucked up, then pour it up
Drink beer, party like there's not a night
Put a one night before that bitch
We don't sleep until we get sick
We gon' blaze till we get licked, call Earl
The world spinning, talking jail, we winning
The girl that you love is good in the beginning
Two good shots and not a girl singing
Spinning over now I'm sober face breasts more murr
Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light
But that shit don't mix, got a body bag full of pills
And shit let's see how fucked up we all gon' get
We gon' get fucked up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night
We gon' get fucked up and that's alright, that's alright

I remember underage drinking at sixteen
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything
My back was to the wall, visited all, after all, all I had was me
Just tenacity, so we all leave with a sense of sweet
Then everything I write around got a cotton seat
Fuck y'all dry, saw off and done rapidly
Partner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions
The upper tune is the dudes moving in my position
But I'm a heavy, wait humble, hitting the heavy bag
Waiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass
Instead I push the work in, chin up and chest out
Picking the shit up where I left off
You went soft intention too tenant to deal with the Los Angel
I admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle
Now I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business
Diversify you millions, you can leave off the entrance
Make every revenue street flood to where it took me
And make that money stack higher than giraffes
I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen
I remember underage drinking at sixteen
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything
I used to have a Glock that I would shot to at backpack
So it will leave no shells at the scene where I was getting my kid back
Yeah, this for the homie whack, rolled to and chopped up
On hard to make the west defined a united fund
Beard big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck
So I can crush the corner, welcome to California
Where people fake it till they make it or take it with their hand gun
Take your chances, swing, try to land one
Now you're in the box like a sand some, I march to the madness
My symphony deliver something classic
Either you ain't glad or you blast it, jumped in or dragged it
Either way, you got to salute the flag, who you want it with?
I acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity
People keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony
Stage presence, reminiscent of my flash back
Gave my girl a son and my last name
I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen
And I remember underage drinking at sixteen
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything
They're talking about they locked up in a coop in the mansion
I'm saying you can't knock me off the square that I stand in
Nobody gave me nothing, this is just where I landed
'Cause now I got everything, bitch, I got everything
Motherfucker, I live in room that look like a drive-in
When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins
Nothing but respect when I walk to the lights in
Because I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything
Nothing ever compares with the spring of a free mind
Find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind
Using to fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors
You mould them and lead them, fuck the positive message
This is a lifetime allegiance, boy, you're down to the essence
There's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence
Make every revenue street flood, look where it took me
And make that money stack high and you run a pussy
I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen
I remember underage drinking at sixteen
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything

Only death disease and a whole lota palm trees

I make papers and see more new cars than Bob barker
'Cause if the price ain't right then it's time to take flight
Let the piece go twice to make sure you see the light
Plus I'm dreaded not by the locks but by the cops
And flocks of females that only think with their croth
Unlimitted smoke
The bonified cut throat Columbian neck tie
Now don't you look fly
I'll leave you there to be discovered by your mother
Or maybe your brother or your boty boy lover

Be prepared for static and semi automatics in your grill

The shit is closer than you think
Don't blink it might be over in a matter of seconds
I'd like to say this off the record
But it's not
So I testify to the fact
Chronic mixed with the Yak make a hellified contact
It makes it real easy to trip
Unload the whole clip on your block then split!
Ain't no answers to the test you taken
Never move fakin'
Can't be shaken'
From my solid foundation like this
Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit

All this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed
Smoking this weed, smoking is good but I got what you need
A lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I made
Won't you change, I want you stay the same
But I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G
I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G
It's getting hard to survive the streets that eat you alive
Dumping your body, your cadaver is covered with flies
Too much rats are trapped inside of your rapping
Niggas actually laughing at your lights, camera, action
Do you, do you?
Whatever the fuck you think you gotta do
'Cause when I bring it to the whole court
Putting up a play of stats, while you're hanging with the roaches
And rats, we're way above that
Now how you're loving that?
Beat the breaks off the back of that bitch
I can't breathe, can't make it your bitch
Can't believe how deep in your shit
Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on
Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see
I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G
All this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed
Smoking this weed, smoking is good but I got what you need
A lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I made
Won't you change, I want you stay the same
But I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G
I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G
The greatest trip that devil ever put together
Was that self destruction is better than striving for perfection
I see the down could crawl, quickly spreading like gun infection
And miss it after live, use your common sense as a weapon
If you only knew half of this shit that I've been through
Shoul've been a screen play when I get to
More niggas away, IET, quit playing games in the middle
Of the street, fuck y'all niggas gonna say to me?
We don't play the games, just play for keeps and now
Back for the forth fly, back to the back who was back with a tour bus
Get it round the world for a few months
Down dead, way niggas gotta dumb trunk
Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on
Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see
I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G
All this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed
Smoking this weed, smoking is good but I got what you need
A lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I made
Won't you change, I want you stay the same

Blow it out like a afro pick

You're easy like Sunday mornin and shopliftin
It go simple as that, I'm never givin' half to a rat
I'd rather bam to your face with a bat
You get tied down to the tracks
Used to make a living cookin coke to crack, now I can't turn back
This is holocaust rap nigga, overreact
And I'ma bring to yo' chest like an asthma attack, ya heard?

Yeah, I'm just tryna do this hard work and get things good between us baby, yeah.
Look: Samantha, Loraine, Monica, Veronica-
Veronica, she treated my dick like a harmonica.
How you think I learned how to twist it and turn
Ya back until it's broke, make you feel it in your throat?
It was Pamela, Linda, Keisha, Nicole-
Had me fuckin' while I was drivin' on cruise control
Can't wait to get it home and teach it all to you
Look I'm just tryna be the best, I'm doin' it all for you.
You know that thing with the peanut butter?
My Brooklyn bitch said, ""Fuck untyin' the ropes,
It's faster with a box cutter.""
I know you love the way I'm diggin' you out
But always wanna fuckin' argue so let's figure this out;
I'm just tryna make you happy bitch-
Who's there for you anytime you get in the mood for suckin' a dick?
I took the time out to find out what ya like
You bust fifteen nuts, wanna get up and fight
So look:
You should thank all of the bitches that I have in my life
All the experience I'm gettin' got me fuckin' you right.
Never took time to see it and plus
All you thinkin' about is yourself, I'm thinkin' for us
You love the way I beat it down when I come in the house
And all in ya mouth, the bedroom, kitchen and couch
You should thank all of the bitches that I have in my life
All the experience I'm gettin' got me fuckin' you right.

I think not, hard knock the cock, welcome to my sweat shop
I pick locks made by NFL, NBA, NHL, fuck all day
Who could say I didn't do this shit
Unsatisfied bitches gotta go out and chase the dick
And that's just not the thing to do
So I learn new shit from the next bitch and teach it to you.

I insist that we fuckin' on videotape
Just in case a bitch lose face and try and call rape.

Got an open invite to lay us a pipe
Make ya head feel like your wet, warm and tight
I'll go from all night till the sun turn bright.
Two wrongs don't make it right bitch, no need to cheat.

Why am I the only one that's tryna make this work?

Now-now-now, hold on, hold on, hold on.
X to the Z... I B I T.
Let me just spit game for a minute at this lil' ol' piece of thing, man.
I mean it appears that you have yet to grasp the totality-of the provisions of pleasure-that we provide.
I mean there's an evident mis-overstanding of reciprocation taking place at this juncture.
I mean, we do this for you. I mean- boo to break it all down: we fuckin' more, so we can fuck you better.
I mean, it's a whole rotation thing that's takin' place at this moment.

Got the gangsta for all your chain chains
March to the heart beat of the city
You only hear the drums when they audace and they see me
You know what time it is? Flavor with a thousand checks
It's like the ice ring surrounds my neck
I never worry about the referee
The gate keepers keep him locked for me
Push all to shallow, forever
Always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z
Fold it all for the money, can't team, where my gangstars at?
Hit the park, build at the car scene
Blowing red everywhere, look how strong we are
So there will be no war or shots
I'm about to give my city boiling hot and make 'em pray for real
And make 'em say my name, lit up more smoke
Than a power water drill, concentration, determination
The very thin line between paradise and incarceration
Gangsters, gangsters
Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming
Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I

Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am

Get the irry feeling of peace, then walk into the light
My soul want me take it without a fight
She says she wanna spend the whole life
But she only got me here for one night
Said it's time, better get it in
Call your best friend, I'm a call you wonder-twins
Stop and go like red light traffic
Innovation made it another classic, we made it happen
And big hip hop want us gut cut
Niggas dare too much than offense popped up
Another game fucked up 'cause the lanes clocked up
But the content sucks
I wanna fill up some big red trucks
Tour then through the whole world, motherfuckers lining up
'Cause these tickets won't move like crap
You're tying west coast around my back

Everything fake now, toast to the bad guys
That will leave a whole class swimming with the fishes
Part machine, part skill, part intuition
I cooked my first album in my father's kitchen
He told me how to make a living, twenty grand and half a chicken
Now I'm shitting on myself and still I let him know
That if he turn me in a turn around, it kill us both
This is a cold world, but I'm a polar bear
Destroy the earth like a silver flare, best beware of us
In God we trust, but everybody else gotta pay cash up front
Caught there, they try to tear me down
I'm on a level now, I speak like I mean it
The focus study my literature
Clean house, taking out the trash

And I'ma just continue to flow, while rockin' the boat
Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope

With a custom made Herut charm as my medallion

Seem like, I recite the same prayer every night
Watch my folks, make sure my dogs stay tight
And fully prepared to gunfight in broad daylight

Try not to break the law, sometimes I gotta bend it

The answer to life riddles never come that easy,
But it was easy to lead me, But it wasn't easy to see me,
Get up off the block to the TV,
And sell a couple million CD's, best believe me,
You see these calluses on my soul,
Couldn't let hate and paralysis take control,
I pick you up when you're down till I can't no more,
My name sting in your mouth like canker sores,
Been at war my whole life, sleepless nights, endless fights,
But still can't walk to the light,
'Cause my work ain't finished on earth, for what it's worth,
From the cradle to the Hurst, God and family first, for real

Time for change, time for growth, peace, understandin',
See when niggaz keep forcing my hand, disturbing my plans,
Bringing out the soldier in a peaceful man,
It's like trying to build a house on sand; you'll never get a solid foundation,
One man can change the nation,
Yo I put that on all creation,

This is the message: time is of essence,
Especially when you're counting your blessings,
Lessons learned from the deepest of pain,
It's not a game, keep my name out of your mouth and I'm'ma keep it the same, ya dig,
It's a shame, graduated to the rap game only to find out crack and rap was the same thing, damn

Who got skill, who got hussle,
Who got their family with them, who pay for their muscle,
Yo, it's all gonna come out in the wash, the lost angel,
With dirty wings, bullets ricochet off my halo,
I lay low for no one, I love my life,
Ain't afraid of no hard work and sacrifice,
Was born twice through the life of my seed,
Making sure he see a side of life I was never able to see,
Hitting home like ground zero,
Move over now, peace to the real heroes, still underground,
I put it down for the homies that can't, that's hard in the paint,
I'm living proof it's never too late to be straight,
Once in a while I go back to the main strip,
And see the same niggaz still doing the same shit,
And all I can do is increase the flow,
Put it out, let it soak in and hope they grow, C'mon
Somewhere in the heart of man, (somewhere within, somewhere)
There comes a time when he must understand, (when he must understand)

(Girl): Hi Xzibit!
(Xzibit): What's up?
(Hightower): He he, see what I'm saying.
They were just trying, you know, to tell you hello and shit
But listen why don't you do this
When you're done over there, why don't you come here and shit
You know what I'm saying?
That way they can tell you hello on person
(Xzibit): Ah alrihgt, you want me to bring you somethin'
(Hightower): Hey, bring yourself, I'm sure they can handle the rest
You know what I mean?
(Xzibit): Yeah yeah, all right, I'll be over there in a minute.
(Hightower): Peace!
(Xzibit): All right
(Verse One):
(Xzibit):
It's a lazy Sunday night
Xzibit posted at the lab
Gettin' high as a kite
Proceed to rolll the light
It's real tight
In a paper Philly Blunts I don't need
It might fuck off the taste
Of this bomb ass weed
My nigga Tango and Breeze
Came through we blaze a few
Together bored as fuck
Niggas down for whatever
Break left from the bomb
Phone call from Ron Hightower
Shower at his crib in a hour
All the women involved drop drawers
Don't say nothin'
Just a lota nuttin'
Fuckin' plus dick suckin'
Goddamn who was that?
Half black with the fat ass
Too much to ask if you can put them on the glass
(For me)
My name's Xzibit
I ain't tryin' to spit game
Just tell me your name
And the proportions of your frame
(38-26-32)
That's right
Xzibit now has it poppin' on Sunday night
I don't wanna save 'em
Pay em' or buy clothes
All we really wanna do
Is try to fuck these hoes
(Verse Two):
(Rass Kass):
You knew the game
And you still ended up on your back...
(Xzibit):
Bitches get laid like tracks
Break it down like that
With stacks of profilactics
Got ill tactics just to get you on the matress like yo
(Girl moaning in background)
With minimal conversation
No time wastin'
Only hard penetration
Gettin' shiners on recliners
Cummin' in your faces
Stop! Get on top
I take your mind different places
Won't be satisfied till I hit every race
Color and creed in deed
All I need is weed a fly steez
Who ain't afraid to take the lead
A little dirt on your knees
Looked over saw Breeze
Laid out on the couch about to let it all out
Nigga that's the kinda shit that I'm talkin' about
I don't wanna save em'
Pay em' or buy clothes
All we really wanna do
Is try to fuck these hoes"
47,I Came To Kill,2012,Napalm (2012),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"This is the long drop method it was supposed to be more humane
Measure your height and your weight to break your neck with your hand
Sometimes they use a shore drop or they use a crane
Either way the victim dies in agonizing pain
But if the calculations ain't correct when the rope's set
The rope will rip the head right off the motherfucker's neck
My appointment at the gallows x emerging from the shadows
With a vendetta beetle who wanna battle
Man you gon' get whipped in flaw shackle to an A-frame
Beaten full force until you can't repeat your own name
Till you smell the smell of burn and flesh
Keep you alive until you pray for death
Drawn in the corner disembowel until there's nothing left
Saudi Arabia amputation for petty death
Li chin translated this the leader in death
A rubber tie filled with gas around your arms and chest
Set you on fire turn your body to a melted mess
Ask the AT about the south African necklace
Go ahead and pick your poison it was coming to you
Call me the prison bull I came to fucking kill you
Have must I come through merciless
Be quick with that bullshit you heard of
Uncut mole what have we ride through
And always remember that death will come off swift wings
Anyone who run contested now know have we now picked you whatever
I came to peel
Hands behind your back shackled then I forced you to kneel
Shoot you in the back of the head send your family the bill
For what the bullets cost I'm on my China shit
Eye for an eye waterboard you like my government
Impaled and left at the front gates
Used to hear the sound of broken arms rib and leg makes
Whipping and pull apart call it the breaking wheel
By inquisition espanish mi corazon is free
No compassion don't expect it when I fucking see you
Lethal injections is my profession loading up my needles
My iron maiden the Caucasian the Asian
The information received by the ancient art of persuasion
I'm 'bout to drop like a guillotine
The cut is quick and clean I promise you won't feel a thing
I'll never kiss the ring
I rather storm the castle kill the king then set fire to fucking everything"
48,Inside Job,1998,40 Dayz & 40 Nightz (1998),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"(Intro: Xzibit)
Mr. X to the Z (who am I?)

So it's one fifteen in the mornin I'm comin' up, a hard day, serve
We gettin' drunk smokin' herb and the third dike you roll
Non-stop cash flow, 20,000 dollars and the rest cuttin' yayo
We had the rocks, my nigga late to pick it up
Get him on the phone, hurry up 'cause I ain't tryin' to get stuck
So what the fuck is the hold up?
(""Nigga sit your ass in the chair and I'll be right there"")
Reminds me I gotta shake the spot
I got bitches in the hotel room ready for me to bang cob weight (*knock*)
Yo, who is that man?
(""He wanna spend a couple of hundred, (yeah), but he'll be right back"")
That's when I shoulda got the heater
But I was too busy in the kitchen countin' money and takin' shots at Tequila
Started countin' out twelve when it hit me
If you was Rocksteady, you woulda came when the C-Note's rang
Before I could yell out to lock the front
Niggas rushed in the front door with the gauge, ready, duck
Bad enough I'm caught up in it, jacked, but worst than that
I'm caught in the kitchen without the strap
(""Where the muh-fuckin' sack homeboy?"")
Yeah, woulda killed Terminators only D between us is
A stove and a refrigerator, came in and put the gauge to my chest
Took the money off the table and said (""Yo, where's the rest of it nigga?"")
You gotta love it, came straight to the moneyman
20,000 cash, needed stacks, wrapped in rubber bands
Snatched the whole shit and broke out
I ran to the living room and got the heat from under the couch
Smashed out into the middle of the street started blastin
Dumpin at the getaway cars but they was mashin
I thought I heard the homies just in time for the action
Police hit the corner with they reds and white's flashin
These niggas rolled off with at least a cool fifty
Ya, I'm in handcuffs on the ground and mad cause the K-9 bit me
Shipped me off downtown for the bookin
Threw my herb sack when the cops wasn't lookin'
Fingerprints, hold the tape, hear come detectors
One at the door, another one askin questions
Stupid shit like: - ""Who was I shootin at?""
Was it game related and where do they kick it at?
But I didn't say shit I can tell from all the people
Involved it was an inside job
But I'm the wrong nigga to rob, I'll hunt you down
Fuck the money, I'll take you off and accept the loss
Set bail at fifteen g's, no sweat
Got cars slippin tonight, and almost got wet
Homies come to set bail see, but that's all right
Since I'm already here I'ma spend the night
(Outro: Xzibit and another having a conversation)
(""Hey, hey I need to use the phone again"") (*Car horns*)
(""Ay, ay man"") (""Since when did you start takin' shoestrings and shit?"") (""Man"")
(""Ah"") (""Do I look like I wanna kill?"") (""Ay man, fuck that"")
(""Ay, look?) (""I just need to use the phone real quick man, eh, fuck it"")
(""Aight, ay, let me get the top bunk"")
(""Ay man, this, this, this blanket, this blanket smell like urine man"")
All right, you're charged with Public Intoxication
(All right, listen there's a thousand people down there who are drunk)
Okay, I understand that"
49,Invade My Space,2006,Full Circle (2006),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"(Intro: Jelly Roll)
This, cannot continue
We must go, our sep-arate ways
Without youuuuu, I can do betterrrrr
But first these words, I have, to, say
It's nooooot, that I don't hear youuuuu
When you scream, and curse, my, naaaaame
It's juuuuust that I, don't feeeeeeel you
Nigga you, invade, my spaaaaaaace
(Xzibit)
Yeah!
Blacked out, tatted up, let's go, saddle up
I'm alge-ballin, dumb niggaz cain't add it up
Cock back, back 'em up, fuck what you throwin' up (yeah)
All these rappers comin' out, ain't nobody showin up
Man, where your talent at? Show me where your balance at
You the king of the streets? Well I ain't heard none of that
Just like the South say, watch what your mouth say
Frank Sinatra hustle, Rat Pack, (Did it My Way)
I know we don't see eye to eye, you ain't never lied
We should part ways 'fore somebody catch a homicide
Recognize, lost of a lot of love when my momma died
Did a gang of shhhhit, I'm surprised that I'm still alive
Fishburn yellin' wake up, open up my eyes
Don't believe them lies from them guys that you idolize
Ridicule, try to downplay, try to minimize
And criticize when you on your grind so I realized
(Chorus: Jelly Roll)
This cannot continue, we must go our separate ways
Without you I'll do better, but first these words I have to say
It's not that I don't hear you, when you scream and curse my naaaaame
It's just that I don't feel you, nigga you invadin my spaaaaace
(Xzibit)
Go ahead spit it out, that's right, get it out
So I can respond, nigga F**K what you talk about
Drop like a guillotine, money over everything
Seems to be the theme in the land of the Philistine
Mentally you still shackled up on some lame shit
Side by side on the bottom of a slave ship
Came a long way from the place that I started from
Ever seen a man's last breath beaten out of him?
Hate manifest from the inside out
The shit starts in your heart then spill out your mouth
I'm the odd man out, watch it all pan out
I see you tryin' to stand up but you don't stand out (ha ha ha!)
Now that I found that my path is original
Prepared, never scared, had to peak at my pinnacle (yeah)
I'm not like you, but you think we identical
It's pitiful, you can never bang with the criminal
(Xzibit)
Three wheels lock it up, ammo stock it up
It's not for niggaz cause George Bush comin' after us
That's why it's time to roll, get where I gotta go
All my people fightin for they soul, you are not alone
Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant
Forever on my grind, you despise and belittle it
Here's a little tidbit, X rock that real shit
Dump like a L.A.P.D. cop, over kill shit
Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize
Put you on track where you just, you was out of line
And I ain't got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit
You know that young shit, the ""Hey nigga where you from"" shit
Even though the pistol in my hand, I'm a businessman
People grow apart, don't expect you to understand
Let's part ways and, then pray for better days
I realize somebody 'bout to die, so I came to SAY
(Xzibit + (Jelly Roll))
Yeah, knowhatI'msayin? (you invadin my spaaaaace)
Yeah, stop askin where the fuck I'm at
Yeah (nigga you invadin my spaaaaace)
Tryin' to see where I'm at, tryin' to be where I'm at all the fuckin' time
C'mon (you invadin my spaaaaace)
Get a life nigga, heheheh
I got mines, know'mtalkinbout? (nigga you invadin my spaaaaace)
C'MON!"

Yes, uh, breathe with me
C'mon... listen, yo
I know you're fed up, feel like you can't get up
Have faith, stay strong, keep your head up
Yo, it only gets worse; we in a world
Where your status and your bank account determine your worth
There's no time to rehearse, the clock been tickin
'Cause we all started dyin' at birth, I speak the truth and it hurts
It felt like I was dyin' of thirst
Till I was blessed with my voice, I move mountains with verse
The worst thing you ever seen in your life, ""The Passion of Christ""
Pregnant chicks buyin rock, hittin the pipe
It ain't like I ain't tried to tell ya; misery love company
Keepin' the wrong company brings failure
Cause people use people like paraphernalia
With a scam, with a scheme, with a dream to sell ya
But I ain't got nothin' but love for all my soldiers and thugs
To all of my women, we gotta keep livin', c'mon

Yeah! C'mon
Mr. X to the Z had to raise the stakes
Had to touch my people like T.D. Jakes
On the ground like a nigga flippin crumbs to cake
I won't stop like an eighteen wheeler with no brakes
Bein dipped in her-on so each CD's weight
Niggaz be fake, they speak what they can't create (create)
You won't, see me break, I'm built for a tough frame
One-eighty-five and I'm still on huff
I was only 15, tryin' to pass that rock
Never got caught, just sat down, collected my thoughts
This is bullshit, I ain't got a plane or a boat
I'm just another nigga sellin some coke, y'know?
Had to grab life right by the throat, murder I wrote
My callin for ballin wasn't pedalin dope
It was oversea convoys, bangin' out cuts
No police or government agency lockin me up, so what?
(Chorus: singers)
You can turn your back and then walk away
(You can turn your back and then walk away)
Soon be comin' the judgement day
(SOOOOON there'll be a-comin' a judgement day)
(Xzibit)
C'mon...
What do you believe in? I believe in karma
And that fo'-five to drop that drama
Can't wait for the time when I meet my maker
Picture everlasting life in Jamaica, time to wake up
Watch your thoughts, your thoughts become words
Your words become actions when the bullshit happens
Keep laughin', that's when the gauge start clackin
Feel the buckshots smackin have your body mismatchin
Yo, I feel the devil tryin' to force my hand
Steady bringin' out the soldier in a peaceful man
See I was born to be all that I can, without a Uncle named Sam
As you can see we just a part of his plan
Cause first there was a war on blacks
And then there was a war on crack, now it's war in Iraq, c'mon
I never give up, I only give back
I ain't preachin I'm just statin the facts
So let the choir SING!

And I laugh inside
Niggas always perpetratin
Like they down to ride
But please don't try to tell me
What I can not see
What's the real definition
Of A Fake MC
(J-Ro)
Muthafuckas only rappin' since 93
And expect all props
(Xzibit)
Them gettin' dropped like hot rocks
""So stop what you doin' 'cause I'm
About to ruin""...
Like Shock-G get turned to stone
Tryin' to rock me
I separate my thought process
From stress, 24 tracks inside my brain
Tyrin to maintain
I bang shit without no gang or jherri curls
I seem like Kadeem
In a whole different world
It's the girls the cars niggas lose themselves
Forgettin who they are
When they try to be that superstar
They don't understand
It's all in the game plan
Exploit the art
And watch Hip-Hop fall apart
But I'm a do my part, and stay true
And keep breakin down bitch niggas like you
(Hurrincane Gee)
I'm not the type
To play games or drop
Name I just maintain
And burn rappers out the frame
Doin' my part to stay true
And keep breakin down
Bitch niggas like you
(Xzibit)
But above all else
I represent it for myself
Leavin' muthafuckas stretched out
Or better yet X-ed out
Xzibit, Excelerate, I rush it to the extreme
Like nicotine, never get me clean
From your blood stream
We all can't bust, so do it how you must
But if you hustle, avoid gettin' rushed
With hand cuffs plus
In got we trust but don't trust us, we just
Add to the ashes, then pick up the dust
Like that
(J-Ro)
I make it seem
Like you havin' bad dreams
Have you wakin' up out your sleep
By your own screams
Xzibit has arrived Goddamit
(Xzibit)
We bout to rock the whole planet
And bitch niggas can't stand it
Try to play the back and look intense
You need to hit a fence
You don't want none of this
Hands on experience
I'm no the type to play games
Or drop names I just
Maintain and drop rappers out the frame
(Hurricane Gee)
I bring it to the ruffest toughest
Mic killers
And you wanna be niggas
And you burn bithces, type vicious
Imitating Hurricane flow for riches
You don't know the half
I got the ill vocab double rap style
Gettin' bucked
More freaky than your last good fuck
Milkin you like ba ba pieces
Meetin niggas lyrical wishes
Writin rhymes and washin out dishes
Flowin with the likwid wicked
Representin with my nigga Xzibit
And we gonna do it
And do it and do it
Till you satisfied! cause shit is tight
Bodiqua C.E.O. on the mic
Smashin and trashin
Fuck Moschino fashion
All you muthafuckas need to stop askin
Valued more than the chrome
On your last set of wheels
Hurricane here to reign on your brain

You are now tuned in to the ultimate sounds... of Dr. Dre
You know what time it is!
Xzibit steps up to the mic
Layin down the hard-core, real raw, underground
My name is KRS-One, and it's REAL!
(Xzibit)
Well it's me, down with D-R-E
X to the Z rocks any party
Rocks the beats, and the breaks
Rocks the cocks off the whores in the place
Cause suckers shake, while I'm creatin'
They get together and they start to hatin'
How can we take him out one time
'Cause he brought back the West with the freshest rhymes
I might go first, and he'll go second
I'll wreck 'em, deck 'em, set it, just checkin' your mic
Droppin' hot shit I like
So throw up your hands bitch, run your ice
'Cause I'll go third, and he'll go fourth
By the fifth eat shit, you'll step off
Six is your beatdown, your title is seven
Takin' out your four man crew makes eleven
By the twelveth I go for self
Rockin' L.A. like no one else...
You can check any rapper from the underground scene
But few have dropped hot shit and seen green
Some have dope twelve inches, count 'em
But not many niggaz have slammin' albums
X to the Z rocks consistently
I'm ""Criminal Minded"" so don't fuck with me
Why? Well that's my secret baby
I don't take shit, so fuck you, pay me
So you can call me, a public servant
Not a king but a teacher I believe I've earned it
So I just walk, or ride my bike
And bust on the +Up In Smoke+ stage tonight
Give me a chance and I'll rock the house
But let a motherfucker try to take me out
Cause male or female, I will strangle
If it's a label, they have to untangle
Adidas, chains, jerseys, braids
Bandanas hangin' off the end of my gauge
Step right up if that's what you like
But watch your bitch, I catch hoes like a dyke
In the night at a height right for flight
Way out of sight, you bite, I recite
My chain shine bright, plus my kicks stay white
As your faggot CEO say, ""Well all right!""
... I am your mentor
History is mine, it's time you surrender motherfuckers
And just back up quickly
Your style is sickly but you persist to get me
Or outwit me with the style that I created
Years ago when I was sellin powder to the hoes
Oh, all of a sudden you don't know
Or can't remember can't recall can't bring to mind
That rhyme that place do not chase
I run a marathon a race of rhymes in your FACE
In case you hate I won't write no tough rap
Fuck with me get your whole FAMILY kidnapped
(KRS-One)
Yo Xzibit! Show these motherfuckers man!
I don't think they understand this shit!
Break this shit over they backs!
(Xzibit)
I don't dress up to rap or keep a hairdo
I only grab a nine to bust holes in your crew
I deny your existence as artists
You puttin' out a record expectin to chart but it's weak
But when you speak through the microphone
You fail to realize, nope, you're not alone on the earth
The light comes forth cause Mr. X
Intelligence, smoke and guns manifest in the flesh
I snatch the mic and get hype
Behave, before you make the news front page
Headed for the grave and the wake
So save your microscopic miniature small talk and WALK
And put a little pep in your step
X to the Z will destroy any motherfuckin rep-utation
In the nation, in creation
All you assholes in ANY occupation
Like rappers with nothin' to say
I CRUSH 'EM like chronic and then smoke 'em with Dre
Cause no matter how fatter the wallet, I'd rather
Gather together and splatter
Whatever egotistic bullshit, the game is over
When you push the record but don't push the culture

Breakin, emceein, graffiti art, deejayin, beatboxin
Yo Xzibit, keep rockin'!

Nobody to threaten that they about come get me
I wish I could go back to where we began
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again
I wish we had more paths to cross
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss
My killer's remorse
For me we are the same should be laughed at
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that
You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately
I'm so christian I'm so muslim
Super size on your mom trigger get push up
I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking
And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is coked
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off
I said memories fade just as blood washes off
Hope to see you soon
I feel so guilty my hands are filthy
From decorating your face all over the building
I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear
I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam
I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie
We smoked you like the weed in the bong
Have you ever seen the bloodstain
And know that person has returned from every once came
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing
What's done is done chop that shit up to the game
You're still dead when I'm still alive
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi
Started the bullshit escalated to violence
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence
Now I feel empty not even existing
My worst enemy is no longer against me
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me
And you felt the same thing but never could move me
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards
The dirt on your casket
I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out
And I just sold out and wait for the contact
And life for the combat and now we be on that
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now

And I'ma lay your ass down like the All Star Game, c'mon!
Sawed-off shotgun, shoot through your shoulderblade
Bitch-made niggaz get hit with a hand grenade
Blow up your Escalade, then I hit the road
And I'm back in the hood lookin' for somethin' to smoke
Everytime, I use the element of surprise
With a gun that's big enough to make an elephant hide
I elevate my rhythm by hustlin' crack addicts
Get locked but when I'm released I'm back at it
See Mitch know the time, in front of me the birdie and
Phil got the costumers comin' to get it early we
Came a long way from po-lice chasin' us

Got a sick flow - didn't know? Let me demonstrate
Renovate the game, new nigga that you love to hate
The left hand lands and the right hand devastates
Half part of your face replaced with a metal plate
Irate, get snatched to a better place
Let the detached decorate with the yellow tape
Detonate, drop bombs, make the earth shake
In Brazil with a half mill' in the briefcase
Look ma top of the world, the best of the best

Givin' respect to the dead, and avoid havin' the same thing

Of Hennesey straight, relate feel my hate
Xzibit flippin through these bitches like DJ trait
Translate to left field, only real niggaz follow
Bitches suck and swallow, I'm livin' life behind the bottle

'Cause I got a kill switch with a itch for the action
While other rappers use mass weapons of destruction
To sell they shit
Verse Three: Xzibit
El ve-te-rano, you can only pray to learn what I know
Ride slow across the horizon a lone desperado

Niggaz pull rent from the crack of they ass
Maintain do your thang this too shall pass
I season beef with lead pieces then cook it with gas
I'm from the school of hard knocks way ahead in the class
Xzibit hard to get through, like bulletproof glass
Break it down like Johnny Cochran then mix it with hash
Your defense can't last against advanced prosecution
Hit the airwaves like pollution -- hey, here's a solution

Grand arsony 'cause I'm still in the show
What's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life
Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya
All I know if you spend too much time without being refined
Then your life will be described as a failure
Let me tell you about this bitch ass half cock pussy ass niggas
It's never gonna pull the trigger to protect no figures
Never seen a hard time in your life beating the shit out of your kids and your wife
Because what you lack in a fight
That we all fight similar self aided mutilation
Never lost angel Los Angeles congratulations
From admiration to aggravation to the highest level
Don't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle
Heart cold and in gut metal I didn't survive at all
Praying for my downfall got the fuck from around y'all
Know when niggas bringing me down even include myself
I celebrate life for nobody else
Mountains of wealth ain't really shit without health
Memento tried in stealth
Explain Cause hell is crowded with cowards who fail for the dollar
Now watch Xzibit rise to power
I turn these fifteen minutes to hours
But still ask
Let me tell why you these hypocrites and half wits
Caught up into politics
Worked yourself to death but uncle Sammy is taking all of it
Prisoner to the policy the mark of the beast
Becoming one with technology surveillance's a bitch
And everyone one of us some of us got no heart or no back bone
The few will see freedom while most of the masses will conform
The woman you lust for is usually not the one to stick around when you go to war
Immaculate platform
We back and prepared for 'em attacking the land lords
'Cause the shit too high we 'bout to get what we came for
And if I should die may it not be in vain more
Importantly more to see keep it cracking orderly
Got my future in front of me focus is fucking phenomenal
Nobody can touch us I turn the impossible possible with it
Do me a favor man do not try to tell me shit
It's just me and my bitch
When I was injured I sustained 35% burns over my body
I lost my ears my nose and have been through many reconstructive surgeries
My father was there, my wife was there, my children
That was alot of my motivation because I knew the way that they were looking at me
I had to get stronger I had to become independent again
And I think that's why I pushed so hard
Let me tell you about these long days of sleepless nights
Penny pension trying to make it to the afterlife
And not to mention time is short you better make it right
Before you see that final light get all your business tight
This is the gospel gotta get it or get left alone
So get it on into your destiny and set the stone
The dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death
So make it count and live out loud make it no regrets
This for the set this for the ones that never waken up
Living a fantasy insanity is fake as fuck
They out of touch they out of line it's time to face the truth
That I wasn't supposed to make it now I'm living proof
Excavated mountains misery eventually found the fountain of youth
It's been pissed in, shit in violated till they pollute
That's why they shoot have your ass in a box dressed in a suit
'Bout time you got in touch with your roots
The best help that you can do is help yourself
You gotta step up you gotta find the strength inside of you
To pull yourself through it because you know you can
You can have people pull you everyday
But unless you're willing to move and you're willing to move forward
Then you're gonna be stuck in the road
Yeah you're gonna be stuck in that bad place it's depressing
And holding you back
The only person that can set you free is yourself"

I can't stress enough no matter what - mama I love you
You've always been there by my side
You've taught the wrong from the right - mama I love you
Yesterday was you fifty-ninth birthday
Time flew missing you in the worst way
I still feel the same pain since the first day
You left through death on God's request
I can't complain through the year's mama I've been stressed
Through them bullets and the bad times I've been blessed
For the times that I fail but I tried my best
Able to do for my loved one's, real success
Your the source of my strength I was blessed with your gifts
Your insights, your wisdom, your penmanship
Fun 'n' games, I'm doing thangs, I know you wouldn't agree with
What I drink, what I smoke, who I be with
You made sure I got some love when there wasn't none
Opened up my heart showed the world where I'm coming from
Your little grandson is just like your little boy
Mama what you built here no man can ever destroy, your bundle of joy
I've been through so much
I lose touch and sometimes I feel that life sucks
My women try to get close I push here away
She wanna talk I just sit there with nothing to say
Feel me it's all the pain I contain on the inside
You in the right place but left me at the wrong time
Use to cook, clean, and sing me to sleep
Now I only go to bed with my heat, damn I miss you
The school of hard knocks where I learned life's lessons
With not enough answers and too many questions
When you had me you gave birth to a soldier
Now I'm much older now the world much colder
Our lives in the hands of politicians that don't care
We ponds in the game biological warfare
The family's so spread out 'n' disconnected
Trying to hold things together put my soul on records
It's hard; you know your daughter had a baby too
A beautiful baby girl just another little piece of you
Another branch we can add to the family tree
Responsibility bringing out the man in me
You ain't a man if your not taking care of home
Raise and protect my own, until they full-grown
No matter how much these streets try to change me
I'm never 'gon forget how you raised me
I Love You, Forever.
(Ad Libs)
Yeah, all the mothers, all the daughters, yeah, come on
Sun, Moon, Earth, yeah, this for you, uh, Damn, Damn I Miss You"

To a Muslim, turn a Buddhist to a Christian
Tell 'em catholic Ronnie been it
Sipping red wine inside the pentagon
Writing sinister lines till all the ink inside my pen is gone
Jeremy Lin got the world watching ESPN
My sick porno obsession got me watching these lesbians
Explain I'm a sick fucking psychotic master
The mic is my sword the booth is your casket
I'm sitting inside the classic 6 4 with the ratchet
Throwing up west side is my worst fucking habit
Only snap backs and egos eyes looking through peep holes
Is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow
Living my destiny poppin' pills high as fuck
Fucking bitches in the club holding my space bottle up
I think it's time you salute me or shoot me
Either way I'm the star of this motherfucking booth
They say I got a suicidal tendency murdering my enemies verse
It ain't no questioning thunder under my shirt
Fuck around and you'll be up under the dirt
This automatic will turn your home into a hearse
Worse case scenario pipe bound your burial
They gonna have to bury your twice
The scary cat on this night life
The golf stream vibing what the weed is top flight
My PO already know I'm a motherfucking flight risk
Heavy chain light risk pay cash for everything that white bitch
She got it, she got it, that's my words the oriental
Sixty two minutes they got it looking like murder all
I'm leaning hard in that flat back turbo charge
Coupe on twenty fours pedal to the floor
Hundred shots of that nigga still got plenty more
Slim the mobster am I is really made Uzi
We turn your block to a motherfucking movie
Lights, cameras, action niggas ready to shoot you
But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you
Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me
Will turn your block into a motherfucking movie
Rap boy we were kids we were the Lord of the Rings
Rep in the full train smoke in solely green
I know other case burst scenes there's no more men of honor
I might made my super armor running from karma
The good die young no country for old men
There will be blood deeper than leviathan
And my platoon full of bad lieutenants
X-men, expendables, bad company, criminals
Crush goons with a kanga, surfing in the rainbow
48 hours to kill Bill, Cash and Tango
Brave heart, battleship, devil's out to kill with the
Passion of Christ, it's a wonderful life
Miami Vice what to get right
It's midnight in the garden the good and evil are crashing
Ordinary people, lethal weapon without 4 sequels
Above the hunger games
The gods must be crazy ricochet through the purple ring
Because the devil wears prada
The dead presidents can turn a goodfella to a godfather
Animal house, standing to live with the case speech
Leonardo DiCaprio on the beach
Oceans Eleven, if all dogs go to heaven
The silence of the lambs, son of sam 7, I am legend
Fuck this new jack city I'm on the midnight express
With this American History X
Off the dome and I'm talking slick as petroleum
Because I don't fuck with pens unless I'm rolling on some eulogium
Niggas preaching hate from Napoleon nigga slowly throwing salt on my game
Like fluorine or sodium on a door
But holy I'm only in it for the cash part
Thinking fuck the world something like a pornstar with a passport
With officer walking and my side mirror in
He don't like me 'cause I'm dark as an nigerian
Rocking alot of juries smart as a librarian
In the look in the American eyes said I'd bury him
I said it before don't ignore it again too
Hands on the 9 like you couldn't attend due
Life's a hooker the hall raised me
This poor baby was born crazy
Put in the middle of drug wars
Thug lord and judges tryin' to call case me
Lord save me it's gone Swayze the movie
Lights, cameras, action niggas ready to shoot you
But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you
Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me
Will turn your block into a motherfucking movie

Do I take that as normal and watch her play with her tits?
I'm confused, I feel so used - and I got the dick
Now what am I doin' here?
She tell me she wants to keep the condom as a souvenir
And that's kinda weird to me
I guess this ol' fuck session ain't what it appear to be
Because the concierge has just brought the bill to me
I go 200 miles per hour on a street bike
And 9-0 beats per minute on a sweet mic
Whenever I get with bitches I lose a little somethin'
Sperm by the zones, we keep it hot and goin'
Xzibit we got it flowin', don't even approach us, you only get roaches
How you gon' smoke with us nigga when you can't even focus

And we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all

I come inside just in time to see our baby walking
And bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often
I'll be working a 9 to 5 till I'm old and grey
Then just wither away the dust, watch it float away
And it'll be complete my life because I lived it right
Never lifted my voice in anger just to pacify
I guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall
How can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled?
Matter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall
Instead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all
Average for an arsonist, tagging up the apocalypse

Remember me man? You thought I was a fan till I threw you in the back of a
Van
Yo these Drop Squad delegates rhymes are delicate
I spit on the mic to get these MC's pussys wet
For those with plans to clone me thee original
It can't be done I'm digital (digital)
Xzibit:
Yo who wanna come see the hard rock?
The non stop green block yo whole block receive speed knot
You need not
Get brave my bullets never graze
They hit close to home separating flesh from bone
So better get off on your own bitch
Rollin' chrome shit tryin't to own shit
I was molded, after the best that the streets had to offer
The author of my own destiny
So I suggest you stop stressin' me
I'll find out when I pull my nine out and blow your mind out
Play a deadly game with no fouls and no time outs
Inhale large amounts of dojah forever ready like a soldier
I'm lock mode and shoot from the shoulder
And burn down your lavish landscape digital tape
Cause everything you rhyme about is actually fake
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit
""I don't want niggas soundin' like me. On no album"""

Yeah, help for the helpless!
Big money, big cars... big weed! (T-Pain adlibs)
Y'all know what time it is! But you better stack that money!
(Awww shit! Ha ha ha ha...)
For baaaiiilll...
(Chorus 2X: T-Pain)
I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell
Yeah!
(Daz Dillinger)
I'm on a two million dollar bail
Caught with the product that them young niggaz sell
I'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later... my clientele hit my pager
The situation gettin' thick, Dat Nigga Daz is major!
I live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters
Ten years up on the table, I deny that flavor
She a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet)
Can't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin
Now I'm back up on the street, completely correctly
You disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be
Automatics get tragic when you let niggaz have it
Then I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage
Monday morning, 8:30 right back in court
Couple of homeboys, my momma give me full support
Raised up filthy but the Lord be with me
Like an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, ""NOT GUILTY!""
(Xzibit)
They used to have me on that paperwork
'Cause I used make my paper... work, lifestyle covered with dirt
See I was first on my block with .40 caliber glocks
Similarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock)
'Cause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught
Only the pros and the cons get to stack these knots
Motherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats
When they fencing all day, they start talkin' like a parrot
Information they sharing so be cautious where ya walk
Never pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark
It might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you
To a five by nine for a very long time
Fuck droppin' dimes, niggaz is droppin' whole hundreds
So the hood's gettin' skinny and the one-times love it
If I don't go get it, then the next nigga will
So I kill at will with my gauge in them killin' fields
Yeah!
(The Game)
Yo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much
Tell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck
It's just like a house 'cause I take a bath in it
Get ass in it and I gotta stash in it
Smoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah
Smokin' chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive
Bandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive
Walkin' out the courthouse spittin' on the camera guy
I bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row
This some gangster shit for my niggaz down on death row
Exhibit A - watch how I let the tec go
And Exhibit B - burn the rubber on the West coast

1996, Disfunctional member of the Alkohaliks family
It's XZIBIT, Bring it live, one time, like this
Sometimes I wonder if it's all worth my while
Xzibit stay versitile
With Million Dollar lifestyle
And I could feel it as a child growin' up
The niggaz that was real and the niggaz that was scared as fuck
That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you
So ease off the trigga talk, you ain't killin' shit
It's not affecting me or the niggaz that I'm chillin' with
I don't believe the hype or buy a Woof tickets
Nigga you make a gang of noise and never sing like a cricket
I guess that's why we never kick it
A lot of niggaz are soft and get tossed tryin' to fuck with the liquid
How many niggaz do you know like this?
Always claimin that they're riding but they really turn bitch
It don't make sense
Either you're a soldier from the start
Or an actor with a record deal tryin' to play the part
Like that
It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Extra large
It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Paparazzi (2x)
I don't need no lights no cameras
Just action god dammit
Never no superstar, I'm more like a planet
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat
Emergin from the fog with my fucked up dialogue
Try to live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt
And niggaz you spent it on, would not give a fuck
Now that's deep, how deep, It's deeper than Atlantis
Home of the scandalous
Big Bad Los Angeles
Dangerous, Vandelous
Yo, not to be trusted
So how the fuck is you hard
Not being scared by the boulevard
I'm pulling that card and sayin' Gin motherfucker
Flowin like liquid, soak it in motherfucker
I'm breakin it down, my sound surrounds like death
From the West
Puttin' whole counties to the test
It's all in perspective
Break a one-nine copy
This is for the niggaz gettin' caught up in the Paparazzi
It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Extra large
It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Paparazzi (2x)
Niggaz smoke stress and cross dress
But I just played it back
Others going through schemes and pipe dreams
For a contract
Real tightly rolled, fuck 'em all how I feel
I made a cool half mil
Before I had a record deal
Therefore you look and stare like it's magic
But too much of anything can make you a addict
When devils be startin static, bring out the automatic
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate, but wait
Who dare to cross this path
Yo, I'll do ya like math
Cut with glass, make a blood bath
So on behalf of all niggaz I get drunk with
Smoke them blunts with
I dispose of your punk shit
Keep it all in perspective
Carbon Copies gettin' caught up in the Paparazzi
Once again, It's the liquidation crew, and we return for you
Like this
It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Extra large

Only for the money and the fame

Take a break, make a drink, roll the 'wood, let the games continue
Uh, (you make me so hot) - you better than the rest of them bitches
I'll bang your back out in every position
I never listen to the shit niggaz say
How you're easy to spread, like to pop pills and fuck all day
But baby that's all right with me
If you thinkin' long-term, bitch that's what it ain't gon' be

Whenever I hit her hard in the middle she piss
Do I take that as normal and watch her play with her tits?
I'm confused, I feel so used - and I got the dick
Now what am I doin' here?
She tell me she wants to keep the condom as a souvenir
And that's kinda weird to me
I guess this ol' fuck session ain't what it appear to be
Because the concierge has just brought the bill to me
I go 200 miles per hour on a street bike
And 9-0 beats per minute on a sweet mic
Whenever I get with bitches I lose a little somethin'
Sperm by the zones, we keep it hot and goin'
Xzibit we got it flowin', don't even approach us, you only get roaches
How you gon' smoke with us nigga when you can't even focus
'Cause we don't break bread with bitches, we take head from bitches
Cause niggaz be gettin' dead from bitches for bein'

The nigga that's been down
With the set since birth
Whatever it was worth
I checked in on the norm
Since a juvenile callin'
Shots in the dorm
Moms said you better get right
Or shake the spot
I chose to break and be a rollin' stone
Like pop
Stashin' the rocks by the gats
With the Gs
So I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze!
I don't fight the feelin'
Gotta hustle with a passion
Comin' cross state to put you down
With some action
In actuallity I keeps it real in the streets
Remininsin' younger days
Over gangsa ass beats
And I,
Hit the weed
Till myeye balls bleed
While my life is corrupted
By lust and greed
Serve you anything from cocaine
Up to speed
I came with the drank
So here's five on the weed

See kids don't belong
Up in grown folks business
The Likwit niggas rollin' through with a thickness
Sickness bear witness
Like tequlla without a chaser

From the west coast underground
The mighty King Tee
And Mr. X to the Z, see
Never underestimate the power
Of the X man
Dismantle your plans
Or just catch you with a back hand
Xzbit bring it to you live

Cool in a gang
And ain't about to change

Catchin' bodies in this uphill battle
But Xzibit unravel
Have smoke will travel

Run your money and the jewels
To the front without a sound

Derranged in the mothafuckin' brain
Through ya speaka and hey
I walk around the hood lookin' looped
Strapped like a mothafuckin'
Desert strom troop
Niggas be like ""King Tila
How you get that Benz?""
By sending birds to Oklahoma City
To my friends
I slang my gangsta funk
Through the night
Sometimes I fight
Like I'm the ghost of Eric Wright
Compton is where I dwell
It's like hell
Slangin' the shit that got the smokers
In a spell
And all my homies live lives
Like crooks
Rich and infamous
Hoes wanna look but get shook
'Cause we don't trust you hoes
You'll have a nigga fucked up
With a bullet through his clothes
Positively nothings positive
Negativity positively how we live
Positively nothings positive
Negativity positively how we live

Undivided attention

Most dangerous things next to grizzles
Unsolved mysteries

Quick sharp and straight to the neck
I'm heavy on your chest
I'm all up in your life

The coast that resides to your left
Whre niggas perpitrate
And catch a fate worse than death
And like Cyanide I'm hard to detect
Got more designs and straight lines
Than an architect

Cause you never know when Xzibit gonna roll through the set
Don't be scared, just be prepared and quiet as kept
At a night club, talkin' 'bout you don't go out
And you tryin' to got to school and make a certain amount
But the last part, I just couldn't figure it out
I guess its real hard to talk with a dick in your mouth
Lightweight, like confetti, steadily tested by motherfuckers who ain't ready
To deal with the legendary
Soopafly, x-z, and bullett logo
Shot callers, clear the whole block like we po-po

Round and round we go, it don't stop

Daddy Jayo Felony, ain't nobody stoppin' me
And I said daddy, bitch that's what you gon' call me

You got me crunked the fuck-up, if you think I'm goin' soft
On ya; I'm hard on my hoes that's how it goes
Bitch, get up off your toes, and get my six-four
You got my name in ur mouth, so you might as well break bread

My name is Bullet Logo and this is my opinion
I'm coming from SD, and Dulo is my religion
Be-b-b-b- atch!

All I really wanna do is win the game, fuck hoes!

And a cocain dealer, layin low from the law
See it all comes down to who's quick to draw first
Pay attention, prevention, ridin' off in a hurst
Mister X to the you know me
Thousand-dollar bitches wanna pop the pussy for free
The disfunctional member of the Alkoholik family tree
Frequently bang bitches, Wu-Tang, Killer Bee
Hennessey on the rocks, with Pina Coloda
At the Ramada, make you work hard like Donna
For the cheese, got you down on your hands and knees

You know protect and serve, a couple traffic stops
I make a bust, and take something out the top
A thin blue line, we run these streets
You bang on them, but never bang on me
I cell search, stepping on pillows and sheets
I'm the police, treat a nigga just like fresh meat
I got a short wick, on some New York shit
Take you to the precinct and fuck you with a broomstick
I patrol your hood, put you on my hood
Leave you in the wrong hood, got it understood

You know a couple of muthafuckas was giving us grief
Pulled a couple strings, dodge the media beef
Ever since them niggaz in black said ""Fuck the police""
I been grinding on the back of my teeth, loading my piece
Waiting for some, get back like it or not
We investigated the shots, that killed Biggie and Pac
Ever wonder why nobody ever figured it out
'Cause we the ones that got to figure it out
I shout freeze at the top of my lungs
I'm the cream of the crop
You don't stop you get popped by my warning shots
And if you try to come back, with a civil suit
I sit back and watch my system take a shit on you
Order in the court, Order in the court
That muthafucka shot me, case dismissed
Ha Ha Ha Ha, police
I'm the police
(Verse 3 - Xzibit)
You see this fuckin' badge, you see these fuckin' lights
I'm in your neighborhood rolling on you every night
You faggots run and duck, look at you scared as fuck
You see me coming in your mirror niggaz straighten up
Turn that hat around, I'm here to take you down
Hey partner look at these weapons and this coke I found
I'm going to let it slide, show you who you can trust
And if you want to keep selling, nigga you sell for us
Make you a 1030, I'll get you hands dirty
Murder for hire, professional liar
I plan to make police chief and then retire
I remember when you set your own hood on fire
I reinforce the freeways, to bring the tanks
So the next time y'all trip, fuck bloods and crips
'Cause we the biggest gang in L.A.
Ramp Part, fuck with us, get blown away
I'm the police, I'm the police
I'm the police, I'm the police"
79,Recycled Assassins,1998,40 Dayz & 40 Nightz (1998),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"There's no escape from the ones who harassin'
The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin'
Now I try to school 'em on the killin' and blastin'
But season after season they recycle assassins now
Montageone:
He's too advanced for his own good
He didn't get a second chance to see the glock pointed at his hood
Makin' his way through the rain he's caught in the game
He felt the pain of a slug to the back of the brain
Nothin's changed in a city flask
Where niggas lurk in black shirts pants and low hats, forever
Until the job is done and no one's left
My man Jeff told me with his very last breath
To watch moms
But they got her with the car bomb
Pop tried to save her second blast got his arm
Niggas play for keeps like casino
Baby's has got fathers just got back from doin' Chino
With nothin' to lose loose screws in the attic
The only skill a nigga knows is how to strip an automatic
And stash the barrel stab a nigga something terrible
Death resume 20 kill in incredible time
No guilt and shame
On the mind stuck a nigga for lookin' didn't know he was blind
So I find
Mankind is a serious threat
To another others kind when there's something to get
In a vet gonna fast jet to the spot to see what they got
Nobody saw shit 'cause it's not
Cool to brake the rule of the code of the streets
Niggas frightened by the visions of the blood on the sheets
And it's deep how blood drys as a mother crys
Open eyes gettin' landed on by flys
There's no disgues for the ones who harassin'
The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin' now
Xzibit:
I came from a family of one girl and three boys
Fuck playin' with toys our fun was on the block
Watchin' all the cats negotate the neighborhood stock
My job was to come runnin' whenever cops was comin'
My older brother I figure was the ring leader
Whenever these cats move they all bring heaters
All black and nickel plated (c'mon)
Soon became fasinated bitches cars and kicks
And look at how fast they made it
My younger brother gave less than a fuck he was content
With G.I. Joe and Tonka trucks
But I want butts, livin' first class delux
15 years old soldier ready to serve these clucks
My older brother was touched
It's a game where you don't play gotta have cane
Crack house for my birthday
The next day my brother shot in cold blood by the police
In a rage he lived but he paid the price
Caught with keys 25 to life
Takin' in by the crew time to standed on my own two (c'mon nigga)
But as I marinated thinkin' about the hood
I really can't remember my body doin' good
For long big decisions somebody got to make 'em
Undercover recognize the face now can't shake a
Phone tap (what) and now I'm in the belly of the beast
Use to sittin' in leather sheets now I'm sittin' awaitin' release
Visitors day, my younger brother came down
Put the toys down excited about the first round
He bust I was crushed to finally see
The solution to the problem could of started with me
It's on now"
80,Release Date,2002,Man Vs. Machine (2002),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"Yeah, today the big day
(Xzibit)
Been here four years, eleven months and twenty-nine hot ones
One more day and I'm a free man walkin'
Leavin' from behind these gates, I paid my debt to the state
And ever since they took the weights
Wasn't much for a nigga to do but start thinkin'
Wishin I was back home drinkin' every weekend
Remember like it's yesterday, eight-teen and?
I can't remember the letters I just wrote a lot of them
Goin' for a ride that I cannot stop
Set up shop in Cochran, connect the dots
And for those that don't know, that's the Pen-East to Fresno
Northeast to Baskersfield, fuck ""Let's Make a Deal""
Livin' around niggaz who kill, right along with the niggaz who will
At the drop of a hat, sharpen up anything hard to stab you with that
Niggaz givin' up the manhood they can't get back
It's a sick university, murder the cirriculum
Concrete campuses, I miss Los Angeles
More than that I'm missin' my kids
Missin' my turf, missin' my bitch, what could be worse?
Shouldn't have asked that, called the bitch collect (It's Xzibit)
Some nigga picked up, wanted to break her neck
When kites slide up under your door, you slide them back
'Cause when you pick 'em up and read 'em that's where you're at
And if you ain't rollin' with that then watch your back
Level four right away, gettin' hit the same day
Playin' the price for the games you play
Never realize how precious time is till you give it away
Can't remember what a t-bone taste like
I stayed awake nights listening to the sounds of prison life
Motherfuckers cryin, shanks gettin' sharpened
Tacs gettin' taced up, plottin and talkin'
Sellin everything from weed to blow
When it's time for you to go you're the last to know
Niggaz holdin' weight, essays got the power
Locked down, one shower every seventy-two hours
Top ramen, tuna, trigger happy sharpshooters
Waitin for the jump off, can't wait to thump off
Had to smash a nigga readin my shit
Tryin' to intercept my outside and write my bitch
I seen niggaz sleep for weeks, get too weak
And then physically and mentally cannot compete
Find new shit to master, make the time move faster
Home sweet home, shipped off to Land Caster
Kept a low pro, close to home and I'm trippin'
Time to catch up with all the shit that I been missin'
Everybody runnin' they mouth, pussy to count
Cause bitches in Cali love niggaz that's freshed out
But some of these niggaz on swipe
Gettin' out with the virus caught from the nigga he liked
Fuck that, when I touch back I got plans
If I can't rock the powder, rock the fans
Give my naked pictures away, shake some hands
Hope I never seen none of you motherfuckers again
On all times take the long walk to the front gate
Dress out expandin shit, today my release date
(Talking)
(X) All right my niggaz, I'm gone, see you in da outs dog, woo!
(G) What's up nigga
(X) Yeah, what's up nigga
(G) Hey get in the car, my nigga, sup X?
Here goes ya motherfuckin chain nigga
Lucky I didn't pawn that motherfucker
(X) Ha, yeah right
Check it out dog, everybody know that you just got out
That shit was all on the radio
But dig it I got two strippin bitches
Just flew in from motherfuckin Las Vegas
Ready to get down and dirty, I got a pound of weed, got on the Hennessy
Everybody at the club waitin, what you wanna do?
(X) Take me to the motherfuckin studio"
81,Ride Or Die,2004,Weapons of Mass Destruction (2004),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"(Feat. Tone)
We just ride and get high, till the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
'Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...
(Verse 1: Xzibit)
... We just boogy, advance
The rubber band stack thick in my pants
Real gangsters make plots and plans and touch dirt
Only prayin' for the day when they can wash they hands
Real gangsters leave nothin' to chance at first glance
If it ain't a sho' thing then you bet' not swing
Real gangsters keep that Cutlass clean, keep the monsters mean
And when you dump it drop it right at the scene
Real gangsters got a gangsta lean
You might not talk red, black, or blue but everybody talk green
Glance to my left look over my right shoulder
Livin' life in my rearview, FUCK stayin sober
Forget back I sit back and wait for the click-clack
Real gangsters want real spit so I spit that
Real gangsters don't even say it
They just hit the trunk cock it and spray it
Light up your Christmas! Yeah!
(Verse 2: Xzibit)
... And don't slip up
It's way too late when the bodybags zip up
Real gangsters pray for they soul when they get up
You live by the gun but you'll die by that hit up
Watch that rig up, find yo'self in a box
In a spot where the cops can't dig up
Real gangsters ain't just thugs in bandanas
Slugs and big cannons, drugs and big hammers
Real gangsters open up ya minds and expand 'em
Why was Tupac really spittin' at the cameras?
Cause real gangsters get no peace, they want us six feet deep
Or locked down in the belly of the beast
Real gangsters make bread, rise like yeast
Won't hesitate to put hot chrome to ya teeth
So fuck beef! Real gangsters load heat
When ya see 'em in the street better call the police, c'mon
(Verse 3: Tone)
... Syndrome is a fear
That inner-city residents have of they own peers
People in they own community
Usin' a case where two blacks got smoked by one in '93
And ain't now nigga be the murder case
Usin' and servin' survival shit as a defense plea
In Cali big knot (knot)
The judicial system out here'll have you level fo' till you rot
It's because of the system we violence stricken
Forced to frequent the zone when the reefer's driftin
And it's hella drift cause in Southeast Danglewood
Damn near, 30 years of Bloodin and Crippin
And we inflicted with a disease mo' trip than an H-I-V
Can't nothin' protect you from a hundred, drummer 2-2-3's
You can call the police
Wear a V-E-S-T but forget about safety"

Henny-spell brew, now ya comin' up off it
He brought it, he rolled it, he passed it, you smoked it
Now ya fucked up off some weed mixed with coke shit
Ya love her, ya hate her, ya fucked her, ya raped her
25 or life 'cause ya can't control your anger
It's heavy, it's deep, it's solid, it's weak
Hears people say about your record in your street check it
Be careful watcha wish for
Ya fuck around ya get it, I get it, I had it, I spit it, I gettin' wished a minute
So where my niggas at, what part of the game is that?
I pay my dues now nobody tryin' to pay me back
And if I did, I'd probably have as much as shaq
My life is the movies so listen to the soundtrack
It's what it's all about, ya better stall me out
I feel the aim with the name you niggas callin out
If ya feelin' how I'm feelin' and yo ready and willin'
Then come to the table and put it together
Who doin' it better come bounce wit me (come on!)
You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out
If ya movin how I'm movin and ya chosen and proven
So lose the illusion of top-guns due to confusion
Come bounce wit me (come on!)
You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out
I'm tired, I'm hungry, you're lazy, disgusting
Ya lay about the house and ya never do nothin'
Ya seen it, believed it, you planned, conceived it
Whisper me the bullshit, bitch I don't need it
You cheated, YOU cheated, we cheated, so beat it
Eat it like a dick bitch, you two concede it
You broke it, replaced it, I slammed it, I chased it
Hands in the air if ya love gettin' wasted baby
You've never seen this before
You better come and get it
U wit it, I'm wit it, I'm busy baby, u fuckin' wit it
Is it your place or mine?
Don't wanna waste your time
Yeah you can get it how you want it it'll blow your mind
It's overtime to your pride in the public grind
I hit from behind, and leak you when I break your spine
It's what it's all about, you better stall me out
It's just a game wit a name you bitches callin oooouuut
If ya feelin' how I'm feelin' and yo ready and willin'
Then come to the table and put it together
Who doin' it better come bounce wit me (come on!)
You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out
If ya movin how I'm movin and ya chosen and proven
So lose the illusion of top-guns due to confusion
Come bounce wit me (come on!)
You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out
Pop it, drink it, float it, sink it
Plan to stop me then you better re-think it
Drive it, use it, pimp it, abuse it
Shit muhfuckers do the hip hop music
I'm livin', I'm dyin', I'm laughin', I'm cryin
Pop to a knees bitch let's start flyin
I love it, I taste it, I touched it, I faced it
Breakin down the bullshit, back to the basics
I had to kick in the door, that's how I had to get in
I shittin with lyrics and getting betta so fucken print it
Getting gangsta wit it, the best that ever did it
Hittin and quit it my nigga you shouldn't babysit it
We need more MC's and less wannabes
360' of reality
That's what it's all about, killin' me haul 'em out
Nothing to aim, with the name you niggas callin oooouuuttt
If ya feelin' how I'm feelin' and yo ready and willin'
Then come to the table and put it together
Who doin' it better come bounce wit me (come on!)
You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out

Take a chance, come dance with a cowboy
Playin' stopped playin' long time ago with childish toys
It's only men in here; deuce deuce inch Pirelli
And Goodyear niggaz, sip malt liquor beer
They gave me sixth man of the year, came off the bench for Tha Liks
Shot the lights out at the championship
Big chips, big trips, new fits, my money clip's
Full of green cheese, my other pocket got green weed
Rap niggaz, we different individuals
Elevate the level of the music and the visuals
It's do or die, I need a +Priest+, call +Superfly+
Whatever we discuss when we meet's between you and I
I'm truly high, red-eyed for the red-eye flight
Five hours, eight drinks, I rode all night, shit
Everyday, every night's a saloon
Crime blitty, good bottle, million dollar tunes
(Chorus: Kokane)
Love when when you're out there on the ave
When you're down 24/7, niggaz don't know the half
My Romeo's step down on the pedal
My back keeps on scrapin the metal
I be coastin and be coastin, hittin three wheel motion
With my rimz and tirez

I ain't never seen Kevlar flesh (hell naw)
Y'all bitch niggaz is flirtin and fuckin' with death
I was taught to stick with the right and work with the left
Never love nothin', never turn snitch and confess
Got catch me in the heat of the act, and run the risk
Of catchin three to the back, and try walkin' with that (yeah!)
I ain't goin' to the pen for shit, except to snatch up
My loved ones to get loose and hop the fence
It ain't hard to look hard, snatch up a catalogue
Mad dog to niggaz that walk up your boulevard (yeah!)
But one day, you gon' feel it (what?)
I'm a firm believer in the theory if it bleeds, I can kill it
A hit man for hire (yeah!) caught up in the crossfire
The live wire, leak a nigga like a vampire
My empire roll rimz and tirez
Either get with us, forget us and get behind us, muh'fuckers
Ride along, with my rimz and tirez
Side along

Mr. Recycler (what?) I'm lookin' for a sixty-two Chevy
And she kinda bad, threw him six and I was read'
(Whatchu want me to do?) To get spic and span
Man I'm glad you came and got me from that old white man (good lookin')
He took me to a spot in Long Beach, hooked me up with four pumps
(Bzzt) but everybody in the hood can't jump (bzzt)
And I change colors when the sun hit me
Fix me up, now my owner wanna slang me for 50?
Bling bling, now I belong to a Japanese
And they was quick to throw me in the magazines
I make money (huh?) I never broke down, fools trippin'
(Check it out) How many cars you see in Seoul on streets dippin?
(None) Afraid to get that ass caught slippin (why?)
For me it was an easy task
I kept an engine on my ass with heat under the dash

87,Say It To My Face,2006,Full Circle (2006),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"(Intro: Kurupt)
Bitch ass nigga was talkin' all this shit right?
I'm like damn, you bitch ass nigga
I should sock you in your motherfuckin' mouth
Talkin' all this shit about my homie
So I chirped him (chirp-chirp)
Hey 'cause, this nigga talkin' all this shit right?
Boom, the homie came up and was like
""Nigga say that shit in my motherfuckin' face""
Popped him dead in his motherfuckin' mouth nigga
Niggaz be talkin' all this shit
The only thing I wanna know is, look
(Chorus: Don Blaze (Kurupt))
See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault
My back was up against the wall... thanks to y'all
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches)
You need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say 'bout me
Cause that's the way it's supposed to be... but you ain't no G
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me
(Xzibit)
Sometime men got some more than women
You do too good in Cali the prey start to turn to venom
You can't walk in these shoes nigga, you can't fit 'em
I'm bout five seconds away from the ""let's go get him""
So nigga (say it to my face) if you're feelin' like King Kong
Mysery love company, I guess I'ma leave y'all
Until that day, you wanna tuck them nuts
And try to hit my switches and get your frame fucked up
You gotta (say it to my face), I'm right here with a 12-gauge
You talkin' to a man that plan on dyin' of old age

(Niggaz talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me
(Xzibit)
Too much of anything makes you a addict
Wantin' contact with another man makes you a faggot
Patience is virtue, don't make me hurt you
I came full circle, about-face reversal
Salute the general, make yourself presentable
Analytical, every move made political
(Say it to my face) and wake up in a hospital
Huh, gutter never takin' me under
Fuckin' nerve of you motherfuckers
Thinkin' I was slippin', I was servin' you motherfuckers
X went off the deep end, I'm determined you motherfuckers
So watch how you speakin'
'Cause I'm listenin' closely for any pussy approachin' me
(Chorus: Don Blaze (Kurupt))
See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault

(Niggaz talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me
(Xzibit)
Nigga, you better come with the Taliban
Never been a slave or afraid of another man
X move like the brutal force of an avalanche
It ain't my fault you smoked off your chance
See motherfuckers envy what they cannot be
Mr. X to the Z, H.N.I.C.
Shh, half assed niggaz gon' shit on me
If they sentence me to five I'll be out in three
You'll be deep in the dirt for the bugs to eat
Tucked in for eternity, time to sleep
Till that day, I'll crush everything in my way
And give a fuck about what y'all say
(Chorus: Don Blaze (Kurupt))
See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault
My back was up against the wall... thanks to y'all

88,Scandalous Bitches,2006,Full Circle (2006),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"(Xzibit)
She was a brown skin ebony honey that love hip-hop
Cut off tank-top, she make your whole face drop
Hotbox, like it or not, she don't care what I got
She got her own knot dealin' in stocks
And in the backwoods she plans to dust me off
Suck me off, and then say I must be off
Tryin' to smoke with X, the Cali kush was makin' her cough
She must hate wearin' her clothes, she keeps takin' 'em off
At the Palms Hotel on a Friday night
Attack each other like animals till the sky turn bright
Make it a - night to remember, she went tellin' her sista
Then her sista turned around and told the shit to Melissa
Then Melissa got my number, started sendin' me pictures
In all type of different positions, man this bitch on a mission
Listen, a man is a man, gon' handle his business
I ain't a bad guy, just dealin' with scandalous bitches
I remember when Xzibit used to push in a Caddy
I met this chick from the Valley, she said she wanted me badly
Now this is common in Cali because the homies is savy
Bitches be givin' money to niggaz and callin 'em Daddy
She in a brand-new Lexus, just moved from Texas
She came to California to model and be that next bitch
Takin' naked pictures tryin' to gain more acceptance
Maybe get some jobs, try to politic some connections
I said appreciate for X to the Z
My homie picked through my trash instead of talkin' to me
He fell in love with her ass, and while she casin' his place
Tryin' to tell another nigga what he got up in his safe
About the big hundred stacks and them bricks to match
Forever watchin' his back, therefore he never relax
And when her nigga attack, he got a slug in his britches
He ain't a bad guy, just dealin' with scandalous bitches
I met this girl from the 'Natti, I got along with her daddy
I made it up in my mind this is the girl I'ma marry
Now when you wanna get married the preparation is scary
You want your weight to get carried, you want your skeletons buried
She moved out to California next to me in a hurry
Her reputation was dirty, but yo that didn't disturb me
I want to stop the insanity, try to have me a family
Started checkin' my phone and brought her back to reality
Left her ring on the dresser, adios motherfucker
I'm travelin' home from the road, I hear she fuckin' with Usher
Now Usher don't even know me but I got love for the homie
Even though everybody around me be thinkin' he corny
She denied everything, said the rumors was phony
On the phone cryin', she love me, said she wanted to hold me
(""Yo he ain't shit to me Alvin, I was just into his album
That was some bullshit, I'm sorry, I'm better without him"")
So I'm off to Miami, got invited to party
By Mr. Raymond himself, yo I ain't hatin' nobody
Now when we walk in the party, yep, guess who I see
Lyin' bitch said she was callin' from N.Y.C
He started wipin' the sweat off of her face and her chest
And then she gave him a peck, and then she looked to the left
And when she seen it was X, she started cryin' and trippin'
And dude was lookin' confused, the scene it couldn't be written
Now he just pluckin' his chickens, I ain't gon' sock him or diss him
I'm from the West Coast, where niggaz don't be fightin' for bitches
A little over-dramatic, in Rome I called him a faggot
In front of millions of people, funny but shouldn't have done that
I was makin' a joke, I didn't mean to offend
Like when I introduced Destiny's Child as Boyz II Men
Listen, a man is a man, gon' handle his business
I ain't a bad guy, just dealin' with scandalous bitches
""X, you ever get tired of um, motherfuckers talkin' to you about Pimp My Ride?"""
89,Scent Of A Woman,2004,Weapons of Mass Destruction (2004),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"Yeah... Check it out... They say behind every strong man
Is an even stronger woman
'Cause she, was put here to defeat me
'Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me
'Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need
'Cause she, blow my phone up, to reach me
'Cause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me
'Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need
(Xzibit)
Man,""x"" ain't with that sucka, she know
I'm from a place, where they quick to say ""Fuck A Bitch""
And gettin' grits, off of pussy, try ta get a hitch
But I'm a bachelor, stackin' it, drinkin', need to quit
Me and my clique, ride through cities like we own da shit
You caught my eye, looking fly, body lookin' thick
So who am I? I reply with my government, exchange the numbers
Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger
Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line
Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time
Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman
I got 20/20 cord vision, seein' you comin'
Livin' my life, I don't need a wife
But you persist, tryin' ta strengthen our relationship
But I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets
Without a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace
You ain't the one for me!
(Xzibit)
You found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit
Never seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit
Now them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets
Provide a place for all my peoples to eat
I'm feelin' stuck, had to hustle up
The A-T-F, hit the house, had me shackled up
You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out
You never let a brother down, when you stressin out
You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route
You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out
And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat
You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me
I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was
The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man
I understand that you love me and you want the best
But if you wanna take the good, you gotta take the rest
I rock a vest, baby!
'Cause I, run these streets for my struggle
'Cause I, carry heat for my troubles
'Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?
'Cause I, want family so I'm buildin
'Cause I, want you just for my children
'Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?
(Xzibit)
And all this time it was you
Baby forgive me for the pain, I was puttin' you through
It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true
I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I pursue
I used to think I was the MAN, wasn't havin' a clue
I wasn't lookin' for no love, but I found it in you
It's so true, behind every great man is a women
Every time you call me, Baby Girl, I'm a come runnin'
You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life
I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight
I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down
You always given me another reason, I can smile
Cause you believed in me, when there was nothin' there to see
My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree
Ugh, nothin' can stop us now, ?Verawane? gown
Watchin your father, walk his little lady down the isle
Cause you the one for me!
'Cause she, was put here to complete me
'Cause she, wooze the earth, underneath me
'Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need
'Cause she, won't let go, she won't leave me
'Cause she, won't leave, what she don't need me
'Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need
Dedicated to the real ones out there
Yeah, ugh, this is for you"
90,Shroomz,1998,40 Dayz & 40 Nightz (1998),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"It's a long day Friday
It's like movin on this way
Got Xzibit up tight, right
Partner came through wit two white boys
(Duuude)
Talkin' noise 'bout a hot spot
Where bitches come alone
And niggas don't cock block
Let the top drop
And we out
Hit the liquor store
Give me Olde-E and three blunts
No make it four
Anything else
(Vitamin C pills and orange juice)
What are you drinking gin
(No dude it's the shroomz)
The shroomz? (what?)
Yeah that's some other shit
One of the reasons why George Clinton sees the mother ship
How high it make you get
Fucked up?
Throw it up, guts
Or do it have you stuck wit soft dick and can't fuck
Hold up
Now chew 'em up and slam the orange juice
Vitamin c chase
Kill the taste
You can tell its nasty by the look on my face
Don't get it twisted like a nigga coked up
And druggied down
See cannibus and mushrooms be comin' from the ground
All natural
Post it at the club
Looking funny style
Tight slack
Pimp feather hat
Where the bitches at
Here
We giving orders at the bar holding money
When all of a sudden
All the people started looking funny
And started lookin' runny
And likwitfy
Right before my very eye
This is a different kind of high
(Oh shit, you see this shit
This motherfuckers melting and shit)
Niggas and bitches walkin' by that I recognize
Feeling hypnotized
Pupils dilated changing size
That's when I heard the battle cries from across the room
Set these crooked niggas straight
Liquid krew
Activate
Form of
A bunch of wild niggas mashing you
Came crashing through
Elbows and right hooks for you
We got thrown out by this time
My shit is blown out
Pull the phone out
Accelleration and we bone out
In the zone out beyond
Captain Kirk and Klingons
Shit that I'm on
Be high powered like a yukon
Back to my house
Fucked up
Trying to see straight
How much of that bullshit did I actually take
(2 grams duuude)
God damn
No wonder why I feel like an underneath told the white boy faggot
We got beef
Over did it homes
Niggas playin' bones in the living room
Restless
Try to find anything to mess with
Where my keys at
Pickin' up clothes
Trying to fold this shit
See my riot gage on the wall
Better unload this shit
Fucked up niggas and fire arms don't mix right
Cocked back the chamber
Dumping shells till it felt light
Thought I dumped the all
Counted 7
But it was 8
Straight gone
Point the barrel at the flow and let it go
(Fuck!, shit!...wooow... ah ah ah its cool, I just shot the flow man.
It's all good, it's all good... ah ah where everbody at, ah shit (haha)
Fuckin' wit dat shit"

Touched in all the stray but bound he pound his way
And so he shines so bright in the sky
I'm designed in oasis, wide open spaces
But naked bitches having sexual relations
Major operation, let me take conversations
Sense of the intel, pay attention in detail
Yeah, deign your flat, not your vital son
AC, DC, alkaline, whichever type of battery you got in your bag
Gonna be removed when the clips just slap
You and your bitch get slapped, damn, it's good to be back

Already all stars, they fizz a lot fast week
Burn like the sun and you suck like a black hole
Stuck in my style and get over my flat
This colors don't run, we attract you
Drama like madness, you wanna get your head flew
Incredible bars, I show 'em how to rhyme
I'm not the average, no one's back home
Super rap killer, extremely great spitter
Make a door, hit the door, solve the queen's riddle
Sinister, ailing off the bank with the sickest
So get up and get down with the sickness
This is something more than just songs
I wish upon the stars, pray to God that I come with
Better lines than them, they crush their dreams
And attempt to my sport when I do this thing
It's something more than fairytales
Is a story of a little star, looking for a place to shine this life
Touched in all the stray but bound he pound his way
And so he shines so bright in the sky
What you know about dead money and sacrifice?
What you know about people scheming and take your life?
What you know about these Cali G's?
That mister penitenciary invested movement on a bigger better day
What you know about the harder man?
We paint the outer water décor to the promised land
You understand, is in my nature not to walk away
'Cause I'm a beast, my beats are open up your chest in face
Call the police, it's still the same and I don't give a fuck
I speak the truth and all my catalogues are living trust
Now give it up and get it, take it at gun point
We cut broke niggas in what point
You gonna realize we came for

Sorry I'm away so much, yeah, yeah
All the sons, daughters, penitentiary niggas, yeah feel me
Uh, sorry I'm away so much, yeah

My son was born about four and a half years ago
Loved and protected him, amazin how fast they grow
I came to know about his likes and his dislikes (yeah)
Video games, taught him how to ride his first bike (that's it)
This is the life my little nigga, I see you gettin' all upset
When I leave the house, poutin, let me tell you about
Tryna make it in this world and provide for you
Cause on them overseat plane rides I miss you too
Never knew that I would have to be away so much
Five thousand dollar phone bills keepin' in touch
We Starskey and Hutch, yeah, we partners for life, yeah
I rock mics, so I'm sorry when I hug you if I squeeze too tight
Long nights in the studio take me away
Gettin' mad 'cause I'm tired and you want me to play
Money can't replace time, I'm just tryna get you outta the fine relyin
And expand your mind my lil' ni', yeah
Yeah, c'mon

I got a brother locked down, he be out in a couple
Knuckle for knuckle, a veteran and nothin' but muscle
Now broadcastin live from behind the wall
Stayin tight through long kites and telephone calls
Gettin' hype when you see your brother on TV
Can't wait for your release so you can roll with me
Arrange everything exactly how it's supposed to be
For right now here's a thousand, J, stay lo-key
You say damn Xzibit, whyn't you pay a nigga a visit
Time limits got me movin a million miles a minute
Knee deep, gotta strike while the iron is hot
Still gotta eat and keep the lights on when it's not
Sleepin' on cots, bullet wounds got you in knots
I wish I was there to snatch you up instead of the cops
Muthafuck it, do the time and get it out of the way
You goin' from convict to corporate nigga in one day (in one day)
(Quik)
Now I ain't never been this hot before
So in essence it's obvious, I ain't never been this out before
I'm spending 25-8 days, 366 times a year
Up in the studio freakin and mixin rhymes in here
Nothin' but beer, bud smoke, Hen and Coke, women and sheer
Callin playa niggas there
Not the kinda place I really wanna bring my son
Get on lil' Dane, gon' in there and have you some fun
Used to be that negro be up there sewin ya clothes

93,Spread It Out,2012,Napalm (2012),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"I'm heavy hearted, heavy headed, misunderstand it
Try the permanent repercussions, I empty the cannon
I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in a wood
Drink a gallon of heaty, throw it up with the hood
I'm a rhyme for my people, give my people a voice
Never follow the leader, use the weapon of choice
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out
I own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron
The iron mob, try better bombs, I'm better alone
So tag along like a dog with a bag of bones
Smoke to the sack of gold, nigga on a grind
Put my motherfucker records on
So they can relate to the hate and the pain
To the struggle and strain
Never take it in vain, bring the one and the same
Press and push your forehead at the back of your brain
So now
Let's spread it out, nigga
Yeah, yeah
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out
It go ooh, ooh
And you can't get none, you don't want none
You can't get none
Spread the fuck out, gets these hot ones
I try not to get involved with the nonsense
I'm from the time where you couldn't pause comments
Couldn't hide behind a computer
Catch a fatal get shot by a shooter
A barracuda for Buddha
I maneuver to the manure, ignore the allure, the illusion
My bad, sorry for all the confusion
If you thought I was finished, if you thought I was done
The saga continue, bring it back on the one
I'm coming back with a gun, 'cause I saw that I know
Meditated intentions, my shit ready to go
Never taking a smoke, in my profession you need aggression
A weapon, you can brand the shit to your own discretion
And I hear, just a sandwich, nigga, what's your preference?
I chose bad and now I'm headed in a right direction
They're sick of the decisions, now my family is good
Make you well understood, put you back where you should be
This go for all my people, people who see we're equal
I feel they come, it is dark, I protect us from evil
We misheard an illusion, car can make a confusion
People constantly losing, we suffer everywhere
Enough with all this swagger, party's a baggy bagger
We hear a session is starting, let me show you what's heading at
Money's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights
She make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night
But she know that you go off with that stripping ho
While your woman is wondering where does all your money go
You try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain
Maybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere
Pussy nigga, you lame, get on top of your game
Feed your family, man, this is simple and plain
Children retain, remember living upon the pain
That's when they curse your name, they will see you do the same
Yeah, so spread it out, nigga"
94,Stand Tall,2012,Napalm (2012),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"Sometimes it all just come together, you know?
I put my city on my back, now
And push the haters in the background
Together we walk, but divided trough the struggle, we fall
Got my city on a map, now
That's why I could never back down
Never back down, show 'em through it all
You gotta stand tall
To all of my friends, enemies and affiliates
Burn the back wood, burn it back to your fingertips
Let the whole world recognize this accomplishment
You couldn't have told me none of this back in '96
The ability to crawl upon the bottom, this bitch
This is our time I'm spending mine up in this bitch
I still remember the very moment I was enlisted
I studied on the sadistic, gangster is worth the business
And when there's blood in the streets from my brothers and sisters
They wanna debate on television about the victim
Right or wrong, Treyfa was my little man
I would take a chainsaw to z...? my man
For all the moments I wasted on making others happy
Attack me, I'm bulletproof, tag me, I've seen the virus through
I never lied to you, still rolling with golden views
Spend every word and I mean it, mean it and I really buy to you
'Cause I'd rather be in hell than a jail cell
I'm hancock, superheroes lend me cocktails
I never feel, don't try to patronize me
I learn, I'm painfully aware of everything in my surroundings
I am shaved, fully shining, never touched the silver lightning
The only cross that I bear is covered with some fucking diamonds
I hear my city calling, here come the jogging
Now are twelve hundred soldiers in the parking lot
So, failure ain't an option
How do you think I made it out that corner apartment?
Turn my corner to my market, and now I target the same niggas
That taught on all that dumb shit
Because when the gun clicking
That bullet leaving can't get that life back
Karma is a bitch and believe me, she'll get it right back
They say that success is the best revenge
But who really wins if we all die in the end
If I had it all, then I probably wouldn't pray the same
And the club that I come from sticks the debt with the pain
My name good in every corner in my city
You don't believe me, then come fuck with me"
95,State Of Hip Hop Vs. Xzibit,2012,Napalm (2012),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"Man, I'm talking about that six four rag top
Green, with the back racked
Everything mat black, caught it in a six pack
You know what the fuck it is and what I came to do
Now put your hands up in the air, like I'm about to shoot
My agenda is here, crystal perfectly clear
Breathe apocalypse in, we have nothing to fear
We have nothing to lose, pressure applying the rules
Wasp on a motherfucker and knock him up out of his shoes
That's what my coast love, good money, great drugs
Every bad bitch you can think of
Swagged out, locked out, flamed on, purve out
Shit face from shots, your words come swirled up
Better put the word out, mind I find the mediocre
I'm a bust it down, serve 'em like a bunch of smokers
You can fuck around, who else get the fly
You know I asked your little mind is your prime world dying over
Order in the court, that's what you came to see
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z
Not a verdict to see, just the moment of truth
Fighting the fight of my life, jury ready to shoot
I be my own attorney, watching you try to burn me down
Testimony testifier from the underground
Order in the court, that's what you came to see
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z
I create in a dark, darkest place in my heart
I finish off with your started terror, I tear you apart
I am not for the cage, I'm the climb to the change
Dread the eye and the needle, that means accurate aim
That means I can arrange haters and hideous things
I'm the sickness you feel, sickness from popping a vein
Paranormal presence to people who can never explain
Why deal with the devil when dealing with you is the same
I got a proposition for all you bitches listening
Get in position, let me nail it like a crucifixion
Give you what you've been missing
A man in my condition shouldn't be allowed around crowds without supervision
Call it a superstition, can't get this out my system
I got a fetish for fucking over my opposition
It's time to set the standing, the mother ship is landing
We didn't come here in peace, we're here to take the player
I came up with the wolf, they came out with them tools
Elevate you out the earth gravitational pool
This is not for the week, this time works for the streets
Mister X to the Z, motherfuck, what you think?
Motherfuck, what you blog, this for my loss and my dogs
Standing tall, still calling shots from behind the wall
I've been tried and I'm true, reassemble my crew
Carry on tradition, position I'm put here to do
Make movements my elemental, I did make some improvements
You can check my potential, tool to never pursue it
If I listen to critics, there would be no Xzibit
Dreams splattered and broken never breaking my spirit

And now a message from the President of the United States
(George W. Bush)
Tonight I wanna take a few minutes to dicuss a great threat to peace. The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons, is here in our own country. He is a homicidal dictator, who is addict to weapons of mass destruction. He has proven he is capable of any crime. The tyrant is me. I have directed the administration to support the use of violence against all of you. I will kill thousands, or hundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country and across the world. I um, resolve to bring sudden terror and suffering with horrible poisons, and diseases, and gases. Men and women, boys and girls, thousands of civilians will be killed in a single day, murdered at random, and without remorse. My ultimate ambitions are to control the peoples of the United States, and to blackmail the rest of the world with weapons of mass terror. Weapons of Mass Destruction."

I just wanna thank you, for bein around
And patiently waitin and holdin' me down
It's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z
That without no you, there could be no me
I just wanna thank you, for bein a fan
And watchin me grow from a boy to a man
It's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z
That without no you, there could be no me

You 'bout to hear some words, that you ain't probably heard
With all of these rappers pullin triggers and flippin birds
I know it sound absurd, 'cause they don't tell the truth
They prostitutes, fuckin' contaminate the youth
But yet I'm guilty of, the things I said above
No matter my faults still continue to show me love
Naw I ain't perfect mayne, but yet I stay the same
I play chess not checkers but this is not a game
And this is not a song, and this is not a verse
It's not conceived, or simulated or been rehearsed
Spent the first half of my life, thinkin' that I was cursed
Could have been hit with a hollow, follow behind my hearse
That wasn't meant for me, I spent a decade
Makin' it what it's 'sposed to be, hopefully brought you close to me
All these people approachin me, don't even know the half
I could be facin life but X is signin autographs, damn
(Xzibit)
My son's 11 now, I got to see him grow
Makin' his free throws, the way he laughin' at the show
Yo he remind me of me, when I was ridin' bikes
He gon' be taller than me, he got my mother's height
But yo you know the difference, between me and them others
They say you buggin when I call you my sisters and brothers
I coulda missed it all, I coulda dropped the ball
Mind of Metallica, motherfuck 'em and ""Kill 'Em All""
I used to hustle raw, I used to run the streets
I used to hustle heats, I grinded all my beef
Most of my homies is gone, restin in peace
Some'll never see release from custody of police, but me
But nah my little dude get to go to private school
And I can do the things my father couldn't afford to do
That's what it's 'sposed to do, this is from me to you
Support from you and yours, thank you for gettin' me through, true
(Xzibit)
We buried Proof today, it really broke me up
To see my brother in that casket, maaan what the fuck?
Media made me angry, I had to soak it up
The future is fragile never promised to none of us
Hittin so close to home, but what I focused on
Is how he lived, the lives he touched, the cornerstone
We never walk alone, although sometime it seems
That nightmares go hand in hand with livin' out dreams
So let me take this time, from my struggle my grind
To let you know that I appreciate you by my side
It's been a long ride, a lot of long nights
A lot of long flights, worth every sacrifice
A soldier of fortune fearless fightin the good fight
I never had a plan B, I never lost sight
That's why I hit the stage, that's why I kill the mic
It's for my fans that's ridin' with Xzibit for life, RIGHT!
Thank you, for lettin me breathe
For lettin me be who I am, huh, yeah, huh

All these bitches and women
Son, please be selective
This is California can't stick your dick in everything
We will survive necessarily by any means
Let no man ever hold you down or suppress you
It's the 90's the police just arrest you,
Disrespect you on occasion take life
By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight
It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us
When your neck is on the line stand ground then bust
In God we trust but just incase keep it loaded and locked
Ready to rock
Then shake the spot

You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers
Who forever smoke bud
So it's probably in your blood
Realize you can only run the streets so long
Then the streets run you into the ground then gone

Same shit different day
It's the same ol' song
If the time ever comes that I meet my match
Take control of my assets
Fuck startin' from scratch
Take care of your mother
Keep yourself on track
Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back
Beware of the serpent
Cause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike
And try to make you loose sight
Don't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real
Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill
Son if you ever pull heat
Then use it
If you got a chance to walk away
Then do it
Total domination takes full concentration in all situations
A solid foundation
You are the foundation
Beginning of a new generation
I remember hospital hallway pacin'
I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine
Only to find that yours looked like mine
So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time
In this life you can't press stop
Then press rewind
Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man
Have your own plan, expand your mind
Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs
This is nothing but love
Via satellite Muggs
Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life
Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife
Be prepared for the worst
But expect the best
No matter where life takes you
Come home to the West
Survival takes more than just gats and guns

Yeah... I was blessed with some clarity right?
Uh-huh, hah... I'ma sit back
Tell you niggaz what I been lookin' at, huh
(Xzibit)
Y'all niggaz is killin' me
You got Bloods and Crips in New York City, is anybody feelin' me?
I ain't concerned with who gon' shoot who
I'm only concerned with music, and who break through
FUCK YOU, for thinkin' platinum is the ultimate goal
These faggot niggaz gettin' they money, but losin they soul
I don't wanna hear shit from you niggaz with no background
No backbones, you get no chance to back down
Deal how we deal witcha, peons, no chips
Changin whips out so they can look richer
I see the big picture, startin in the kitchen
With bricks and Pyrex pots, the widescreen edition
Listen, I seen niggaz hit with so much time loc
They have to die and come back three times to see them white folks
Take notes, cause you will be tested
Vested up, drunk as fuck, large caliber weapons
I feel you... rap niggaz, fuckin' it up
Monkey-mouthed muh'fuckers, spoilin the cut
For real niggaz in the street, really hustlin weight
See they networks and blueprints on hip-hop tapes
Johnny Law catchin on, soakin up the game
How you think they find the stash spots and follow the slang? STUPID
Grown men playin' cops and robbers
Death for dollars, I'm too laid back to holla
(Chorus 2X: (scratched by DJ Premier))
(X) What a mess...
""And Ruff up, the motherfuckin House"" - GZA
""Hope y'all niggaz hearin this right""
""We... we gon'.. we gon' gon' win""
(Xzibit)
Look at what we leavin' behind
We back at square one, ridin', with nuttin to ride fo'
Dyin' for nuttin worth dyin' fo'
The blind lead the blind with a blindfold, with ""Eyes Wide Shut""
Save mine up, cause nothin' ever last forever
Never nothin' out of my reach, we blast whoever
I can split a muh'fucker from his ass to his last thought
Shit talk, then stomp through the asphault
It's yo' fault we tow-truck for your outline
In due time, you'll find, the world is mine
So I listen to the rhetorhic, jealousy and the ignorance
Can't stop me nigga, my mind too militant
God blessed me with a chin
And a heavy right-left combination that'll cave your face in
So don't make me hurt you, patience is virtue
They only got a few of us let, huh
(Xzibit)
Primo... turn me up...
Now it's two-thousand-and-two; where kids do
Whatever the fuck they wanna do, huh, sad but true
Wanna take another life like it's the thing to do
Shit, we the biggest gang, flaggin red white and blue baby
Designer drugs, pimps and thugs
Can't shoot, innocent folks, hit with slugs
One day it's gon' all make sense, till then
Use your brains and your strength it's your best defense, c'mon
(Chorus w/ variations)
(X) What a mess..."
106,What U See Is What U Get,1998,40 Dayz & 40 Nightz (1998),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"40 Dayz and 40 Nightz
What you See is What you Get
Intro: Xzibit, (J-Ro)
Speaking:
And so it was written, and after all these things
I saw another angel come down from heaven
Having great power and the eath was lighted with his glory
And he cried mightily with the strong voice saying ""Babylon the great has
Fallen
It's fallen and has become the habitation of devils
And the home to every fowl spirit and a cage of very unclean and hateful men""
What you see is what you get now
Xzibit never wait around for kick downs, get my own shit, blowe
Shot heard around the world
Uplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple
To make things simple my existence is to ripple through time
Only concern is what is mine, divine, never monkey shine
Walkin' down the very thin line, holdin' wait, runnin' crazy in the streets
Yeah
Plus the company I keep work in overtime
While you oversleep don't wanna see none of this evil I speak
Around on the atlas, cume la matra, the super actress
You all get close-lined and pinned the mattress
All day, every day, every which way
Who said to can't have your cake and eat it too (fuck you)
This is a hard time on planet earth
For what it's worth Xzibit stand station without reabilitation like this
Pimps, players, hoes, hustlers, willes thugs, ballers, busters
Gangstas, macks everyday, all day, shot callers, even high rollers keep it
Moving
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wow
Bless the child like a hoe who's on flesh 'n' bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wow
Bless the child like a hoe who's on flesh 'n' bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home
And that's the real shit
You got more than you bargained for
Hit the floor I pull a fast one to let you know that today could be your last
One
Black, take your breath like an asthma attack
Just a slave like Flava Flav, you're blind to the fact
Mr. X to the Z the Liks and King T
Guranteed to bring the house down naturally
Niggas knowin' no limits lime Master P
Makin' you motherfuckin' bastards see
A whole different breed of MC
Realize it's you against me, catch a three-hundred and sixty degree
Roundhouse to the mouth right
And like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright
I feelin' like my whole life is a green light never turn red
'Cause I strike like a rattle-snake, lock like a dread
Niggas wanna bump heads but they better off dead
Came crashin' through the door like the Feds, bring it
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wow
Bless the child like a hoe who's on flesh 'n' bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wow
Bless the child like a hoe who's on flesh 'n' bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home
And that's the real shit
And yeah, everybody start to rush
Swingin' through is your friendly neighborhood lush
I crack your bottle than watch how Xzibit bust
I regulate like a killer with a nickel plate
Ill set it straight and start to shakin' you down, breakin' new ground
Construction work
Heavy artilary, put your dick in the dirt
Stay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt
Slug burnt through your jacket, through your sweater, through your shirt
Get cut from th belly up
I burnt the chain fast lane, suck my sugar cane
I'm tryin' to spart that niggas brain while you entertain trivial things
Material things, protected by the underground kings
Who rule the land with an iron fist
The ""Men In Black"", if we flash can't remember shit
You cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam
'Cause my package came short 12 grames, get the picture
Playas, pimps, hoes, hustlers, willes thugs, ballers, busters
Gangstas, macks everyday, all day, shot callers, even high rollers keep it
Moving
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wow
Bless the child like a hoe who's on flesh 'n' bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, yeah, yeah
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wow
Bless the child like a hoe who's on flesh 'n' bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wow
Bless the child like a hoe who's on flesh 'n' bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, yeah, yeah
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wow
Bless the child like a hoe who's on flesh 'n' bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home"
107,X,2000,Restless (2000),Hip Hop,Xzibit,"Yeah, ladies and gentleman
Broadcasting live to you and yours
It's Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit
Yeah, bounce it
Come on
The first day of the rest of my life (X)
Stand behind the mic like Walter Cronkite
Y'all keep the spotlight, I'm keeping my rhymes tight
Lose sight of what you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory, you just can't shoot through
You gon' shoot who? (who?) Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leavin' the whole world stuck, not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut, now we break through in the rut (c'mon)
Hennesy and Orange Juice, baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down, and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while I post the range
Going up and down my dick like the stock exchange
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) To the Z and we all in the family
Ever since Xzibit could spit, been on some pimp shit
Approach every woman like a potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that (X) stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next ex-wife
Mr. Big Chief Reefa (uh-huh), Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it through and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Borrow your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin'
Rockin' chains, stadiums, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop tops sittin' on twenties using rappers like crash test dummies
Stackin' real estate and money - It's funny
How things change overnight when you thinking right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) To the Z and we all in the family
What an event? We hardcore 100%
Making it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents (X)
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demandin' respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
It seems like everybody around me did change, but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat - restless, no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like bitumen grit
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Crawl back, bounce in the spot, slide right in
I ain't trying to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Representin' nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennesy, rock plenty of ice, make it a double and SCREAM
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) To the Z and we all in the family
So there you have it
A-B-C-D-P-G-C
X to the motherfuckin' Z
Mr. Xuberant, Xtravagant
Xtrodinary, Xciting, X-alotta
X 'em with a little bit of Xtasy
X-ing your bitch ass out if you tryna test a g
And what's the recipe?
Xcalibur weaponry
And we shoot Xceptionally
That there is hot
X marks the spot?
Fuck naw, X spots the marks
Xclamation point, niggaz..."
