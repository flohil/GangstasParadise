Yeah yeah yeah
Old school Pt.2 feel it
The realest, who be the realest?
That's how we do it, man!
We run through it, nigga
I'm the number one insane rapper mix CD stabba'
Your album was doo-doo, I threw it out the passenger
The number one crapta, the 8, the 12, the 16, 22's and 23's
Sometimes I could blow a little steam
I got alot on my chest but I keep it quiet, so I don't blow the steam
Get 'em every time, my military bars, will leave a permanent mark on ya brain
The comeback kid, to see you get your ass whooped!
Mad witnesses, these niggas mad shook!
I don't have a clue, why he chose to speak on my name, when you know I'm gon' shoot
You know I'm gon' crack yo' face, when you see me in the place I'm a dangerous person
Behind the rope, poppin' off with the girl
You got the ratchet in the car
I got the ratchet on my person!
3 Stacks, 3 Stacks, 3 Stacks
And a pocket full of hacks!
It don't stop, it don't stop, it don't stop
When it's on it go pop!
Yo, it been a long time since I sold a dime on a dime
This shit too hot whoa!
It's poppin' uptown when I used to see Flaco
Now back to the block hollerin' 'I got those'
I got those in every state, like the same amount of snitches that you got in your face
I'm a make my cracks bigger and take over the whole hood
Shit changed, dunn the ladies say that I'm no good
I smoke wood, to get high till we pass out
Cash over bitches, that's how we ride out

Infamous nigga, yeah-yeah
C'mon man, any nigga get charged
And in this love scene, ayo, ayo, VIP, ayo
(Chorus x2: Prodigy)
You play yourself once, you get shot twice
We gon' die three times, and the four takes life
Five of you try to jump me, and six Angels come
To take you away to +7th Heaven+
When that alcohol hit, I'm feelin' good
When that purple haze hit, I'm feelin' good
Thirty milligram, yep!, I'm feelin' good
I got so much pain, I just wanna feel good
When them drugs take effect, I start feelin' the buzz
Gimme right, gimme ready for the things to come
Sex, money and murder are the things we want
Power and longevity allow me to stunt
On the beach, they put me on the beach
Soakin' up the Sun chargin' up my batteries
When I get up it's gon' be a assault battery
Wit a Uzi, bullets peep you to asleep
No nap time nigga, my snack time nigga
I wrap niggaz up in them doggy bags nigga
You know, for the coroner, I'm strung out on gun fire nigga
Turn it up more dunn
(Chorus x2: Prodigy)
It go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
No man wanna die, everybody want Heaven
Teleported, start spreadin' his wings flap to the sky
Just when P give me the word, I'ma clap 'em till he die
It take 25 seconds 'fore he actually die
Three screamer spent 22 askin' me ""Why?""
I told 'em you crossed my vine, I tossed my nine
And walk around with twin shotties like I lost my mind
Boggie in the mouth, Ken Griffey the hands
Point 'em out I make his ass part of history fam
Yeah, and I don't gotta say no more
I've been waitin' five years to bring the K on tour
When we carry the .44, he rollin' wit 50 Cent
Untold the 50 gallons rock it like 50 Cent
Yeah, bussin' at the sky, fuck it I'm high
So big one hit you, your cousin'll die

You see what's really good when you catch him by himself
Dolly, I leave a fool holy like Jesus Christ
It's a miracle he still living
And you could say a whole life time of prayer
But you never in this lifetime player be the mayor of the murder murder
Killer killer, bloody rap songs out the slums in the squala
Made a few dollars, now they say I'm too rich
I give some to you, now a nigga cool
Ha, I ain't got two cents for you bums
Now watch as I burn rubber in the six-huns
CL made my gun ring a bell

You gon' need plastic where your face's at
Boy I'll bullet riddle you up and chop you into parts
Then scatter you all over the East Coast, kiko
You're playing with your life
You play with me you're like a baby running with a knife
You're upset your wife got my CD in the changer
And you rap too and she don't bump your bangers

'Cause us weekly and team z don't slip nah
Award show life, yeah we

All access, badges, backstage passes
Big dark sunglasses, to match it
My life is like a video, eryday's a movie
The press tryna kill me, please don't shoot me
Coming out the spot with my mistress love
Holding hands and kisses and hugs
Front row, next to Bieber, Kanye and Carmen
In the spotlight life, Biggy told me you on touring
We was doing shows tryna reach our goals
He said P, don't forget how you got where you going
I was just a little nigga back then, I didn't care
If I didn't have a tux, afford a black tie fair
'Cause it wasn't my type of party, type of crowd
I'd rather be with a ...shootouts go down
A young ball mentality, ball down,
When you grow up in the hood,
You live the hood lifestyle
Now I own, network with big millionaires
And you prolly seen my picture in Vanity Faire
Award show life, get dressed
Red carpet, cameras, get fresh
It's best you always look your best
'Cause us weekly and team z don't slip nah
Award show life, yeah we
Cameras, seats and arm candy

I'm a publicity whore, fiend to be seen
I die for more air time on the screen
Nah, 15 minutes ain't enough for me
I need the endless run, don't try to kill my dream
I got a rock star house wife, she like nice things
Tavern on the green, breakfast at Tifanny's
Strictly Rolex and Cartier on her wrist
She high maintenance, it's my fault she like this
Spoil my bitch, award show lifestyle
We on our way to another show right now
My son growing up he thinks he Chris Brown
My lil daughter need that college money no doubt
I must bust my ass continue to shine
I cannot stop no, on the road I'ma die
Just like, give me my props

I'ma bang on 'em, pop them thangs on 'em

I'ma bang on 'em, pop them thangs on 'em
Drop a nigga frontin', get 'em if I want 'em

Drop a nigga frontin', get 'em if I want 'em
I'ma bang
Ayo, my hood broke my heart into pieces
Dunn the streets took my dreams and shattered them
And turn me into a preacher
Minds to money got me not givin' a fuck
All I care about is muzik and who I gotta cut
With the Mac, uzi, .47, pick a weapon
Six million ways to die, my .25 endin'
When I pop him in the gut, I drop him where they stunt
I try keepin' it peace but that shit's for chumps
Projects fucked me up, made me strong as ox
Made the nigga cold blooded, ain't no friends on the block
This the comrades and coldies, the crooked ass police
Playin' cracks in the pocket send you up in creek
Look don't ask me why Queensbridge can't stick together
If you don't know the answer then you don't know the ghetto
Everybody don't get along and that's what it is
We either shootin' when we shoot them niggaz or we gon' get hit
Bang on 'em, pop them thangs on 'em
Drop a nigga frontin', get 'em if I want 'em
I'ma bang on 'em, pop them thangs on 'em
Drop a nigga frontin', get 'em if I want 'em
I'ma bang on 'em, pop them thangs on 'em
Drop a nigga frontin', get 'em if I want 'em
I'ma bang on 'em, pop them thangs on 'em
Drop a nigga frontin', get 'em if I want 'em
I'ma bang
Ayo, my own niggaz turned on me, B.I.G wasn't lyin'
When he said, the ones who smoke blunts with you be conversant
They was plottin' on my demise, they wanted my seed
At the head of the table but I'm permanently chief
I don't care how many bodies you got on your gun
You either submit or go and start your own gang son
Everybody wants to be boss, it ain't enough soldiers
Everybody wants to call shots, it ain't enough shooter
And it really hurts my soul that we can't click
But whatever it'll never be the same again
And when I see you niggaz, you already know what it is
And if you don't, you gon' find out the hard way kid
Tried to make it work, but now I'm on some other shit
I'm greedy with that limelight now you ain't gettin' none of it
Bang on 'em, pop them thangs on 'em
Drop a nigga frontin', get 'em if I want 'em
I'ma bang on 'em, pop them thangs on 'em
Drop a nigga frontin', get 'em if I want 'em
I'ma bang on 'em, pop them thangs on 'em
Drop a nigga frontin', get 'em if I want 'em
I'ma bang on 'em, pop them thangs on 'em

Yo what up, man!?!

Who the fuck it sound like, man?
What the fuck you calling so early for, man!?!
What the fuck time is it!?!
It's like 3 o'clock, man, thought you was coming to get me, man!?!
... Shit, my bad son.
Please, man, come get me man, before I choke this bitch, man!
Hurry up son, man it's like 90 man, let's get some hoes or something.
What up, dun!?!
Same ol' shit.
No doubt, ain't nothing new...
Let's take a little spin, dun, word up.
Yo... open my wings to a new day spread my lungs
Get laced, jump in the whip, stash the guns
Twist the key, shifted to D then flee
Before anything, get the daily dose of choke
We got the Benzo flooded with smoke on the float
My eye's burnin' from the dope killin' my throat
Lean my seat a taste, lumbar support
On the belt doin' 90 or more
Debatin' on the latest rhyme wars
Where units don't count
But your rap pay add up to large amounts
Get my thrills puttin' other nigga's skills to sleep
Catch chills off'a infamous beats
Swing the trees doin' one-handed you'ees
Blowin' on the ouwee 'cause we can't have the medicine canoein'
There go the boys to the right, no days and nights like that
Ay yo dun, hold that down and turn it around
Dirty as fuck, thugs drugs and guns, d's and fatigues
T n T hopin' out of MPV's
Surprise all'a fuck out of me
Got rubber Glocks pointed at me
Ay yo twin, what the fuck...
(Twin)
They had us laid out on the ground holdin' us down
With gats to back of our heads was goin' down
?It wasn't us that held up that bitch you got.
Where's the proof, man!? Let me speak to my attorney.?
I know the routine, don't try to throw me
I been gettin' knocked since 12 and my moms tried to scold me
... But all that told me to get in more shit
Ay yo P', (what up) you my co-d, we both get knocked
What you did with that half'a tree? (right in my sock.)
Yo, I hope these fuckin' dicks won't find the stash spot
Dun, you know how I get down!?!
Yo I'm ready to bounce
Do the 100 yard-dash and tear ass
If my other half was alive we woulda got killt
?'Cause dun woulda went for the guns and got ill
Plus I gots cracks on me, they foundt the cracks on me
Looked at'em, gave'em back to me
I could swore they was takin' us in
Then the lady in the car said, ?..that's not them.?
Picked us up, told me I could keep the drugs
They didn't give a fuck, they was only lookin' for guns
An' you ain't gotta tell us twice
We hopped in the car and slid off
On our way up-town for more of that funk
P' lit the tree back up
Got off the Tri-burrough, hit the Henry Huds'
?Fuckit, let's slide through the Rutgers.?
Roll the windows down 'cause infamous mobb bumpers...
(Prodigy)
... Skip To My Lou had the crowd jumpin'
Took a walk through the park frontin'
Didn't even have to hurt nuttin'
Man I love it, ain't nothin' like summer in New York
Hear Infamous Thoughts, then the Dream Team music starts
Damn, we young black entrepreneurs
New York Pricks and Dicks can't stop our floss
We like organized crime, the fuckin' Mobb
I'm only twenty-six playin' wit' serious cards
Dead serious cash, luxurious labs
Learn to balance fame with pain, you CAN'T COMPLAIN
(Chinky sings X)
Jus' another day livin' in the hood...
Jus' another day around the way...
Feelin' good today... oh no we can't complain
Jus' another day... livin' in New York...
Dealin' with the jakes and the snakes...
Feelin' good today... we hit'em up 'cause we here to stay..."

Just look at my face; do I look like I'm playing with you?
Listen to my verse; Do it sound like I'm a scared fool? NO!

You see me in the street it's the same way I act
It's not movie dawg, it's a reality show
So that'll be real good when that cali-coat blow

Welcome to the life of V.I.P

There's niggas being killed; bitches being fucked
There's drugs being sold; our money getting up

The blood's everywhere, but most of 'em is fake one's
I load up the .9, trying to get payload
I take everything from you shoes to your Kangol
You gotta give it up or get your arm chopped off
Niggas know my name - Big Twinz pop off
The fiends know wassup, I'm the one to cop off
I'm not soft, Infamous fire like hot-sauce
Get a load of real shit, the hemi go bang
The swami go rang, in the shoot and range
So I could perfect my aim
Stick you like a dope needle how a nigga aim
Sharp-shooter, top shotta, top fire rapper
Voted most likely to knock back up...
I pick the ratch[et] up and cap you up
Night or day it don't matter
The skateboarder, surfboarder, snowboarder
Understand P you see 'cause he's sorta...
The best stuff on Earth
And if you come up with your bitch to put the cuff on first
'Cause I'm a animal pimp, I get up on a female
And tell her things she likes, she give me that tail
And I call heads, but I was all wrong dawg, a sex is the best

Promoters get scared and put on the lights for the house
Dun we just tryin' to have fun
Go at the ladies and possibly get in the jump
You crazy
You get blown open son
You tried to stop that flow on a big showboat and got cut the most
While your dogs afloat
Me and mines keep partyin and sparkin dope
Its simple
P is not to be fucked with
Put your thugs up put your guns up and shit
If y'all niggas want to get at P
Do it
You got problems you want it with me
Come on
If you gangstas, gangbangers, thugs what
Do it do it come on do it
If the ladies want to holla at P
Do it
Gettin' hot you want to slide with me
Come on
For my mamis honeys big body bunnies
Come on come on do it"
11,Field Marshal P,2008,H.N.I.C. Pt. 2 (2008),,Prodigy,"(Feat. Un Pacino)
(Talking: Prodigy)
Yeah, that's right, of course
Uh, uh
Yeah, ayo, uh-huh
(Chorus: Prodigy)
Field Marshal P
Soldier you step inside my room solute (solute)
At attention, pay attention
When P say something it's the truth
The Universe is my witness (uh-huh)
It's all what these demon cops tried to do
It's all our leaders that got hit
It's all the shooting that hit our leaders too
Nigga I'm a vet, on the streets I'm a King
Push it to the maximum when I do my thang
My words will shock you, my songs will scare you
You fit to die real soon, let me prepare you
For that rectangle box, you deserve to die, you dirty lil fuck
You ungrateful, un-loyal, I'll have my nigga Un take care of you
Or my nigga Fox, you just light work, real simple
I'll pick up the pistol and hit up your temple
Demolish your rental, you cheap fuck, bury 'em in his cheap suit
Ashes to dust, you're not a revolutionary, you're a punk
You're not a rebel soldier; just leave it up to us
I'm a insurgent, I put work in, check my card, listen to my verses
(Chorus: Prodigy)
Nigga I'm a pro, in the rap world I'm a god
I only hear the facts; I'm death to your garbage
I only spit the rap, if the shit's real
I only lie to the police on the real
New York Pricks and Dicks (NYPD) know the deal
They wanna do the kid like my nigga Sean Bell
Fuck that, it be a racist cop buried there
With the bagpipe music, I'll burn another L
To amazing grace, what a perfect song
Was blind but now you see us, it's not a game at all
Y'all some slimy snakes, bunch of reptile cops
The government and military all corrupt
I ain't on that shade the world shit
I'm a share my experiences, been through hell and back
Now I'm right back in hell, dunn I'll be right back
Yeah, but in the meanwhile...
(Chorus: Prodigy)
Cops said a nigga tried to get you a charge
Get cameras, 'cause they might plan some shit in your car
But yet the god just talking the fact he got lips
They gave 'em 42 months; he got bagged with that grip
Word is bond, I was just right there
I've seen the judge's face, military mind
I preached to nigga ""fuck jakes""
The Hip-Hop could suck my dick
Down right they trying to hate on us, destruct our clique
Big Joe was in the Garden the night of Sean Bell death
Had plans to kill a nigga the minute Sean Bell left
Trying to slant the victim's characters for wrong judan
Niggas scared to hang around me like ""what's wrong with Un? ""
But fuck 'em, nigga down to take bullets when we were leaving
And we don't get mad we get even
Before you violate my rights and start looking
Shit is candid in the car you're searching, I got footage
(Chorus: Prodigy)"
12,Gangsta Love,2012,H.N.I.C. 3 (2012),,Prodigy,"Baby you the type love only come around once
Babe girl you my world, you my soul,
Blood in my flesh, you ain't never gotta stress
Relax, I ain't never gonna leave you or mislead you
Cross my heart hope to die, with needles in my eyes
God created us for each other
We tougher than all the others,
We the best, you and I, competition
Nah, we got them by a land slide
Up in the G5, drunk off of love,
Swerving, got the plane ribbons in the sky
I never thought I, would come home from jail
And fall in love with baby girl
Look, fuck what you heard, look think of all
While we laughing so hard, we might piss our past
Look, the echelon that we on is beyond anything they dream
You the queen of hearts and I'm the king
Oh, you're gonna say some shit
Like he's not the one for me
When everynight he's here for me
I won't let him down, I won't never, never leave his sight
He's my angel, my whole
He's my gangsta loving, he's my gangsta loving
He's my gangsta lover, a gangsta lover, lover, lover
When I first met you, I ain't digging you'll want me
My lifestyle too hood, my music too
That New York bullshit yeah, I'll be on it
Ice cold blood, some say I'm black hearted
But you sorta guarded me, show me what a real love is
In a true romance
I would never leave you, you give me so much strength
I need you to live, and would much rather die
Than to be without you
I'm so attached to you, can't breathe without you
When people try to break us up, you're not caring
You turn they volume down cause you ain't tryina to hear it
They can't tell a thing about you baby
Look, the echelon that we on is beyond anything they wildest dreams
You the queen of hearts and I'm the king
Baby, you're the one I wanna love, the one I wanna trust
The one I wanna kiss, the one I wanna touch
And now, I only, through the haters baby
'Cause they put a G just to lie, I bet you keep g'd on me
Make me feel like I'm the only one, that you ever love
But you are, ever love,
He's my gangsta loving, he's my gangsta loving
He's my gangsta lover, a gangsta lover, lover, lover
Oh, you're gonna say some shit
Like he's not the one for me
When everynight he's here for me
I won't let him down, I won't never, never leave his sight
He's my angel, my whole
He's my gangsta loving, he's my gangsta loving
He's my gangsta lover, a gangsta lover, lover, lover"

It's real... check it out tho'
Respect the I-M-D
Fresh out the car in the R-A-double-P, E-R
P-E-double, when I speak it gets real
Flakes try to tell me, ""Yo Dunn, nah chill
You can't come out, wylin out like that
Rhymes so vivid Dunn I see what you sayin""
But you gotta understand how I feel
The pain and the hardship it took to build
Years of frustration, some got killed
Others fell vic' to the gates of steel
Most try to instill sanity still
Stuck on this rock where we don't belong
I wanna go home not sing this song
But I'm forced to perform speech napalm
Calm, surrounded by all types of harm
Dogg man fuck your screwface I watch hands
Watch your hands nigga, I see that, word up...
Word up, peep y'all cats movements
Laid back in the cut like what?
Pay attention... check it out Dunn
I'm bein watched by snake eyes
Peep them shed skin plenty times
Surrounded by crash dummies and empty minds
Get your shit together Dunn, see between the lines
Stay awoke, to the ways of the wickedest kind
Infamous - cause of the way, I write rhymes
Plus my story's more foul than your newborn eatin swine
(Stupid) Catch a seat, it's about to get deep
Like squeezin flouride on your brush for your teeth
Or, takin' your seed to get shots every week
We need to pay more attention to our surroundings
Busy wildin, all for the wrong cause
Put that same strength into somethin' that'll pay off
Don't forget your soul's involved
That same energy you put out, comes right back it revolves
I smash you, Dunn only if I have to
I would hate to, but I'll be more than glad to
The positive and negative war has now begun
P helps you separate both the sides
Let the truth arise, black devil don't hide
You can't hide from me, you might from the others
I've been employed to pull your ass out from the covers
You walk like you got hooves and talk like you 'sposed to
Trickin my brothers into followin you? Yo
Potential energy is easily made kinetic
I turn 'em all back where they belong, don't wet it
What? Set it...
Set it nigga, fuckin' fake-ass motherfuckers

Ya niggaz know my handle, talkin' like you straight thug
Dunn, I catch you while you shoppin' for kicks
Suprise bitch, shoot outs is spontaneous and, oh
From now on, call me Columbo
'Cause I come through wrinkled up, think I give a fuck?
Look at my chain, look at my anklet
But are you listenin to the words man? My shit bang kid
Nigga I run this shit, I set the trend, you get the dick
That's basically it
These rap niggaz think I'm talkin' 'bout them, nigga please
You ain't in my league, jus' follow my lead
I be the H.N.I.C.

But all's fair in love and war it's whatcha hand called for
Now ya man's wanna ride for your cause
But fuck it, they could get it too, simple as you
And I be God-damned if they put they hands on me
Money brings power and puts guns in parties
Sends niggaz on Amtrak with those for your body
It pays for thirty plane tickets if we got beef, huh
Hardly, you all know what that is
I grew up in the hoods and the projects wit dope fiends and crack heads
Teenage killers with Mack-10s
Best friends cut each other's throat and twist they own fan backwards
Maybe that'd live now I'm on some rap shit
Album sold out keeps me far from the big house
The hand guns from that bigger house
'Cause ain't nobody cuttin' for me to enforce to hold it down like

16,I Want Out,2008,H.N.I.C. Pt. 2 (2008),,Prodigy,"I was just tellin', ""Have these youngin's is over wildin'?""
Two shootin's in two days and none of it over dollars
Have my mind zoned, somewhere in a different time zone
Y'all can stand under building, I'm tryin' to buy homes
But I ponder it gradually grab me back
You can put me anywhere in the world and I'll adapt
(Look)
I'm tired of flyin' to label reps
Ike my niggas all ready to eat the table's set
I'm tired of corner standing, piffin' the same exit
Keep it real, I want hills my ninja, change settings
I want a backyard where pookie can play
I don't care if it cost my life nigga shoot me today
Remember going to the store, momma told me to keep the change
I wanna jump in something new, tell my momma to keep the range
My man got shot I had to peddle him home
He couldn't take the pain and caught a heroin Jones
This is it I want out
This usually part of the movie where the pistol comes out
Like I said I need change
I need a whole lot of this money and little bit of fame
It's like a ghetto tell tales
I'm tired of camouflagin' the corner let me get the next sale
I'm really tryin' to prosper of a good good rap
Before I leave out the hood, I take a good look back
They say, what don't kill you will kid, it'll only make you stronger
And the wrong mistake is a half dead ass doing the coroner
Heavenly father I'm lookin' into the heavens
My girl think I'm going crazy, this nigga going 7th
These days you know the hammer under the pillow
Got a mansion left from the ghetto I'm trapped in the middle
So niggas laid flat like soda without the fizzle
When it rained it poured be lucky it only drizzled
Took my homie under my 'brella I took him in
He bit me turned around and told me that's how a snake wins
The world we livin' in can't trust a homie far as I can shoot a nigga
Leave me the shit get lonely, homie
Don't speak my name if you don't know me
Most important you black the bitches dat shits is corny
Out ya rabid ass mind tryin' to run up on me
Don't make have to shoot you with the 40
Yo, Thunn, I be right back, yeah, hold it down G's
While I'm gone get me songs all over the streets
That's what you call awareness, these niggas put they lil' albums out
But nobody cares, it's P time to shine
Get dat shit the fuck outta here I satisfy the custi's
My history at retail is outstanding
My CD got wings 'cause it flies off the shelves
While I'm stuck in the bing for the next 80 days
Fuck it I got years it can't get no worse than it already is
I spoke to my nigga, yayo, the other day
He told me everybody bumpin' H.N.I.C., part 2
And on the youtube, I'm killin' 'em out there, crazy views
I make a rapper run for his life and drop a gem
This nigga threw his watch so we would stop chasin' him
He lucky I was on trial, I woulda stabbed him
He was saw from every angle all them cameras
Fuck it, I still won, still undefeated
This nigga tryin' to act like he did something, beat it
You're not a gangsta, it's been proven
Nah, you just a snitch like Frank Lucas
Yous a false prophet out in the world
While a real nigga like me trapped in a cell"

Oh, yo, oh shit man, what up dunn?
Yo where've you been at man?
Yo we need you man
You gotta put out that knowledge
Kick that street knowledge G
Please man, you got that drugs
I need my fix of that dope
C'mon man, please man, you got it man, c'mon man
Now the latest gun drive, jelly beans
GMT peyote, I know you feel me
P's song is a natural tripping me
My rhymes is so vivid, you start to see things
Way different, America's fake
I was fast asleep, but now I'm wid awake
I was under the spell of Kangol and reserved notes
Religion and fashion, I used to be flashy
Till I had a total recall, forgot what I've already knew
It took me 33 years for me to see the truth
Ever so clear I was too young
I couldn't articulate myself the right way son
But now let me break it down, pass it all around
This is not a theory, the conspiracy is real
They wanna put me in a straightjacket in a padded room
And tell the world is 12 monkeys so they can be confused
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Secret Society trying to keep their eye on me
But I'm a stay incogni' in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically
They say life is like Chess
But fuck that I'm tired of playing games with you kids
Ain't no time for playing, check the rhymes it's insane
I write it for the streets, for the hood inspiration
Inspire every party to map where it's poverty
I started with a Mobb but now I got an army
With soldiers and troopers
The TV and the radio scared the death of us
So we hit the YouTube up
Now I got millions of views
Now watch how many rappers follow what P do
Now I'm too hoody to conform to the program
I'm too much of a rebel for me to try to fit in
Nigga! It don't matter on the color of your skin
Right now you either positive or you negative
I got friends in high places, multiple races
And coaches on my side, all you got is paper"

Yeah old school part one feel it
The realest, Who be the realest
Them niggaz stay
Infamous minded
U've been blinded
Cut on your face
Fucking with these mobb giants
They are the victims
We be the victors
Sometime a nigga gotta step up
And bring war, Spray ks
And go out in a blaze
Young guns learn to duck
So they won't catch strays
Wont shoot to be frontin'
Or to waste shots for nothin'
If I'm pulling out my torch
I'm gonn hit somethin', Whatever
Slugs through your avirex leather
I close one lid
So I could aim a little better
I stop firing
And de-cock the hammer
You need triads
I need to get up outta here
Don't really think It's cool to let another man
(Havoc)
""Let me buck that nigga son""
(Prodigy)
I hold my own cannon and shoot just as fast
Move with select few
Don't fuck with lil dude
Or little pistols
Strictly the big Ru's
Cause deuce-deuce its only good for hiding
I need big firepower when I'm riding
52 shot clips
You pop lips, Silence
And I don't stop dumping till I hear sirens
I'm not a boyz 'n' the hood addict
Menace fanatic
I live the street life for real
So I can brag it
Pop gave me gun lesson back when I was a kid
Now I fire more arms than he ever did
That's why
I keep things in proper prospective
And every album point y'all niggas in the right direction
There's no protection, when I'm on the mike
You couldn't fold me
If you trained all your life
You's a chump, I'm a champ
You broke, I'm top dollar
Niggaz gotta whole lotta mouth
That's no problem
Fake thugs lay down
Real killers don't yell it
Bring it don't sing it nigga
Use intelligence
Its evident you not, murder material
When you all alone, you pose guns in the mirror yo
Chinky, Rapper Noyd, Hav, G part 3, my nigga Bino and Nitty
Y'all feel me
Let me get deeper in the subject
Cause its gets me hard
Every nigga holding
Don't mean he gonn arc
Any nigga that show it
Need to disown it
Or get it tooken by another who deserve it
Listen, this is what it takes to survive today
Use your eyes, to my niggaz that's ride with me
And you see that nigga P, be the storm quiet
I'm holding, so ease back
I stay infamous minded

Catch you comin' out your fuckin' crib nigga

Ayo, I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
Peel on the Ducatis and other four wheels
Write a book full of medicine and generate mills
Tour the album, only for more sales
We used to catch those on the block with crills
Now it's paid shows, promoters post up bills
Sign deals only if the math is real
If you can't match numbers then you can't have the Head Nigga In Charge
Of shit, live nigga rhymes artist
Pardon, P dub shines regardless
Remorseless, haunt niggas like poltergeists
My advice, 'fore you get like that, is think twice
'Fore you move on it, put jewels on it, who want it
Loose niggas make the news when we start formin'
Snatch stripes off a nigga's uniform often
Doin' it past yo' delf you way out your jurisdiction
Why niggas bullshit on the grill
I don't fuck around dunny, this move's real
I Keep It Thoro nigga
Yo let me back up for 'em, lemme back up, yo, yo
Why niggas bullshit on the grill
I don't fuck around dunny, this move's real
I gave birth to your whole style and feel
How do it feel, to hold my dick in public
Cock blower, duplicate rap cloner
It's me and you do it live on stage for dolo
I smack niggas like you, smash niggas by the tools
Grab niggas by the throat, show 'n' prove
Rhymes cocky, crazy ill, mad rowdy
Did a buck off of my shit and wrapped your outtie
Tempermental, I snap quick, very touchy
Ayo my attitude is all fucked up and real shitty
I rap like no one out there can fuck wit me
You feel different, niggas see me
I throw a TV at you crazy, bitches say P you crazy
A +Pain in Da Ass+, nah but +Fuck you, Pay me+
I'm no shorty, nigga I stop your glory
I'm a thorough street nigga for real, you just applaud me
Avoid P, man take your baby mom's advice
I'm nothing sweet, ill with the guns, you pay the price
When you see me in the streets soldier, salute me
You just a groupie, oh you gangsta, then shoot me
Who gives a fuck really, I miss my nigga Twin, kill me
So I can join the rest of my falls, up in the heavens
You rap niggas make me laugh, y'all crazy ass
And I don't give a fuck what you sold, that shit is trash
Bang this, 'cause I guarantee that you bought it
Heavy airplay all day wit no chorus

All we go through is hell, what the fuck is a heaven? (fuck is the heaven?!)
We live fast and store death long as possible (that's right!)
Get our cash and put threats in the hospital. [x2]
Young P! - When I was thirteen I had dreams
To do what LL did and Run DMC!
Dirty ol' fuck! - Learnin' how to aim my pee
Older niggaz in the hood use to try to thug me.
Till Pops gave me a knife, told me to handle my thangs
And if not, when I came back - he would handle me.
I put my first 'lil bit of fear into niggaz I was gas
Started hangin' with the others that was on the same shit. (whattup dog?)
Had my first taste of gun fire early in my years
Gang fights, we was jumpin' niggaz, we was just kids.
Takin' coats off victims, watches off people's wrist
Shootin' in the air (pop, pop!) part of tryin' to aimin' for your head.
And us young bloods and 'lil young gunz from back then

Be careful where you pull that trigger, they got you on film
They got eyes in the sky, we under surveillance

Gotta watch what I say, they tappin' my cell phone
They wanna sneak and peak inside of my home
I'm paranoid and it's not the weed
In my rear view mirror these cars, they follow me
So I bust rights and lefts, lefts and rights
Till I stop seeing those Impala headlights
Then I circle my block to make sure it's smooth

You seem to be the type I could love for life.
I'm tryna found out for myself
See if I'm right baby
You're killin' 'em close
You'd be dressing your ass off
Hair and your nails looking fresh from salon
You ain't got to be on TV or magazines
From my POV (point of view), you're a star to me.
Can I, may I get your autograph
Or perhaps you could put your number under your name
And give the young man a chance to prove you
Worth a young woman such as yourself.
If I'm deserved it?
Oh, girl
Aren't you the baby I can't get enough of?
You my angel, yeah
Thug angel!
Oh girl, oh
I can't get enough of you
Come here baby (I need you), yeah.

There goes my baby, my lady, my heart beat
She the blur circulating
Do my thing, she the torch in my brain
It go lavish trap for so long to obtain
'Cause yo dope, she mine
If I want her kit, got to treat her everyday as if
We just met, and she treat me the same
Smile on her face when I walk
Inside the room, nothing else matters.
Everyday silouhettes, the only living colors
Is me and my bitch.
Come here, give me kiss and your real hug too
They jealous, they tell us to get a room
But everyways I'm loveless, and I swear
We could make love right here.
Get my soft candy, I unwrap you
And then pop it in, the flavour everlasting.
Oh, girl
Aren't you the baby I can't get enough of?
You my angel, yeah

She not into all of that, she ain't into all of this
I think we found the rest
And growing all together is in our future,
Love chow, waw, orgy, gorgeous
Flawless
She's all that I'm wanting when I'm boring
To my thugs, when we hang out in the clubs
'Cause I turned down all thet upper brothers
But, to her I'm the best thing
Since sex is been here
She cry when I'm in it, 'cause
It feels so good, like ball beauty
I doubt that you ever found another like mine
And I'll never ours.
So if we split, then we both had a loss
You're my soft candy, I unwrap you
And then pop it in, the flavour long lasting.

Niggaz filthy, I am really to things that I rap
You just a custy trust me
You won't want that,

Using gang glass joy, I wish I didn't kill
All r.ap. grand wizard on the sixteen
They spit like 47 and 50 cows I bang
I shine, illuminate
Get my aura, is awsome
Illuminati is us, we are the origin
Of all inlighting
This pirates stole our shit
So, now you know.
Skulls and bones.

Scare the pussy a lot

Great white colors
All the whites cuts you

Skull and bones

I'm cooked like the coke up
Boy it will over scorch you,
Be a soldier on your frontline
I'm wicked with the rapping
The sickest nigga on the drop
To bitches I'm attractive
I make that pussy holla
I'm good with shit man
Listen to the shit I say
It's perignon you dog, I pop like the bubbely
When I was doing bad, you people was all laughs
Assholes, jock off, kiss my whole ass
Mobocracy, live by mob rules
If niggas don't humble, they self re eat food
Who possibly, could stop me, I ask
Perhaps nigga not knowing I be going ham
Mob deep coming, put your woman in the stash
In delict, whenever I speak it's straight cash
Hustle harder, go harder I mash
450k I made on the gas
They call me big time, big beats
Big raps, I get big chicks
Little rappers, they get stepped on
They dreams get crushed, I'm not to be slept on
I'm not to be slept on
Keep dreaming, I'm not to be slept on
450 killer me is on the gas
Got bad ass bonnie, shot gun on my left
Feeling like Bonnie and Clyde
Mallory and Mickey, she giving nigga top
Like she tryna giving hicky
She handing me the pussy like she handing me the blicky
Right before you curled up, on you curb sticky
And it's cl floated on smooth like the frisby
Man, what y'all niggas wanna do, you can't really
The boys get up but the land get bizy
In the mix empire state boys
Bright lights, dark streets, welcome to my city
The capital of passion girl we get spiffy
Mob hats counting money like the machine
Niggas start shit will resort to heavy metal
450kilometers on a pedal
They wanna catch me slip I move too fast
Internat P, check the numbers on the dash
They call me big time, big beats
Big raps, I get big chicks
Little rappers, they get stepped on
They dreams get crushed, I'm not to be slept on
I'm not to be slept on
Keep dreaming, I'm not to be slept on."

Hennessy liquor, some weed and a ciga'
Ain't shit changed but the diamonds got bigga'
Watch Mucho Frio, somethin' like a blizzard
It's summertime it's hot, and you ain't got no Freeon
I'm in the Bentley drop; to me you're a peon
You got neon lights underneath your Nissan
I got LeAnn Rimes passin' me the weed son
Doin' ten miles per hour through New York
Just ridin', bumpin' my new one
You act like I'm not that, nigga that pop that
Rounds at your top hat, Blazers and Slacks
Fuck up your suit, send a couple of troops
That'll go find your friends and get them to you
Know the name; niggaz call me Bandana
They wanna write me off, but my songs is bangers
Bitch +Stop Fronting+, you open off my chain
Open off my watch, open off my Range
Nigga you fronting, you wide open off P
Off the words I wrote to the beats. [x2]
Ayo, they talk shit behind my back, smile at my face
They wanna hear what I hear and see what I see
P; the God MC, I got a bottomless pit
Sixteen, that's how I keep dropin' new shit
This radio station, rotation, nigga I just made this
I'm impatient, put my shit out now, shut that other shit down
This the Mixtape, imagine how the album'll sound?
I'm on tour with Mobb Deep, we out in Japan
Australia and then we doin' Madison Square
Then it's right back on the road with 50 and EM
Rappers upset we last more longer than them,
At the club we gon' pop your lady if she's hot?
She see we on the top, now she starrin' at my rocks
I get in her box, and beat it up to socks
I mean fuck her brains out, till she scream ""Please stop"" - C'mon!"

And I ain't neva let you go, let you go
What time is it?, dawgs sit righ here
Put the kids to bed - tell y'all story
And I ain't neva gon' leave you alone, leave you alone
First worry about my money, you know what..?
It's a cash explosion, it's rainin' dollars
We made it to stardom, the new album
The 50-50 joint ventures, it only gets better and better
Might treat myself to a nice Ferrari for the winter
Gave my whole crib up, Do NOT ENTER!
'Cause the nigga inside with the shotty got a temper
And I play it by the book, man; I thought he was a burglar
I'm gettin' off 'cause I served her
You wastin' that broad with that shit they want
More money than any dope man could eva see
Man, S and Bar ain't got shit on P
I'm like Trav and John, 'cause I M D
And I do surgery on the nigga for free
When it come to that Tae Bo, we gettin' box load
I pop a nigga over my money, man all I know 'em
(Chorus Sample: performed by Jeannie Reynolds)
""I'm stuck to you - just like glue""
""I love it, I love it, I swear I do, ah baby""
Yeah that's how that one go you'nah'what'I'mean?
(Live that money right?)
And I ain't neva let you go, let you go, (No doubt)
And who gon' love the paper man? You gotta love the paper
If you got that much paper you gotta hold it down
And I ain't neva gon' leave you alone, leave you alone
So the next one, you know what that's about, (That's right)
My bestest friend, my worstest enemy (That's right)
Y'all could even save my life or be the death of me
Even get me outta drama, or put me in a locker
Y'all gon' have me wind up in that chair with the tires
Stab a nigga like Myers
But I'd rather put fire to your ass like Pryor (Damn!)
'Cause I prefer the iron
Shoot at bitch ass niggaz and do 'em like Bison
I got big jump-off that fit down my pants leg
'Lil jump-offs, your dunn know
A damn thang, niggaz talkin' thug on their song on the radio
But we the reason they fire proofed the Coupes
And we the same reason you brinin' re-enforcements through
You'll neva get me alive my gun is like glue (Come wit it, come wit it)
Shots spread like the flu, do you lungs, do your peoples
I love my heaters, I'm...
(Chorus Sample: performed by Jeannie Reynolds)
Yeah, you motha'fuckin' right man, them hammers man, them guns man
And I ain't neva let you go, let you go
Gotta keep them thangs on you, what you know about that though?
But you know there's one thing a nigga can't live without
And I ain't neva gon' leave you alone, leave you alone
And it's the bottom line right here
You know we like; phatties with size, 'lil cutie pies
With the nightstands walk and bodies that talk
Make niggaz dig deep until they barrel the game
And pull out somethin' that'll definitely gettin' to her brain (Word)
With the perm or the braids (Whatup)
It's all love as long as it curves and it's in right space (It's all good)
With a face that deserves the front page
I got the keys that'll free all birds from their cage (Let's go)
I get pussy like James, its nuttin' to point
Y'all niggaz takin' too long to get to the point (Fo' real)
Y'all chicks makin' me sick, you lookin' so good bitch (God damn)
I gotta have you, enough I can't stop it
Gangsta love, you pretty and thug
She's like the hood nigga only if he's bustin' his gun
Mama you go girl, you keep right on, doin' what you doin'
Keepin' niggaz off
(Chorus Sample: performed by Jeannie Reynolds)
""I'm stuck to you - just like glue""
""I love it, I love it, I swear I do, eww baby""
And I ain't neva let you go, let you go
And I ain't neva gon' leave you alone, leave you alone
And I ain't neva let you go, let you go
And I ain't neva gon' leave you alone, leave you alone

Ok we gotta battle the .9 millimeter heavy duty pistols
West has the carbon 15 .9 millimeter pistol
And I got a mac-10 from Invasion USA
We're gonna have a 'lil race, you read? (Yep)
Ok, bottom two, here we go: .9 millimeter fired, then the mac-10

Do it one more time for these niggaz man
It's another one
Uh-huh, ayo
Everybody hit the floor, its fuckin' goin' down
Manny's better know the time, niggaz better hold it down
This is the big one, you only get once
Do it right, do it right now and do it to his dunn
Ha, I'll show you about power, money and respect
Whether you're a coward, broke with no strength
Ten G's outta of the bank, we gon' do it up
Ten G's off the street, till that make it dub
On the bub in the brown water, in the bud
Lose this; lose that, yep we feelin' good
Put the pedal to the metal, we take it to the Mac
To the tippy top wit a diddy bop like the Mac
Too heavy in my pants, take a glance, take a flick
At the man with the hundred million dollars rap, bitch
Bet I murder that, bury that, you ain't gotta worry that
My dawgs smell purrty cat, we attack, where they at?
I got a pocket full of drugs and I'm ready to roll
I got the pocket size nine and it's ready to blow
You get your choice 'fore the best shawty up in the spot
You get the grand prize when I get you back at the spot
I'ma certified best when it comes to rap
I'm the best, God bless you and all your friends
'Cause I'm on some bullshit and I'm ready to flip
A nigga try to punk me, I'ma bang on him
'Cause I'ma take it to the top
Ready, throw your hand up, niggaz better man up
Shawty back her ass up, tonight she's gettin' stabbed up
On a hush, she lust for the thrust
They love it when you kill it, I love you till I bust
Get a rush off the Dutch, with the ducks in the kush
That turn people crazy, your shit don't faze me
I'm maybe a 'lil loco
But that's basically natural for me to not give a fuck about you
I doubt you, had different colours leakin' out you
Like red, yellow and white, you got some stomach on your NIKES
I got blood on my G-Unit's, I had to do it
The nigga kept talkin' and talkin' I had to shoot 'em
You send 'em I dead 'em, caught 'em and bagged 'em
And take 'em to the mall, that's where they toe tag 'em
Tryin' to stop my party? Party don't stop (Nope)
We handle you that real fast...
Through the Queens, through the Brooklyn, through the Bronx
Through the Mount Vernon, through the Yonkers, through the Long Island
Through the Staten Island, through the Manhattan
Got the stage trapped, I dance when I'm real bent
(Only when I'm drunk) I'm schemin', you can't catch me sleepin'
(I see you niggaz) Nah nigga I take it to the top (What?)

Aiight before I get started spark up the Laurelton
Light up the night up, now let's get it going
To the mothafucking top, I don't mothafucking stop
Till we find life out there and setup shop
Party rocking, bottles popping at Henny and Mo'
It's like 500 bitches now we're having a bowl
Got a gun, screwdriver, a knife, and a shank
Plus I break face bones with my platinum rings
It's a ghetto love story I'm in love with life
Of the rich and Infamous, Ferrari's and Ice
Lamborghini bikes, they ain't make those yet
I'm still waiting for that 700 Benz
I do it for my niggas in the dead and in the pens
Just when you think this shit's over
That's when this shit begins
This the Bronx, this Harlem, Brooklyn and Queens
That 'New York State of Mind' where you're popping 'em thangs

The beef don't seize
The money keep coming

Killa, killa, the killer
From Queens goddammit

Put your body on that asphalt, fucking asshole
Come to the hood and you ain't got no passport?
He couldn't get his gun out the stash fast enough
So that nigga got his ass blasted up
Keep the Hennessy coming, and we keep lighting up
Nigga I stay sedated, that's right we're not cut
From the same cloth, you're chin-chilla soft
I'm brilla-pack cost, I'll take your skin off
You *edit* --- rub me the wrong way
You're a suit and tie nigga, P hoody all day
Tattoos and jewels - Mister Cartoon
And Gabriel in the district, get all my loot
I'm addicted to looking fresh
I'm super fly, got a bad habits for hammers
I'm in love with .9s

To fuck someone up, what nigga? I make it hot
Police be up on the block, 'cause P just shot
Some stupid fucka, now you niggaz can't pump, ol' mad at me
Should be mad at that nigga whose tryna crab me
You know I ain't the one if you didn't you know now
These niggaz be slow, till I blow the four pound
And put a 'lil pep in their step
I got death for any nigga wit 'S' on their chest
That's my reflexes, when you hear them shots
See if I gave it to a nigga he deserves what he got
Look my hammer got the cure for your amnesia
How conveniently we forget, P is Black Caesar
And Hell over in Queens that swell up in my jeans
Don't mean I'm happy to see you, that mean I got the thang
Look here nigga!, I rap what I live, you makin' up shit
Old type of scenarios this how it really goes
In real life you're a puss', neva pull no jukes
Neva pull no trigger and let the blood gush

Spillin it on the floor for our dead people
While I spark the sequel

I spoke to Flex he said he's gonna let both of us in

Mad deep
Jumpin' out the cocaine white Jeep

Ain't I that same nigga we was both on the train goin' hard
And then your shit surfaced
Takin' the phone in the bathroom, whisperin wit your girlfriends
Try to play me on some jerk shit
Numbers underneath the sole of your lady Timb's
... Ooh shit!

Kid, I kept it tight for you
Turned nigga's down, didn't go out all them nights for you

You skim 20's out of my stacks of Benny's

Got hoes callin the crib, hangin' up not speakin'
Come on, what type of shit is that?
What, I'm sposed to sit back, stay up all night for you to get back?

Memories play back like film
I flash back we was little niggas livin' most real
1989's when we first met
We first clicked over convo' gettin' twisted
In dunn grand earth crib cuttin' outta school
Watchin cable it seemed like the other day
Through the eyes of a stranger we was kids
But in our own minds we was grown mens
Outside on the block we would play the bench
And y'all play the rock every chance y'all got
As I sat back and just watched hey, what can I say?
The same back then as I am today
I can recall me, Jemel and Jamal
In the room drinkin' straight vodka with they moms
When I walk home with the big nefertiti charm
Back with the light blue camoflauge suit
God me and Hav' doin' it hard, tryin' to get on
We sampled songs on the box with record and pause
Killer B didn't even get his first firearm
And I was still holdin' one shot derringers
(Hook: Prodigy)
Who would think anyone of us would cease to exist
Left with just thoughts of the past to reminisce
Sometimes I see a chick walkin' past with ya kids
Or find an old flicka of some 1-2-5th
All the shit that we been through it boils to this?
Dun, I wish we could start it all over again
(Prodigy)
Ninety-five, we on top tourin the states
A lotta times we even took the click overseas
Came along way from the hallway
Sitting in the staircase with Bacardi
Bring the honeycomb speaker outside to bang
While we would share drinks with the other that came
Triple L stayed takin' they cash in dice games
Killer Black grew to keep an ice grill, dunn was not playin'
Yammy, the most Infamous told me one day
""Put the bogies down 'fore I pound you out P""
But it was all love, we was eash others dunns
We held each other down, borrowed each other guns
Its hard to believe that niggas so strong
Could die so easily forever be gone
I could still feel the web of your palm, against mine
'Cause we did our hand shake all the time
Why it have to be your time to go and not mines?
Spilled tears contemplating to my delf cryin
All the laughs we shared and fights we had
All the nights we would get nice, damn
Plates of food we split in half
I dedicate the rest of my life to all my niggas that passed

Too much and he's back at it again
Like the Scarface Twinz
I seen this nigga cut a nigga up so bad I had to stop looking
(Chorus x2: Prodigy)
I miss the dead, I wish the dead
Oh please come back, I need ya help
And everybody that got somebody deceased
I know you feel the same
The spirit gon' live through me
Listen, I light a candle on your death and birthday
Lord have mercy it seems you cursed me with a life of pain
All I do is strain, everyday is a struggle, everyday it rain
Even when the sun's shining, they say that's when God's crying
Dark clouds hanging over my head made lightning
Strike me down if I'm lying
I miss my pops; all I got is lonely tear drops
And memories of him teaching me to hurt people with my bare hands
And how to shoot people
I remember me and him stuck a jewelry store
He did the sticking; I was in the get-a-way car
Pops came out with a big bag full of jewelry
We had a high speed chase with Nassau County
I was eight years old, my pops was drama
They locked him and sent me home to mama
(Chorus x2: Prodigy)
Thinking back it was me and (E)-Moneybags up in Champion Motor
I was Ferrari dreaming, E copped the Navigator
On the way there and back, he told me about the jukes
Him and Troy took the niggas for their shine and had 'em shook
And how he killed Black Just but he meant to hit Preme
Shot up the nigga Rovo over by the Coliseum
I remember laying up fucked up in the hospital
Troy and Bags would visit; Troy had Sickle-cell
Me and him use to kick it and Bag's baby moms died giving birth
'Cause of Sickle-cell problems
And Shamik from LeFrak would bring me Red Lobster
I never knew they was coming, they would just pop up
My niggas; you stunt on us, we shoot people
Straight like that, no half step, I eat you
Alive with this .4/5 mag-num
Stay on your toes 'cause we toe-tagging 'em

Wanna be thugs, flashin jewels get ganked

Yo I seen all types be the victim of a kite
Be like, them silly fishes be the first one to bite yo
They see the cheese but they don't see the trap
Not a real live cat, but a real live rat
You got, broken guns, the first to run
First to leave, first to abandon your team
Yo you wonder who I'm talkin' about?
I'm standin right next to you ass, the one that you got in doubt
First to shout, to get you into some bullshit
Now you're all drownin, cause loose lips sink ships
Do you like Hav'? He be like, hell no
It works, cause you know, that the fuckin' truth hurts
I just, let niggaz bring 'em down in the day they cool
After six they throw on the nightgown
Loud sounds, expected after sundown
Man down, half crowns get shotdown and right now
(Prodigy)
Yo... aiyyo we leave niggaz with dry blood on they face
Put slugs where your bones at, break you off a taste
Shots of tequila, plenty Henny, we drinkin' heavy
Smokin' dust, Dunn I brought mez (?) tabs with me
And to my mamis on ecstasy
C'mon, we can bungee in the V.I.P.
We turn bitches out, take turns in that bitch mouth
Carve niggaz up, show niggaz what it's all about
It's us, the best of Queens, handguns to minks
Top fashion, we flash and bang
Niggaz think they Flash Gordon, we snatch the link
'Cause we mafioso and you the average dick
Kid, we send messages through bottles
Crash your face with the Mo, have glass all in your nostrils
And run through y'all niggaz like the shits
Kick niggaz with the boots, dukes we get biz, youse a"
43,What U Rep,2000,H.N.I.C. (2000),,Prodigy,"(Prodigy)
Wha, what the fuck yo? Fuck yo?
Is it real? Really? ...
Teach y'all niggaz how to rap yo
Show y'all niggaz how to expose a sound
(Noreaga)
Spit on these cats nigga, spit on these cats what, what?

Fuckin' dickblower... (thug like what?)
Yo (yo!) At ease! Back where you supposed to be
P put it back where it's supposed to be
Supposedly, niggaz comin' close to me
Trash rap niggaz can't fuck with the...
... Exulted, affluent life style I kick
Calm shit that make your livest rep wanna harm shit
Don't be alarmed when the guns bang (why?)
It's only natural for my dunns to hurt some-thang
Cop a squat though, you might learn some-thang
We givin' out back braces and arm slings
Reality rap, the only song I sing
Nuttin fugazi, strictly the real thing
Live in the flesh, my niggaz fresh out the pen
(When you see dem) When I see you dunn, new guns, money ain't a thing
(Money ain't a thing, nigga what, what?)
You could catch me in the clique, in the spot everyday
Nore guzzle the Crist', I down Chardonnay
Pardon me, 'fore you get knocked out the way
Everyday it's like a title fight take place (no doubt)
Aiyyo Nas - fuck that nigga just say? (What he say, huh?)
Aiyya Noyd, tell Manny P. to pass me the shank (shank nigga)
I think it's time to take 'em to the hood, let's play
Ese, I like it when it get that way
Chorus: Prodigy + (Noreaga)
So what you rep dunn?
(Iraq, where niggaz burst guns
And everybody on the block pump junk
So what you rep dunn?)
Dunn the infamous, Q.B. houses
Where niggaz stand out all night, and make thousands
What you rep?
(Iraq, where niggaz get buried
And we fight dirty, and stay hungry
So what you rep dunn?)
Q.B., we like to blow faces
And pop slugs in your illest nigga's rib cages
(Noreaga)
Aiyyo, yo
Stick it to you, black magic like voodoo
They can't fuck with us, 'cause y'all cats straight doo-doo
(You niggaz stink like shit)
I'm from Iraq, home of the snakes
Niggaz ain't got love for the jakes; do whatever it takes
Climbin down terraces, and the fire escapes
Yo we move money, money move me
Yo I'm usually, livin' it up (livin' it up nigga what?)
Gettin' my dick sucked
Bone a bitch in the butt, make her say what-what
(Prodigy)
Now gun talk, do you speak the same language?
For your sake, I hope so, let's rap a taste yo
My shit spit like a retard, and plus boss
I drool for the day me and you could face-off
It gets gangster, when my clique step in the room
We blow torches, and celebrate good fortune
This is for my dunns who rest in coffins
I wish y'all was, wish y'all was here
(Noreaga)
Yo what the deally P? Iraq, can buy out Q.B.
And you know we smash the industry, negatively
So fuck a good boy, I always been a foul hood boy
Yo as a youth I had ring-worms, and all that shit
A lil' dirt ball nigga, throwin' dirt at ya clique
Cause me an Aknel nigga ain't packed no bags
We rather, be in the streets, sellin yellow mesc' tabs
'Cause where we from, muh'fucker yo the game don't stops
Or we was, out thuggin' yo we had chicken-pox
Me Mus', Maze, Outlaw, +Final Chapter+ brigades
It definitely get real, on stage
I ain't the Madd Rapper, but I'm mad at rap niggaz
They're sellin records yo, actin' like they clap niggaz
Cause me and P. get money like L.S.G.
While them cats small change like a E.S.3.
Yo I'm still the same cat, that I used to be
Often, I'm on tour with my rosaries
Coastin, always hit 'em with the thug potion
Look at you now, now you just full emotion
Prankster height, my peoples like the gangster-type
Queens niggaz like to shoot, ain't afraid to fight
While y'all niggaz wear Pampers like the cradle type
Mainly hype, thugged-out, shined with light"
44,Without Rhyme Or Reason,2012,H.N.I.C. 3 (2012),,Prodigy,"If I start rambling, don't mind me,
I might get off track, but who doesn't it?
I love rap music, but I hate the fake light...
Usually calls the lord Weedy.
So, I choose not to take part in it
On that extra seat, and just I do what I do
I'ma write this writters
Sometimes I'm overthink.
It's not ... it's how remind myself
My clean activity flows best.
Nigga, I'm not concerned you tryna make hits,
It's all bullshit, if you ask me.
When you bend over just to go Platinum
No, thank you.
As I'd be as clearly
That I'm comfortable with myself.
And that's all that matters
I made the point in my life with.
I'm cool with exterming perks
I just roll my shit,
And I can show you how to live to the f-ckers.
But you got to follow me like Twitter
This is not the casino... it won't be sweet
Helo hard boulevard, not easy streets
Without Rhyme or Reason
I do what I love, I don't follow low sequence
(x4)
It feels so good to have my own staff,
This over rappers they try it
They might like it,
Spend so much time copying tunes.
They don't even know what it's like to be
Themselves.
Or is it that they don't like they sell.
Maybe you defend who do you ... doing
What ? None.
Or maybe they would love you more,
Two actually tried, they never resured.
I know, we act like potential and?
Reality is not so gorgeous
The ugly truth, that you ain't got the heart to face it
You would lie, sex, money, fool, music
I score points like a ... win trophy
Yes, that nigga... balled out, but
I'm really just having fun with you
Don't hate, you should be concerned with ours
Cause my life's awsome.
I'm all buried in stash food
I might take a little time off
I'm out at tropics
Sending emails, drinks, laughing
Getting tanned.
Without Rhyme or Reason
I do what I love, I don't follow low sequence

Do what I love, I don't follow low sequence."
45,You Can Never Feel My Pain,2000,H.N.I.C. (2000),,Prodigy,"(Prodigy)
Naw, you can never feel my pain nigga
And you can never feel my pain nigga
Never feel my pain nigga
How do I start it
Nineteen seventy four, motherfucker I was born with pain
My moms and my pops pass it down to me
So don't talk to me about can I feel yours
'Cause I ain't feelin' you at all, your pain isn't pure
You cryin cause you broke from the projects
That's not pain, that's emotions, you a bitch
I'm talkin' bout permanent, physical sufferin
You know nothin' about that
You just complain cause you stressed
Nigga, my pain's in the flesh
And through the years that pain became my friend; sedated
With morphine as a little kid
I built a tolerance for drugs, addicted to the medicine
Now hospital emergency treat me like a fiend
I rather die sometimes I wish a nigga O.D.
Beggin God for help, only to find
That I'm all by my God damn self
Ay you can never feel my pain nigga
Naw, can never feel my pain nigga
Can never feel my pain nigga
Never feel the pain nigga
You could never feel the pain nigga
Naw, never feel the pain nigga
And the females ask - P, why you always look mad?
Don't mind me if I may come off like that
But see, a nigga depressed, I need smoke
I need me a drink, I'm tryin' to stop those
Experience life, through the shoes of me
What you find, is you can't do that, you ain't built for it
The impact I put on this earth
It's like nuttin that you ever seen or heard; so look listen
When I speak, sit up in your seat
Pay attention to the words, cause the story is deep
In and out of crisis, since before I could walk
It gave me strength though, nowadays I hardly talk
It made me cold-hearted, anti, I won't play sports
I barely joke or play games, take it how you want
My handicap took its toll on my sanity
My moms got me at the shrink at like 13
And doctors called the cops on me
'Cause I be throwin' IV poles and they ignore me
I gotta, try to calm down and breathe
I can only hold it but for so long; put me to sleep
Do I sound insane... if I do, then this here was written for you
Cause you could never feel the pain nigga
Naw, can never feel my pain nigga
Could never feel my pain nigga
Never feel the pain nigga
You could never feel the pain nigga
Naw, never feel the pain nigga"

(Prodigy starts rapping at 1:03)
Yeah
Don't try that with P, nah give ya'self a break
You're f'ing with the wrong nigga, do ya'self a favor
Back up offa me lil nigga real fast
Or just like that you'll be pushing up grass
You're a plant fool; I'll put your flesh in the dirt
I tried to be polite, but you wanna be a jerk
Tried to prove a point; the only thing that you proved
Is people get killed simply for being rude
You thought you was the man, turned out to be a chump
You thought something sweet, believe Jay (Z) if you want
Ga'head believe Nas or whoever you choose
You come on over here and you gon' see the truth
It's nothing out the ordinary, this is what we do
My team's so strong, I feel sorry for you
These rappers is pissed off, they're not being felt
They get record deals but their albums get shelved
While I'm...
(Chorus x2: Prodigy)
Heavy on the dimers and heavy on the smoke
Pockets full of hundreds, doing hundreds in the post
GT Carrera nigga daring nigga front
Fucking with these young veterans you'll get done
We're heavy on the dimers and heavy on the smoke
Pockets full of hundreds, doing hundreds in the post
GT Carrera nigga daring nigga front
Fucking with these young veterans you'll get done
I'll react like a Terminator nigga what?
Won't stop coming till I know a nigga done
Rikers all good, it made me a millionaire
Or when it come time to squeeze yogi, we don't care
Now we thirty-thou feet in the air
Getting head from a pretty face who ain't scared
To fuck with these Gs and she's happy that she did
'Cause we turned out to be that shit that she felt
Baby on the real, all these lame niggas now the deal
My dudes give out the wounds that never heal
On the real, all these lame niggas now the deal
My dudes give out the wounds that never heal
(Chorus x2: Prodigy)
Don't be mad at me, be made at ya'self
For being so garbage you need to be killed
For putting out bullshit like you saw the joke
'Cause you're from the hood don't mean your shit's dope
Just 'cause you got bodies don't mean you're gon' gold
Like just because you're black don't mean you got soul
Niggas coming home from doing wild time
Talk about P - ""Yo P I could rhyme""
50 Cent did it; I could do the shit too
But you're not 50, he individual
And you're not H and you're definitely not P
What would make you think it's so easy to be?
I've been doing this since I was a Rugrat
I'm gifted; I'm blessed with talents you can't match
Stop dreaming, wake up and smell the 'Kush'
You better than P? Nah you wish!
