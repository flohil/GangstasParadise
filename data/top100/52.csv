0,Adios Uncle Tom (Skit),2008,The 3rd World (2008),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Yo
This is Poison Pen, with a message to the industry coon
No matter how Hollywood you think you are
No matter how many records you sold
No matter how many chains you rock
How big your rims are, or how shiny your freaking grills are
This is what they think about you
""(?) Nigger!""
""Burn the Mexican flag for American""
""He's a nigger!""
""The Qu'ran is a document of slavery and shatel""
""He's a nigger! (Oh my God) A nigger look at the nigger!""
""Don't tell me I need re-education, they need deportation""
""We need to close our borders and this needs to be a white country like our forefathers founded it""
Keep shucking and jiving and showing ya teeth, bitch."
1,Angels & Demons,2011,The Martyr (2011),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,":
: What do you see when you're in the dark, and the demons come?
: I see you... I see you standing over the grave of another dead president.
:
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fightin' over Heaven, Heaven
Heaven it's real
:
America's nightmare, young black and just don't give a fuck
Run up in a court room and wet 'em up
Got nothin' to lose, but my handcuffs
Every man must choose to lay down or stand up
It's war time, everything is fair no fear
When they said the homie murdered the judge, I don't care
Fuck him, he deserved it
Long as the homie get away and don't get caught for the crime, I encourage it
We rootin' for the villain in black
Pourin' out our salutes, salute, niggas is shootin' back
In self defense we bang the pistols
Like, 
 or Brian Nickles
Every pig, every public official the boomerang is comin' back to get you
You reap what you sow didn't you
The system you created, created a monster
And now you scared 'cause it's comin' back to haunt ya
:
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fightin' over Heaven, Heaven
Heaven it's real
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fightin' over Heaven, Heaven
Heaven it's real
:
Since we gonna take the blame, I'ma rep my name to get my aim right
Let's have a overthrow and after-party in the same night
Same height as 
, same muscle build as 
With the same circumstances in the hood, you know the outcome
And read it in the news about your sergeant and your captain
Don't take this as a warnin' just another nigga rappin'
Fuck the way we organizin', fuck the trainin' and the grapplin'
And fuck them Uncle Toms who call police because we smacked 'em
And fuck you sympathizers with your middle class reactions
'Cause we bangin' on the system, G'ed up, fuck the factions
And if you didn't know the G was for 
And long live his warrior spirit, packin' a Magnum
Watchin' over the soldiers knowin' niggas be blackin'
When we really need to be disciplined in our ways and actions
When we get some freedom you niggas can start braggin'
Until then, inside the blood in my eye, you see the dragon
:
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fightin' over Heaven, Heaven
Heaven it's real
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fightin' over Heaven, Heaven
Heaven it's real
:
I'm like the birth of baby Muhammad
The movement I started could spar with the hardest
A martyr regarded as spartic dis-hearted
It doesn't matter whose missiles can shoot the farthest
When you're a target in an Afghan Teutoburg forest
Close quarters combat over corrupted elections
Bilderberg is like cancer it grows with infection
Nepotism is the gold in the conductors connection
And ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in
The military ain't there for the peoples protection
They're just there to protect an investment
That's why people get arrested, electrocuted, molested
Connected streets are infested with those, tired of protestin'
Traumatized children, grown in guerrilla garrisons
9/11 generations pale in comparison
And you will learn a lesson repeated through history
That no matter what you think, occupation is not victory
:
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fightin' over Heaven, Heaven
Heaven it's real
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fightin' over Heaven, Heaven
Heaven it's real

Somalia, Kashmir, Nigeria, Palestine, Iraq, bring it back."

3,Beef And Broccoli,2001,Revolutionary Vol. 1 (2001),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Look, let me make something abundantly clear for people
That're so bereft of activities they feel like they have to comment on every one of mine
First of all, being a vegetarian should never be associated with being a revolutionary or being
Open-minded
That's a dietary choice
If someone wants to proliferate the type of ignorance we're supposed to be fighting by thinking that
You're just fucking yourself
I don't go around promoting beef and poultry
Shoving it in people's faces
I don't castigate people for not eating steak sandwiches
And I would never diss someone for being a fucking broccoli head
Or living off radishes or eating grass or tofu
I like a lot of vegan cuisine
But the illogicality of expecting everyone to adopt your particular idea of what being healthy is
Is just preposterous
I seen some of you herbivores
And if you wanna argue health y'all need to eat some kind of supplement
Cause some of y'all are so fuckin' skinny it's disgusting
Lookin' like the only hip hop motherfuckers on Schindlers List
Being a malnutritioned ass has nothing to do with being a revolutionary or being on point
I'll be damned if I let somebody else push their agenda on me
You know I don't eat pork, not 'cause I'ma Muslim, I just don't really like it
But I really will fuck a bird up
And fish is good when that stuff is fresh
It's like my nigga Vast Aire from Cann Ox said:
""If you don't like the smell of burning meat well than get the fuck off the planet""
You know I don't criticize people for eating moss
Then don't open your fuckin' mouth about my food man
I like beef and broccoli motherfucker! Mind your goddamn business
Matter of fact, you know what? I'm out
I feel like some arroco pollo, a banana daquiri and a motherfuckin' bestal benano"
4,Black Vikings,2011,The Martyr (2011),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn. Alone among god's primates, he kills for sport, or lust, or greed. Yay, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death.
(Poison Pen)
Yeah | Immortal Technique | SP the Ghost | Poison Pen | Vinnie Paz
We gonna stomp 'em out, run them out, run them out, call your number out, send your uncle buggers out
We gonna stomp 'em out, run them out, run them out, nigga ain't nothing civilized about no uncle buggers nigga, you feel me? Don't bring no uncle buggers out nigga, fuck outta here
(Immortal Technique)
All troops in formation? Let the siege commence!
(Verse 1: Immortal Technique)
Back like I was locked up, putting in work
Burning through books like Nazis in a Catholic church
I'm cursed like Cain when he murdered his brother
Cut your face off and wear it while I'm fucking your mother
I am Mars Ultor, the avenger, the God of war
And if you don't believe in me, I doubt you believe in God at all
I breathe smokeless fire, the Jinn type,
That'll make you hate the way Allah made you to live life
Like Hindu niggas that be bleaching their skin white,
Other people's teeth in my hands after a fist fight
I was born with a sixth sense and a swift right,
Skinned werewolves and raped demons at midnight,
Sell your kids into slavery after we murder you
Or sacrifice them in the same fire we burning you
Barbarian funeral nigga, you wanna know
Damn the river, bury me, and let the water flow
(Hook: Poison Pen)
Chaos, mayhem, bang outs, slay them, uprise, rape them, raid them,
Cage em, pandemonium, insurgent, death merchants, commit the best murder, pillage, Kill them, erase history, make them a mystery.
(Verse 2: Styles P)
Cut the nose off or the ears off the whole head
Immortal and Ghost coming: Code red
You never seen a black barbarian, warrior
War lord, pussy, cut your balls off
More bodies come; more bodies hauled off
What you want the sword or get shit sawed off
You don't need an accident,
And I'm breaking your back 'cause your spine needed a crack in it
You bugging me, I'm coming to fumigate,
Like Wolverine and Sabretooth, the way that I mutilate
I'm like the Viking in Valhalla Rising,
Except I got black skin and both of my eyes in
Don't test him, please don't stress him,
He'll hang you from a tree with your own intestines,
How you wanna die? make your own suggestion,
Now talk to the Lord and make your own confession
(Hook: Poison Pen)
Chaos, mayhem, bang outs, slay them, uprise, raid them, rape them,
Cage em, pandemonium, insurgent, death merchants, commit the best murder, pillage, Kill them, erase history, make them a mystery
(Verse 3: Vinnie Paz)
You pussies living in a movie theatre,
Put the motherfucking spell on you like Brujeria
Chop his motherfucking head like a ruthless leader,
Guns drawn in a church service, shoot the preacher,
You need to be Godly to know Allah
Ain't no rappers eating around me like a broken jaw,
It ain't ever been a day that I ain't broke the law
What you think I hold a motherfucking toaster for?
I ain't going there, there's police in that room
And Vinnie walk around with bags of dust like a vacuum
Bury you under the earth inside a black tomb
My body covered in dashiki and stab wounds
I'm a gorilla/guerrilla, barbarians is my ancestors,
That's a part of my neurological transmitters,
We Islamic and brought the story of Shams with us,
While we brought the motherfucking blam blam with us
(Hook: Poison Pen)
Chaos, mayhem, bang outs, slay them, uprise, raid them, rape them,
Cage em, pandemonium, insurgent, death merchants, commit the best murder, pillage, Kill them, erase history, make them a mystery
The walls have been breached! Advaaaaaaance!
We came in the name of peace and brotherhood, you wanted us bound in slavery, poisoned our water, changed our names...
Burn their homes, take their jewels, skin them alive!
Hold on, hold on, hold on... not they women though. (Heh heh ha ha ha ha ha!)
No one will know these people ever existed, and all that will be left is what we build upon their ruins..."

Burn this for every single muthafucka you know!"
6,Civil War,2011,The Martyr (2011),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,":
You know what? Fuck Dirty Harry.
We got guns too, nigga!
Fuck the Terminator, nigga.
Fuck Rambo, nigga!
The ghetto is like a prison with invisible bars
No matter where you at always follows you where you are
And it's hard out there for a pimp to get outta
But it's harder for the hooker that he beat the shit outta
I got niggas underground in the confederate states
Ironically runnin' from slavery that prison creates
So I never hate on the south, I respect they vision
I just hate on the niggas that promote Samboism
And white execs that love to see us in that position
They reflect the stereotypes of America's vision
They want us dancin', coonin' and hollerin'
Only respect us, for playin' sports and modelin'
More than racism, it's stay-in-your-place-ism
Our people are trapped in practical black-face-ism
So fuck a civil war between the north and the south
It's between field niggas and slaves that are stuck in the house
:
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowin' the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin' to survive cultural assassination
:
Crip niggas, blood nigga, eses, asians
Why the fuck we warring with each other's population
The devil want us dead, all our population
People in folk nation, why the separation
Why we got Jamaicans hatin' on Hatians
When the British and French raped both nations
Mexicans and Blacks kill each other, straight hatin'
While the government profits from prison population
If you on the bottom, be you Anglo or Asian
You gotta recognize the realness of what I'm sayin'
You gotta recognize another G ain't the enemy
When the police ride, they kill us frequently
We gotta make the youth see, where the truth be
If you a G, then go and develop GD
50 years of gangs and our people still poor
If we really run the streets, we should really end war
:
Civil war, for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowin' the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war, for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin' to survive cultural assassination
:
Listen, our hearts were torn apart just like Yahweh's
Watchin' towers full of souls fall to sawdust
Every time we called your office you ignored us
Now you holdin' hearin's on us all inside of Congress
Microscopes on us, ask if we're Jihadists
My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers
I think Patrick said it best, Give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claim innocence, you play victimless
But you gave the kiss of death in the name of self-defense
Slavery and theft have brought other nations to the end
To pacify your citizenry with success
We believe in freedom, justice, security
But they're only good when applied universally
So certainly if I rage against the machine
My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Heard you need puttin' fear inside your heart
Make you burn Qu'rans and tell me not to build a Mosque
Me, my wife and babies we ain't never made Jihad
We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to God
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
The greatest threat of harm doesn't come from any bomb
The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
What happens when that few includes you
Civil war"
7,Conquerors,2011,The Martyr (2011),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,":
Nearly all religions were brought to people, and imposed on people, by conquerors, and used as the framework to control their minds.
My main point here is that if you are a child of God, and God is a part of you, then in your imagination God's supposed to look like you.
And when you accept a picture of the deity assigned to you by another people, you become the spiritual prisoner of that other people."
8,Creation & Destruction,2001,Revolutionary Vol. 1 (2001),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Yeah
Haha
Se acabado la mierda 
Bout to drop a def' cut
Yo, yo, yo, huh
Immortal Technique, disintegrates mic's when I spit
I cause more casualties than sunken slave ships
Full to capacity, I bring tragedy to rap without my man Kadafi
The government took Nazi scientists from Germany
To design nuclear rockets and ways of observin' me
'Cause their pathetic attempts, didn't work to murder me
When this country was conceived, these bastards never heard of me
But now I hold the souls of slave masters eternally
Bleeding internally, burnin' D, durin' surgery, verbally
'Cause I'm a spirit to which
Devils are incompatible
I've been around since the planet was inhabitable
I spit in the ocean and created microscopic animals
Which evolved into two species, the righteous and the cannibals
But until then, I had alien women suck me off
When God said ""Let there be light"", I turned it the fuck off
And that's the reason earth is only 5 billion years old
I made the sun shine, and permitted time to unfold
The surface was lava, but when I stepped down, it became cold
Fuck what you've been told
My spiritual form became a swarm of molecule sickness
Manifested liquid trapped inside a mountainous region
Until the skies starting raining, continuous seasons
Immortal Technique, at long last, reincarnated
Undebatably reinstated to leave you decapitated
Je suis fous, but my crazy words make sense
I'll split every pound in your body into six pence
I'm sick of simple similes about The Sixth Sense
I'll leave your body drenched in the blood of all your ancestors
You'll never be at peace, like the souls of child molestors
I'll cut you and bless your festering wounds with alcohol
Drown you in a clogged toilet, in a public bathroom stall
I'll rip you down, take a chunk of you home like the Berlin Wall
This is the final call, for all rappers that wanna brawl
Immortal Technique, the wrong motherfucker to dis
'Cause I allow God to let you motherfuckers exist
Hahahahaha yeah, real oh
We about to crash somethin' now, yo
Yo, yo, yo
I'm the stronghold on your neck that doesn't let you breathe
Stronger than the fake image of God in which you believe
More dangerous than your ignorant ass could ever perceive
A European virus, mutated in Africa, overseas
Transported by mosquitoes and fleas to where you live
So lock yourself in your house with your wife and your kids
You're such a bitch, somebody probably made you out of a rib
My arrest record just scratches the surface of what I did
My bid locked me up and brought my life to an end
I was forgotten, abandoned by my bitches and friends
You don't want beef with people like me so don't pretend
I'll resurrect your aborted baby and kill it again
You get no props in hip-hop like feminine men
I'm iller than any plague God gave Moses to send
You wanna make amends, 'cause I'm the reason that the earth shakes
Burying your fam like Central American earthquakes
Immortal Technique
Harlem to Canada
Lyrically damage ya
Te dije que se acabado la mierda "
9,Crimes of the Heart ,2008,The 3rd World (2008),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"I turned 21 in prison, locked up at night
Now I walk around free, it seems like another life
Another role with some other dice
Another ho or a loving wife
People come and go
Some really you never know
Intellectual midgets that really never grow
Fake love that hangs on like, can I hold you though?
With no friends that look at you like, yo, yeah I told you so
A toast to the broken hearted, who never finished what they fucking started
People who go out and try to be a rebel at night
Who try to make up for the fact that they settled in life
It's like a fight between the devil and Christ over the limelight
Spiritual celebrity poker, but the whole deck is full of jokers
And every year that you get older, the stakes get higher
Gambling with a bunch of fakes and liars
Real talk 'cause the real New York is the pain and the suffering of lost love
Staring off into the distance of the mist in the club
Depression and emptiness that lead to suicide
And the struggle inside yourself that keeps you alive
Surviving medicated, stalked by sobriety
The life you live now, tortured by memories violently
I pray inside of me that one day you can be forgiven
For murdering the beautiful world we used to live in
Love doesn't need a complicated metaphor
And sometimes, nothing even needs to be said at all
Sometimes the person you with is not your one and only
And you just fuck with them 'cause your afraid to be lonely
And when you come back, it's too late
So you overcompensate like victims of rape for the self hate
Lost in the affection of strangers around you
Instead of the only person who ever gave a fuck about you
Thought you were happy, so you didn't come check me
But then when he cheated or treated you incorrectly
You conveniently realized that you could never forget me
And tried to crawl back in my life, unexpectedly
These are my indictments of those who claim to be righteous
And leave a trail of broken hearts on they way to enlightenment
But I can't give in to hatred and pass judgment
Even towards every illusion I've been in love with
Cause the heart that betrays itself willingly
Is like a nation that trades freedom for stability
It's so seductive to be cold and corrupted
And isolated, trying to be an independent republic
But liberty, to be loved on the surface is worthless
The sacrifice of revolution with no purpose
Take it from a criminal searching for his redemption
Cursing at god, desperately trying to get his attention
What you thought it was over?
This ain't over till we say it's over mother fucker
Ey yo Tech, what do you think about the rap game right about now?
It's all bullshit you know that I know that,
Hey come along with me man well have a budget
I didn't get into this for that.
Well that's all there is
If that's all there is I've been wasting my mother fucken time with you
Yeah yeah uh
(Verse 1 - Immortal Technique)
The game is polluted with rappers that are really snitches
And most DJs are nothing but industry bitches
And we don't got no mansion or riches
But we got guns and knives and your children's pictures
And everybody loses in war, but you lose more
What do you think we brought back the Panthers and the Zulu for?
Immortal, witch doctor, made himself a voodoo doll
For every motherfucker that fronted that I can recall
Fuck the industry, don't call me, you can't get with me
I leave niggas hanging, like Mississippi
RBG to the last drop of blood in my body
Or the feds drag me away, like a Tsunami
But I'll be back, like a fresh body bag from Iraq
Like a Baltimore slum, during the resurgence of crack
Brown and black, like the AK I keep in the strap
While we waiting on the next stock market collapse
(Verse 2 - Fatz Da Assassin)
Territorial oratory editorial
Fuck around I'll be the cause of your lifes memorial
I write wraps territorial east coast porters too
Never crossing borders still I will coastally slaughter you
I'm better than all of you, vendettas be mauling you
You talking cheddar, I'm a shredder, Ill sever it off of you
I never remorse for you, no letters endorsing you
Pole position in the coffin is what is costing you
The Caucus bosses, who control the fortunes too
The mortgages of a cultural loss through and through
But it's the Rebel Arms, Gods speed with devils charm
The bitch made gets switch blades in every arm
And this way we ix-nay on any harm
'Cause snakes play and fakes lay like hidden bombs
We march in unison, the souls is true within
Eternal mission with shit, a lifetime of doing it
(Verse 3 - Goodtime Slim)
Stronghold said it, whoop yo bitch ass with batons
The rebel arms swarm inform like Vultron
Slash your old beats you heard the Mark of the East
Running through cop land screaming Fuck the Police
Hormones in the water, they acting out of order
Like a pack of rabid wolves, they lambs for the slaughter
Crush your mandible rip the drums like animal
Eat MCs, they my own kind, I'm a cannibal
My regimens solute me, haters wanna shoot me
Kool-aid in they veins, they lawyers try to sue me
You sell crack in rap, did a scidd bid
Multiple baby mommas, take care of your kids
Guillotine rap, shackles on your neck
Chemical warfare where punch lines connect
Da Circle played the snipe, with Immortal Tech
They calling the block governor to drag 'em off the set
(Verse 4 - J. Arch)
Rebel Arms out for supremacy and move non gimmicky
Related to royalty on each trip you mention me
Twist bars illishly, rebel against the infantry
Get more than your feet wet when I make you a memory
Cats not ready because they commercially industry
I make house calls on those afraid to visit me
Disrespect? I smash your off the petty
From undisclosed low case fast for the chetty
Arch don't break dance, yet I rock steady
I jump on your scope to prove your aim not deadly
My shot to the top is like Mickey and Mal Smently
Flow milky like the tits of a chick that's top heavy
The Techniques Immortal so Rebel Arms the regiment
Archs styles nicer than other rappers ever been
My canteens full from when the doctor got medicine
Five star general, frontline veteran
Invasion baby,
This ain't a fucken game you think we playing
Immortal Technique
Oh yeah don't forget
Revolutionary Vol. 3 coming soon
You're not worthy, you sons of bitches"
10,Crossing The Boundary,2003,Revolutionary Vol. 2 (2003),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"I never make songs to disrespect women
Or to judge people, about the way that they living
But the way I am is based on the life I was given
Like them white boys, ""losing my religion""!
I used to be a Christian and a political pawn
The Bible is right and all your native culture is wrong
Next thing you know you telling me bout making a song
Come in a studio and tell me that I'm making it wrong
Pissed off cause reality is making it strong
Like the ghost of Timothy McVeigh making a bomb
Hey yo Marvin Gaye, what the fuck is going on?
These rap niggas making propaganda out of your song
But it's the gong show, amateur night at the Apollo
My dick is like my music but harder to swallow
So children follow me like the Pied Piper
And sing the chorus in the air with your blunt and lighter
The second verse is worse than the first in this respect
Scripted specifically to keep people in check
Harlem to Boston real niggas spit with me
But Landspeed you ain't fucking shit to me
And underground labels know that I don't trust you
And you only independent till you major so fuck you
And if you pissed off cause you think that I dissed you
I'll rape your mom so we can make this a personal issue
Dance with the devil
Remember that you're not on my level
Stupid you're not ready; I won decipher
Bragging Rights and Rock Steady
And practically every battle that they got in New York
And I still murder rappers on the streets for sport
Dr. Guillotine, cutting you short, little man
But you don't give me props 'cause I never won at Scribble Jam?
Well fuck you, I hope someone you love dies so fuck your crew
And fuck your family too
Technique said it bitch, what the fuck you gonna do?
Immortal Technique incinerate degenerate fags
Burn Trent Lott wrapped in his Confederate flag
I got the beretta with my face wrapped in a rag
So put the African slave jewelry in the bag
Motherfuckers tell me that a diamond is forever
But is it worth the blood of Malcolm and Medgar Evers?
House niggas get your head severed trying to be thug
You don't concern me, I'm trying to hurt the people you love
Word of mouth is I'm in the club being sneaky
I'm like the bodysnatchers and your girl is getting sleepy
I'll murder you, indiscreetly, right at the source
Like the Roman legionare that stabbed Christ on the cross
This about Judo
It ain't about Jesus
And you shouldn't fucking talk about telekinesis
Nigga please; moving shit with your mind?
Try moving your mom out the projects with your rhymes
And next time: I'm coming after 
Profanity, fuck it 
Roll up the 
Put the price up to listen to listen to meek pop shit
'Cause I got Martha Stewart giving me stock tips
Underground money with honeys up in the whip
Bangbus.com nigga fucking your bitch
Am. I thought I told y'all niggas on Vol. 1, I wasn't fucking around, and you just slept, because you sold a few thousand units
In the Golden era, when niggas'll buy anything on the shelf. Those days are through, and you're through with them."
11,Dance With The Devil,2001,Revolutionary Vol. 1 (2001),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern was making a million
Being the illest hustler that the world ever seen
He used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hanging out selling bags in the projects
Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation 'cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once, and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see me and niggaz like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities at other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble minded young man with infinite potetial
The product of a ghetto breed capatalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed
Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
So Billy started robbing niggaz, anything he could do
He'd get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew
Starting fights over little shit, up on the block
Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
Working overtime for making money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfilling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggaz treating him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggaz showed him no love
They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club
But only a real thug can stab someone till they die
Standing in front of them, staring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
And they wanted to test him, before business started
Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
So now he had a choice between going back to his life
Or making money with made men, up in the cife
His dreams about cars and ice, made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three
Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone
Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
This is it kid now you got your chance to be raw
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screaming 'shut the fuck up' and 'stop moving around'
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed to the clouds
So Billy stomped on the bitch, until he'd broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was meant to go first, but each of them took a turn
Ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned
A broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggaz pulled out a brand new twenty-two
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
I'm falling and I can't turn back
I'm falling and I can't turn back
Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
'Cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried, 'cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully than when they were raping her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And crying out to the sky 'cause he was lonely and scared
But only the devil responded, cause god wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
After that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen cause the story that I'm telling is true
'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too
And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact, I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow
He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black, color is not restricted
You have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of god's children and fall from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because the dance with the devil might last you forever"
12,Death March Intro,2008,The 3rd World (2008),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"This is an invasion
An occupation
Immortal Technique
The evil genius DJ Green Lantern
And you're now in a state of guerilla warfare
Has been spread by the superpowers of the industry
To the 3rd world underground of the streets
This is for all those who have been labeled extremists, maniacs, terrorists, shit
Welcome to the 3rd world
Yeah, yeah
Invasion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
Peruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians
They call us terrorists after they ruined our countries
Funding right-wing paramilitary monkeys
Tortured a populous then blamed the Communists
Your lies are to obvious, propaganda monotonous
And that's not socialist mythology;
This is urban warfare through the streets of your psychology
So I'm like the legs of a paraplegic really
'Cause I'm still part of you, even if you can't feel me
You can never debate me, the M4's at your baby
Like troops with gats in Iraq do daily
So you can marginalize the way you portray me
But don't get Hollywood and try to play me
We can shoot it out in the theatre like troops 
 in the '80s
 classic, crack-era mack-milli
Shoutin' BET is not black-owned, on ""Rap City""
You got a contract to kill me mothafucka' that's fine
'Cause there's a contract to kill your family when I die
So when your car explodes, don't be surprised
Soldier, I'm like Marine Corp C4
Even blow the spot with the beat rockin' at 3/4
Canvas the flow like the ghost of Michelangelo
This is the anthem, Immortal Technique and Green Lantern
Don't say shit bitch, you don't want the check check
To become a ""chick-chick"", you know what I'm sick with
Lyrical tuberculosis, cocaine overdoses
Blood coming out your noses, that's when death approaches
March to my death smiling, laugh if the end's violent
There's no escape from this political asylum
Revolutionaries don't fear execution
'Cause the death of my physical constitution
Is just the beginning of spiritual evolution
God will reincarnate me as revolution
You can't take out a revolution
You can't kill a idea
Fuck, is you stupid
You kill that man, he becomes immortal
Ignore the triplets, this is a fully loaded
4/4, 3rd world underground hardcore
Street hop, locked and loaded
Motherfucka' you should know it
Blast the doors to the game open and overthrow it"
13,Dominant Species,2001,Revolutionary Vol. 1 (2001),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Yo, in a hundred years form now
Everyone who's living on this planet will be dead
So it's inconsequential really
All the shit that you talk
All the bullshit that you stand for
It's more important what, what your ready to build
What you're ready to pass down to your children
What you're ready to create
You better fucking remember that
When you challenge a mother fucker like me
Remember, I'm the dominant species
I'm stuck inside the future and life is chaotic
The government is psychotically racist and robotic
The matrix of entrapment is socio-economic
Erotic conspiracy theory becomes reality
Life is war, and every day's a battle to me
I'm on the brink of insanity, between extreme intelligence and split personalities
But I elevate to the point of reversing gravity
Revolutionary conceptuality spitting out of me
Even the dead people in my family tell me they proud of me
Stupidity's not allowed by me
'Cause I don't got time to play
I'm the black hole lyricist that'll take your shine away
Darkness at any time of day
I'm the Technique and you're nobody so what you trying to say
Stellar density becomes your physical alignment
1.8 billion tons per square inch confinement
Yo, yo, yo, I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet
Yo, yo, lyrically I'm infinite like possibilities
But you don't have the capability like infertility
'Cause opening your mouth to question my validity
Is like trying to contradict the theory of relativity
When I spit is the epitome of heavy artillery
My enemies are obsessed with me like the bitch in Misery
But break out like father running from responsibility
Every time I step and abuse the mic with versatility
I balance humility, with brutal instinct
I'll make your whole cypher look like those crackers from N'Sync
And I don't care about your link, or your luxury car
I shed light with more magnitude than all of the stars
La Brea tar pit thick
So don't ever talk shit
And remember something nigga, while you rave and rant
A roach can live for nine days without its head but you can't
I'm explicit like video tapes of conjugal visits
Some niggaz are too stupid to understand it like astrophysics
Technique is exquisite
I'll make your thoughts a victory
Get pessimistic with the quickness
If you think that I will just become another statistic with anything but success
When I bless the mic as I spit this
Specifically prolific with kaposi's sarcoma type sickness
My style is like a ten year old child with a slit wrist, too much reality
For the fucking hit list
I got a Black Panther mentality with a spick fist
So you can get dissed
Even if you're locally gold, vocally bold, or globally
Multi-platinum sold
I'm emotionally cold, disciplined, and ready to kill
Like spirits in the same room with you, I'm giving you chills
I drop knowledge while these mother fuckers clumsily spill
And I drop it so heavy, it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet"
14,Eyes in the Sky,2011,The Martyr (2011),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,":
I am the eye in the sky, looking at you, I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules, dealing with fools, I can cheat you blind
:
My truth is the 
, buried in Ethiopia
Watch who you fuckin' with, a Minneapolis Somalian
When I go home the world I used to know is gone
And now I live on my own
For which shall it profit, a rapper with creative control
To sign a deal with the devil and lose his soul
My stillborn first expression is cold
Like the faces of slave masters on the paper I fold
Subliminal racial supremacy, chokin' me quick
Like the bedtime stories of 
Lynch mob gunnin' for me tryin' to murder my seed
So shorty put him in the 
 in a basket of reeds
And now I stare into the future with a spiritual flash light
Wondering who the fuck was me in the past life
Bad diet, fuck law, die young, fast life
Same as the crash flight that took off when the music died on your last night
Tell 'em the truth and they call you a traitor
Talk to 'em honestly and they call you a hater
Losin' my composure 'cause the message is urgent
Talkin' reckless drunk on the mic like 
Cursin' at the serpents, Sumerian demons
Who brush their wings against the air that I'm breathin'
A heathen with nothin' left to believe in, even a reason for livin'
That was forgiven by God and not religion
Envision 
 risen from the dead like 
In a Baptist church, shakin' off the rigor mortis
The borders should be illegal instead of the people
That were here before the 
 and all of its sequels
I speak to the detached and unrealistic
That were born normal but turned socially autistic
We resisted homeland securities mission
Because I know what they really envision
:
I am the eye in the sky, looking at you, I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules, dealing with fools, I can cheat you blind
I am the eye in the sky, looking at you, I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules, dealing with fools, I can cheat you blind"
15,Freedom Of Speech,2003,Revolutionary Vol. 2 (2003),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Freedom of speech, motherfucker
Okay, something for the kids (hahaha)
(Pinocchio)
I got no strings to hold be down
To make me fret or make me frown
I had strings, but now I'm free
I got no strings on me
Step into the club smoothly with a L in my hand
Bitches know that I'm a freak like the elephant man
Intelligent plans
Fuck a record deal, I want development land
With my benevolent clan
And that's the reason that I only trust my fam
40,000 records sold, 400 grand
Fuck a middle man, I won't pay anyone else
I'll bootleg it and sell it to the streets my self
I'd rather be that than signed and stuck on a shelf
And because of this executives try to diss me
Racism frozen in time like Walt Disney
And now they say they wanna get me signed to the majors
If I switch up my politics and change my behavior
Try to tell me what to rhyme about over the beat
Bitch niggas that never spent a day in the street
But I repeat that nobody can hold my reigns
I put the truth on tracks nigga, simple and plain
(Pinocchio)
I got no strings, so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
They've got strings but you can see
There are no strings on me!
I guess to America I'm a disaster
A slave that was destined to own his masters
Independent in every single sense of the word
I say what I want, you fuckin' little sensitive herd
This is America, I thought we had freedom of speech
But now you want try to control the way that I speak
And O'Reilly you think that you a patriot?
You ain't nothing but a motherfuckin racist bitch
Fulla hatred, pressin a button trying to inject me
But I ain't got no motherfuckin deal with Pepsi
No corporate sponsor telling me what to do
Asking me to tone it down during the interview
Tryin' to minimize the issue, but I'm keeping it large
I love the place that I live, but I hate the people in charge
Speakin' is hard when you got strings attached
So I'm a say it for you 'cause I ain't got none o' that
And if you didn't understand what I spit at your brain
Aiyyo son, let this little nigga explan:
(Pinocchio)
I got no strings to hold be down
To make me fret or make me frown
I had strings, but now I'm free
I got no strings on me
Come on son, y'all niggas know the way I do
Immortal Technique, got com (?) live for you
And I know sometimes it be making you nervous
The way I snatch puppet rappers that belong in a circus
You motherfuckers just can't compare
Looking for a fan base that's no longer there
I know that you're scared, and you're hidin' up in the cut
But this is freedom of speech nigga, tell 'em what's up
Word nigga, fuck John Ashcroft! Nigga, fuck Fox News! Fuck those snake-ass
Bitches Tryin' to manipulate your opinion, tellin' you what to think
Word the fuck up, like ""we invaded niggas 'cause we want to free them""
You racist motha fucka, you don't give a shit about those people
You can suck my dick!

Another rum and coke at the bar, nigga
It's my day off, word up

en han llegado a seruna miseria insoportable para la gente
Pero hay unas veinte patrias engreídas que todavía creen
en una sociedad de antes donde los artistas
fuimos bestias de trabajo para la industria
Ese sueño se ha acabado
Y ahora nos encontramos despiertos en la hora de revolución
porque no podemos llamar esto 'movimiento' si toda la propiedad
intelectual pertenece a los que no son {?}
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Motherfucker!
Ya te dije
Que se ha acabado la mierda

Nos compraron el alma barata
Hasta la sangre nos sacan, atacan
Y con un contrato te atrapan
Pero primero me matan hermano
Porque prefiero morir
Peleando que ser esclavo
Industria sucia
Toma lluvia de acido
Aprende la historia de hip hop clasico
Cuando controlan el negocio y la cultura
La musica se vuelve en comercial basura
Y la reina latina, pintada como gallina
Es mas que bailarina o puta en la esquina
Es abogada, profesora, madre, soldada
Y carga nuestro futuro cuando esta embarazada
Mira nuestra gente crucificada
Y la manera desgraciada
Que estos perros no hablan de nada
Más que fiestas y riqueza
Que la gente no tiene
Asi que ahora vas a ver
La violencia que viene
Un movimiento de verdad ha empezado
Dejamos el imperio corrupto descuartizado
Golpe de estado disparando al presidente
Es hora de revolucion nuevamente

Golpe de estado el mercado me tiene bravo
Hermano yo pinto el cuadro
Y el barrio ya está cansado cabrón
Yo te lo juro que lo que yo sudo es puro
Ustedes son burros
Que venden el culo por el reggaetón
Abre los ojos, cojo el presidente del sello
Bobo le rompo el cuello al pendejo
Solo con mi cañón
No tengo miedo guerrero por eso muero
Y me quedo con tiraera
Porque ella llama la atención
Levanta publico mano te tienen imnotisado
Entrenado inyectándote mierda con la estación
Temperamento rey del movimiento
Este es mi tiempo
Con mi canción
Hasta Tempo sale de la prisión
Por mis palabras tengo seguidores
Rapeadores en todas las naciones
Comisiones de aplicar presión
Yo soy la epidemia, la saga, las nueve plagas
La misma palabra en la biblia
Que habla de Armagedón
La competencia es riqueza
Qué tristeza
Que tengo que romperle la cabeza
Pa que me pidan perdón
Perriando quiere decirte que tú eres de la brutas
No te gusta que te llamen puta escucha la canción
El sandunguero es tan feo
Que es con doble sentido
Le dicen a tu hijo que lo haga sin condón
El estremera y el capital inmortal
Vamos a gritas pa que viva la revolución

where the artists were beasts of burden for industry

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Mother fucker!
I already told you
That the shit is finished!
[Immortal Technique]
They bought our souls cheap
Even blood they take from us, they attack us
And with a contract they trap you
But first they'll kill me, bro
Because I prefer to die
Fighting than to be a slave
Dirty industry, drink acid rain
Learn the history of classic hip hop
When they control business and culture
Music becomes commercial garbage
And the Latina queen painted like a chicken
She's more than a dancer or a whore in the corner
She is a lawyer, teacher, mother, soldier
And bears our future when she is pregnant
Look at our crucified people
And the disgraceful way
That these dogs do not talk about anything
Other than parties and riches/wealth
That the people don't have
Therefore/Thus now you're going to see
The violence that comes
A movement of truth has begun
We're leaving the corrupt empire in pieces
Coup d'etat shooting the president
It is time for revolution again

Em - I heard that you and my dad used to be in the gang. Is that true?
IT - Who told you that man, your mother? It wasn't a gang we were just a group of friends.
Em - Did you do bad things?

Em - Goonies??
WHAT?!?
(Verse 1: Immortal Technique)
I coulda chose another life with the feds tryna get me
Little kids putting work in like at GAP and Disney
In the whip, high as shit, like Bobby and Whitney
Grab your hand and push the motherfucking pedal to sixty
Harlem cops frisk me, to get me to make their quotas
But I told ya Siempre hay que separar las drogas
Bar brawl in the club, popping and rocking georsh
Shot it out, leaving bullet holes the size of matzu balls
I love big chicks, never fucked with a slim broad
Played soccer and hammered nails into the shin guards
Gambled at Cee Lo with Dominicans, locked in the tombs
We was there for robbing niggas for them Spanish doubloons
Remember Goonie era graffiti of all sorts?
Now they wanna foreclose on the hood to build a golf course
I'll put your hand in a blender to make an entrée
Then cut your dick off, and glue it back on the wrong way
(Hook: Immortal Technique)
All my Revolutionary soldiers better ride
My word is mathematics bitch, numbers never lie
So even if they tell you I'm dead, nigga, I'm still alive
Because muthafucka, Goonies never die
Witness protection program, rappers better hide
I serve revenge out the freezer, niggas never slide
So if they tell you I'm gone and you safe, niggas lied
Because muthafucka, Goonies never die.
(Verse 2: Swave Sevah)
I'm a certified Goonie, the type that burglaries ya crib
And leave it smellin' like Sour and Afghan gooey
Life is a movie but yours was filmed on a greener screen
I give you pure uncut raw, no deleted scenes
War with a broadsword, dumping a tech nine
Slit your throat, give you a Columbian neck tie
The Best Buy to get, we let die, let fly the next guy that try some shit
Listen a few words just to describe my clique
We like a gang of Spartans walking on the Gaza strip
Never say die, its time to fight and we never run
My Goonies rob niggas for jewellery, we call 'em treasure hunts
Let him front like he a tough guy with me
I'll hit him, slug turn him to one eye willy, watery grave, hide ya chips
I'll hijack ya boat load and cruise away on my pirate ship

My team got away with murder, we ain't fit the bloody glove
Those jungle breeds and we've come to feed our hungry cubs
With hoes pulling at our pipes like Goonies under country clubs
Let these funny thugs know whoever steps in Bolics spot
Is getting crushed with solid rock like a Chester copperpot
I suggest the drama stops, I'll flood blocks with mustard gas
You're up shits creek in a rubber raft cut in half
Cross my fucking path, I dare you, I'll mangle who lit the fuse
Quick to lose my marbles like Mikey replacing his with jewels
Watching y'all enslave the game I'm forced to say the truth
Break the chains quick as Sloth reaching for a Baby Ruth
We got AD proof and whores in daisy dukes, extra low
While fat bitches do the truffle shuffle just to get in shows
Fuck what your record sold, respect the code and recognise
The rebel tribe that my people kept alive will never die.

Harlem once was red line district rated
Designated ghetto like the yellow star of David
And you wonder why people don't own they homes
'Cause the racist bank wouldn't fuckin' mortgage a loan
Harlem once was red line district rated
Designated ghetto like the yellow star of David
And you wonder why people don't own they homes
'Cause the racist bank wouldn't fuckin' mortgage a loan
Harlem once was red line district rated
Designated ghetto like the yellow star of David
And you wonder why people don't own they homes
'Cause the racist bank wouldn't fuckin' mortgage a loan
Until after the invasion of gentrification
Eminent domain intimidation, that's not negotiation
And it's frustrating to look at every day
Like watchin' a porno on 56k
Biohazard labs instead of store rooms
What's next, motherfucka', projects as dorm rooms?
You ain't foolin' nobody in this community, dude
With your little fake Manhattanville community group
Ivy league real estate firms are corrupt
That lay siege to your castle like the Moors in Europe
They treat street vendors like criminal riffraff
While politicians get the corporate kickbacks (""snakes"")
Harlem renaissance, a revolution betrayed
Modern-day slaves thinking that the ghetto is saved
Till they start deporting people off the property
Ethnically cleansing the hood, economically
They want to kill the real Harlem renaissance
Tryin' to put the Virgin Mary through an early menopause
The savior is a metaphor for how we set it off
Guerrilla war against the rezoning predators
When I speak about Harlem, I speak to the world
The little Afghan boy, and the Bosnian girl
The African in Sudan, the people of Kurdistan
The third world American indigenous man
Palestinians, Washington Heights Dominicans, displaced New Orleans citizens
Beachfront Brazilian fevelas that you livin' in
The hood is prime real estate, they want back in again
I didn't write this to talk shit, I say it because
Some of y'all forgot what the Harlem Renaissance was
We had revolution, music and artisans
But the movement was still fucked up like Parkinson's
'Cause while we were giving birth to the culture we love
Prejudice kept our own people out of the club
Only colored celebrities in the party
And left us a legacy of false superiority
W.E.B. Du Bois versus Marcus Garvey
And we ended up selling out to everybody
The Dutch Schultzes and the John Gotti's
Banksters, modern-day gangsters (?)
They want to move us all out the NYC
Like they did to the Jews with the Alhambra decree
So support your own businesses and do the knowledge
'Cause the real Harlem renaissance is economic
Harlem renaissance, a revolution betrayed
Modern-day slaves thinking that the ghetto is saved
Till they start deporting people off the property
Ethnically cleansing the hood, economically
They want to kill the real Harlem renaissance
Tryin' to put the Virgin Mary through an early menopause
The savior is a metaphor for how we set it off
Guerrilla war against the rezoning predators
""When they were saying it is the renaissance of Harlem, they didn't mean that we had stake in that. They meant to say that they could make money out of us.""
""They are coming in with all kind of prejudices. In Brooklyn they're doing the same thing. In, um, Queens they're doing the same thing. The Bronx. There's hardly any place which is affordable. I mean these people are putting up condominiums which start from a million dollars. How many people in this community make that kind of money? How many people have that kind of money?""
""People of Harlem, they are the natural allies of the oppressed people of the world. Whether the struggle is in Panama, in Africa, Cuba.""
""We spend money with the wrong people. We are looking for love with people who don't love us. What's wrong with us loving each other, and making sure we are protected?"""
19,Harlem Streets,2003,Revolutionary Vol. 2 (2003),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Yeah... Harlem streets stay flooded in white powder
Like those motherfuckers runnin' away from the twin towers
Gunshots rock the earth like a meteor shower
Bowling For Columbine, fear, giving the media power
Innocence devoured like a chicken spot snack box
Government cocaine cooked into ghetto crack rock
Corrupt cops false testimony at your arraignment
Check to check, constant struggle to make the payments
Working your whole life wondering where the day went
The subway stays packed like a multicultural slave-ship
It's rush hour, 2:30 to 8, non stoppin'
And people coming home after corporate sharecroppin
And fuck flossin, mothers are trying to feed children
But gentrification is kicking them out of their building
A generation of babies born without health-care
Families homeless, thrown the fuck off the welfare
Homicide Harlem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
Homicide Harlem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
Homicide Harlem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
Homicide Harlem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
It's like Cambodia the killing fields uptown
We live in distress and hang the flag upside down
The sound of conservative politicians on television
People in the hood are blind so they tell us to listen
They vote for us to go to war instantly
But none of their kids serve in the infantry
The odds are stacked against us like a casino
Think about it, most of the army is black and latino
And if you can't acknowledge the reality of my words
You just another stupid motherfucker out on the curb
Trying to escape from the ghetto with your ignorant ways
But you can't read history at an illiterate stage
And you can't raise a family on minimum wage
Why the fuck you think most of us are locked in a cage
I give niggaz the truth, 'cause they pride is indigent
You better off rich and guilty than poor and innocent
But I'm sick of feeling impotent watching the world burn
In the era of apocalypse waiting my turn
I'm a Harlem nigga that's concerned with the future
And if you're in my way it'd be an honor to shoot ya
Uproot ya with the evil that grows in my people
Making them deceitful, cannibalistic and lethal
But I see through the mentality implanted in us
And I educate my fam about who we should trust

Homicide Harlem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
Homicide Harlem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?

Or give America Biggie and Tupac flashbacks

To memorize a ghostwritten shit verse and spit it back
I won't let your wack rhymes redefine lyricism
For a whole generation with their fathers in prison
You live inside the image of an Era that's gone
Like government officials trying to justify Vietnam
I'll leave niggaz traumatized like they momma died
And they was responsible for the driveby homicide
And I don't market revolution, I live it
What you think cause you fake everyone else is a gimmick
Jealous bickering, industry slaves, the nerve of you
Like a child prostitute born into a life of servitude
Until we murder you making the red carpet burgundy
The Psycho Realm and the streets were I prefer to be"
21,Homeland And Hip Hop,2003,Revolutionary Vol. 2 (2003),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"To think about the origins of Hip Hop, in this culture, and also about Homeland Security, is to see that there are, at the very least, two worlds in America: One of the well-to-do, and another of the struggling. For if ever there was the absence of Homeland Security, it is seen in the gritty roots of Hip Hop. For the music arises from a generation that feels, with some justice, that they have been betrayed by those who came before them. That they are, at best, tolerated in schools, feared on the streets, and almost inevitably destined for the hell holes of prison. They grew up hungry, hated, and unloved, and this is the psychic fuel that generates the anger that seems endemic in much of the music and poetry. One senses very little hope, above the personal goals of wealth, to climb above the pit of poverty.
In the broader society, the opposite is true: For here, more than any other place on earth, wealth is so wide spread, and so bountiful, that what passes for the middle class in America could pass for the upper class in most of the rest of the world. Their very opulence and relative wealth makes them insecure, and ""Homeland Security"" is a governmental phrase that is as oxymoronic, as crazy as saying ""Military Intelligence"", or ""The U.S Department of Justice"". They're just words, that have very little relationship to reality.
Now, do you feel safer now? Do you think you will anytime soon? Do you think duct-tape and Kleenex and color codes will make you safer?
From death row, this is Mumia Abu-Jamal."

Yeah nigga, Immortal Technique, metaphysics
The bling-bling era was cute but it's about to be done
I leave ya full of clips like the moon blocking the sun
My metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch
Like an escape tunnel in prison I started from scratch
And now these parasites want a percent of my ascap
Trying to control perspective like an acid flashback
But here's a quotable for every single record exec
Get your fucking hands out my pocket nigga like Malcolm X
But this ain't a movie, I'm not a fan or a groupie
And I'm not that type of cat, you can afford to miss if you shoot me
Curse to heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me
Immortal Technique stuck in your thoughts darkening dreams
No one's as good as good as me, they just got better marketing schemes
I leave ya to your own destruction like sparking a fiend
'Cause you got jealousy in ya voice like star scream
And that's the primary reason that I hate y'all faggots
I've been nice since niggaz got killed over 8-ball jackets
And Reebok Pumps that didn't do shit for the sneaker
I'm a heatseaker with features that'll reach through the speaker
And murder counter-revolutionaries personally
Break a thermometer and force feed his kids mercury
A&R's try jerking me thinking they call shots
Offered me a deal and a blanket full of small pox
You're all getting shot, you little fucking treacherous bitches
This is the business, and y'all ain't getting nothing for free
And if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company
You can call it reparations or restitution
Lock and load nigga, industrial revolution
I want fifty-three million dollars for my calloused hands
Like the Bush administration gave to the Taliban
And fuck packing grams nigga, learn to speak and behave
You wanna spend twenty years as a government slave
Two million people in prison keep the government paid
Stuck in a six by eight cell alive in a grave
I was made by revolution to speak to the masses
Deep in the club toast to truth, reach for your glasses
I'll burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards
Innocent deep in a casket, Colombian fashion
Intoxicated of the flow like thugs passion
You motherfuckers will never get me to stop blastin'
You better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion
You better off begging for twenty points from a label
You better off battling cancer under telephone cables
Technique, chemically unstable, set to explode
Foretold by the Dead Sea scrolls written in codes
So if your message ain't shit, fuck the records you sold
'Cause if you go platinum, it's got nothing to do with luck
It just means that a million people are stupid as fuck
Stuck in the underground a general, that rose to the limit
Without distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick
Revolutionary Volume 2, murder the critics
And leave your fucking body rotten for the roaches and crickets"
23,Internally Bleeding,2003,Revolutionary Vol. 2 (2003),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"(Immortal Technique)
The things I've seen in life will make you choke by surprise
Like an aborted fetus in a jar that opened it's eyes
Provoking my demise, I'll leave your spirit broken inside
Like the feeling of 50 million people hoping you'd die
And niggaz wonder why my heart is full of hatred an anger
Cause some bitch killed my first born song with a coat hanger
I strangled out the pain until my soul was empty and cold
Crippled and worthless, so I thought that it could never be sold
My mother told me that placing my faith in God was the answer
But then I hated God 'cause he gave my mother cancer
Killing her slow like the Feds did to the Black Panthers
The genesis of genocide is like a Pagan religion
Carefully hidden, woven into the holidays of a Christian
I had a vision of nuclear holocaust on top of me
And this is prophecy, the words that I speak from my lungs
The severed head of John the Baptist speaking in tongues
Like Che Guevara my soliloquies speak to a gun
Pain is slow motion like trees that reach for the Sun
Nigga the preaching is done 'cause I don't got a DJ
Like Reverond Run
I curse the life of any man who kills benevolent ones
I never asked to be the messenger but I was chosen
To speak the words of every African slave dumped in the ocean
Stolen by America tortured, buried, and frozen
Written out of the history books your children are holding
Internally Bleeding, cold blooded stripped of emotion
I go through the motions but there's no life in my eyes
It's like I'm hooked up to a respirator waiting to die
Hooked up to the fucking chair waiting to fry
Sooth an electrocution currently used in my execution
Producing thoughts at the speed of light, burning confusion
I'm losing my sight breathing is tight, the evening is white
I made my peace with the Lord and now I stand on his right...
Death is a another part of life...
(Chorus: Immortal Technique]
These are my last words, I'm having difficultly breathing
Dying on the inside, Internally Bleeding
Angel of death dragging me away while I'm sleeping
Watching my world crumble in front of me, searching for meaning
These are my last words, I'm having difficultly breathing
Dying on the inside, Internally Bleeding
Angel of death dragging me away while I'm sleeping
Watching my world crumble in front of me, searching for meaning"
24,Leaving The Past,2003,Revolutionary Vol. 2 (2003),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"They told me I would never make it, I would never achieve it
Reality is nourishment, but people don't believe it
I guess its hard to stomach the truth like a bulimic
It's a dirty game and nobody is willing to clean it
But this is for the paraplegics, people dreamin' of runnin'
Ladies married to men who don't please'em dreamin' of cummin'
Verbally murderous like David Berkowitz when I'm gunnin'
Some cowards on the internet didn't think I would sell
Scared to talk shit in person, 'cause they stuck in a shell
And couldn't understand the pain of being stuck in a cell
Hell is not a place you go if you're not a Christian
It's the failure of your life's greatest ambition
It's a bad decision to blindly follow any religion
I don't see the difference in between the wrong and the wrong
Soldiers emptyin' the clips at little kids and they moms
I'm just like a desperate motherfucker strapped to a bomb
Humanity is gone, smoked up in a gravity bong
By a democrat republican Cheech and Chong
Immortal Technique, you never heard me preachin' a song
I'm not controversial, I'm just speakin' the facts
Put your hands in the air like you got the heat to your back
And shake your body like a baby born addicted to crack
And since life is a gamble like the craps tables at Vegas
I freestyle my destiny, it's not written in pages
I hate it when they tell us how far we came to be
As if our peoples' history started with slavery
Painfully I discovered the shit they kept a secret
This is the exodus like the black Jews out of Egypt
I keep it reality based with the music I make
Blow up the truth to your face with the style I run wit'
Like the navy missiles that shot down flight 800
I'm like the Africans who came here before Columbus
And from the 1500s until after the model
I watch Latin America get raped in the sorrow
You see the Spaniards never left después de Colón
And if you don't believe me, you can click on Univision
I never seen so much racism in all of my life
Every program and newscast, all of them white
It's like apartheid with 10 percent ruling the rest
That type of stress will make me put the fucking tool to your chest
Step in my way nigga, I wouldn't wanna be ya
I burn slow like pissing drunk with gonorrhea
I'll do a free show in North Korea, burning the flag
While Jay Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag
Tryin' to confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:
Capitalism and democracy are not synonymous
You swallow propaganda like a birth control pill
Sellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill
But that will never be me, 'cause I am leavin' the past
Like an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass
Like a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash
Unbreakable Technique leavin' the plane crash
I'm out with the black box and I refuse to return
I spit reality, instead of what you usually learn
And I refuse to be concerned with condescending advice
'Cause I'm the only motherfucker that can change my life
(Ending)
Some people think I won't make it
But I know that I will
Escape the emptiness
'Cause that shit is slow and it kills
The flow and the skill
I made y'all believe it at last
You can make the future
But it starts with leaving the past"

Sometimes you might have to brandish a motherfuckin firearm

Lick shots for the revolution
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots

Where the fuck you niggaz aimin at?
Where you aimin at? Where you aimin at?
This is only for the hardcore wherever you at, yeah

Volume one cop killa, hip-hop has never been realer
Volume 2 shot up the president like a guerrilla
New York police state capital tried to swallow me
Locked me longer than Puerto Rico been a colony
Thirteenth Amendment slavery property
And now they signin rappers that promote their philosophy?
Fuck that, nigga hip-hop is not Republican
That's just the white motherfuckers that own the publishin
And get the fuck out, if you want the foreigners gone
I paint the White House black and park my car on the lawn
Marry a Muslum girl and fuck her five times a day (WHAT?)
Every time right before we shower and pray (HA!)
You damn right the AK, symbolize a jihad
But a holy war, is a conversation with God
You bitch niggaz misinterpret what you don't understand
Stackin the wrong sign can end up, shootin your man
Shootin each other, shootin your brother
Aimed the gun at the right motherfucker
And leave him colder than the prison in Russia
Or America's white power structure
Niggaz love to say ""Fuck revolution!""
Until the jury comin' and move for the prosecution
And them brothers act like a born-again Huey Newton
Forgot about the bullshit music they was producin
But my niggaz aim precisely, through the confusion - AND
(Crooked.I)
I got a hundred shooters with me, Rugers shoot you through the kidney
Stand in front of the judge and lie quicker than Scooter Libby
I'm runnin' through the city - dear God
If I murk the racist Rush Limbaugh I wonder would you forgive me? (huh?)
Somebody told me Glenn Beck as the clan's over
See ya, time to let him see a damn soldier
Flip your Landrover, I told ya I blam toasters
Gun pop off like the mouth of Ann Coulter
This is my gangsta religion
See I aim with precision, point blank the position
I'm black as the ancient Egyptians
Before European historians went and changed the description
I'm blamed for the 'caine in the kitchen
The C.I.A. playin' with the pigeons, same pain that I'm pitchin (yeah)
Listen, you dudes better watch the hook
I'm a boxer, coppers'll come up, Hoffa look
They wanna get rid of this conscious crook
Like I'm agnostic, apocryphal non-canonical gospel book
But I ain't goin' nowhere, that's the motherfuckin truth
America don't care for its inner city youth - so I

Cop murdered by the certain burner turned in the back of his sternum
He flirted with pullin me over for bein brown, I bust
Now he in the back of the truck with Don Imus
I must, take aim when I lick shots
Throw stray bullets like when Nas got off of Pharoahe Monch
These pigs wanna see us dead inside a jail cell
Turn us from Shawn Carters to Shawn Combs to Shawn Bell
My temper 'bout to break like levees in New Orleans
Catch Jimmy Iovine when he refinance his mortgages
Kid illusion is dead, we movin with the blue and the red
Latin Kings, Giuliani with a gat to his head
Y'all don't lick shots like killers aimin at the Feds
Y'all lick shots like Jenna Jameson and Superhead
Pigs slice to Venice and beef at the benefits meet
Buried him on Venice Beach with the flies and the bees
Bzzzt - Chino, and Immortal Tech'
Kill shit like the Chinito at Virginia Tech (what's fuckin' with that?)
And Jacob ain't your friend, he's a fuckin' jeweler
BLAP, BLAP! I shoot the cats off your fuckin' Pumas!
(Adjusted Chorus)
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
Lick shots for the revolution
Lick shots, throw rocks, bomb blocks, guns cocked
But watch where the fuck you shootin'
Where you aimin at, for the fame in rap
Where the fuck you niggas aimin' at
Where you trainin' at
Fuck the game of rap

Why the fuck you think they pushing military recruitment?
America been platinum and she afraid of recoupment
So when you try to close the border and don't let us in
I'll overthrow California with 20 million Mexicans
Cubans and Chinese who came looking for freedom
Till they realised America was run by a demon
And I don't mean George Bush he was a fuckin' Zero

And then planned it, it sounds simple but stupid niggas wont understand it

Coughing up blood, like, what the fuck happened?
Raising my risk of cancer's the answer homie
But after drinking something, it's nothing, like puffing a bogey
Now I could blame the same product placement in movies, all the commericals of Scarface in a jacuzi
But now I'm living it
Damn, I should have never took that first cigarette
I fucked up like your girl was riding on top of me
I shoulda took it to trial, I never got to plea
But this ain't a Christian nation, motherfucker please
America never taught me to turn the other cheek
'Cause I'm from Harlem, the north of Manhattan
We knock niggas out and make them bounce like Ricky Hatton
But wilding on the corner got me turned back from the Canadian border
I knew she was a virgin, when I first met her
Rocking stockings popping out of the Catholic school sweater (?)
Mom told her she could do better than a criminal
17 year old pyschotic trying to be lyrical
I never meant to break her heart or fuck up her life
But I was careless, instead of treating her right
I seen her again at some club stripping and wondered if I could have made her life different
I joined the army looking for money to go to college
But they ain't paid me a quarter of what they fucking promised
Extending my tour, treating me like a sucker
That's the reason officers get fragged, motherfucker
Don't give me speeches on how you respect and you love me
But no body armour and a lightly armoured humvee?
My family's lonely and you want me to re-enlist for 30 grand homie?
No
Yeah, when I was young, I got signed to a record label
The deal looked so good when it was on the table
They paid for my cable, cribs, cars and jewellery
The studios, the women, there's nothing they wouldn't do for me
Except stop screwing me and publishing my royalties
How the fuck are you dog when there's no loyalty?
Word to the street, I should have gone independent like Immortal Technique
Some people learn from mistakes and don't repeat them
Others try to block the memories and just delete them
But I keep them as a reminder, they're not killing me
And I thank god for teaching me humility
Son, remember, when you fight to be free
See things how they are and not how you'd like them to be
'Cause even when the world has fallen on top of me
Pessimism is an emotion, not a philosophy
Knowing what's wrong doesn't imply that you're right
And it's another one you suffered to apply in life (?)
And I'm no rookie
And I'm never gonna make the same mistake twice, pussy"

Replaced it with a lifeless, anorexic white bitch
The fashion industry, got 'em in a funny spot
Self hatred leaking out their mouth like a money shot
Movie star, Hollywood, Babylon fantasy
Bunch of peacock bitches in a cocaine canopy
And if your healthy they make you think you're a manatee
Look how they invented this Eurocentric insanity.
Got you brainwashed, to the point your bleaching your skin
Blind to the truth and can't see the beauty within
'Cause ain't nothing wrong with exercising and tightening your thighs
But there's something wrong with contacts that lighten your eyes
We're going backwards from hip-hop in the park
To the experiments by Dr Kenneth Clarke
So after the Cannabis, imma have to handle this
Release the pressure on her and open her like an amethyst.

Their lies can't phase ya, beauty
You gotta know who you are (know who you are baby)
Stay strong and always remember, the truth in your heart
Don't forget there are those who benefit from your scars
Believing (?) I was natural.
(Verse 2: Immortal Technique)
The business of beauty isn't a natural model
It's built to be the opposite of the cultures we topple
These magazines got you caught in a hustle
'Cause when you starve yourself, your body doesn't burn fat it burns muscle
And men who don't even like women control the business
That's why the women look like men and the men like bitches
I break it down as God as my witness
Remember Sambo, caricature characteristics
Now who got the collagen under their lipstick
Implanted Arabic hips, surgical sickness
A bi-polar society, that claims to be righteous
Spray painting artificial melanin tryna be like us
Living in a pathetic epidemic of schizophrenics
Buying a synthetic body with credit
You mad that I said it, but you know that I'm right
Find the natural beauty and get you some natural love tonight.

Car-jack you and kidnap you in front of your house
And while you tied up by that shotgun while I'm driving down south
I'll push the pedal to setenta and kick you the fuck out
Solamente to look back and have something to laugh about
I doubt that you really want Technique as an enemigo

This large and didn't realize that there were ""some enemies"" present.'
(Verse One)
I'm a weapon that fires
Lyrical projectiles with no mercy
I'm cold blooded like reptiles
Touch a pregnant bitch and make her give birth to a dead child
Every time I flex styles
Niggas vacate the premises and become exiles
I manufacture rhymes like textiles of x-files
And lighten juveniles
Living life with no purpose
Organize an army that will make the devil's nervous
Competition is worthless
Like the electoral vote
If you provoke I'll break your motherfucking neck in a yoke
Your better off throwing your shitty life away sniffing coke
Technique will choke you into a spiritual state
And it will take a lake of hydrochloric acid to soften this
I'll fake your parents suicide and kill you in the orphanage
But I inspire ideological metamorphosis
Stop talking shit or I'll make your existence a memory
So you can have me frozen cryogenically for centuries
But I'll break the ice if anyone on the planet mentions me
I'll burn a hypocritical flag intentionally
Explosive revolutionary
Chemistry's my destiny
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fucking mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future you'll worship those that descended from me
(Verse Two)
When I fight you I won't smite you
I'll use a HIV infected needle to strike you
As well as anyone that vaguely resembles or looks like you
And just to spite you I'll force your children
At gun point to bite you
And rip a piece off
To start the beef off of the rest of your petty limited life
I'm coming at cha to catch ya by surprising the scythe
Nobodies stupid enough to back ya when tactically attack ya
Because my style is nasty like protruding bone fractures
And you're a played out dirty pussy devil
Like Margaret Thatcher
But technique never get captured inside the rapture
'Cause I mastered the art of causing natural disasters
You should learn the difference
In between the students and the master
My stature is the dispatcher of damaging decibels
And even though my starving people are considered expendable
I consecutively escape the racist corporate tennicles
I spit raw kinetic energy that's immeasurable
Retaliation for perpetration is unendable
Mercy is not extendible

Without the hidden camera, and the 12 year old girl
Let's face it you're basic, you aren't half the man that I am
I'll throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand
Give me a hundred grand, give me your watch, give me your chain
That's your girl? Bitch get over here, give me some brain!
I'll bust off on her face, and right after this segment
She'll probably rub it in her pussy, trying to get herself pregnant
I said it I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies
Like pro-lifers, that support the death penalty
And don't talk about war, when niggas know that your puss
A fucking hypocrite draft-dodger like George Bush
Don't push me nigga, 'cause I'm close to the edge
And I'll jump off with a rope that's wrapped around your head
Send a death fetus to my ex on Valentine's Day
The safety's off nigga, so get the fuck out my way
Look motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter
A raging alcoholic like the President's daughters
Disgusting flows like third world country tap-water
But before I hit the border, someone give me a quarter
'Cause I'm a prank call, Cop-Shot, just for kicks
Pay back, for every time that they called me a spic
And Puerto Rican chicks tell me that I fuck like I'm 
And Dominican women call me the 
They call me 
, I'd rather get fired than quit
I get unemployment, you work and we making the same shit
How dare you niggas criticize, the way that I spit
You coffee shop revolutionary son-of-a-bitch
But you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay
When niggas speculate, what the fuck Pac would say
You don't know shit, about a dead man's perspective
And talking shit will get your neckbone disconnected
Disrespected, niggaz don't ""show no love""
Why you trying to be hardcore, you fucking homo thug
And don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote
'Cause if you can take a fucking dick, you can take a joke
I'll choke your friends in front of you, to prove that you be falling off
And you won't do shit about it, like the Church during the Holocaust
Kalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire
Obnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire
Daaaaamn homie, in high school I beat the shit out of you and your man homie
Your girl wanna blow me and don't even know me
She lonely and she think you a phony
I'll take a piss on a development deal from Sony, or Def Jam
Cause you like, all of the rest man
This ain't a verse, this shit talk at the end of the song
And you can suck a dick, if you think I ended it wrong
Fuck you and I'm gone, fuck y'all niggas!
Piece to the strong hold, EO dub
Word-A-Mouf, Forbidden Chapters
IAK niggas, westpoe killing you slow
The plague; I murder a show, you don't even know
Yeah, foul play nigga

Akir: Yo tech, it's the last call baby it's good
Immortal Technique: Yeah, you know a remix just feels right dog?
Akir: Before we get outta here, you gotta drop one last gem on them
Knahmsayin?
Immortal Technique: No question, it's like the elders told me
No one person can do anything, but everyone can do something
So we gotta rep, for all the niggaz that ain't here right now
Akir: The outro tip, the One Remix, yo
(Akir)
One Enterprises, comprises the artist and the sound
The pen and paper plays my savior while I'm getting down
Pray for my nieghbors as a favor for holding me down
Slave for my papers as I savor the way that it pounds
It's underground, but the blatent vibrations widely found
Facing the nation complacent radio stations now
Stop hesitaing and contemplating the way we paitient
Start motivating and get them playin' the shit we sayin'
Ain't no delayin in this war that we gettin' slayed in
Cause times a waistin while we stand adjacent to abrasions
They fouls are more than flagrant
And so I see the prisons cages while I pound the pavement
Looking for payment saying fuck enslavement
Usin' the tools of old ancients
Announcing my engagement to this music that we making
Ain't no faking on tracks, and we ain't never come wack (never!)
Immortal Technique and Akir y'all niggaz fear us that's a wrap
It's like
One love
One music
One people
One movement
One heart
One spark
One, One, One, One
One gift
One lift
One stance
One shift
One way
One day
One, One, One, One, One
(Immortal Technqique)
Immortal Technique in the trenches with my nigga Akir
Our family surived the genocides so we can be here
And now we enterprise the aftermath, one in the same
Living the revolution till we catch one in the brain
And even then my spirit will return in heavenly form
And wipe the chess board clean, of my enemies pawns
The red don communist threat, buried and gone
So they invented a war, the government can carry on
It makes me wonder if the word of god is lost in the man
This is for the children of Iraq, lost in the sand
This is for the illest emcees that'll never be known
And this is for all the soldiers that'll never come home
I wrote this for Mumia, stuck in a beast
For people who, march in the streets, and struggle for peace
For hood niggaz, born rugged, never rocking Versace
Eddie Ramierez's cousin George, and my old friend Sashi
Chris from the block, and all my niggaz stuck in a cell
Paul Wolfowitz, motherfucker I'll see you in hell
My destiny is to show the world, that the music is real
Go back in time and play this shit, for the slaves in the field
And for my children in the future, waiting to breathe
People slowly dying hanging on, waiting to leave
Believe when I'm gone, and this album's on a library shelf
I'll be one with god and one with you and everything else
(Immotal Technique talking)
Yeah...
Revolutionary Volume 2 has been brought to you
By the type of motherfuckers who ain't scared of shit
And if you playing this album, and I'm no longer here
And sometime far away from when I recorded this
Remember that history
Isn't the way the corperate controlled media made it look like
Read between the lines and free your mind
Revolution is the birth of equality
And the anti-thesis to oppression
But this is only built for real motherfuckers
So when I'm gone, don't let nobody I never got along with
Try to make songs kissing my ass, recycling my beats or my vocals
The shit is real over here man
Thank you for listening, and thank you for supporting independent Hip Hop
The heart and soul of our culture
Keeping the truth alive
Goodnight my people... goodnight..."
33,Open Your Eyes,2008,The 3rd World (2008),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"We're here because of you
We're here because you were there
We've arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation
To seek the fulfillment of a promise of America
We were promised a better life in our home countries, where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently
Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury
Some corporations are more efficient than government, but their motivation is not the health or the well being of the people, it's only about profit, everything else, their image, their human resources, their public relations, only exist to protect the reality behind it
Once upon a time, we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition, that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us and so they privatized everything, everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture, by those who never had our interests at heart, they didn't care about our survival or well being, they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land, by exploiting our people, our industry and our resources
They took everything we built and made it theirs, first by creating racism to justify slavery, building the capital for capitalism and then when they gave us what they call liberty, everything we had was still owned by them, our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy and that we would have freedom, but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom
The freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and give us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table
Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God
(Open your eyes before you die)
And while some used missionaries and donations to off set this abuse, other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes, using war, disease and sanctions that killed millions, they supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people, because their loyalty was to those who enable them, enstored them and kept them in power, they became the bastard children of American industry, kleptocracy, government's of thievery, they protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits
The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars, right wing death squads, execute political dissidents, sympathetic clergy and even overthrow democratically elected governments and so the age of revolution began again, they painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the market
But the free market has never been free, because the market does not regulate itself, it is manipulated like a puppet and it survives because of its image, destroy the image and the enemy will die
Such is the same in the rap industry, but the major label super powers treat the underground like the 3rd world, when they need new assets, new artist to prostitute or sign and put on a shelf to use their songs
When they needed new concepts, music and publishing to steal from the producers, they came to the underground, to the 3rd world, they took our culture, our property and our industry and our resources, even using our own people to help them exploit us
But behind the mask of efficiency, they claimed that we need to succeed, they're no better than us, they're economic advertising was always a lie, a few got rich but most were given an illusion of wealth, almost as if it was designed for failure
Opportunity comes at the price of soul and the music, so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture, glittering rented jewelery, the cars, the IMF loans, the seeds with suicide genes, 20 year contracts and oil bloody money
Build your defenses my independent brothers and sisters, they'll stop at nothing to get what they want, they paint the 3rd world, underground, as savage and backward, but the super powers are no less corrupt, they've just learned to disguise it better, 'cause they fix elections too, they embezzle tax money, they go to war for resources, they fund terrorism for their own benefit, and when there's enough at stake... history's taught us that they'll even assassinate their own president.

The fuck?
(And get the fuck out of here)
Ahaha
Ayo man, its about motherfucking time man
Ayo g, ayo g, son, I got my papers man
I'm out this motherfucker
I'm out of jail and I'm never going back again
Never selling heroin, never selling crack again
Don't work for the government coke packaging
Don't fire indiscriminate with the Mac again
My people are stuck behind glass like a mannequin
They pretend to give a fuck, just like the Vatican
Second chance, faith based, two faced, samaritans
Everytime we come back, they...
I'm out of jail and I'm never going back again
Never selling heroin, never selling crack again
I'm out of jail and I'm never going back again
I'm outta, I'm outta, (I'm out this motherfucker!)
I'm out of jail and I'm never going back again
Never selling heroin, never selling crack again
Don't work for the government coke packaging
Don't fire indiscriminate with the Mac again
My people are stuck behind glass like a mannequin
They pretend to give a fuck, just like the Vatican
Second chance, faith based, two faced, samaritans
Everytime we come back, they keep on cashing in
Prison labor, third world sweatshop comparisons
Till we kidnap the whole fucking garrison
Yeah, poverty makes people do reckless things
But corporations do worse to protect they bling
Prisons are more overcrowded than the rap game
They say you are more likely to go to jail with a black name
Freakonomics that I speak through ebonics
And fuck phonics, little niggas is hooked on chronic
But if you on stage with the DEA as your hype man
Don't get yourself locked up and blame the white man
We transformed gangs and criminal enterprises
Using OGs as advisors
Before they send us to war after they divide us
But I won't let them use us like Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders
My movement's like a jujitsu kata
I graduated outta prison, so fuck my alma mater, nigga

Fuck this place baby, I'm coming home again
Shorty wrapped around me, so I'll never be cold again
Never have to knock a nigga out for the phone again
Prison ain't the place that you find your rite of passage in
It's slavery with nasty food in your abdomen
Middle passage, bottom of the ship, how they pack 'em in
Perpetrators on some fake shit, sweeter than saccharin
Jailhouse snitches without corroborating evidence
Niggas selling niggas out for two to three benjamins
But now I'm free, hit the block eating Entenmann's
Benihana in and out, flow for me to enter in
Newspaper pencillin', trying to pay the rent again
Ex-con job interview, nobody answering
Feeling violent from the frustation I got pent up in
But not trying to go back to the place I was sent up in
Turn my own life around, fuck the establishment
Listening to hip hop like where the fuck the talent went?
How the fuck did you replace lyrics with your swaggerin'?
I'ma fix that rhymin on with the magnum
I roll up in a caravan, full of north africans
My squad got more soldier niggas than the saracens
'Cause just watch when the terrorists attack again
Their reaction's gonna be draft us and send us back again
I'm on parole, and I'll never be alone again,
Fuck this place baby, I'm coming home again.
Shorty's wrapped around me, so I never be cold again.
Never have to knock a nigga out for the phone again.
Prison ain't the place that you find your rite of passage in,
It's slavery with nasty food in your abdomen.

And the focal point when I'm campaignin'
Is to put FEMA to work on a plantation in Camp David
Demand payment for New Orleans with the best of swordsmen
Launching missiles at the White House while Techs performin'
On the lawn and I'll just let 'em burn till deaths confirmed
Laid to rest with worms cause other wise they'll never learn
I'll form a coup attempt with anthrax through the feds
From outta package I got in the mail that you just sent
But I got a better punishment for these Republicans
I'd let 'em live so they can see us overthrow the government
Let's fuck with 'em, have the first lady beat me off
Till my semens launched and I skeet across her face like Peter North
And I won't leave a doubt what we about when I cream her mouth
Or leave a drought bleeding out on Condoleeza's couch
I'll seek this route without regrets, and drink a brew
Then think of you 'cause if it's the last fucking thing I do I'll-
(Ras Kass)
Yeah, Immortal Technique, Rassy
Nigga, I never forget nothing nigga
51% of the world bank is owned by the U.S. Treasury
Robbin' 3rd world countries out all their resources and equity
When Afghanistan was fightin' the Russians
Reagan and Bush gave Bin Laden weapons and told him get to bussin'
We even called them ""Freedom Fighters""
Finance the corps with CIA imported cocaine
That whole Iran-Contra scandal
Niggas took the blame, started a war on drugs
Meanwhile Russia's defeated and America thinks ""more oil for us""
Takeover, set up a puppet government, Arabs ain't bearin' it
So the same Freedom Fighters, George W. called 'em terrorists
Poetic justice, payback's a bitch
These fuckin' hypocrites like Bill O'Reilly
Right-wingers deserve what they get
Rush Limbaugh, drug addict
Giulliani, sex scandal
I wanna thank white supremacists and show you how my techs handle
My next man was technologically designed
To spit sauce till all you stupid ass execs at Capitol resign
...I am vindictive... faggots.
(Immortal Technique)
Hahahaha... yeah, I got somethin' for you motherfuckers
Want it? Here you go!
The first payback that I would accomplish
I'd draft children from the senate and congress
Pompous religious right made suicidal
When I expose Josephus for ghost writing the Bible
Making nuclear silos bomb the world with hydro
Chinese dragon-sized blunts, Americabo
And everyone flashin' a gun on a DVD
I'd make them niggas shoot it out with NYPD
And every fucker that didn't buy my CD
I'd stab the revolution in their neck with an IV
See me own the world, I'd give it back to the poor
I'd give a last name to every single son of a whore
Hard to the core, fuck what the game is
Niggas pop on their block but they globally nameless
I'll show the hood real gangsters and make 'em famous
Langley, Virginia, where my connect for cocaine is
I'll make everybody fuckin' have the world darkening
I'll make rap about lyrics, not beats and marketing
Replace every raped virgins broken hymen
Holdin' De Beers reclining while they choke on they diamonds
My designing is like Frances ford coppola rhymin'
Buildin' a universe inside solitary confinment
Reverse Rockefeller's laws and bring Mumia home
And serve the president freestylin' off of the dome
Hahahahaha
A message to the outgoing president
Hey, I got a great idea nigga, kill yourself
It's so funny I thought about it the other day
You should probably kill yourself
Uh... why don't you kill yourself?
Ha ahahahahaha

Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
Your government receives from the drug industry.
Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
This money, which is in the billions, is coming from
Your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
Our national product, which is of course cocaine.
Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
Government is spending millions of dollars to
Eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
Same time, we are doing business with the very same
Government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.
Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
Characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.
(Beat starts)
*Two Men Speak in Spanish*
(Immortal Technique - Worker)
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coca fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to Jesucristo when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position
(Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss)
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials
(Diabolic - Peruvian Leader)
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people... the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fascist state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see
(Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor)
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya... mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
C'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough
(Poison Pen - Drug Dealer)
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot?
Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my yayo
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose (?), chop it and bag it
(Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer)
Taking pictures and tapping phones
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo',
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack or blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room
(C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate)
Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and soon
Feds will be up in your mouth... like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
Players do favors for governors and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier
(Immortal Technique Speaking)
The story just told is an example of the path that
Drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
Every state in this country. It's a lot deeper than
The niggas on your block. So when they point the
Finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:
(Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City"")
I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
Lawmakers, the politicians, the Colombian drug lords,
All you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
Like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
The ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
Is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
Business. This is the American way."
37,Positive Balance,2001,Revolutionary Vol. 1 (2001),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Big Zoo, uh
Technique, uh
Positive balances, uh, uh
(Verse 1 - Big Zoo)
Pound for pound
I'm the most positive when I bust mine
The Zoo adds on like a plus sign
Addition, that's the key in the ignition
With no pause, I propel to pole position (Vroom!)
Ahead of the pack, light years ahead of the wack
I give a fiend a Good Book, instead of the crack
That's the gold mine, negativity can't hold mine
The black bear's headed for the gold mine (look out, look out)
And then I'm positive as Showtime
I make negative MC's switch styles in no time
They change teams, rhyme about kings and queens
Instead of how they sellin' work to fiends
Then I, switch thugs into soldiers
Those that have given up on God to praise J Hova (Damn!)
The rap Ice Age is over
And positivity protects the Z boulder boulder
(Chorus - Immortal Technique w/Big Zoo ad-libs)
Yeah, you know how it goes, positivity, yeah
My opinion is solid ground but you're a common hater
Splitting and dividing on numbers like a denominator
Third-eye navigator movements are necessary
Everything you see in videos is secondary
You need positivity like you need respect in jail
Because without balance you'll be making negative record sales
Neg-neg-negative record sales, ziga-zam, Technique, like this
(Verse 2 - Immortal Technique)
I jerk off inside books and give life to words
Leaving concepts stuck together you probably never heard (what?)
I love when people think I'm psychologically disturbed
Cause it means I overloaded their neurological nerves
Rappers try to serve me with disgusting incompetence
But I keep it positive with ultimate dominance
Meditating with Native Americans close to Providence
I speak to the spirits of ancestors at pow-wows
But rumor has it that you getting raped like Lil' Bow Wow
Now listen industry motherfuckers, don't get offended
Remember, that I'll bring an end to your pretender agenda
And render contenders dismembered, bend the fabric of time (what? what?)
And put your soul in a blender
You living a lie like thinking Jesus was born in December
Instead of catering to labels, something gotta give
I'll rip the electrons out your body and make you positive
I seen a lot of kids come and go with marketing gimmicks
Because without balance, you don't last more than a minute
This ain't a game, I'll beat the shit out you at the line of scrimmage
I rock shows in the ghetto, nigga you stuck in the village
I wanted to spit on the radio since I was eleven
But I can't afford the pay-ola for Hot 97's
So I make paper underground, and I'm soon to blow
Moving tapes like Biggie's ghost at Bad Boy studios
*Biggie - Hypnotize sample*"
38,Rebel Arms ,2008,The 3rd World (2008),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"What you thought it was over?
This ain't over till we say it's over mother fucker
Ey yo Tech, what do you think about the rap game right about now?
It's all bullshit you know that I know that,
Hey come along with me man well have a budget
I didn't get into this for that.
Well that's all there is
If that's all there is I've been wasting my mother fucken time with you
Yeah yeah uh
(Verse 1 - Immortal Technique)
The game is polluted with rappers that are really snitches
And most DJs are nothing but industry bitches
And we don't got no mansion or riches
But we got guns and knives and your children's pictures
And everybody loses in war, but you lose more
What do you think we brought back the Panthers and the Zulu for?
Immortal, witch doctor, made himself a voodoo doll
For every motherfucker that fronted that I can recall
Fuck the industry, don't call me, you can't get with me
I leave niggas hanging, like Mississippi
RBG to the last drop of blood in my body
Or the feds drag me away, like a Tsunami
But I'll be back, like a fresh body bag from Iraq
Like a Baltimore slum, during the resurgence of crack
Brown and black, like the AK I keep in the strap
While we waiting on the next stock market collapse
(Verse 2 - Fatz Da Assassin)
Territorial oratory editorial
Fuck around I'll be the cause of your lifes memorial
I write wraps territorial east coast porters too
Never crossing borders still I will coastally slaughter you
I'm better than all of you, vendettas be mauling you
You talking cheddar, I'm a shredder, Ill sever it off of you
I never remorse for you, no letters endorsing you
Pole position in the coffin is what is costing you
The Caucus bosses, who control the fortunes too
The mortgages of a cultural loss through and through
But it's the Rebel Arms, Gods speed with devils charm
The bitch made gets switch blades in every arm
And this way we ix-nay on any harm
'Cause snakes play and fakes lay like hidden bombs
We march in unison, the souls is true within
Eternal mission with shit, a lifetime of doing it
(Verse 3 - Goodtime Slim)
Stronghold said it, whoop yo bitch ass with batons
The rebel arms swarm inform like Voltron
Slash a Robeast you heard the Mark of the East
Running through cop land screaming Fuck the Police
Hormones in the water, they acting out of order
Like a pack of rabid wolves, they lambs for the slaughter
Crush your mandible rip the drums like animal
Eat MCs, they my own kind, I'm a cannibal
My regiments salute me, haters wanna shoot me
Kool-aid in they veins, they lawyers try to sue me
You sell crack in rap, did a skid bid
Multiple baby mommas, take care of your kids
Guillotine rap, shackles on your neck
Chemical warfare where punchlines connect
Da Circle played the snipe, with Immortal Tech
They calling the Blok Governor to drag 'em off the set
(Verse 4 - J. Arch)
Rebel Arms out for supremacy and move non-gimmicky
Related to royalty on each trip you mention me
Twist bars illishly, rebel against the infantry
Get more than your feet wet when I make you a memory
Cats not ready because they commercially industry
I make house calls on those afraid to visit me
Disrespect? I smash off the petty
From undisclosed lo-cays, move fast for the cheddy
Arch don't break dance, yet I rock steady
I jump on your scope to prove your aim not deadly
My shot to the top is like Mickey and Mal's medley
Flow milky like the tits of a chick that's top heavy
The Technique's Immortal so Rebel Arms the regiment
Archs styles nicer than other rappers ever been
My canteens full from when the doc don't got medicine
Five star general, frontline veteran"

Cause the game don't give a fuck if you're lyrical
And that's pitiful, so my position is pivotal
You can hate me all you like, but you worship the principle
I inspire revolution, the government's not invincible
Vietnam to Venezuela, trick knowledge, they pimping you
All up in the hood like McDonald's and liquor
Selling AIDS medicine, when we know you got the cure nigga (Woo)
You leery of conspiracy theory but hear me
Throw a business perspective, it makes more sense clearly
'Cause moreover, that's what we go to war over
And numbers don't lie, unless we do Bush and Gore over
Freemarkets make money disingenuously
But I invest in agriculture, biochemistry
Smart nigga from the hood, pussy, what type of crime is that?
But execs are like, ""You from Harlem? Where your diamonds at?"" (Stupid)
This is how pimps get pimped
And players get played
Rich people get robbed and
Broke niggas paid
New York, London, Chicago, Philly and LA
Miami, DC, B-more and out in the bay
Show me a pretty girl with the world stuck to her
And I bet you there's a brother that's tired of fucking her
Lots of niggas' girls is someone else's one night stand
I probably made some bitches nervous listening with they man (haha)
And if that offends somebody, I'm sorry, fuck you
What you think Revolutionaries don't like to fuck too?
You just gotta beware of dangerous couchi
Cover ya head like a kufi
Some rappers think they live in a movie
Until they get herpes and clap from a groupie
And I don't need to shout you out, nigga, you know who you be
Most people are only players 'cause they got played
And have not let go of that shit since the 7th grade
Yeah, you got your heart broke, life sucks doesn't it?
But you shouldn't fuck up somebody else's life because of it
Somebody did your mother like that, that's why you fatherless
Before jail and racist cops, that's what the problem is
This is how pimps get pimped
And players get played
Beautiful women get cheated on
And gangsters sprayed
Jersey, Detroit, Denver, Phoenix, Atlanta
Texas, Vegas, Seattle and fucking Louisiana
I'm not a crack rapper, I'm not a back packer (Hahaha)
I'm not a whack rapper, moonlighting as a bad actor
I treat labels like the projects, 'cause I'm a hater
Go to the Sony building and piss in the elevator
Cater the hustlers, crooks and cheap smugglers
Bootleg my own album to reach customers
Every city, state and country, the hood love me
Even Aborigines in Australia bump me
They say underground fans are all the color of talcum
But who the fuck you think buy 50 and Jay albums?
Who the fuck you think made Snoop and Dre platinum?
Call up any major record label and ask them
But there's some devils in disguise in hip hop
That belong at Republican fundraisers with Kid Rock
I hope one of my fans has one of your kids shot
And blames it on Acid, Prozac and Slip Knot
You a pussy acting hard like a bitch cop
I drop you to the floor, like a reverse wrist lock
Eat your food and shit on you, like a highway pit stop
And make revolutionaries out of kids that used to flip rocks
The government pimped 9/11 to go to Iraq
And history repeats itself right on track (How?)
First as a tragedy, and then the comedy begins (Why?)
'Cause it's funny, motherfuckers don't see it come around again"
40,Revolutionary,2001,Revolutionary Vol. 1 (2001),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"(Men talking)
Yo load the fuck up (locked and loading)
You too (locked and loading sir)
Remember break that window when that cop comes in
And blow that motherfuckers head off
(Multiple gun shots) (Got him)
Yeah load it up again cause these motherfuckers
Are gonna come back for us. (Were ready)
We gotta be prepared in this day and age, we gotta
Be prepared for whatever comes the fuck at us. (Word up)
'Cause we are living revolutionarily. (Definitely)
You cannot second guess yourself in these days and times
There gonna throw whatever they can at you and you gotta
Be prepared for it, you gotta be prepared for anything
(Sample of Malcolm X)
""If liberty or dead,
There's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody!"" (crowd cheers)
No matter what the fuck life throws at me
I continue to make it threw indefinitely
Immortal technique defeats the odds repetitively
Until there ain't shit ahead of me competitively
Surviving the tough times is imperative to me
Looking at the whole world revolutionarily
(Sample of Malcolm X)
""They don't want to hear you old Uncle Tom handkerchief
Hand talking about... uh thee (inaudible), no.""
Technique will force you into strategical retreat
Because I dominate guerrilla warfare in the streets
There ain't no way to picture me without a victory speech
When I reach higher positions
Without the recognition of pissed on competition
'Cause I conquered there ambitions
In a systematic form like a religionist tradition
My mission is to take you, lyrically break you
Lyrically assassinate you
Lyrically incinerate your body and recreate you
To destroy the power that mentally incarcerates you
Cause even though I rip it better I could not forsake you
You're my people with the same oppressors so how could I hate you
The revolution of the mind that bring lee generates you
But when you come original people impersonate you, start to hate you
Cause the conflict is building within the ultimate sin
Is to be ashamed of your skin
My rhymes are like Jamaican over proof I make the room spin
Intoxicated flow I bleed vodka and brandy
Don't make me choke you down like Jon-Benet Ramsey
Something demands of me to rip this fucking shit uncannily
God commanded me to be a technological disease
And psychologically do battle with the best emcee's
*Inaudible* these in technique
'Cause I'm the capital of revolutionary nation that's infallible
Aztec like the Hannibal
Rip your heart out of your chest and feed it to the cannibal's
Your just a fucking animal but I'm the Neo Sapien
Cause my original civilization was based upon creation
You know theirs no escaping even though your heart is racing
I'll put your best disciple on academic probation
Fuck the litigation, fuck the best rapper nominations
And fuck the president I voted for assassinations
I'm saying fuck the federal bullshit investigations
Fuck the cover up of ghetto radiation extermination
Using my people for experimentation
And if doesn't play hip hop then fuck your radio station
(Sample of Malcolm X)
""Revolutions overturn systems, revolutions destroy systems!"" (crowd cheers)
Yo what the fuck happen to reality spitting rhyme slayers
These days everybody trying to be a thug or a player
Where did all the real motherfuckers go in the game
Bring back the break dancers and graffiti writers with fame
I remember hip hop before the mic cunt clapping
'Cause I used to drink forties with more flavor then these rappers
Lyrical ego trips doesn't make fortification
Your not dope enough, spit self glorification
So don't jerk me around cause my name ain't masturbation
Life is hard it'll leave you scarred 'cause I been threw shit
If you consider rap a job I suggest that you quit
Don't you understand the audience will listen and dance
In the club, crib or car or whatever they get the chance
To be emancipated start debating justice in the cipher
Why do you think project rooms look like the cells in Riker's
I'm explaining the significance or the reason behind it
There preparing your children for the prison environment
When you don't amount to shit prison becomes retirement
But I refuse to be took in to central booking in chains
Cause sleeping on the floor in cages starts to fuck with your brain
The system ain't reformatory, it's only purgatory
Close to hell but I rebel as begin to sparkle out
And tell my people how we fell into the trap that we live in
Because they locked us up in ghetto's and began to rape my women
So I leave the system Unforgiven like East Wood
'Cause I was bless with lyrical strength to do whatever I could
You should have seen it coming long ago when you were very young
My word is through the father, holy spirit and his fucking son
'Cause when I grab the mic device in front of Christ and start to rip it
I'll make Jesus turn around and say ""yo pop this nigga flipped it""
So talk about whatever and be what you wanna be
But don't mistake the way I break the faith for simple blasphemy
Cause through the highest frequencies in the NYC
I'm crushing 97.1 percent of MC's"

For all my free market, health care-robbin', stock-stealin', retirement fund fuckin'-with niggas.

Shout-out to the homies, Carnegie, O.G. Willie Randolph Hearst, Farouk, Rockefeller - the real Rockefeller, my main bitch Leona, pour out a little Louis the 13th, Scott Rothstein, Jack Abramoff, hold ya head.
My Rothschild niggas, let's get this money
I spend my day pimpin' America overseas
Pensions for the workers? Nigga please
Embezzlement etiquette, private settlement
I'm better with confederate rhetoric
From my mansion in Connecticut
Foreclose, evict hoes out of tenement
I twist words like a speech impediment
I hope you got good credit bitch
If not better get a new job with benefits
While I play golf with niggas I get chedda with
New money buys brand new carats
My old money bought your great grandparents
You got grills in ya mouth I ain't mad at ya
I own every gold mine in South Africa
Thanks baby you made me a billion
Plus I own a building, for each one of my children's children
That's the shit, snort coke in the whip
Miss U.S.A. suckin' my dick, yeah what
Fuck the law 'cause real jail is for suckas
I go to country club prison you dumb motherfuckers
 I am the 1%, fucking bitch
You know my C.E.O. corporate steez, please
Overthrow governments overseas in a breeze
Politicians in my pockets for a few hundred G's
So if I'm ever in court, my assets'll never freeze
I got a job and house and a bank account
When I'm out I doubt that's somethin' you could say
And if not then I'll fake death like Kenneth Lay
Make money every day the world burns on its axis
While y'all strugglin' to pay taxes
I'm gettin' my money the fastest
Memos and faxes, shredded up documents
Slush funds through the corrupt continents
But they don't want me indicted
'Cause they don't want my dirty laundry aired when I fight it
Don't get my lawyers excited
'Cause what good is a law if you can't rewrite it
I got C.I.A. traitors, dictators, so fuck y'all whistle-blowers and haters
 Shit
I'll invest money from Al-Qaeda
In the bank now then let the widows go to later
Capitalism's who I pray to, fuck the state of the world
Money talks so what the fuck I need to say to your girl
You know my C.E.O. corporate steez, greed
I treat countries like the I.M.F., down on your knees
Real gangsters run the world, fuck what you believe
I'll cut down a forest while y'all niggas burnin' some trees
I'll get your family murdered for a couple of G's
'Cause your workin' class money ain't fuckin' with me
You think rappers are rich 'cause of songs you heard
My labels made some money, and haven't rapped a fuckin' word
Yacht in the ocean coastin' with the sails out
Hey America, thanks for the bailouts
I made off like the Banco Ambrosiano
Got away scot-free like Il Vaticano
Activists act a bitch get mad at me
'Cause of my tax free charity
80% to the staff and company
And 20% to the homeless and hungry
The country gotta pay the Fed Reserve
Kick back to the banksters, haven't you learned
You protest cops who patrols on the street
But I bought city hall so I own the police
Email, Facebook, and the shit you tweet
All the phone companies, so I heard you speakin'
My suggestion is, your correction
No elections, sex with no affection
No invention would benefit the world of man
Will exist till I got the money in my hand
World bank, interest rate, damn rape on the spot
But I'm a gangster you gon' take my money like it or not, nigga
 I got your country in my pocket, motherfucker
You know my C.E.O. Masonic steez, cheese
Only little people pay all these taxes and fees
Since you were born we controlled what you watch and you read
And pretty soon were gonna, own the fuckin' air that you breathe
I take what I want, fucker, I don't have to say please
I'll convince you that it's good for you, take it and leave
You think Presidents are the face of a nation
I put 'em all where they are, end of the conversation

43,Sign of the Times,2011,The Martyr (2011),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"(Verse 1: Immortal Technique)
Imagine the word of God, without religious groupies,
Imagine a saviour, born in a Mexican hooptie,
Persecuted single mother in a modern manger,
You'd crucify him again, like a fucking stranger,
Tears of the anger are worth more than Diamonds or Rubies,
Imagine being locked up since Juvie,
Imagine changing your life and still going out like Tookie (Damn..),
Imagine Niggas talking shit, when they never knew me (Fuck!),
Imagine a movie, that depicted the pain in your life,
Like them kids in Afghanistan, chasing the kite,
For most of the world, that's what it's like,
Imagine if the woman you supposed to love for the rest of your life,
Is set to marry someone else at the end of the night,
They say you fight the greatest Jihad in your heart and your mind,
And fight the hardest when you start from behind,
So I dream the impossible all the time,
Fuck a Masonic design, America's future is mine,
Repeat that to yourself, 'cause if culture's a crime,
Then numbers tatted on your arm, aren't too far behind,
They can only conquer you after they murdered your mind,
So Rise Up! Muthafucka like the sign of the times (Rise),
I feel my body weakening, but my spirit is fine (Yeah!),
Ready to go to war with devils at the drop of a dime (Come On!),
And fight with my Rebel Army, until the stars are aligned!
(Native American Chorus)
(Verse 2: Immortal Technique)
Nostradamus was a white man's prophet,
Who predicated European's Supremacists logic,
Because the pilgrims and the Conquistador columns,
Killed more innocent people than Hitler and Stalin (Yes),
I guess the fortune-tellers skipped an anti-Christ or two,
Brothers give this to the O.G.s doing life with you,
And pray for the problems, with the Pope psychology,
So the Vatican will author an apology (For What!?),
For destroying the people's liberation theology,
Snatching the spirit of Jesus from people in poverty,
Business decisions, like keeping people in prison
But had the opposite effect, incarcerating religion,
That type of crooked politics imposed on the populace,
Is obvious, if you read the Northwood documents,
Forget the compliments, for what I recorded (Yeah),
And live for Revolution, instead of always dying for it!
Remember a bullet can never stop me (Never!),
My legions are led by the spirit of Haile Selassie, Watch Me!,
Even if I'm shot in the Shakra, I will prosper,
Doppler effect, bumping music out a helicopter,
Telling the Persians ""dig up Zoroaster!"",
And Tell them I came back, as the son of The Ahura Mazda,
Fish out the Philistine, Dagon, from the shores of Gaza,
And call Quetzalcoatl flying over La Raza,
This is my message to the older Gods,
I sacrifice you all to the Revolution like the Romanovs,
Lost in the desert, like the Hebrews of Israel,
The blood-clot system, try to kill me like sickle cell,
But I survived and I'm alive to fight another day,
Cocooned in a coma, I can still hear my mother pray!
Sister crying out to God, ""Please let my brother stay!""
Walking towards the light, but something is pulling me the other way!

It is not your time to die..."
44,Speak Your Mind (Hidden Track),2001,Revolutionary Vol. 1 (2001),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"You have to speak the truth
You have to speak your mind
Every time I speak my mind I'm lyrically critical
The pinnacle of being revolutionarily pivotal
Beyond anything ever studied that's metaphysical
Man fuck a minority, I'm not politically minimal
But obviously terminologies that are statistical
Are manufactured to be unequivocally subliminal
Transmitted by monopolized media visuals
So I riddle hypocritically pitiful criminals
Habitually utilizing typical rituals
With false pretense in attempts to be spiritual
TO individuals who believe in biblical miracles
Instead of themselves, because they're not thinking original
And the color of their skin makes them feel invisible
Like microscopic miscarriages lynched wit the umbilical
Only a fuckin' imbecile would think their uncorrectable
Cause your susceptible to becoming more than a spectacle
Remember that your flesh your blood and you body are dissectable
Ill beat you until your vegetable
And wake up in a hospital covered in poisonous chemicals
In a fetal position wit your face sewn to your testicles
Thinking that you were kidnapped by extraterrestrials
You got heart? I'm the blood that pumps in your ventricles
Technique, I'm like ya soul nigga... indispensable
Wit no respect for those that cower at the hour of revolution
Cause the government owes my people restitution
Instead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution
Conclusion is that you'll have to violently silence me
'Cause I raid the airwaves of cutthroat piracy
In school my teachers blinded me
But now I can see
I'm mentally and revolutionarily free
Broadening Horizons about what my people could be
If we wasn't set up to get shot locked or OD
You see families bleed because of corporate greed
And monopolizing weed is virtually impossible
So it won't be legalized and that's another obstacle
But I'm still rollin' up pocket fulls of tropical
The governments involved directly so its unstoppable
Like a nuclear rocket full of biochemical toxins that invade the ecological
Improbable that the average intellect could understand
So I encrypted this into hip hop that's in high demand
And spread it through the ghetto of every city like contraband
Stomp a man of any complexion with a devilish nature
'Cause I'm tryin' to save the earth, but your just next in line to rape her"

I leave government spies and murderers
Wrapped in plastic like Dominican furniture
I put the iron in you, like the center of Earth's curvature
And make your block turn into the border of Serbia
My flow's dirtier than juiced-up players in baseball
And beat you in the head like a sock with an 8-ball
You got Stockholm syndrome, and that's why I hate y'all
Cause you be biggin up the industry while they rape y'all
(Poison Pen)
I spazz out and beat the shit out niggaz
You fag out and beat the jizz out niggaz
Gloves (check) ski mask (check) duct tape (check)
Get abducted in Austin and recovered in Great Neck
Bed-Stuy, BestBuy, clique and rush the {?}
Rip up the pavement throw the whole block on you
Pop up, you gotta get it
Like Ricky and Boyz in the Hood
Stoppin' to scrath a lotto ticket
(Swave Sevah)
Yo! I feel the sudden surge given me the urge to speak (yo what up?)
Scream somthin that's absurd and disturb the peace (Fuck y'all!)
Throw a hot verse to beats; you see the music I'm a prisoner, hip-hop is my work release
I'm not the same Swave you knew, I'm a whole new person
More assertive and aggressive, my attitude worsened
I raise hell on this earth, your rap is over you Casanova's gon' end up like Gerald Levert

[All] Controlled demolition, we bringing the structure down!

Immortal technique, nigga, I'm the type to flip
'Cause me and my dogs fight to the death like Michael Vick's
And I don't hit women so I'm not gonna mangle your wiz
A prostitute with an AIDS race will handle the biz

Hit the block with a pen and glock, a ox and rocks, a devil spray
If that's a K, play yo' punk-ass infected with leprosy
Leave you half-murdered beyond recognition beat and indecent
Leave you with your plastic surgeon for a remix
(Swave Sevah)
Hey yo I'm hard-bodied with it
In these scars, contusions, concussions, fractures and pains you suffer from (I probably did it)
You ain't worth spit
I put a hit out on your mother
Then fuck up you and your four brothers

You play Scarface when a microphone's in the room
But you more like Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon
(Poison Pen)
Ass cap clappin' em
All this rap trash
Snatch them diamonds off their neck worth 50 dead Africans

Yo this dude is truly a joke
That stuff got you feelin' tough
Must be sniffin Peruvian coke

We spit cold war syndrome, it shatters the bones

Spread my dependence on your bitch face when the ???????

Thrown into submission holes and choked till you tap out

Let's go
Talk to 'em
Holla
Don't you get tired of hearing niggas saying that shit... all the time?!
Why don't you just shut the fuck up and rhyme nigga?!
Yeah, yeah
Used to run around getting my fight in the streets on
Back in the day, before Harlem had a green zone
What good is a good education with no direction
Like the right to vote but no one to vote for in an election
Like a gun with no bullets in the clip for protection
Like the crowd packed in the front, without the mid-section
Used to live robbing and stealing and being reckless
It took time for my mind to put the ghetto in perspective
I used to live in the back of a holding van
Used to be off beat like the white girl's shoulder dance
I wrote rhymes, acapella, no beat, behind bars
Shed blood to make it like the story behind scars
I used to be a battle champion in the meanwhile
Before some of you little fuckers learned to freestyle
Prematurely senile, underground pre-Madonnas
I was Oliver North during Iran-Contra
'Cause I never snitched and that's backed by evidence
I learned it by watching you, don't ever forget it, bitch
'Cause everybody knows how the government do
They never snitch on themselves, but they want you to snitch on you
Evolution from Australpithicus
Primitive commercial shit to hardcore lyricist
Your raps is useless
Rappers are dropping like Icarus
Technological revolution, nigga picture this
""Motherfuck... motherfucker what?""
Yeah, I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
Lyrical bullets, packed to the top of the clip now
Treat it like a robbery, I'm shutting the shit down
Fellas put your hands up and all the women strip down
That's not misogynist, you ostracist 'cause I could just apocolypse
Talk politics to the populus or challenge what the market is
With militant carcuses that will snatch the spirit of hip hop out the sarcophagus
This is the curse of Tutankhamun, I bring the drama on
I'm sinful, I eat you, broad daylight on ramadan
Hip hop, reperations, now we taking back the loochie
Don't tell me you spent it on coke, like Danny Bonaduce
We're tired of being on the outside, looking in
Wondering what the fuck hip hop would have been
This is what it is, as opposed to what it used to be
And this is your corporate tax ID eulogy
Dominant species, the new breed that won't let you breathe
I make you die for what I believe
So we got nothing in common, there ain't no comparison
You got beef with niggas, I've got beef with Arians
White power Nazi, European Americans
Rapping poverty pimps and fake vegetarians
The resurrection ripping a hole through the record section
Flight connection to the Chechn border for guerilla lessons
Fuck a middle man distributor, I got a choice now
This ain't Volume 1, I got a grown man's voice now
Toured the country four times over, I'm older and wiser
Poisonous words, you'll find strychnine in my saliva
""Motherfuck... motherfucker what?""
I told you what it was
But this is what it is now
50 caliber bullets, I don't need a clip now
Fuck your private jet nigga, we shooting the shit down
Bomb wall street and make the stock market dip down
I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
If you ""the shit"" nigga, I don't care about shit now
I play the role of Abraham, idols get ripped down
Melt the ice caps and make all of this shit drown
""No one out there can fuck with me""
""Motherfuck... motherfucker what?""
""I speak that real shit""
""The illest""
""To smash the airwaves""
""No one out there can fuck with me""
""Motherfuck... motherfucker what?""

""To smash the airwaves""

This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemmings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered and stole his religion, and painting him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political right wing, ideology
Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
Got my back to the wall, 'cause I'm facing assassination
Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
How could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave?
Indigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves
Corporate America, dancing offbeat to the rhythm
You really think this country, never sponsored terrorism?
Human rights violations, we continue the saga
El Salvador and the Contras in Nicaragua
And on top of that, you still wanna take me to prison
Just 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism
It's like MK-ULTRA, controlling your brain
Suggestive thinking, causing your perspective to change
They wanna rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government, want us to settle
A bandana full of glittering, generality
Fighting for freedom and fighting terror, but what's reality?
Read about the history of the place that we live in
And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children
Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs
Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage
The brink of holy war, bottled up, like a miscarriage
Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension
And they refuse to even mention, European intervention
Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams
US manufactured missiles, and M-16's
Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
Media censorship, blacken out the video screens
A continent of oil kingdoms, bought for a bargain
Democracy is just a word, when the people are starving
The average citizen, made to be, blind to the reason
A desert full of genocide, where the bodies are freezing
And the world doesn't believe that you fighting for freedom
Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon
It's open season with the CIA, bugging my crib
Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
I'm trying to give the truth, and I know the price is my life
But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique
Who beheaded the President, and the princes and sheiks
You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade
Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God
Bitch niggas scared of the truth, when it looks at you hard
It's like MK-ULTRA, controlling your brain
Suggestive thinking, causing your perspective to change
They wanna rearrange the whole point of view in the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government, want us to settle
A bandana full of glittering, generality
Fighting for freedom and fighting terror, but what's reality?
Martial law is coming soon to the hood, to kill you
While you hanging your flag out your project window
Yeah, the fourth branch of the government, aka the media, seems to now have a retirement plan
For ex-military officials as if their opinion was at all unbiased.
A machine shouldn't speak for men so shut the fuck up you mindless drone
And you know it's serious when these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars
On a PR campaign to try and convince you they're fair and balanced
When they're some of the most ignorant and racist people
Giving that type of mentality a safe haven
We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do
We die in wars, we don't get contracts to make money off 'em afterwards
We don't get weapons contracts, nigga
We don't get cheap labor for our companies, nigga
We are cheap labor, nigga
Turn off the news and read, nigga
Read. Read. Read."

Revolutionary Volume 2
Yeah, broadcasting live from Harlem, New York
Let the truth be known...
You better watch what the fuck flies outta ya mouth
Or I'ma hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat, so when you scream, only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be... a more wicked MC
'Cause AIDS infested child molesters aren't sicker than me
I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
'Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the 3rd Reich
Just like the CIA trained terrorists to the fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer, 'cause God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
My words'll expose George Bush and Bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same seven headed dragon
And you can't fathom the truth, so you don't hear me
You think Illuminati's just a fuckin' conspiracy theory?
That's why Conservative racists are all runnin' shit
And your phone is tapped by the Federal Government
So I'm jammin' frequencies in ya brain when you speak to me
Technique will rip a rapper to pieces indecently
Pack weapons illegally, because I'm never hesitant
Sniper scoping a commission controllin the president
Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong
The truth will set you free, written down in this song
And the song has the Cause of Death written in code
The Word of God brought to life, that'll save ya soul...
Save ya soul motherfucker... save ya soul...
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I hacked the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence
Of Republican manufactured white powder pestilence
Marines Corps. flak vest, with the guns and ammo
Spittin' bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
Turn a Sambo into a soldier with just one line
Now here's the truth about the system that'll fuck up your mind
They gave Al Queda 6 billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are coming true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
Because subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watching the Towers, and though I wasn't the closest
I saw them crumble to the Earth like they was full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington bridge
Four Non-Arabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof
""Jealous of our freedom,"" I can't believe you bought that excuse
Rockin' a motherfucking flag don't make you a hero
Word to Ground Zero
The Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the 7th
The New World Order was born on September 11
And just so Conservatives don't take it to heart
I don't think Bush did it, 'cause he isn't that smart
He's just a stupid puppet taking orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin' and lockin'
Looking for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back
Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq
Or a Defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortions
Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And Dick Cheney, you fuckin' leech, tell them your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggaz fooled, but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
That's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis
I know the CIA saw Bin Laden on dialysis
In '98 when he was Top Ten for the FBI
Government ties is really why the Government lies
Read it yourself instead of asking the Government why
'Cause then the Cause of Death will cause the propaganda to die...

53,The Martyr,2011,The Martyr (2011),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,":
Norfolk: I'm content to die for my beliefs, so cut off my head and make me a martyr. The people will always remember it.
Walsingham: No, they will forget.
:
A man who walks with God, can walk anywhere.
Hence I fear nothing.
The point of Guerrilla war is not to succeed
It's always been just to make the enemy bleed
Deprivin' the soldiers, of the peace of mind that they need
Bullets are hard to telegraph, when they bob and they weave
The only way a Guerrilla war can ever be over
Is when the occupation, can't afford more soldiers
Until they have to draft the last of you, into the service
And you refuse 'cause you don’t see the purpose
The only way to counter the insurgents that are well equipped (how?)
Is to paint the people fightin' for freedom as terrorists
Then find a faction lookin' for foreign investment
Install them in power and murder any objections
You cant stop a revolution from breathin'
So to beat them they offer people the illusion of freedom
But when you're done dreamin' and wake up tortured for treason
Then you can see them hidin' behind the God they believe in
Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
That’s the place a Martyr is born (Motherfucker it's on!)
During the night before the start of the dawn
That’s the place a Martyr is born (Motherfucker it's on!)
When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
That’s the place a Martyr is born (Motherfucker it's on!)
Guerrilla war when the army is gone
That’s the place a Martyr is born (Motherfucker it's on!)
The purpose of life is a life with a purpose
So I'd rather die for a cause, than live a life that is worthless
I don't need the circus or the day of national observance
I need you to think for you and stop being a servant
Pawns only move a square, in the game that their used in
And realized it too late, like the shootin' of 
Or 
 and 
Slaughtered by the power hungry branches of their own gente
 wasn’t killed by Pakistani nationals
He was assassinated by a Hindu radical
And 
 rebel to a U.S. continent
Was sold to the 
 by Bolivian communists
Wasn't 
 murdered by a Zionist
And 
 a victim of the same violence
 was seen as a threat, to the 
But to blast him they used Muslims from the N.O.I.
Even the 
Was murdered by factions of his own government
So now that it's proven, that a soldier of revolution
Or head of an empire, disguised in the constitution
Cannot escape the retribution or manipulation
Of the self appointed rulers of the planets corporations
So I'ma need every generation to put your hands up
'Cause you can only get 'em off your back, when you stand up
Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
That’s the place a Martyr is born (Motherfucker it's on!)
During the night before the start of the dawn
That’s the place a Martyr is born (Motherfucker it's on!)
When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
That’s the place a Martyr is born (Motherfucker it's on!)
Guerilla war when the army is gone
That’s the place a Martyr is born (Motherfucker it's on!)
:
I was a man blessed by God, to survive some of the worst circumstances.
I had many things, a beautiful woman I loved, a home, money, and I gave it all up.
To bleed and to die free.
Sometimes I look back on that life and I wonder what it would have been like.
In the moments of weakness I think about trading it, but then I snap the fuck out of it and I get back to my reality.
And I realize, that I’ve been at the heart of a war, and that’s the place a Martyr is born."
54,The Message & The Money,2003,Revolutionary Vol. 2 (2003),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"(Immortal Technique)
Before we go any further...
I would like to send a message to all the underground MC's out there, working hard
The time has come to realize your net worth in a market
And stop being a fucking commodity
And if you didn't understand what I've just said then you already waiting to get fucked
For example; a lot of these promoters are doing showcases
Throwing events, and not even paying the workhorses
They trying get us to rock for the love of hiphop or rock for the exposure
Now look man, I don't mind doing a guest spot for my peeps
Or, or, or doing a benefit show, but don't lie to me pussy
'Cause I find out I'm paying your lightbill, I'm fucking you up nigga
Besides, you ain't doing this for the love, you ain't doing it for the exposure
You charging up to $10 at the door, and you ain't tryin' to give me shit???
So wait a minute... you want me to go shopping, cook the food, and put it in front of you
But you won't let me sit down and eat with you? The fuck is that?
Niggaz need to start playing their position, man. Just 'cause you throw a party
A hosting event or an open mic or a showcase, or a battle
That don't make you important at all
Without me and everybody like me out there
You ain't nutting but a good idea, motherfucker
So stay in your place
And to all these bitchass A&Rs who are too lazy to come up with a way to sell records...
That they keep recycling marketing schemes and imagery
C'mon...
There is a market for everything man
There is a market for pet psychologists nigga. There is a market for twisted
Shit-fetish video's. For nipple rings, for river dancing, for chocolate covered roaches...
But you can't find one for cultured hardcore reality and hip hop?
People like you: the house nigga executives
And them rich motherfuckers that own you; you the motherfucking machine man!
You and all these niggaz talking about the same shit
With the same flow over the same candy-ass beats
But I refuse the feed the machine
And I'm not giving any magazine money
So maybe my album won't get 5 mics, or double XL's, or 5 discs
Whatever man, fuck it
But then again; you don't own me, and none of you niggas ever will
If I'm feeling what you fight for I'm rolling with you to the end
But if not, then FUCK YOU!
And the more that MCs, producers, DJs
And independent labels start to grasp the conceptuality
Of what their contribution to the business of hiphop is
Rather then just the music - the more the industry will be forced to change
Oh, heh, and one last thing;
You don't have to agree with everything I've said
But don't ever be condescending to me
Picking up your wack ass friends that rhyme and being like
'Oh yeah, Immortal Technique - he's aaiight'
No nigga...
Your mom is pussy, that's aaiight, ok...
Your peoples getting shot dead in the street, that's aaiight
I'm the motherfucking Immortal Technique nigga! The message and the money!
And you ain't got either!
Remember that!
Punk ass motherfucker...
(Clip from the Film ""A Soldier's Story)
See, the Black race can't afford you no more
Oh there used to be a time we'd see someone like you
Singin', Clownin', Yessir Bossin', and we wouldn't do anything
Folks liked that. You were good. Homey kind of nigga.
When you needed somebody to mistreat, call a name or two
They paraded you. Reminded them of the good ol' days.
Not no more."

Lock and load!
This is the point of no return I could never go back
Life without parole up state shackled and trapped
Living in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no coming back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
Just like the Spanish exterminating Tainos
Raping the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
Motherfuckers made me out of self righteous hatred
And now you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection strapped down ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace
Concrete jungle, guerilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle pitch fork and machete
The end of the world, mother fucker you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad
The comet that killed the dinosaurs, changing the earth
They love to criticize they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills when you misusing them nigga
The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomon's temple
Al Aqsa the name is not coincidental
I know too much, the government is trying to murder me
No coming back like cutting your writs open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country
Genetic engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog ripping off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act
So come and get me mother fucker 'cause I'm not coming back
This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore
This is the point of no return nigga you better believe this
Mary Magdalene giving birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killing monkeys to conquer the planet

The dark side of the moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians, criminal minded
Broke into hell, tore it down, and built and city behind it
South Paw, murderous, methodology nigga
Remember that I'm just a man don't follow me nigga
Cause once you past the point you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dying alone
So tell me mother fucker, how could you die for the throne?
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own
It rains acid, one day the earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world livin' inside of a dome
Computerized humanity living inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is living and real
Worm went to planet X and the seventh seal
Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
Cause almost everything that I was ever told was a lie
This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore"
56,The Poverty Of Philosophy,2001,Revolutionary Vol. 1 (2001),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Most of my Latino and black people who are struggling to get food, clothes and shelter in the hood are so concerned with that, that philosophising about freedom and socialist democracy is usually unfortunately beyond their rationale. They don't realize that America can't exist without separating them from their identity, because if we had some sense of who we really are, there's no way in hell we'd allow this country to push it's genocidal consensus on our homelands. This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed.
Nigga talk about change and working within the system to achieve that. The problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it's not you who changes the system; it's the system that will eventually change you. There is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely, and I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I've been alive to know that it's a serious problem. Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism. You see, third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials. But plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states, force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources.
I'm quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words. My revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others.
You see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America. Aside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States; places like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Columbia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well.
As different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we'll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined. And that's why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques.
But you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people. ""Fuck them, let them fend for themselves."" No, Fuck you, they are you. No matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in, or follow an anorexic standard of beauty, or no matter how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them, no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on, you will never be them. They're always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey. I'd rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I'm really not, just to fit in. And whether we want to accept it or not, that's what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us.
I want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn't have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We're given the idea that if we didn't have these people to exploit then America wouldn't be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living. No, that's wrong. It's the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money. We have whatever they kick down to us. My enemy is not the average white man, it's not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don't see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies. The generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real Mother-Fuckers that I need to bring it to, not the poor, broke country-ass soldier that's too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up.
In fact, I have more in common with most working and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people. As much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue. Many of us are in the same boat and it's sinking, while these bougie Mother-Fuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we're all in, we're gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole.
In other words, I don't want to escape the plantation I want to come back, free all my people, hang the Mother-Fucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground. I want to take over the encomienda and give it back to the people who work the land.
You cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a Fucking lethargic devil. I don't look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole. Most of those successful individuals are sell-outs and house Negros.
But, I don't consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto. Poverty has nothing to do with our people. It's not in our culture to be poor. That's only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture and forms of government. You know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois lead. The idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That's why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people 'cause he represented the agenda of white Spaniards once he was captured, not the Aztec people who would become Mexicans.
So in conclusion, I'm not gonna vote for anybody just 'cause they black or Latino they have to truly represent the community and represent what's good for all of us proletariat.

57,The Prophecy,2001,Revolutionary Vol. 1 (2001),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"So you're the motherfucker they call... Immortal Technique.
What the fuck make you so special nigga?
Huh... what the fuck do you do?
I calculate planet alignment like Mayan astronomy
Discovering atrocities worst than Aristotle
Subjecting children to sodomy
Your theory of the galaxy is primitive like telome
The truth about the universe stuck up like Aztec pottery
Unpredictable results like experimental psychology
I stomp the streets with emcee's beneath my feet in colonies
But presentation and spirit revolve around autonomy
Searching for monogamy
And cutting fake bitches out of my mind like a lobotomy
So obviously I'm not gonna be here to play games
Walked the top of the world and leave the arctic circle in flames
Battle the beast and false prophet predicted in the King James
I give a fuck about your emcee name I don't admire you
Only by dental records will you be identifiable
Cause the future is not reliable
Remember when rap was not economically viable
Comparable to what motherfuckers think of me
I might be nobody but wait till I'm together like a symphony
Resounding sound that will continue infinitely
Angel of death punishing all those who live in infamy
And shine so far away from you
You'll never get a glimpse of me
Attempts to extinguish me don't even bother me none
Like retarded kids throwing ice cubes at the sun
A victory against Immortal Technique will never be done
Just degrees of losing it every second your adding one
Some niggas dream of pushing kilos but I drop tons
With more facts and formulas and philosophical logic
Then a basement full of scientists puffing on chronic
Dipped in mycin potassium cyanide and liquid bubonic
And use it as a sonic one to find the spawn of the demonic
Screaming like onyx is of absolutely no consequence
The poison is dense enough to clog up your arteries
Mercy is not a part of me
I cause you bodily injury permanently be simply verbally murdering me
Is inconceivable cause of the unbelievable evil injected inside
The blood stream of my people
And redemption is not located under a church steeple
The feeble and the meek in soul just like the technique
Will inherit the earth, But the earth will be weak
Mother earth in her decrepit terminal illness physique
The year three thousand is bleak no happily ever after
Just death following the forth right disaster, a legacy of bastards
With plastic explosives your futures been eroded
Cause you forgot that when your free it's multiplied indefinitely
By the struggle that be the struggle I see
To socialistically united the third world countries
Expose hypocrisy in Americas democracy
Sloppily obsessed with stopping me 'cause I speak prophecy
Trample and dismantle your capitalist philosophy
The same way I stomp the conquering rap monopoly
And I'm not a fucking prophet
But that's the fucking prophecy"
58,Toast To The Dead,2011,The Martyr (2011),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Here's a toast to the dead
If you don't drink, smoke to the head
For the freedom fighters killed by the Feds
For those who died hard in the streets, soaking in red
And died slow asleep in a dream, choking in bed
Here's a toast to the dead
For my enemies that have gone
I'm not a coward, so celebrating that would be wrong
I pray to God that your soul will come back again
So I can see you in the next life and finish it then
A toast to the dead
For criminals burning in hell
I wonder how many presidents are burning as well
Emperors, popes, senators, generals
Amputees feelin' lucky until they see the vegetables
A toast to the dead
For those who are forgotten
Written out of the history by the corrupted and rotten
Black saints whitewashed during La Reconquista
Thousands of Indio-Spaniards used to conquer the Incas
Fuck a moment of silence!
I need a moment of violence!
Like the nineteenth-century Caribbean Islands
Long love those who came before that paved the way for me
The warriors and scientists that came before slavery
And if that last lyric was predictable
Take that clairvoyance and apply it to life in the physical
Presumptuous, half-hearted homunculus
Self-destruction is the power without knowing what the function is
Here's a toast to the dead
For all of my fam
I will never let an idea die with a man
My rhymes are like Nazca lines, designed to give a view of this
J Dilla's still alive as long as his music is
A toast to the dead
For rap legends and pioneers
Your legacy won't be forsaken as long as I am here
Knowledge of the past and wisdom of the present
I'll teach and leave in the hands of a worthy lieutenant
A toast to the dead
For children with cancer and AIDS
A cure exists and you probably could've been saved
Sad to see medicine divorce morality
Corporate home-wreckers pimpin' up the salary
A toast to the dead
For those that'll die today
For victims and those exonerated by DNA
The only thing worse than giving freedom to the guilty
Is killing the innocent and leaving your soul filthy
Immortal Technique
Remember me when I'm gone
I encrypted my lyrics to stay alive in the song
So you'll always keep a piece of my spirit inside
When you struggle to complete what I started before I died
But some of you won't survive the changes the Earth makes
Swallowed by tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes
And that's just the first stage if you cannot reverse ways
And realize that we are one, regardless of our birthplace
My last toast to the dead is for the listener
Human being or extraterrestrial visitor
Remember us for more than our primitive ways
When you study us long after the end of our days"
59,Top Of The Food Chain (Remix),2001,Revolutionary Vol. 1 (2001),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"Yeah... yeah... used to run around getting my fight in the streets on
Back in the day before Harlem had a green zone
What good is a good education with no direction?
Like the right to vote with no one to vote for in an election
Like a gun with no bullets in the clip for protection
Like the crowd packed in the front without the midsection
Used to live robbing and stealing and being reckless
It took time for my mind to put the ghetto in perspective
I used to live in the back, of a holding van
Used to be offbeat, like the white girls' shoulder dance
I wrote rhymes a cappella, no beat, behind bars
Shed blood to make it, like the story behind scars
I used to be a battle champion, in the meanwhile
Before some of you little fuckers learned to freestyle
Prematurely senile, underground prima donnas
I was Oliver North during Iran Contra
'Cause I, never snitched, and that's backed by evidence
I learned it by watching you, don't ever forget it bitch
Cause everybody knows how the government do
They never snitch on themselves, but they want you to snitch on YOU
Evolution from Australopithecus
Primitive commercial shit to hard-core lyricist
Your wax is useless
Rappers are dropping like Icarus
Technological revolution... nigga picture this
Yeah... I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
Lyrical bullets, packed to the top of the clip now
Treat it like a robbery, I'm shutting this shit down
Fellas put your hands up and the all the women strip down
That's not misogynist, you ostriches, 'cause I could just, apocalypse
Talk politics to the populace
Or challenge what the market is
With militant caucuses
That'll smash the spirit of Hip Hop out the sarcophagus
This is the curse of Tutankhamen, I bring the drama on
I'm sinful, I eat you, broad daylight on Ramadan
Hip Hop, reparations, now we taking back the loochie
Don't tell me you spent it on coke, like Danny Bonaduce
We're tired of being on the outside, looking in
Wondering what the fuck Hip Hop would've been
This is what it is, as opposed to what it used to be
And this is your corporate tax ID eulogy
Dominant speech is the new breed, that won't let you breathe
I'll make you die for what I believe
So we got nothing in common
There ain't no comparison
You got beef with niggas, I got beef with Aryans
White power Nazi European Americans
Rapid Poverty pimps, and fake vegetarians
The resurrection, ripping a ball through the wrecking section
Flight connection to the Chechen border for guerrilla lessons
Fuck a middle man distributor, I got a choice now
This ain't Volume 1., I got a grown man's voice now
Toured the country four times over, I'm older and wiser
Poisonous words, you'll find strychnine in my saliva
I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
50 caliber bullets, I don't need a clip now
Fuck your private jet nigga we shooting the shit down
Bomb wall street and make the stock market dip down
I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
You the shit nigga, I don't care about shit now
I play the role of Abraham, idols get ripped down
Melt the ice caps, and make all of this shit drown..."

61,Ultimas Palabras,2011,The Martyr (2011),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"(Audience Claps)
A new American revolution has begun not against the forces of a colonial kingdom, but a rebellion against an oppressor that has risen among us. It is not a foreign invasion we have to fear, rather the threat of a force within our nation that has usurped what was once of having the greatest democracy ever known to man.
We now live in a world where the population has grown exponentially, and the planet is running out of resources to sustain us all. We in the inner city and those struggling in the suburban ghettos may not realize it yet, but, make no mistake, the people who control technology and run every enterprise that makes up our world have seen this coming for a long time. The ideas of renewable energy, global warming, the idea of collectively working were purposefully bought out, derailed, demonised, or corrupted in favor of an economic structure designed by a monetary cast system. In a desperate attempt to convince us that we need to maintain that extravagant existence, they've pretended we might share in their dream. That we can justify any inhumanity in its name. Out of this blind ignorance was born the curse of slavery.
Many of the founders of this country were themselves Masons. That is not a left-wing or a right-wing conspiracy theory, it is a widely known and accepted fact. So then explain to me how a nation founded by men, who not only understood the long and complicated history of Europe, but also that of Africa can permeate such a lie in convincing the American public that one race of men was superior and one inferior. When, in fact, we know that all the early men, the people who created civilization, every aspect of what we see today, the foundation of all modern human life - were from Africa. The greatest cowardice, of course, came not with slavery itself, unfortunately, but with the excuses for slavery. For if America had been as brave as the Roman Empire and all other empires that had come after her, and claimed ""No, we were just stronger and that's why we took you!,"" then when slavery was over racism would have probably followed in suit. But instead it was the social lie, the religious lie that was told that stayed in the minds of people that separated one human being from another in order to distract us from the issues of class and freedom - they created issues around religion and race to dominate the world for centuries to come.
Some claim that they respect the culture of life in this country. They cry out for the indignity of children that are slaughtered before they are born, but god has not penetrated their souls, for they have no empathy; nothing in their cold hearts for the hundreds of thousands of lives we have taken in our wars overseas for that which they call ""collateral damage,"" which are the burnt and damaged children of world. They have no prayers for them. Only snide commentary on the Internet and laughter in their hearts, and yet you claim to be one with God? (chuckle)
We talk about immigration in this country. Might doesn't make right, ladies and gentlemen, it just makes right now. What we are saying to the rest of the world is one day when America grows weak, one day when her legions falter on a day when her economy crumbles, China, Russia, Europe, whatever power has arisen; all you have to do is come here and conquer us in a few military excursions, and then you too can set up shop here, and in 100 years you can tell every red blooded American ""No! You are an illegal human being! I am the true citizen! I have all the rights! You have no rights!"" Maybe you forgot how you got this country. Maybe you take for granted the blood, the sweat, the tears that the people who live in practical serfdom shed everyday; for we may not run America, but we make America run.
We talk about the law, yet how many indignities have been legal in the past? How many treaties with Native American people have we broken? How many international laws have we violated? And, speaking of laws, how can a corporation be regulated by a government that is funded and controlled by corporations? How can there be accountability for people who see a profit margin above the lives of Americans? Above the lives of human beings in other countries? We have taken the soul out of ourselves and placed them inside machines.
My words, of course, will be marginalized, demonised in typical fashion. Anytime you dare to question the power structure they say, ""You hate America.""
No.
I love this country. I see its beauty everyday in its people, and I love it a lot more than those that have abandoned the American worker, that have chose to exploit and try and take away every single benefit that she has. Those that attempt to make excuses for every atrocity committed in the name of supposed freedom. Those who demand accountability from everyone, but often none themselves. Who favor contracts over lives. Who favor invasion and control over organic democracy overseas. The greatest flaw that any intelligent person has is to think that they're smarter than everyone else.
And so, as the government has planted its spies amongst us, we have planted our spies among them. They have infiltrated every branch of the American government. They have retrieved names, data, hard numbers, the paper trail that will expose those that truly control this country. Those that control the political parties. Those that control the oil industry. The energy. Those that stand behind the companies; faceless, whose names have never been revealed until today...

I sold 80,000 off a quotable in the source
The hood is not stupid, we know the mathematics
I made double than what I would going gold on Atlantic
'Cause EMI, Sony BMG, Interscope
Would never sign a rapper with the White House in his scope
They push pop music like a religon
Anorexic celebrity driven financial fantasty fiction
Contradiction, 'cause the life we was given resembles life in prison
Fed time with Manuel Noriega
The real Noriega, who did America 100 favours with Contras, the Shah and the CIA
Moving Escobar's coke through the MIA
This is the 3rd world speaking, through a dead man walking
Any everybody talking about the south taking over
It's true motherfucker, but it's coming over the border
Fuck your chain, my people'll kill you for water
Fuck fans, nigga, I got soldier supporters
That'll cut your throat if you strapped with a tape recorder
That's right, motherfucker, welcome to the New World Order
Where the truth is always censored by corporate reporters
The government runs the drug politics on the corner
That's why I never stress rappers and their employers
I put a bag over his fucking head and torture your lawyer
'Cause it's too simple to shoot ya, I'll Taser the roof of your mouth and electrocute you
I'll root you out with the Ruger, the German Luger, U-boat, and the troops in the scuba (?)
Nigga, you can't overthrow me, like the island of Cuba
Niggas will never find your body, like the bitch in Aruba 
And I manouvre through the state department and their friends
With secret deals like the Nazis and IBM
And now you know this ain't a trend or a fashion
This is my life and my passion
Fuck trying to cash in nigga
I need more than advancements and a rented mansion
So why you little house niggas is singing and dancing
I'll kill you and take your land, like an Israeli expansion"
64,You Never Know,2003,Revolutionary Vol. 2 (2003),Underground Hip Hop,Immortal Technique,"She was on her way to becoming a college graduate
Wouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid
The type of latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with
Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire
Disciplined, intellectual beauty's what I desire
Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
Everyone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless
At first I just thought, she didn't mess with broke kids
The thug niggaz always talking about, how they smoke kids
But the rich-sniff-coke kids got no play
""I'm not even interested"" is what her body language would say
Everyone around the way, gave up trying to get in it
It didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it
On the block, bitches was jealous, but wouldn't admit it
Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it
'Cause they regreted the long list of niggaz that they let hit it
And no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick
Smoking weed with thoughts of envy, whenever they lit it
She smoked intelligently and they bit it, always trying to copy
But when they tried to use her vocab, they sounded sloppy
She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure
I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure
(Hook - Jean Grae)
Don't you know that, time waits for no man
Not fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find, a reason why
God came, to you and I
If I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, 'cause you never know
Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad
I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad
That I wasn't just another nigga trying to get in it
So every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute
I didn't have a gimmick so the minutes turned to hours
On her birthday, I gave her a poem with flowers
Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower
We talked about, power to the people and such
We spent more time together but it was never enough
I never tried to sneak a touch, or even cop a feel
I was too interested, in keeping it real
Perfectly honest and complete, she would always call me ""cariño,""
And never Technique, bought me a new book to read every 2 or 3 weeks
Forever changing the expression of my thoughts when I speak
It was because of her, I even deaded all of my freaks
She convinced me, to stop hangin' out on the streets
To stop robbin' and stealin', from people like you
Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo,
Museo Del Barrio and the Metropolitan too
Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
So I decided one day, to tell her my feelings was true
I couldn't live without her so I told her, facing my fears
But honey's only response, was a face full of tears
She could only sob hysterically, holding me tight
I tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight
I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
Except I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night
I went on with my life, college and my career
Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
Where the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer
Then I got sent to the hole, when my exit was near
At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her
Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared
Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole in the summer
Came back, in tact and on track
But the fact of the matter, is I still felt cold
Even after my mother, hugged me, cryin' at home
My real niggaz would catch me thinkin', out of my zone
Fuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone
Relatively well-known around the New York underground
But I kept thinking of her and how we used to be down
The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair
Though gone physically, somehow it was still there
I had to do something, because the shit was too much to bear
So I went and visited the building where she used to live
The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
The way your life done changed
While primitive minds (are) still stuck in the same game
Like her cousin who was on the corner slangin' cocaine
Stepped in the lobby and tapped the button next to her last name
Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up, like a mother oughta
But her facial expression changed, when I asked about her daughter
She told me that there was a note for me, that was left behind
She had left it there waiting, for such a long time
I was inclined to ask about it but she brought it up first
I saw a tear swelling up in her eye, and then she cursed
She told me where the letter was and I started thinking the worst
Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door
And sure enough there was an envelope with my name on the floor
""Nobody loves you more than me carino"" is what the letter said
""By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead
But when you left in '97 a part of me went to Heaven
I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
But it hurt me, to see what true love really does
'Cause even though we never made love, you were all that there was
It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
You made me doubt the way I thought, you made me want to believe
And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me
It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
Baby don't you see, I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV
Hoped the end exists for me since late in 1993
I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you
I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
Promise that you'll meet me in paradise inevitably
No matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me""
What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
But I remember wishing that I was dead, instead of her
She was buried on August 3rd
The story ends without a sequel
And now you know why Technique, don't fucking fall in love with people
Hold the person that you love closely if they're next to you
The one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you
Appreciate them to the fullest extent, and then beyond
'Cause you never really know what you got, until it's gone"

New to the world, fresh out the barrio, I was an outlaw rebel. Out of my mind, young and wild, my existence defined in one word: Survive!
(Verse 1: Joell Ortiz)
If it could be sold, I can sell it, If it can't, that's cool,
I'll fix it up make it look good enough to catch some fool,
It started when I was young with my genesis games,
He traded me John Madden for it I don't remember the name,
But it was weak though, the streets though, they play with perico,
So Tito became my hijo, he had cheap blow,
And each o like three, four times, I flip one,
But it's evil, the people I deal with a stick none
With big guns, _______ that diesel never change
The custy still nod like they agree with everything
The weed ain't the same, all the colors is new
It ain't just green, the haze is purple and them berries is blue
I don't care if it was pink, as long as they still smoking
I had them bags packed until they damn near open
The hustle's in my veins, I could bleed in a pot
And make a soup that'd go for 10 dollars a pop
(Immortal Technique)
In la calle, on a collision course with incarceration, consumed by the lies of the streets, they were an illusion but I awoke, caged like an animal.
(Verse 2: Pumpkinhead)
They got me locked in a cell where I'm feeling like an experiment,
My spirit sharper than lasers they used to build pyramids,
Writing on the walls keep me sane,
Knuckle push-ups on the concrete, till I bleed out the pain,
Thoughts of my freedom lingering in my brain,
I'm stronger and much quicker I appreciate the gain,
Building with my _____, brown power reunite,
Tattoos of my flag, PR pride Jesus Christ,
But I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy,
So when I'm free I'll teach and spread the speech,
Of how they try to divide us (to make us weak)
Find us (and break a piece) So I gotta,
(To make a peace) honest (I play for keeps),
This is the life of your forefathers that fought hard,
Four corners of backyards, power in numbers,
So they subtract us and add bars,
If they want it, we gonna take 'em to war,
We not a gang or a clique, we Young Lords!
(Immortal Technique)
I came to my senses, un esclavo no soy (I am not a slave), that is not my past, I came to know me and my people, red brown and black, helped me paint the future.
(Verse 3: CF)
The world got a template, to turn us into inmates,
Caged in a state pen, Man, fuck going to Penn state,
Bonded to slave ships to punch in your timecard,
Walk my oasis spacing jungle behind bars,
Got my epiphany like Malcolm X,
Prison to the bricks, but I'm stuck in this global house arrest,
I'm a free man so I changed my mannerisms,
This Greenspan system wanna dent my activism,
Estilo machetero get my people out the ghetto,
21st century grito de alar estate quieto (stay calm),
We vocal minorities, no pookie man trail,
Guess the local authorities to be the Ho Chi Minh trail,
From robbing bodegas and boosting like low-lives,
The medium figures choking the four five,
Revolutionary gangsters in your presence,
Trying to dead us with cancer, through chemical testing!

Unidos por fin! (Finally, united!) We seize the time, free at last, learn to love, live to fight, not just for me, but for others, teach the new blood, and live for freedom!

I survived the Cointelpro assassinations.
AIDS epidemic, Crack era, fractured a nation,
The Interpretation of American Democracy,

I live a double life of political philosophy,
But Revolution follows me, the struggle for equality,
Against the morally bankrupt claiming to be born again,
It's a civil war again like MS-13s origin
Ban ethnic studies claiming our culture will swallow them,
But you can't conquer people and build a country on top of them,
And then feel offended that they breathe the same oxygen,
Your family values lack the wisdom of Solomon,
But Operation Condor and Operation Bootstrap
Are Poli Sci 101, research for the new jacks,
It's hard to reach Communist Utopia tomorrow,
When your hands are in a fuckin' glass jar like Che Guevara,
Forget the distorted historical facts you were given,
Slave trade was the capital for capitalism,
Trapped in a prison, mentally, dying existentially,
Separated from people you can't see yourself to be,
Then racially integrated into a burning house
Colony of an empire, economically burning out,
Can't win a debate so they sponsor every threat to me,
I wonder if Agent 800 is standing next to me!
In Puerto Rico, the main problem we have es que somos colonia (is that we are a colony) we are fighting for freedom, because we will not be a slave nation forever. The struggle here is to make universities, the struggle here is in the community, it's against the police and violence, it's against discrimination, it's against the crimes against humanity on this beautiful Caribbean Island, this is ________.
