Now what you boys got a death wish
I beat a mothafucka' uglier than precious
Real nigga, you can find me where the x is
Whippin' in the kitchen, both hands ambidextrous
Recession got the hood pushin' more than time clocks
So I dropped a hundred in the streets I don't buy stocks
Tell a little mothafucka' get his shine pa
Good fellas hood fellas living on my block
Nigga got a problem, I solve 'em (solve 'em)
A couple keys yes nigga we'll rob 'em (rob 'em)
Got tha 9 milli in my pants, case you niggas wanna dance
Leave a mothafucka' shakin' like Harlem (Harlem)

Who you gonna trust?
Yeah, you could trust me, haha
La la la la la
Ooh
I don't care about nothing else my my baby (baby I don't care)
All I care is bout being here for you (Ooh)
And I won't stare at nobody else my baby (Promise I won't stare)
'Cause all I need is you (All I need, all I need)
To all the ladies in our lives, you heard
Strong independent women, come on
Yeah, huh
What you think gangstas don't cry get hurt by lies
Times you embarrassed me I swallowed my pride
I'm tired of telling you I got nothing to hide
I'm in the studio at night you think I'm out with the guys
Every time I speak to you you got something to say
According to you I must be crushin all day
All I'm askin you for is to be more trustin'
I'm outta town all the time and don't accuse you of nothing
Picture me creepin' with a chick on tour
When you love my sons as if they was yours
I know at times you feel alone 'cause I'm not at home
That's why every few hours I pick up the phone
To reassure you my love is more than it seems
I adore you my wife my Colombian queen
I promise to never stray I'm honored everyday
To have a woman like you in the life of Jose (Hey)
I don't care about nothing else my baby (baby I don't care)
All I care is bout being here for you (Ooh)
And I won't stare at nobody else my baby (Promise I won't stare)
'Cause all I need is you (All I need, all I need baby)
Yeah how I'm supposed to start this
First is first you my queen goddess
My moon my earth the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge
I swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college
And still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and
Touring making dollars assuming that you know I love you or regardless
I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's
Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history she's worth and deserves
More than this cold world has given me to share with her word
And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)
Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl)
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all hopes gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title
You my future my happiness my heart my idol
I promise girl, that
I don't care about nothing else my baby (Baby I don't care)
All I care is bout being here for you (Ooh)
And I won't stare at nobody else my baby (Promise I won't stare)
'Cause all I need is you (All I need, all I need baby)
Haha
This is going out to you, you and you and you
To all the ladies out there if you love your man
You need to hold your man embrace your man
And just grab his hand repeat after me
I promise to stay true and give you all of me
Whether he's locked down or on the ground
Or whether is out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man and respect that man
And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and
I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times you will always...
Always be my girl
I don't care about nothing else my my baby (Baby I don't care)
All I care is bout being here for you (Ooh)
And I won't stare at nobody else my baby (Promise I won't stare)

I'm the type of brother to beat you down then fuck you up
Grabbin the mic to rock on tonight to see if the crowd will care
Step to the Gizzy you dare, you get lit up like a flare
From the, Bronx the Boogie Down battleground, Uptown
Turn smiles to frowns as I smack clowns around
Shorts I don't take em, bones I fracture and break
So make not one mistake, or you get eat like steaks at Frank's G
Jack in June, gettin' swept, with a broom soon
To meet your doom, mornin night or the afternoon
Harassin the mic, with a verbal assault of rap
Stick lyrics back to back, that'll pack, to keep myself on wax
Hot like an iron, to defeat the kids you gotta keep tryin'
If you spread any rumors sayin' you took me out, you're lyin'
A human beat is struck I know when it really sounds trunk
I'm never ever buck I don't give a fuck if you think that I'm a sucker
Parties that I've made, people wonder how long it lasted
Lyrics that are so hardcore, it'll leave you flabbergasted
Gasp for air, inhale it hold it in
And just wait for the rest of the posse to begin
I'm the human beat magician with the bag full of fun

Suckers is scared, because they know I live trife
As I troop down the streets of a ghetto
Skins are jockin, and always screamin hello
But I keep drivin' in my jet black Beamer
I'm not a daydreamer, but I'm known as a scheamer
I'm dead-ass, when it comes to this
And if you fuck around, your moms'll reminisce
Thinkin' of the good times she spent with her son
Somebody shoulda told you that I wasn't the one
Yes I'm known to get nuff respect
And if you face Fat Joe, well then you face your death
Now in ninety-three, it's time to take a stand
And you know how I'm livin', I'm a bad, bad, man
Niggaz know the flav

Check it
All the old folks, hate my guts
'Cause I be hittin all they daughters and they big fat butts
'Cause I'm the papichulo when it comes to rap
And if you fuck with me, then you leave handicapped
I don't give a fuck, don't care who you are
I gotta say peace to my peeps GangStarr
Some real motherfuckers from around the hood
When I chills with them, we be up to no good
Hittin skins, makin' ends
Loungin with my friends in my fat BM
Whether Uptown in the Boogie Down
Or checkin' out stunts in the Polo Ground
See just like Mel, I'm internationally known
And I'm mob related, like Al Capone, check it
Too hot to handle, blow you like a candle
You never catch Joe in the middle of a scandal
Now in ninety-three it's time to take the stand
And you know how I'm livin', I'm a bad, bad, man!
Everybody knows the flav
""I'm a bad, bad, man!"" (cut and scratched 2X)
One day I was chillin', caught a buckshot
The nigga was butt, so then he gets no props
Word spread fast around town
I was layin six feet deep underground, check it
Niggaz wished the worst, but spoke too fast
Cause here I am and I'm ready to blast *gunshot*
The cops must have missed, takin' me for a bitch
Because they tried to gas me, and make me turn snitch
But I'm not the one for peace
So I turned around and said, ""Fuck the police!""
I'm the type to handle this on my own
Pack two joints and pass one to Tone
There's no shame in my game, I do what I gotta do
See I'm rollin' with a crazy live crew
Now in ninety-three it's time to take a stand
And you know how I'm livin' I'ma bad, bad, man!

To burn down the throne, niggaz follow my lead
Save your breath for crownin me King of N.Y.
I'm the one and only Godfather, one through three
Pardon me, but I was raised in the projects
Forgettin I wasn't the only object
We was more concerned with cuttin' up and choppin
Supplyin fiends with that work, get it poppin'
Now who wanna pop off till they head get popped off
By the realest MC, and that's ME!

Knee deep in the game, other half in the streets

Wonder why I paint a picture of the street life so vivid I lived it
Y'all dudes innocent, y'all just visitin
And that's the reason why they call me ghetto
D.O., have you homeless {?} diggin deep holes
Police know, but just couldn't figure me out
I'm like {?}, have 'em makin' pies in the house
It's grill, spit fire like I never been out
And I ain't gon' retire till there's never a doubt
The wheels, in my head keep spinnin
I'm thinkin' anybody go against me losin chil'ren
I'm thinkin' there's no better time than now to start some killin'
It's Cook Coke Crack, 2005's ghetto version of Achilles NIGGA

Yo, yo, loop this and you crash the remix
And forget who you thought I was, I'm Crack BEYOTCH
The same dude that made you ""Lean Back""
And had that nigga Ma$e spittin' that gangsta shit
Can't wait till my nigga Shyne come home
Six minutes, six minutes, Joey Crack you're on
Uh-um, uh-um, is my microphone on? Yes
New York, look I brought the championship home
Now, through up your peace signs to the sky
For all our soldiers that died
That means Biggie Smalls, Tupac, Big L and Left Eye
And Big Pun the greatest of all time, sing it with me now
Wonder if we all V-S'es'us
Wanna know the streets that we fuss
Now sit back and witness the di-rector's cut
And niggaz throw your T.S.'s up {BEAT NOVACANE!}"

That's my life without you girl
I'm so lonely I'm so blue
Without you girl my life is through
Maria
This song is dedicated
Maria - Don't you hear me calling
Maria To the most beautiful woman on the planet earth
Maria
That would be my mother Maria Cartegena
(1st Verse)
Ay yo, she's the best sister
One man love her
And if she died her tombstone would read
The world's greatest mother
August nineteenth she birthed me
I came out
Put her through hell but still in all she couldn't help but smile
I resemble my mama to be truthful
And I ain't got to describe her
You know she beautiful
Shit, I always love my mama
Blow holes through a Nigga if he touch my mama
You did whatever it took to keep the supper hot
And I remember when you worked at the number spot
Once the cops caught you I skipped school
Yeah I guess the cops was cool
They let me feed you
I cryed for hours till they finally freed you
Drop to my knees and screamed Mama we need you
Then you went back to school and got a job that's legal
Maria
Yeah Mami, I love you so much
For this pain, this love, you've been through so much,
And I thank you for everything you done for us
You've been a survivor and we love you so much
I had to dedicate this song to you Mami
I had to tell the world how much I love you
(2nd Verse)
Ay yo, yo yo
I never forget the night that changed out life
A neighbor was screaming Maria come out side
Something's wrong with your son I think he's getting high
Then you replied not my son he don't be getting high
Then you bathed him and tucked him to sleep
Yeah I knew from that day life wouldn't be sweet
He got in trouble with the law
Then you bailed him out
I got in trouble with the law then you bailed me out
It was one July the fourth
They tried to take me out
Shot me right in front of my mother
By Tracy's house
Now its time to change my life I think Rap's the answer
Same day I got signed you was diagnosed with Cancer
Doctor said it'd be a miracle if you survived
Then you looked in my eyes and said
Joey I don't want to die
I pray to god that he show us a sign
Now its fourteen years later and you still alive
Thank you God
(3rd Verse)
God I thank you so much
My Mother has so much to see
So much to do
She's had such a painful life
Many nights I argue with you in my prayers but I know you're the boss
You kept her alive for a reason
Mama I'm a ride for you
I swear
Yo, I bet you proud of your son
He's a rap star now
Took you out of them projects and bought you that house
Got you that housekeeper to manicure the grounds
And I bought you that car that breaks the barrier of sound
You take care of Joey and I love you for that
And you raising John John and we love you for that
I guess Lisa was an Angel
God wanted her back
Damn I really miss my sister
Guess she's better where she's at
Mammy I love you
I want the world to know I love you
And every chance I get I'm a kiss you and hug you
Life wasn't easy everyday is a struggle
But like my niggaz from Chi town say
It's all bubbles
Hoping my real mo'fuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
It's that shit right here
Took me like ten years to do
You know I cried doing this song
Man, so much pain
Mami you such a good woman
You a classy woman
I know you a private person
You don't want the world to know all your business
But I had to let them know how strong you are
I love you so much
This song is also dedicated to little Maria
One of my best friends on earth
Get your shit together girl I love you too
Juju what's up, you my nephew I love you for life
It's Crack bitch"

Bang bang baby!
Yeah, Terror Squad style
Trizzie, check it out now

Yo, I'm rated X in sex, I flex like Lex Lugor
So who's next to get scooped up by this roughneck from Cuba?
We do maneuvers like Super Dave, always with a group of babes
Sayin' ""Mami's out"" like Sugar Ray
Cause Cuban Link don't play miss, I flip and do some strange (shit)
Witchu like hit you with the whips and chains, check it
I get you naked like I'm mystic, cause this (dick) is
Thick as a brick, raw with big (balls) that bend it
Now let's get, physical, my jiggable pie
Let this lyrical guy scuba dive right between your thighs
I satisfy like a Snickers bar 'cause I'm the bigger bar
That'll stick you quicker than a 'spic will strip a car
My repoitoire holds a four star performance with all women
Hittin more skins than Alec Baldwin
You're fallin' in love and you can't get up
Now check the cut, I stripped ya, now you can't strut, word up
Chorus: Big Pun

Paradin in the Palladium, all eyes on my presence
Poppin' the Crist', sportin the chick straight out of Essence
Word up, patch thug, three quarter front Polo jiggy
Be like 'Who is he, lookin' like a grizzly?'
While your girl watch me, you're busy drink pissy
Wanna lay your love, but your love wanna kiss me, huh
I got a fly team, me and my guys gleam like high beams
Makin' the killin' off of fiends with pipe dreams
It might seem, like I'm conceited with the cream talk
But I got the kind of green that could bribe a Supreme Court
And when we talk, the whole world listen
Turn your back to T.S. for one second and find your girl missin'
(Big Pun)
Baby make me holla, take it off, I give you dolla
We can party till manana ain't nobody gotta know nada
Word to Allah, give me some Mississippi massana
I'll be in the sauna, troopin the naga like the chupacabra
Cool it mama, you gettin' too hot, bust a shot
Boo-yaa! Rub it up and down like my ooh-wops
Suscia!, show me your dirty dance
The way you work the pants make any man wanna jerk his gnads
(Cuban Link)
Yo, my (shit's) official like it in you like, Keith Murray
Bury my beef, gettin' your sweet cherry every week if necessary
I'm very nasty like Nas, did you ask me?
Pass me those (ass)cheeks and I'll bring you joy like BlackSTREET
In the backseat of my Jeep, we can chill
Or Creep like TLC but don't sleep, I keep it real
What the deal mami, you wanna feel on my steel salami?
Come and try me, I'll sign my name all over your punani
(Triple Seis)
Oh mami, you comin' home with me
All night in my tub drinkin' Hennessey
Gettin' lyed up with your thighs up, I'ma surprise her
When I rise up, inside her
Yippie kay yay, I'ma ride her, and guide her
Straight to the triz, where we goin', straight to the crib
Pun in here and Cuban and Seis, you know what time it is
Soon as we walk in the crib, let's get biz
TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ (oahkay!)

11,Born In The Ghetto,2002,Loyalty (2002),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"(Feat. Lamauic)
[Intro - Fat Joe] - *Lamajic talks and harmonizes in background*
Yeah, it's time baby
It's time to speak the truth, maturity
Huh, niggas gotta evolve to let niggas know the real
Ya call yourself real, ya gotta start speakin' about the real
This is Joe Crack The Don, and this is what I'm bringin' to you
(Fat Joe)
Uh, yo, nowadays, I'm flirtin with uncertain death
Lord I gotta be dyin', cause after all this cryin, how much more hurtin's left?
When will the pain stop?
This depression and anxiety, is gonna make me show another side of me
My niggas ride with me 'cause I'm the truth
There's benefits to rollin' with this clique, don't nobody fuck with you
Still they label me a tyrant and a backstabber
But study the facts of crack, the shit don't add up
I'm bringin' opportunity to my community
Probably the only rapper that cares, but still you out to ruin me
Who you foolin B? I'm for unity, latins and blacks
Could you fathom the strength, we have of the two it attach
Born together, voted alike
These uncle charm politicians ain't holdin' us right
How could the same nigga be 20 years in office
When it's clear the only thing that's risin' is unemployment
Abortion, little kids havin' kids
The school system is failing us, now ain't that some shit
While the rich keep gettin' richer, the poor keep dyin' young
I can't hide no more, the time has come
[Chorus - Lajamic] - w/ ad libs
I was born in the ghetto
Tremblin, tryin' a stay alive
'Cause when you're born in the ghetto
No one seems to hear your cry
(Fat Joe)
Brown skin, you know I love my bra-ha-own skin
Everyday I'm confronted with racism
These motherfuckin coppers, wanna bag us and have us shackled up in state prisons
After all the taxes I pay
You would think when they stop us, they would have something nicer to say
Than ""get the fuck out the car, where the drugs at?
All the jewelry you wearin, where the fuckin' guns at?""
Once they search the car clean and find nothin'
The same crooked cops try to act like they know us or somethin'
Laughin', tellin' jokes by the thousands
Two seconds ago they tried to send us to the mountains
Leave my son without a father, my wife without a husband
The more I think about it, man it's just disgusting
Still we live amongst 'em, everybody wants out
That's why we rap like we got silver spoons in our mouths
Like we ain't grow up on welfare
Nigga don't even go there, you probably wore Pro Players
We need to educate the youth, tell our seeds the truth
Too much to share, the bare minimum will exceed the proof
(Lajamic - singing until fade)
Oh, yeah, so much pain
Tryin' hard to stay alive, stay alive
Out in these streets, ooh (*harmonizing*)
Man sometimes in can get so tough
Oh yeah, yes it can
Yes it can, yeah
It can get so hard, so hard, so hard"

Aiyyo I said yes yes y'all-n, to the beat all-n
Always been no peace so I never like to ball in
But I maintain and keep a grip on the mic
And say a punchline that'll get the crowd hyped, RIGHT
I never could determine who's the best
It was either KRS or that nigga Lord Finesse
But now I maintain that's with my own career
Joe gettin' gold dough or somethin' wrong in here
Cause everybody knows I got the skills to pay the bills
Plus I got the flow cause you know +The *Hit is Real+
What? Top notch, I give you nuttin but the raw talent
But don't fake jax and make me have to get violent
You wouldn't like it when I flip the script
'Cause when I flip the script, my glock can have an empty clip
Yeah, straight from the Ave of Trinity
I hate it when a juvenile tries to prove his masculinity
I got the whole vicinity locked down
Police hate it, look what they done to Tupac now
You make me wanna blast or somethin'
But for now I keep infiltratin these crews that be frontin
And all these other MC's be hatin' it
Because the Bronx keeps creatin' it, rock on

When in San Fran' I go check Sway and Tech
Otherwise I live the real live back in the BX
Known for transformin on rappers like I'm Jesus
You didn't know I order hits and what not?
Don't make me have to let the dogs loose
And hear the two-per shot, BOO-YA
Ain't it funny how nobody really cares
One minute you're here, the next minute you're under there
Word to Christ, I put out your lights

14,Bronx Tale,1995,Jealous One's Envy (1995),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"Intro: KRS-One
Music please
Yes, welcome to Jealous One's Envy
We'd like to thank you in advance for purchasing this product
It is a Relativity Records product, artist Fat Joe
My name is KRS-One
And of course we're gonna bring THE noise
'Cause we can never be toys
Verse One: KRS-One, Fat Joe
Yes I am the ultimate, uttering ultimatum's for the fun of it
It appears to me you don't know who you fuckin' with
You can't see this with bifocals 'cause you're local
Can't hang with my vocals, better you fuck with Sonny Bono
Or Yoko Ono, but KRS oh NO NO
You might think you a ROTC but I don't give a fuck though
I'm rolling hard like God for the squad black
Packin them poppers bitch, where that money be at?
Aiyyo I be the show stopper, as I shine like gold
Other rappers dull like copper, the certified fake nigga dropper
Which borough, is the thorough
I know, do you know, let me know I'm sayin' though
The coke connector, sweating leather with reflectors
Don't get caught up in my sector, or I'ma haveta inject ya
With a slab of this lyrical dope shit
Fake MC's and wannabe's best to quote this
Fat Joe the true and living will prevail
Kingpin like Sonny up in Bronx Tale
Will I fail? I doubt it
I'm the nigga catchin bodies, while other niggaz fantasize about it
True indeed, behind my back MC's claim they can serve me
In my face they screaming ""We're not worthy!""
Youse a has been, actually you ain't been
I be touring, while you be home taping
So what punk, you could battle in a second
Frankly the bottom line, is where's your hit record
You claim I'm jocking, claim I'm on your dick, where's your witnesses?
If I'm on your dick my name has got to be syphillis
""If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck"" - Jeru
""Up up up and away 'cause I don't play clown"" - Kool G Rap
""If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck"" - Jeru
""Buck buck buck take that witcha on the way down"" - Kool G Rap
Verse Two: Fat Joe
As we proceed to lock it down, don't get it fucked up
We be the kings of the Boogie Down
All we do is spark izm and get cash
Tortuing MC's like that warden up in Alcatraz (bo! bo! bo! bo!)
It's Fat Joe, yo you know my steelo
Get so much love, I'm payin' sixteen on a kilo
Sendin niggaz outta town, still got control of the Boogie Down
Now how the fuck you sound? (Yeah)
Ain't no army that could harm me or bomb me
C'mon G you clowns ain't got a fucking thing on me
I'm flashy like white linen (tell em)
Your rap is under pressure like two outs tied score in the ninth inning
I'm down with Kris and ain't no stopping me
I'm out for Bronx and Monopoly with chicks on top of me
It's My Philosophy, but for now it's in the corridor
Slappin caps like a ball hittin hard to my laborator
These motherfuckers don't want it
(Word to mother Joe, these niggaz don't want it!)
Verse Three: KRS-One
Merrrcy, you wanna serve me but you ain't worthy
My style is too curvy, what you tellin' me
But your flimsy ass will go home after the battle and find I'm your boss
With KRS-One up in your memory
I know your kind, you rap write
You're Mr. John Gotti the Don, but you're just another bwotty mon
Telecro bwotty mon, how you collect
Rap magazine dating back to, Tougher than Leather
The only reason you got, such an extensive rap collection
'Cause most of your rap mags are all stuck together
Watch what you sayin', watch what you say
When your skull gets cracked, whatcha gonna say crackhead?
Your file is dead, kneel to the rap God in bed
Fore I slap you way Back in the Dayz like Ahmad
Don't get me fed up, or vexed up, 'cause you'll get set up
My crew don't let up, I be dead up in this piece (tell em)
Recognize it's BlastMaster KRS-One
For ten years, Fat Joe, chillin' on the East"

And then them rushin' memories make me cry till I can't stop man
Tell my mama I'm a killer if I happen to die
That's how I lived, ain't no sense in me lyin'
My whole life's filled with danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My neighborhood's full of gangstas and drive-bys
And niggas fightin' for position
The demon has risen from out of prison
Now I'm losin' my religion

Paparazzi snappin pictures at your home
Congratulations (woo) baby you're a star
(You hear that baby? You're a star, hahaha)
Congratulations - the world knows who you are
(The world knows you, at least for today)
(T.A.)
Yo, yo
I wanna be like Diddy, I wanna run my city
A Billboard in Times Square, see that's me, yeah
Best rap album what I'm shootin for every year
Pick a place player my name is heavy there
It's groupies everywhere and they all want me
Even the young ones so I need ID
Still ride hat low two-deep in a two-seat
When I flow through don't ever try to confuse me
I ain't tryin' to be rude so excuse me
Watch me two step in my brand new Louis'
Bounce, bounce bounce on the track
Every girl wanna know when T.A. comin' back
I'm famous, I made it, successful
Now I'm less stressful, only eat the best food
If you work hard enough your dreams'll come true
A star could be me or a star could be you
(Rico Love)
Yeah
Yo, too easy y'all, hahaha
Yo, hahaha
As we said I ain't a boss to not be lyin'
Now why you bitches labels got me drivin{?}
Nigga I'm in orbit, ball a whole bunch
You call that mortgage, I call that lunch
And I'm so gorgeous, your wife might hunch
And I ain't even gotta spike her punch
Won't lose the end even if I lose a friend
Pen the big hits, I don't even use a pen
Hehe, I'm like Luther and them
I cheese hard, now they wanna shoot through my grin
... But I got bulletproof cheeks
Bust off on her like she got bulletproof sheets
Ask B, rope for us
Peep the fee, boats are plush
And maybe I spoke too much
But if you want to win you gotta go through us"

19,Crush Tonight,2002,Loyalty (2002),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"(Ginuwine)
Baby, if you wit' it, just clap yo' hands
Stop playin' girl, back that ass up and
Spend that cash dog, drink the Henny and
Freak that girl like you tryna have a baby 'cause
Everybody's out to fuck tonight
The fly women, they out to fuck tonight
My niggas, they down to fuck tonight
Ladies, fellas, the won't stop players
(Fat Joe)
Came through the door, seen it before
Hands touchin' the ceiling, booty streakin' the floor
You ever felt good to the point you so sure that
All the attention in the club is yours
Got your hair done up, shades Christian Dior
Leave us, trade a little happy on your Vickey draws
Gettin' your dance on hard, who could wish for more
And your crew's all but know it's a horse
Got the Don all warm and it ain't the Hen'
Feelin' like the Don woman, you could wrestle her chin
Shorty, come a little closer while the record spin
I wanna freak a little longer, can they play it again
Yo, got my mind on my money, money on my mind
And to let you know, you just as good as gold
It's like we got our own little private party goin' on
And the scene just changed into shores of San Juan
It's so intimate, we so into it
Such a tender thing, but fuck I'm innocent
Grindin' so hard you gotta know what I'm thinkin'
Laughin' 'cause I'mma kidnap you for the weekend
Now we at the pad about to crack a case
Playin' the couch like Caesar's, she feedin' me grapes
Not for nuttin' hon, the sex is great
But you know you got to go, I got checks to chase... next
(Ginuwine)
If you're wit' it grab your friends, follow Joe and me
'Cause it's on, it's on
Went in and got the Cris' and a pound of weed
It's on, it's on
(Fat Joe)
Now mami, let's get serious, 'cause by the looks of it
It seems your sexuality is just a little curious
You got a friend, we could gather then split
If not, I got a girl for every girl I get
There's a drop in the lot and it whip so fast
We hit the swiss hotel before you finish your glass
And you know you wanna be where the cake is at
Where the pockets just like calories, extra fat
Mami, your body like Malery on Natural Born Killer
She like, they got money but y'all are more realer
She wanna roll wit' us, pretty much to crit' us
No beatin' around the bush, just beatin' it till you bit us"
20,Da Fat Gangsta,1993,Represent (1993),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"(Fat Joe)
Yeah... uh-huh...
Chill... hah, yeah...
C'mon...
I'm comin' rougher than the roughest motherfucker could get
Playin' Russian Roulette, never lost a bet yet
Bluffin, ain't my style, niggaz ain't sayin' nothin'
'Cause I'm buckwild without frontin
Raw to the core, I grew up poor
Once I hit the door, I began to explore
Curiosity killed my cat, but not me
Because I learned how to kill with agility
I grew up in the South Bronx, punch you in your mouth punk
I know these streets like Fred Sanford knows junk
In the trunk of a car lays a body
Head decapitated, bust him with my shotty
Stabbed the mug, to make sure, he wasn't comin' back
Now police, can picture that, with a Kodak... huh!
They can't stop me with a homicide investigation
'Cause if they do my crew is hittin up the station
Your best bet, is to let me jet
'Cause I bring war, like a vet, when I'm upset... huh!
I'm not the one you wanna play out in a program
Yo, you better tell them who the hell I am
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Yeah! (2X)
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Tell 'em who the hell I am
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta""
(Fat Joe)
Now on the hip-hop tip, I'm no joke
Get live at a jam, and leave a system broke when I spoke
MC's froze, but I never said freeze
Hopin I don't hit 'em like a fucked up disease
Fall up in the club, Mr. Hype for a night
Choke a rapper with a cord, hang him from the lights... huh!
Now you do wanna mess around with the Fat Man
Cause you see my face in every newsstand
Every other magazine from Billboard to Spin
Pick it up and read Fat Joe strikes again
How true, I'm not about weed and brew
I'm just another papichulo like the rest of my crew
So give me the microphone
This jam is dedicated to my main man Tone
'Cause he flips, and I flip, and we flip the script
And you know, you don't wanna get your ass WHIPPED
Party over here, another in the hospital
Lincoln, Memorial, notice that's how I sent you, hah
I was the one who played the shoot 'em up games
Here's another patient, and yo what's my name?
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Yeah! (2X)
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Tell 'em who the hell I am
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta""
(Fat Joe)
So I cruise around in the B-M
Or in the Benz, hurtin' enemies and makin' new friends
They shake my hand, smile in my face
The nine's in my waist, so there won't be a chase
That's it, the situation is blown out of proportion
When you leave, you must use caution
Look over your shoulder, even on your block
When I come to visit, you know you're in shock
So don't say who is it, act like you know
Kickin down doors is the Gangsta Fat Joe
And I got no time for games
My name is goin' down in the gangsta hall of fame
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Yeah!
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Tell 'em who the hell I am
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta""
(Fat Joe)
Yeah... Fat Joe Da Gangsta

Yeah, uh, uh
Recognize my presence, this rap game specialized with legends
I drop shit niggaz try to memorize in seconds
You criticize me, still visualize the lessons
And when I wish to put aside the questions
Before they find out, who's the realest
Who done spoke without one joke about the illest
Shit that ever happened, in this rappin' beyond rappin'
Joe the God it ain't so hard to start clappin
But I lay low, create flows, for the pesos
Now we got extra hoes, wantin to chase shows
I take foes, and break 'em down to minerals
We went from street corner thugs to white collar criminals
Individuals, with no peace on the quest
The iced out, piece on my chest, from the East to the West
Never sleep in a sweat, keep the heat with the vest
Ready for the 'casian blazin' gettin' deep with the best
The police wanna test my strategy, got half of the world
Mad at me, but very few challenge me
Perhaps you will be the first to approach this, lyrical dope shit
Cartagena will bring the chrome like explosives

Ask your peeps if I ain't have the beast soundin Japanese
Coughin blood, that's what you get for talkin' thug
Run up on your preacher with the sweeper feature coughin slugs
Once a thug always a thug, hallways and drug dealers
Fillers, killers, they wanna chill all day with us
They love the Don, these words are more than just another song
If I said I slit your neck, your jugular's gone
Ain't nothin' artificial, Joe the God, the Terror Squad official
Got a lot of pistols with missiles, prayer lies with you

It's like I gotta keep remindin you and remindin you
Who's that nigga... You heard the kid
Flowers on the casket of all those who oppose the squadus
It's the motherfuckin Don Cartagena ya heard
What?!
(Chorus: Remy Martin)
They wanna know why ya name is Joey Crack
You a hustler, how they think you got the stacks? (Uh)
You stuck being in jacks on the blocks witcha paps (Yeah)
And the Squad to hard niggaz gotta fall back (Tell 'em)
Damn papi, you're shit is icey now (Uh-huh)
In the Bronx witcha Benz rims pokin out (Ten mil)
You got the niggaz in the pen straight loc'in out
But when the don is on nigga close ya mouth
(Fat Joe)
Yeah, yo
You wouldn't understand my story of life I live
Most niggaz that really know me got life as bids
The trife as kids, this ain't no Scarface shit
These niggaz really will kill you, your wife, and kids
I walked through many blocks niggaz couldn't stand on
Had shit locked before I had a glock to even put my hands on
Before I had the dough to put my fams on
Before I had rocks sealed in pink tops, tryna get a gram off
A wild adolescent, raised by the street
Mesmorized by the dealers and the places they eat
And when they blazed the heat, I was the shorty to take the handoff
Run upstairs, tryna sneak the gat past grandmoms
This is how it should be done... my life...
Is identical to none, son tryed to duplicate but I knew he was fake
'Cause every time I walked by he turned blue in the face
I'm like heavy on the leg when I pop
All my change is like heavy on the weight when I cop
It's just the way it's done
Niggaz tell me they respect the way I blaze them guns
On hold it down for the Bronx in the name of Pun
(Fat Joe)
Yeah uh, my name ring bells like a P.O.
Put the pressure on a nigga like I'm right atcha do'
With the muzzle out, nigga can't shoke with my dough
I'm at his mothers house
Beat up his pops, put the pistol in his brother's mouth
Wave bricks, whips... jerked a few coke and next play the strip
With chrome knowin' that they won't forget
And on the weekends we shut down clubs
You know them crazy Peurto Ricans always fuckin' it up!
If I can't afford it, I'ma extort it
If I can't cut it, I'ma bake it
Strip you niggaz butt-naked, I'm a thoroughbred
Carry guns and pump heroin
Never went O.T. I'm too light for Maryland
I'd rather play the streets of New York
Where the fiends are guarunteed to keep the meat on my fork
I'm just a hustler - feds put the tap
On our phones in hopes of cuffin us
Then wonder why we livin' life so illustrious

Verse One: Fat Joe
Now why the sad face, jealous for fellas that's diamond laced
Tryin' to find a place to recline, shine my face
Under the sun where it's warm, runnin' with Pun till I'm gone
That's word is bond on my moms
That's the squad motto, got beef we call Rallo
Dame Un Trago, he go to war wit a bottle
Simple as dat, flip out the mack and cripple a cat (""take that"" 4X)
Right through your back tissue with any pistol I pack (c'mon)
Physical rap means we live the lyrics
Long as niggaz fear us you could never entirely disappear us
We the realest you ever gon' see
In all honesty, ain't another brother that's hotter than me
Modesty'll get nowhere, that's why I go there (yeah, yeah)
Like lettin you know where to buy the new Fat Joe gear (that's right)
Five sixty (five sixty) only the Squad ride with me
Unless you a Bad Boy, and roll with Puff Diddy (eheheheh)
It's my city, and everything in it
Ain't a thing rented (c'mon) it's my Benz, if you see me in it (yeah)
We invented floodin the watch, and runnin' the spots
That's why, I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
Chorus: Puff Daddy
What you thought, we ain't run the streets?
Now you can't sleep ten deep, convoyin in the Benz jeep
Rollin' deep with the Don-Tana
I put the chrome in your cara, adios to manana
Verse Two: Fat Joe
Yeah, uh, yo
You better slide or catch this homicide
Ain't no match for Joey Crack I'm blowin' backs out the other side
Brothers died and mother's cried at wakes, these are The Breaks
Kurtis Blow your head off like Jake (like Jake)
So take heed and read between the lines, ain't no cheatin' mines
Player haters never wanna see my shine
Up in the Range or in the Lex Coupe
Rockin' a fresh suit with dress shoes, on my way to Les Boo's
Less choose the life we rather live, on the streets stabbin kids
Or livin' mad sweet in lavish cribs
Fix marriages for my kids, six karats, I'm a whiz (mm, mmm)
Exotic tokin parrots on my wrist
It ain't shit but for sex, money, and drugs
True thugs with slugs and wrap bodies in rugs
What the fuck, Joe Crack, twist your cap back
Leave your heart rate flat, once Terror Squad attacks (yeah yeah yeah)

27,Dopeman,2011,The Darkside Vol. 2 (2011),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"Trying to cut the top off the Porsche
Put a bitch in the front
Better yet hundred sticks for the niggas that front
I got a steel in them packs, got 'em right in the trunk
Shoot the snap back off your muthaf-ckin head if you want
I got a guardian angel, yeaf she stay in the hood
And she pop up whenever I touch the grain on the wood
I got a bitch from Atlanta, she remind me of Pebbles
Got a hell of an ass, this redbone is a devil
She call me Marty McFly, Nike Back To The Future
10 racks on my feet, but that's something I'm used to
I put my team on the map, you other niggas is fake
Worse than Oregon, you switch a different jersey a day
I'm in the beach somewhere foreign, I'm in your bitch while you snoring
A million cash off the tour, then I'm back in the morning
I'm f-ckin sick of you niggas, I'm about to throw up a million
Doctor oz in the kitchen: cook a perfect prescription
Go prez, go prez, rolling in Bugatti
I got that Ringo Starr
I'm slingin' Paul McCartney
Bitch I'm in the kitchen with that Arm and Hammer
Whipping George Harrison, John Lennon
Dopeman! Dopeman!
Dopeman bitch, I'm the dopeman
Bitch I'm in the kitchen with that Arm and Hammer
Whipping George Harrison, John Lennon
Of course I could get em
But do you know what to do with em?
60 for the brick even if you cop a few of 'em
Talking about that diesel: the root of all evil
You could use your nostrils, or you could use a needle
I need a hundred more, and I want it pure
'Cause when somebody die off it
Then they want it more!
The hustlers we surrounded by niggas that hold the hammers
Oxys got generic, they switched it to old
When you give 'em a 9 or better they go bananas
Make a million dollars a month: that's what the plan was
Now to catch the morning shift
'Cause they need that morning sniff
Thousand bundles finished by 11, then I'm blowing spliffs
Show you how to get right, crib right, whip right
Ten dollars a bag, but it's 20 after midnight
Pill man, weed man, stove man, coke man
You know who I am muthaf-cka: I'm the dopeman
Cut the man off the middle, I want it all off the top
Bout to yacht me a nigga, run him off of the block
I'm taking all of the profit, purchasing more of the product
Invest in killers and dealers to take my company public
I got a thing for them strippers
Got a pole in the mansion
White ho, Marilyn Manson
This for all of my niggas doing time up in prison
For getting caught with the burner, you know a rider's ambition
I'm 'bout to gamble with life, take a trip out to Vegas
I'm 'bout a Zionist mic praying the Lord to forsake us
Remember times I was broke, how it run in your pocket
Spend my money on dope, then I tripled my profit
Now I'm a multi-millionaire, head off in the Lear
Take bitches on the private, than set off in the air
""What you say nigga?""
""I said I'll suck yo dick!"""

30,Envy,1995,Jealous One's Envy (1995),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"Yo This is going out to all my peeps locked down
Charlie Rock, LD
All my peeps who passed away, yeah
I remember when we used to chill on a hill
When Forest Projects, used to be Godsville
Brothers was wilin, others was cool
Some hit the island, some smoked fools
Me I chose the life of crime since day one
13 years old, already trying to cop a gun
I never understood why my pops would beat me
No matter what I did, yo he'd still mistreat me
That's why I never listened to a thing he said
And I wasn't just mad when I used to wish him dead
Instead, me and Ma Dukes kept tight
Promised that one day everything would be all right
14 Years old, cutting mad classes
Puffing on a bone, breaking car glasses
Nothing but dreams of cream on my mind
Shook motherfuckers on the block droppin' dime
Everybody knew Joey Crack represented
And if I told then I'd take your life
Hey Yo, I meant it
That's the way it goes
When you deal with the real fake jacks
And get your cap peeled
Hey Joey, let's just get this money
Brothas just be wilin
Hey Joey, you can't trust nobody
Brothas they been triflin
Yeah Momma never said life would be so hard
Sometimes I find myself alone just praying to god
Hoping that today won't be the last
I mean, Just the other day this kid I knew got blasted
(Say Word) Word, it wasn't over no cash.
It was over some broad who liked to auction off the ass
He was a cool kid, although we lost him big
If he was a real nigga, then he wouldn't have got did
Life's trife, and then you die
Nobody dies of old age, but in the hands of another guy
That's why I keeps an alibi
Juliani wants to see a brother fry
So I maintain to keep my mind peace focused
Keep the gat there in case a nigga wanna smoke this
Times are difficult on the streets of New York
It's kinda hard trying to hope for and not get caught
Blue eyes is on my back with intentions of arresting me
But they won't get the best of me
Cause riches are my destiny
No one expected me to blow like this
What was once hand me downs
Is now the best of ??atanovich??
Yukon Jeeps creepin' through the streets
Catching the eye of every big booty cheek freak
Daten rims so shiny you can see your reflection
Green plush interior, under the seat
The heat for protection
Momma look at me now
Got a house in Long Isle for my spouse and my child
D.E.L. condos for first impression hoes
No more holes in my gibros
Strictly denim and clothes
Airwaves blasting my latest single
All up in the Mecca Club
Making Lucci while I mingle
Jingle jewels in the face of past enemies
Eat your heart out son, you never was a friend to me

If a nigga fake jax, I'm gonna kill a MC

Fuck around and get thrown off the project roof
Mad lives have been lost and forgotten

Keepin' shit real, niggaz know the deal
Just through trial and comin' down on appeal

Blowin' out the tweeters in your musical component
It's your man Fat Joe, oh, is that so?

And go play golf with Russell Simmons
That's the type of mission that I'm on
Aiyyo my word is bond, I keep a army just as deep as Farrakhan

I bet you thought I left you hangin', Joe Crack returns bangin'
With somethin' brand spankin, what the fuck was y'all thinkin'?
Blow out your tweeters, have dinner with world leaders
Terror Squad so much they be cats with dark caesars
Fast cars and millimeters, gold cards and Visa's
Givin' nonbelievers ways to fly with Jesus
Here's my thesis, enterprise break the block to pieces
Hustler and hard pool shark like Jack Gleason
The only reason I came back was for the platinum
With raps, ten times more deadly than saccharin
MC's be actin', I think somebody needs to slap em
Run up on 'em attack em, and ask 'em what's his passion
My love is rockin' shows at the highest extremity
This star from Trinity got your mom sayin' she's feelin' me
Who's dealin' ki's, that's peace, get your cheese, ?
Pump this masterpiece at the loudest degree
Chorus: Fat Joe, Armageddon (repeat 2X)
Let me find out (find out) niggaz is noddin out
Take some time out (time out) you wondered my whereabouts
The truth is I never left you, I kept my promise (what?)

Terror Squad the worst that hurt shit, split you to verses
Joey Crack the world in half, Punisher punish em
Till they lose the hopes and dreams they had
Then Armageddon finish em
Yo I'm bout as braze as Satan, no exaggeratin
My crew is radiatin, shinin while you playa-hation
Cartagena hit 'em like the Red Army invasion
Operatiion lace 'em show 'em what they facin, what?
I've been down since the days of Flash
When it was fun and laughs, before hip-hop was based on cash
Let's blaze a sack and concentrate on coke inflation
You know the biggest asses in United Nations
Fuck the Federation, general population is hibernatin
But bear witness to information that'll rock this nation
I'm not God, but indeed, my mind's relatin
Better act now, before your life is wasted
Cause time is racin

Take Don Cartagena, as your lawfully wedded husband
Now by the power invested in me, by me
I pronounce you husband and wife

I'm underground like a gutter
You never catch me - stutter, everybody knows that I'm butter
I'm not the man with sensitivity
The name is Fat Joe, the label's Relativity, huh
I chop a rapper like a meat cleaver
I'm burnin hot, people think I have a fever, check it
If niggaz wanna front, then come widdit
If you're havin' second thoughts, well then forget it, see
I dig in my crates, I don't per-pa-trates
I got shit sewn, like Billy Bathgate
Beware like Cocoa, yo I'm not a slow boat
Got so much dough I va-cate in Acapulco
Crazy as they come I'm not the one, we can do this
With the hands, or take it to the guns...
You know I can flow, the name is Fat Joe
I can flow, I can flow, I can flow
(Fat Joe)
Yeah, yeah
Everybody knows Fat Joe's in town
Nuff respect for the Boogie Down
I'm livin' in the Bronx on an Ave called Trinity
My name rings bells, within the vicinity
Peace to the money makers always plottin mono
Together we gettin' dough, just like Lucky Luciano
People always tell me, yo you're dope Joe
But I'm not a car, so I don't get gassed like Amoco
Never ate the paint, no I'm not a sucker
Never liked balls so to Hell with the Rucker
Always on my own never sweatin nobody
Warm up a crowd like a bottle of Bacardi
I can kick it this way, I can kick it thattaway
I kick a funky style, from New York to Piscataway
Suckers best scram
Now in ninety-three it's all about the Fat Man
Peace to Finesse, Showbiz and A.G.
Gizmo, Little Hec', and Kool Micskit (say what?)
My crew from Uptown
And if you mess around, then you'll catch a beatdown
See I got this in a smash
If a rapper steps up, he'll get smoked
Like a blunt full of hash
My style of rap is legendary
Fuck with the man, then you'll end up in the cemetery
And that's word to Ma Duke
I never fake moves, I'll go out like a troop
So act like you know, the name is Fat Joe
I can flow, I can flow, I can flow
(Fat Joe)
Yeah
See I rip the mic if you put me to a test
Troop it gets so bad, I make you wanna wear a vest
'Cause I'm too hot to handle
Knockin' niggaz out like ?Livingston Bramble?
Rappers come heavy, but yo I weigh a ton
I won't lose weight 'cause I'm not on the run
I'm on point like a sniper, hyper than the hyper
On the DL, overlooked by C-Cypher
Never get caught, I'm on top with my game
Flip a fat ride, there's no need for a train
Rappers come close, but they just can't make it
When it comes to the funk, you know I won't fake it
Peace to Serge, and my right hand Flex
And when I grab the mic nobody wants to rock next
The name is Fat Joe, cause Joe is livin' Fat
Niggaz gettin' jealous 'cause I got a contract
But I don't sweat it, I know the style is raw
You can't compare me to a cornball
And you know I kick game like a hottie
Now in ninety-three, they should free John Gotti
If you step, battle and I'm gonna mash your toes
You know I got the flow"

Long before Charlie got knocked, until Madonna died
Young and not givin' a fuck
There ain't a nigga I ain't hit when I buck and left 'em shit outta luck
I'ma gangsta like my daddy was, hittin number spots
Sendin me to my room while he was puffin pot
Still I use to peak from the door, couldn't believe what I saw
Stacks of money on the bed and the floor
It wasn't long till I did what he did
I was an innocent kid and got exposed to the life that he lived
I went from grams into O's, pounds to bricks
On the strip pimpin' hoes on some goldie shit
I'ma gangsta by destiny, OG's selected me
I earned my spot, my whole team elected me

Gangsta, gangsta
I wanna be a gangsta
My daddy was a gangsta

Yeah, unh, yo, unh
Here goes this chick doing ten in the bing
But 'less we rhyme time we see her do it again
She started out fuckin' dudes that resembled her father
Mom knew shoulda schooled her but the bitch didn't bother
You couldn't blame her 'cause she got it from her
She was a rider from jump, her pop's died in the hands of a chump
Now she's mad at the world, no more daddy's little girl
Now she's rockin' bandanas, no more Shirley Temple girl
Now she be runnin' wit some scramblers that be down in Alabama
Packin twin hammers, screamin ""Life doesn't matter""
It's a vicious cycle, her game is pretending to like you
Thinkin' you getting head but she's just duckin so they can snipe you
Movin from state to state, runnin' everything from guns to trains
And pushing packs from eight to eight
You know I can't say her name but she was a looker
Pretty thing, such a shame how this life has took her
Now she's raising hell in the cell, no more his are hollering
You might suffer the same fate if you repeat the following...
Sell drugs, use drugs, get caught up in the mix
End up locked up or dead in a casket, that's it"

40,Get On Up,1993,Represent (1993),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"Here we go, now I'm back
I got soul, although I'm not black
Pass the mic and I'm a spark it
'Cause I'm the hottest rapper on the market
I used to shoot dice to the curb
Peace to my brothers on 163rd
Hold your head and stay strong
My main man Roadie got it going on
So now you know the time
Bust how I flip it, check the rhyme
I kick the hits even with the big belly
'Cause I freak the funk like my man R. Kelly
So give me that honey love
You know what I'm thinking of
Joe's the man with the master plan
I got more rhymes than the beats got fans
Peace to Greg Nice and Smooth B
And if you don't believe then you soon shall see
That I'll be the last to survive
I won't fake the funk, I won't take a dive
So now you know what's up
I make the crowd bounce and get on up
""Get on up"" ""Get on up!"" (Repeat 4x)
This is a jam for the radio station
Peace to the whole Zulu Nation
I'm so bad, call the cops
I got props, I'm gonna rule hip-hop
'Cause I'm the only real rap monster
I love eating shrimp and lobster
City Island is my favorite place
Step in Sammy's and dog my face
Losing weight, that must be a joke
'Cause I eat four steaks and drink a Diet Coke
Although I'm big I won't take a swig
Of the Moet, it makes me a much worse poet
And you know that's not the mood, black
Diamond always hits me with the crazy fat tracks
So now you know what's up
I make the crowd bounce, get on up
""Get on up"" ""Get on up!"" (Repeat 4x)
""Get On Up"" is the name of this song
Bounce to the beat if you got it going on
Now in '93, maybe '94
They'll have a Fat Joe tour
Coming to your town with the brand new sound
Representing for the whole Boogie Down
So don't grab the mic or you'll get hurt
If you come in a Bez then you'll leave in a hearse
That's that, everybody knows the flav
Misbehave and you'll dig your own grave
Fat Joe, chopping down trees
Nuff respect to Showbiz & A.G.
Peace to my buckwild crew from the Bronx
I hope you'll strike me gets a good response
And if you like the vibe, act like you know
You can get on up with your man Fat Joe, and I'm out
""Get on up"" ""Get on up!"" (Repeat 4x)
To my people from Brooklyn, get on up
And to my people from Manhattan, get on up
To my people from the Bronx (Get on up)
To my people from Cali
To my people from Texas
To my people from Atlanta
To my people in Detroit
Everybody in the world just get on up

How you cats on your album only three mics?
Like 'Pac shit is funny to me
All you niggaz livin' bummy wasn't fuckin' with me
Now nigga get it on, soon you be dead and gone
Shorty got a bubble all she need the silicone
Love my A-T-L bitches, pay my bail bitches
Type to let you fuck but never tell bitches
Down-ass hoes that'll grind that dough
Catch me with another chick and beat 'em down to a pulp
It's the F-A-T, to the, J-O-E
Drink Cris' with the Feds when they come for me
No cuffs, no guns, they respect a G
Number one with a slug, what you expect from me, huh?
Are you serious?
(Chorus: Fat Joe)
If you see a nigga frontin fake shit on his wrist
Walk around all night, same bottle of Cris'
Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?

New sass weave and fucked up toes

Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?
(Armageddon)
Now all my ladies put your hands up
Nah mami, if you fuck for dough then you's a hoe
And no I'm not the one that don't drop the notes
I only ice the beef and rock the coat
Think you gettin' somethin' from me your thoughts are broke
Might get a little wheeze and assault, he's wrote
So get the hell on with that, don't you weave and feel it
Get the hell on with that, I'm aight I'm chillin'
Chicken neck-ass bitch tryna palm the dough
Should've charged me at the door, I woulda let you know
Get the same jewel mouth full of heavy Mo'
Coulda made you a thug from the guy with the mo'
But yo, I ain't never met a chick that was innocent
They all fuck some, eat some, never kiss
I know a lot that got skeed on and that was it
See me in the video like, ""Bitch is suckin dick!""
(Chorus: Fat Joe)
You let him in at one time cause you thought he was fly
Now you see him at the clubs, he don't pay you no mind
Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?
Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?
Yo, every time you smoke, dude puff your 'dro
But when it's time to go cop, he ain't got no dough
Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?
Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?

Ludacris be the number one street - clown wishin 'em luck
'Cause I'm bout to make 'em break a leg thinkin' I'm givin' a FUCK
And you catch a beat - down, bottles is breakin, craniums crack
Chairs thrown when the heat is attacked
And you hear the street - sound, hitters and runners
Killers and gunners, winter to summer the niggaz that want us
Are headed East - bound, trouble in West other than South
Cover your chest, they cover your mouth
I'm goin' deep - down Dirty indeed, birdies in need
Thirty degrees and you heard it from me
But I'm bout to reach - 'round grabbin my gun
They scatter and run but I'm handlin and havin' some fun
They gotta keep - rounds up under the bed, up under the spread
If it ain't then it ain't, no wonder you dead
So go to sleep - now, throats is splitted
And folks that get it they gotta get the hell on widdit, BIATCH
(Chorus: Fat Joe)
Yo, yo, all these niggaz that claim thug like they're the type
But when it's time to go to war they runnin' for dear life
Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?

Got this clown runnin' around like he's my fam

What was once a dream is now reality
And I'm glad I never listened to haters thet said it'd never be

Set goals, and keep your weight up,
And good times'll come through. What? [what, what?]

Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
For goodness sake before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
Heavenly Father
Lord, forgive me for the killings in the past
All the corrupt business and the dealings that I had
All these pregnant ladies that I serve up their ass
Have me feeling like complete shit when I held my first gat
They killed Tom right in front of his home
They even murdered Steve and my empathy
So I dropped to my knees, why it couldn't be me?
Why you had to leave me here to deal with all this envy?
Even though I got free, you might feel like I ain't free
Hated by the gang tryin' to be something they can't be
A couple hundred million is something we'll never see
So we speedin', crashing headfirst into a tree
Heavenly Father
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
For goodness sake before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
Heavenly Father
I've paid niggers rents, even paid niggers bells
Gave niggers jobs, so they wouldn't go to jail
Did so much dirt, niggers knew I wouldn't tell
Paid for some funerals, they probably went to hell
I don't owe nobody nothin', man, I get a bitter meal
I ain't beatin' around the bush, I'm just speakin' on what's real
I ain't talkin' on no bullshit, man, I'm talkin' about what's real
I ain't justifying beatings when she cheated on my nails
Cheated with his brother, god damn, this bitch ill
Probably the reason my nigger never left a will
Things you never know, have mercy on his soul
Big Pun, one of the most realest I ever known
Heavenly Father
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
For goodness sake before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
Heavenly Father
When I die, I know they'll bury me a G
Don't cry for me, just let a nigger a be
In other words, let your nigger rest in peace
I've been goin' so hard and I barely got sleep
Lord, I know my mamma gonna take my pass at heart
But let her know when these streets are little [Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible] take a motherfucker's heart
Many wars, you could see it on the police cars
Lord, could you forgive me for my sins?
Let me fly, would you help a nigger spread his wings?
As I ride, you'll forever be my queen
Just though for now, Danny had to go and meet the King
Heavenly Father
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
For goodness sake before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
For goodness sake

48,I Am Crack,2010,The Darkside Vol. 1 (2010),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"You know
What you gotta understand is that it's a drug
That affects the brain chemistry of the user
And it causes things like paranoia, euphoria, insomnia, loss of appetite
And this really insatiable craving for more cocaine
People who smoke crack, they get this immediate
And intense release of dopamin in the brain
And once those dopamin levels plummet after just a few minutes
The smoker feels compelled to take another hit
Just to ease the feelings of depression and sadness
Good afternoon
We're reporting live in the streets of the Bronx today
Chronicling a deadly epidemic sweeping the nation
A wave of violent crimes have been linked to chronic addiction
To and distribution of a drug called
Crack
They heat me up, I can see the top bubble waitin for me
Investigators sendin snitches for me
Sold out, lines around the block
Niggas waitin for a whiff of that base and that rock
Chicago Bulls fitted, they callin me red top
You can find me in Humboldt Park soon as it gets dark
Or even in the daylight, even though it ain't right
I'm outside the church preyin on some saved lives
Or sittin' on a scale good enough to taste
I'm better than a protein shake to lose weight
Nigga, no doubt I'm the hardest in the game
It's the Rock, I ain't talkin' Jay, Biggs and Dame
I'm talkin' bling-bling, crack pipe and a collar
I make bums fight to wash cars for a dollar
A glass dick in the mouth of a model
Take your time, baby, don't spit, just swallow
Base
Downtown Miami we've described on the scene
A intense gun battle between police and known drug dealers
From both the local area and New York City
The shooting's been ongoing since early this afternoon
And sources report that so far as many as
Nine people have been killed or wounded
This is just another chapter in what has been
Miami's epic struggle in the war against...
...I - I'm just a reporter!
(Shots)
In the '80s I made so many premature babies
Put niggas in Mercedes strapped with .380's
Uh, who you think made Nino smarter?
If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't be no Carter
Down in DC, yeah, shit got scary
Almost lost my political connect with Mayor Barry
They mix me with embalming fluid, it's unreal
And Jada said he cooked me on a Foreman Grill
Turn a happy home into a stash house
They can smoke me all night until they pass out
I'm cool with pops and I'm cool with moms
But they don't know that we cool, me and you share a bond
Franklins, Jacksons, get me to actin' a fool
I transform into a bird on the moon
Down south yeah, they on me, kid
I'm the shit lettin baseheads and zombies live
Base
A more brutal form of cocaine known as crack
Is increasingly penetrating every part of our social strand
Classified as a Schedule I substance by the DEA
Crack is wreaking havoc on (?) the inner city and the suburbs
With the war on drugs reaching a fever pitch
Law enforcement agencies are scrambling to rid
Their communities of this destructive drug
CL 63 with the seats reclinin
From the cracks we slingin and the keys we flinin
Keep iron on me, niggas on the streets keep eyin me
Till I Stuart Scott a nigga, y'all peep me sideways
Crack is good coke, good dope
Is good money, thick broads on big boats
Big business, big Benzes
26 rims lead to never ending sentences
I'm lookin' clean in a box
With a fresh line-up, nigga, your time's up
The dumps where they find you mangled and tied up
50 keys in the stash gets the streets dried up
Short a few guns, need a couple of pies
You see a boat, I run it right by
Can you feel it, nothin' can save ya
It's crack baby, minus the incubators"

Fat Joe Da Gangsta, got this in a smash, know what I'm saying?
Showbiz, Diamond D, check this out
Awww, one to the head, I don't give a fuck
Suckers better duck, buck buck buck buck!
I let off mad shots
You get dragged when you face the big shot
Yeah, and the Bronx is my territory
Suckers getting sprayed, end of story
Whether one deep or with my crew
I pack a .45, my girl packs a .22
Huh, so you know I'm all right
If niggas want beef, then I give 'em a hell of a fight
Yeah, I'm quick to blow a nigga out the frame
I'm insane, pushing punks in front of a train
'Cause I don't have it up to here
Talking about skins, I have more than Richard Gere
Yeah, 'cause I got it like that
It ain't hard to tell that Joe is living fat
How I last and surpass any nigga who shows his ass
Is gonna end up getting blast
Run for jewels and give me the cash
Everybody knows I got this in a smash
Yeah, you know I got this in a smash (So what's up, what's up?)
Aw shit, another brother hit
This time it's Tone, life is a fucking bitch
It really hurts when the shit hits home
Early in the morning, they calling me on the phone
Telling me my man caught eight to the chest
Nah, this couldn't be, Tone always wore a vest
But that's the way the story goes
Today you're here, and tomorrow who knows?
Man I'm gonna miss him, I love him to death
Charlie's in jail and I'm the only brother left
It's time to get strong, forget about the sorrow
But like Ike said, no one is promised tomorrow
Fuck the bullshitting, it's time to get cash
Don't fuck with me 'cause I got this in a smash
Yeah, you know I got this in a smash (So what's up, what's up?) (Repeat 4x)
Well it's the F-A-T, Gang S-T-E-R
Living like a star, drive a fat car
525 and I'm crazy live
Not all the loot in the world could make me take a dive
Fucking mad bitches on the first date
Straight to the telly, hit the skins, I gotta skate
See, I got no time for a stunt
Because a 40 and a blunt, that's all she really wants
Yeah, so dough keeps collecting PC
Knocking out punks with my man Diamond D
Cause everybody knows I'm the man
And if you fuck with me, then shit'll hit the fan
I took mad flicks since '76
Robbing every other brother for their motherfucking kicks
I once heard a kid say he's his brother's keeper
His brother turned around and bust him with a street sweeper
Everybody wants the cash
But don't fuck with me 'cause I got this in a smash
Yeah, you know I got this in a smash (So what's up, what's up?) (Repeat 4x)"

A material girl, in a material world
Venus, Serena, my cereal girls (Wheaties)

Make it back before the DJ's finished with his set
Now they call me the birdman, when them doors ajar
Ghost ride the whip like I'm from Oakland y'all

The brothers out there fronting that only want to be me

So open nice and wide so I can start to stab it
Before I do my duty, really knock the booty
I want to let you know you're a real hot cutie
Baby it's time, I gotta go for mine
We can rub a dub or wine wine wine
I can take you up or be very gentle
Whatever you want, 'cause it's all in the mental
See, I'm a pour silver, all over your body
Get you real freaky, I know you love it, hottie
Baby, I'm a lick you, tell me does it tickle
I won't hit the skins if it smells like pickle
Smooth like butter, though I won't stutter
Sit on my lap if you really wanna
Get with the man who really knows how
To knock the boots, God bless the child
So don't try to front and give me your back
Cause you and I know I'm a hit that
""Skins, you got 'em"" ""Hit it!"" (Repeat 4x)
Man I really love it, yo I really need it
I have a fat jimmy and I have to feed it
Sometimes I'm filled with humor, I know a girl named Zuma
We hit the sack once, then she started rumors
Telling all the chicks that I was really good
I'm big like a train, but I'm the man that could
Give you what you need, give you what you want
I guess I'm like Kenieval, cause yo I love stunts
We could get together, whatever is clever
I used to watch Dynasty just to see Heather
That was then, and now is now
And if Heather ever sees me, she'll scream ""Wow""
The big man of rap, and even more nosey
I'm gonna flip, but yo I got hoes
Don't try to front and give me your back

Wrist on froze, thanks to the stove;
Mattress financial, bank's never closed;
Monday to Sunday, serve all addicts;
Joey Van Gundy, watch me work the Magic;
Ah, and I ain't talkin' NBA;
I ain't even trust the brethren, jealous ones still envy me;
Problem is, these guys ain't even half what they pretend to be;
Cold Don, now look at all the shots that they keep sendin' me;
And your girl the best, she fulfillin' all my fantasies;
She drip, drip, drippin' all up in the Drophead Phantom seats;
Now pop your bottles, blow your cush, fuck what your man say;
'Cause you know we don't give a fuck, we let the pan play...
(Trey Songz - Chorus)
If it ain't about money, why we wastin' time?
(And tell her that) money's all that's on my mind...
You can believe that, I'll be where the cheese at;
Wrist on froze, better get your hoe;
Pocket full of paper, so these haters can't stand me;
Ballin' like the Lakers, keep heat like Miami,
And she killin' in them jeans, ""Baby, won't you take 'em off for me?""
She said she a boss, she ain't talkin'
If it ain't about money, why we wastin' time?

Neck on froze, thanks to the hoes;
Pussy never plummet, pimp till I'm gone;
Powder white work, let's get this shit poppin';
And fuck the police, like them niggaz out in Compton;
Ah, we too fly for our own good;
And you can see the sky shinin' on the chrome hood;
And you can smell that money right off the Lou Vuitton;
Self-made millionaire right from the Bronx;
On my way to Cali, Kobe, he playin' LeBron;
Drop 50 stacks, tell my niggaz ""Pay the bar"";
Stop trippin', that pussy got a nigga hard;
And the Am-Ex card, blacker than my nigga 'Kon...

If it ain't about money, why we wastin' time?
(And tell her that) money's all that's on my mind...
You can believe that, I'll be where the cheese at;
Wrist on froze, better get your hoe;
Pocket full of paper, so these haters can't stand me;
Ballin' like the Lakers, keep heat like Miami,
And she killin' in them jeans, ""Baby, won't you take 'em off for me?""
She said she a boss, she ain't talkin'
If it ain't about money, why we wastin' time?
You can believe that, I'll be where the cheese at;
Wrist on froze, better get your hoe;
Pocket full of paper, so these haters can't stand me;
Ballin' like the Lakers, keep heat like Miami,

She said she a boss, she ain't talkin'
If it ain't about money, why we wastin' time?"

Ain't no peace on the streets with these Spanish kids
Just another cop beating in Los Angeles
Yup! You guessed it the President didn't say shit
'Nother vacation, chillin' in Camp David
And they wonder why the hood's so hot
My pops locked up, my moms cooked rock
And just the other day Lil' Troy got shot
Over a 2 dollar dice game, way to lose your life mayne
Yeah, this is things of that nature
You gon' get a variety of shit, a-ha-ha
It's a new day, new regime, new change

Damn should be illegal how that ass so fat
The way you shake yo shit make me wanna cop back
Is it ya motion causing all this commotion?
Forget niggaz you even got bitches approaching
Who am I? I'm just a kid from the Bronx
If you love hip-hop you might of heard my shit once
Or maybe twice or like thirteen thousand times
I'm sick of it myself I'm loving the shine
Who else could it be but the squad's O.G?
Be laid up Wit chicks that resemble?
Half black, Japanese 'n' something
Ménages, orgies believe me its nothing
The girls want tha facts got to feed 'em the lies
Who else can have you swimming in wealth the blink of an eye?
Big trucks, gee rides, we fly, twenty-fo' wont you sit in them tires
Believe me its nothing
G-4 ? Just wont mix with my ride keep a strap on my side
Believe me its nothing
Fast women, bad bitches, down hoes, hood rich, pitch up in Daddy's hooood
Believe me its nothing
Big trucks mean rides we fly t-squad our time
Believe me is nothing
Drop from Harlem even, more for Brooklyn
Still got my Name covering the walls in central Brooklyn
Haters want me, they love to slut me
Mad because my fat ass stay - living comfy
Down in d-r on the landing strip
When record sales get low we back to advancing bricks
Jack-of-all-trades we do that too
The only rapper get the Suge Knight effect when he come through
When pun died, half of y'all cried
The other half wanna See my demise
It was inevitable the sqaud'll reach new heights it's unforgettable
Follow the don is all we kept telling you
Once you down with the squad you can never give up
No need to get ya jewel's back, let them other crews do that
It's so ironic that I'm under fire I'm like 'mine'll get better one time' you dick blowers
No ya, not dreaming, it's not a visage
It's just another platinum plaque to add to my garage
Ten years in the game - and still going hard -
Fuck a club we flood the studio wit broads
Uh, my whole life never been more focused
Joes the don ask Jennifer Lopez
What the hell in the world did they do to provoke this?
The newspaper reported the scene was atrocious
And still find the time to please girls
Even get hit on by the chick on Cenas world
We beens about it, y'all dudes is frontin'
Big cars, big chips, big Kris' its nothing"

Like cops into getting blocked{*gunshot*}
He busts, I bust back{*gunshot*}

Now maybe I'm a target on the pedastal
Got a little fame now, niggaz wanna harm me for my revenues
Start ya little beef, that's the shit I love to eat

Ain't you can't deny the fact that this fat niggaz fly
Went from Sergio to Kenny
To moving them Lamborghini's
Got you sick to your stomach
Now you ask yourself why
Nigga, Crack was the first
You seem 'em in red monkeys
And I bet you didn't k now that they came in my size
Now its highly controversial if you find me in commercial
And you know that G five's the only way that we fly
Now I'm feeling like Pharrell and Snoop
The world beautiful
Brazilian, Columbian chicks
You know the usual
Them niggaz over there please send them some bottles
'Cause they lookin' like some haters
I don't really need the problems
Cause these niggaz here
We love to give ketchup
We bloody up the whole damn room
If you let us
And I ain't tryin' to steal
I'm just tryin' to chill
And like up this Kush with this hundred dollar bill

Please don't be mad
Don't talk to them boys

Don't tell 'em 'bout the Macks that I stashed in the grass
And that ten mill terror squad
Start up cash
I'm a law abiding citizen
I barely smoke blunts, now
We into real estate
We fuckin' with Donald Trump now
When you know who
Told them boys what
I been rappin' for years all of a sudden I'm hot
Cause the only time you see me is probably when I'm on TV
Smokin' the cohiba on the deck of my yacht
Nigga you could never be me, though I make it seem easy
Only Nigga from the Bronx
Though Miami's my block
Now you got us fucked up
Nigga we don't rat
We don't talk to them boy's
All we do it clap
All we do is spill Crys
Got that on tap
Look at all the shit I accomplished
Not bad for Crack

I'm feeling like Christ at the tabernacle
Stones are thrown at me
Record labels is hiding
Nigga's disowning Joey
And still I throw rocks at tanks
The poor peoples champ
Go against locks with shanks
Yeah I walk the middle of the streets with no body guards
Stick up kid salute the hard body god
My jail niggaz they love this shit
Yeah they sharpen up they shanks while they bumpin' this shit
And my niggaz on the table
Yeah they listen to this
Little Coca
Little soda
Yeah they whipping up shit
And I know it sounds eerie but my niggaz better hear me
If you speaking on the phones it won't be secret to the jury
They hit you wit that Rico
I'm not meaning PR
I'm talking full scale riots
Whole lot of triage
And I know you not scared but please be cautious
Cause these jealous ass niggaz could be walking amongst us
To my jail niggaz
To your street memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record we love you
We miss you"

Gun in yo' hand?""
Yeah, yeah, AOWWWW! Yeah
Just when you thought it was, s-s-s-s-safe
I ran up in the crib and cleared the motherfuckin safe
Got crates full of bass, got pills, got ones
And everybody knows that, Joey got a gun
I got that ch-ch-ch-ch-chopper, yes I'm a hustler
A to the K with the motherfuckin muffler
Heed when the God speak, when I squeeze my palm squeak
Drop more shells on your block than Palm Beach
Don't do it, don't do it, shit Joey don't do it
I said fuck it I'ma push this shit back to the future
Niggaz call me German so I hit 'em with the Ruger
Bullets like Easy Pass, they run right through ya
Got the supersoaker for superjokers to supertorch ya
Stupid is what stupid does, now move it Coka
I'ma prove it's over, you ain't got a chance
And I don't even need a gun, I know how to dance
Yeah, uh
Joey got a gun, and everybody know
That black kitted car stash box where it go
Fo'-fo' long, told Curtis he could hold that
Run in your hotel room, and take yo' gat
Got old guns for new niggaz, my throwback
And I ain't talkin' 'bout music, get your soul clapped
Canons so big, bounce, they exit
Play Superman, fuck around, get your S split
42 shots to the chest, where your vest went?
No more passes for niggaz, no exceptions
Got the goons with me and them niggaz kinda desperate
Give a nigga a job like Tony, do reception
Pounding, ran the chain on the man's border
Taliban style, blow his brains on the camcorder
You can hear death in my voice, call it manslaughter
Pistol whip the shit out this bitch, put my hands on her"
63,John Blaze,1998,Don Cartagena (1998),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"Verse One: Nas
My stripes show like regiments, military intelligence
Murder game, I leave no evidence -- credentials
Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how you I used to pack a No. 2 pencil
Stabbin students, grabbin teachers, Catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cuttin' class, passin my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label to earn
Like that nigga said in Dead Presidents, money to burn
Queensbridge, pay homage, respect Nas is the vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes, niggaz is dissin that
I'm just the best, puttin' all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings the blood los sangres, blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison
Verse Two: Big Punisher
My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try -- 'Now you know you done fucked up right?'
Hah, you ain't got no wins in my casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa
I hate a actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial college material insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter you shitter shatter, I'm the kid
Out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before, iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun, cause one verse, dead 'em all

Verse Three: Jadakiss
Aiyyo my attitude is subject to change, I mess around
And spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim
Cause y'all misdemeanor niggaz can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only 'cause I know that faggots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get, kicked out the yard for
'Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggaz up
You could meet me in my cell I soak and sock niggaz up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggaz get nathans
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin'
Verse Four: Raekwon
My son cool out (what) don't beef yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggaz, kidnap they work, make 'em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat
In the dash, did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God, stackin up joints, rack 'em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent
Here to Crenshaw, hold my words stronger than a Benz stall
Relentless, the anthology consolidated
With the quickness, dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness
Lex, imagination large, gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the Older God
Specialist, iciclist, Woolridge collar
Feelin' the rich, work for every dollar don't snitch, that's why
Broke niggaz who got heart God, sign 'em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin', Don up in the line up
Verse Five: Fat Joe
It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed Dunn
I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns till it hurts
For fuckin' with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster, with my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gortex with the lot, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned?
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to parlay, I've had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed"

Uh ya real Harlem is back
Who in the world want a problem wit that
Uh I heard Harlem is back
Who in the world want a problem wit that
(Chorus x2- Fat Joe)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants
And do the roc-a-way
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
(Verse 1- Mase)
Yo, yo, yo, we goin' Deja Vu
Then the day y'all do
It'll be the day y'all bleed
Rich minus eighty degrees
King of Harlem ain't no body made me leave
Who else could take five years off
Cold turkey, come back, and fly leers off
Cats front they gonna leanin like smirnoff
If haters wanna hate then it's their loss
Come up in the rucka wit all my jigs on
Got grills so big you can cook a steak on
You gonna hear Mase gone
When they get a Mase on
You a hot 16, I'm a very great song
If beatin' on the DJ before the Mase song
He play Clark Kent, you better have your cape on
Plenty grooms, mansion many rooms
My neckless, two X's, and three benty boom (lean back)
(Chorus x2- Fat Joe)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants
And do the roc-a-way
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
(Lil Jon)
Eminem what's up!
(Verse 2- Eminem)
You don't want no problems with Harlem
You don't want no problems wit da boogy down Bronxton
You don't want no drama wit da blonde bomber
Original don gotta of the blonde bottle, the model
For white America, then Joe,
The spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Mase back to represent
Everything else in between
Includin the percentages of the rest, we dope
The best from each coast, the mid west to the dirty dirty!
Even further to Miami,
All the way back to Californ I A
It'll prolly be best right now if I warn Dre
And get on the horn wit him tell him
'Bout the storm comin' all our way
So tell a pal grab a gal, right now get on the floor why wait
Shake that ass a lil more my way or baby I don't dance
Not that I can, 'cause of the pistol in my pants
(Chorus x2- Fat Joe)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants
And do the rock-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
(Verse 3- Fat Joe)
No Judas, a comadis Caine's brother
Able to able to stop me nigga not me!
Got the streets askin damn who could top Pete
Summer Jam, killed it man did it all with one beat
I guess I'm bi-coastal now, took a
Damn south brother to bring your boy out
As the wheel keep spinnin I can hear
Niggas thinkin' crack I got one hit benny out
Nope Joey bring them semi's out of
Course you and yours pour a lil henny out
So much rappers actin' in the game,
I have to tell him put the mic away
And run and go and get your emmies out
Lean back mothafuckas, this here's a three beat,
We back at the rucka
This ??? crack preachin to your brother,
The mic more rap, we perachin to you mothafuckas

I said my niggas don't dance

Hey!"
68,Life Goes On,2002,Loyalty (2002),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"(Intro - Fat Joe talking)
Yeah, uh, yeah, Loyalty, haha
She was sixteen maybe seventeen, uh
Who you gonna trust?
And Life Goes On (2002)
The timin ain't me, it's like, please goin' through wrong
Speak the truth, haha, speak the truth, yeah, yo, yo
(Fat Joe)
She was only sixteen, when I met her I was playin' the corner
Had to scream one of her niggas, like get up off her
She was a diamond in the rough, real neighborhood jewel
You would never see her out, 'less she comin' from school
At first we started out like sisters and brothers
Till we finally let it out, and started kissin' and huggin
And your moms always dissin me, tryin' to get rid a me
I guess she figured out, I had taken your virginity
She was right, sexin all day
When they wouldn't let me in, we be playin' the hallway
Talkin' all day, 'bout the stupidest shit
Like if we got rich, what would we do with our chips?
And who was our favorite rappers, it was Nas at the time
We would memorize every single bar of his rhymes
Summertime, kids is playin' in the park
I might just ride by, let 'em sprinkle the truck
And Life Goes On
She was sixteen, maybe seventeen
I was eighteen, nineteen maybe a little bit more
(Was she a little more), haha ...
Yeah, huh, but Life Goes On
She was sixteen, maybe seventeen
I was eighteen, nineteen maybe a little bit more
Hahahaha, yeah, yeah, woof, uh, yo
But Life Goes On
(Fat Joe)
This shit got deeper, you was havin' my seed
I couldn't wait to see this little nigga look like me
Sure enough a little fat guy named D'Ryan
Kept us up all night, always bitchin and cryin
I was still slingin fast, the ""Flow Joe"" came out
Things changed, wasn't the same, wanted to hang out
The groupies was chasin me, rudely awakened me
No longer safe for me, this new world is takin' me
You deserve much more than to be mistreated
I was a fucked up nigga, but at least I admit it
Just to be cool, I helped you through school
So you can have your own career, and don't depend on no fool
Life seems crazy when you look back
I pray to God, that you hook up with a good cat
We can't look at, who's right or who's wrong
But I thought I'd let you know through this song
That Life Goes On
(Chorus - w/ variations)
(Fat Joe)
So I moved on to the next phase a my life
I finally met the women I would make my wife
It was love at the first sight, in the worst way
Shorty kept holdin' out, had me thirsty, mercy
Mi shari amor, whisper in my ear
Tell me baby girl is it me that you adore
Used to stay up all night, just bumpin and grindin
Makin' plans for the future, how to hustle my rhyme in
Used to drive cross state for like a G a show
A well known famous rapper, but my pocket's is broke
But we kept grindin
Slowly but surely, kept climbin
Pun broke in the doors, now we headlinin
I'm lettin everybody know you're my sweetest possession
How you kept me real strong through the deepest depression
Paid no mind to your friends, cause their words is trife
I hold you down for the rest of your life
Cause Life Goes On
(Chorus - 4X, - w/ variations, until fade)
(After song is over, there is a skit of a man being questioned)
[Man w/ questions:] Look just shut the fuck up, Joe told us what happened
[Twistin:] Told us what, what happened
[Man:] You're trying to act like you don't know what's going on, but I know
You know what happened that night
[T:] I was drinking Cristal on the right hand side (yeah)
Hennessey on the left hand side
Macho gave it to me, I don't remember after that so, aw
[Man:] You think you're a tough guy right (tough guy)
Your not, you're a pussy, cause your afraid if you rat on Fat Joe
[T:] Aw, sorry, sorry, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
[Man:] Maybe we should put him in a cell and lock him up, until he fucking talks
[T:] Rat on Fat Joe, what do you mean?
There is no rat on Fat Joe, you disarespect him right now, that's not good
[Man:] Your fucking busted man, just tell us this shit
Your fucking baby momma told us
[T:] Fuck it, listen to me, I don't snitch, I'm Twistin all right

Players keep showin love so players play on
What Crack's preachin is CHUUCH, so niggaz pray on
Good heavens, had to wait for track seven
To adjust them fly dresses and high heel stilettos, yes
This vibe is perfect, I wonder
Maybe that's why four's the God's perfect number
And you're all my angels
Victoria's Secret insatiable, that's {?}
C'mon, get it together
My flight lands in a half an hour, we can do whatever
(Fat Joe - over Chorus)
Woo! Uh
Yeah, uh-huh, talk to me baby
Don't catch feelings ma
You know what this is
Hahaha, bitch
Yeah, uh, yo

When you mad she's happy when she's sad she's glad
She ecstatic to see me and she's {?}
Too much of y'all for me to keep happy
Still and all y'all keep callin me daddy
I'm tryin' to change it, similar to Alaskan skies
Midnight look like the sunrise
That means I, ain't budgin, I'm still the same
Same kisser, same hugger, same Joe Crack you love him
You do ma, admit it girl you trust him
To be back at that hotel suite crushin
And you just in time
To break me off before my hotel checkout time
(Fat Joe - over Chorus)
Hahahahaha, woo
We on tour right now
Yeah, talk to me baby, talk to me
Uh, haha
I mean my D.C. girl, she don't like my V.A. girl
My A-T-L girl don't like my Cali baby

Yo, I know ma, I see your vision
Fuckin' with me is like an all-inclusive private island vacation
Woo - room service from the A.M. to the P.M.
All, night crushin this amazin human bein
Got you love struck, topic controversial
'Cause when I'm gone you're lost like that Corona commercial
I know time is money still I can't reimburse you girl
For what you wear, that's the day I reverse you girl
You get your nails painted proper
Pull out the black Amex, I'll take you shoppin'
But when it's time to go I disappear like Hoffa
I see you next time when I decide to pop up, I'm gone

Check it out, check-a-check-a, check it out
Would you believe that Fat Joe would flip a style like this?
I can't get played, 'cause I roll with Baby Chris, nevertheless
Niggaz be tryin' to front the role
When everybody knows, I'm gonna go gold
At least, kickin the funky styles that you wanna hear
Joe is bigger and better, so have no fear
I'll be rippin the mic, clockin dough, stickin the hoes
After every single show, you know (know)
One of the best to grab the mic so don't try to front
Ain't nuttin here yours, so what the fuck you want?
When I step on stage, I'm second to none
Makin' MC's run, without the use of a gun, yeah
Talkin' about the way I rock a party
Niggaz must be thinkin' that I'm high, or drunk on Bacardi
I be hippin and hoppin, rockin' and shockin, the whole rap scene
I'm mean, my favorite color is green
I guess that's why they call it the blues
Your money you lose, cause you choose to disrespect and neglect
The skills of the Fat one, but I'm all that son
Gimme the microphone and I'ma show you how it's gonna be done
So don't fake moves, 'cause I never fall
That's how I'm livin', hey yo I'm livin' Fat y'all

Niggaz don't want the funk, because they know I'm buckwild
Could you believe the rappers that they talk shit
While I be rippin the microphone and all my records are hits
The name is Fat Joe, I'm on the down low
I chill with Lord Finesse, you know I got the flow
I be freakin the funk, not fakin the funk, you're facin a punk, yeah
Fuck around and you'll be layin in ?v-ducts?
I got props, believe it or not
I never got caught, because I pay off the cops, yeah
One of the livest niggaz in New York
Sometimes I be chillin' with Son
Sometimes I be chillin' with Hawk, you know that
Brooklyn in the house and Uptown is too
I gotta be sayin' peace, to the Boogie the Bronx crew
Pete, Sap, Brim, Vayo Mack, Gizmo, Nicer, B.G., my main man Crack
So now you know the flav, and you know the time
Brothers always be tellin' me, ""Joe why don't you kick a Fat rhyme""
So I don't front on my peeps
Kick a verse or two, then be out, and peace G
So don't try to step to dis, you know you take a fall
That's how I'm livin', hey yo I'm livin' Fat y'all

They're all gonna laugh at ya
Yeah, (YO), uh, (oh God), haha
Haha (feedin you, feedin you)
Yo (feedin you, feedin you)
(Fat Joe)
Yo, uh, yo, call me the JV artist
That means I own two joint ventures and two different labels, niggas that pay me homage
Been in this game for nine seasons
That's nine reasons why I'm expired the rhyme beefin
Y'all niggas is rappin' ass backwards
I left twenty spots since beginnin this rap shit
All yo papi lo que pasa contigo
Mad 'cause I'm the only nigga reppin our people
When I came in this game, no one wanted the job
All of a sudden niggas actin' like they wanna go hard
Spittin' venom 'bout the Squad, try and shittin the God
This ain't no ""Scarface"" shit, blow up your kids in the car
And since you wanna act like you livin' a movie
I'll hit you with more shots than Bruce Lee got in a ""Fist of Fury""
Bitch niggas, nothin' but snitch niggas
Today you on my dick, tomorrow you on his nigga
Got deported from the Squad, can't afford another car
Where's your house at? I heard your livin' with your moms (livin' with your moms)
Blane nigga better stay in your place
Keep talkin', burst a flame in your face, motherfucker
(Armageddon)
Yo, yo, with this comparison the Geddy is God
Cause even though you never seen me, I been put fear in your hearts
And I'm smooth like a Mulo it theme
Skip bullets of your Coogi beam
Before you knew you were seen
Yeah I'm nice and I don't care if you know
Cause all you really need to understand is how hard I'm rulin with Joe
And the streets is no place for late bloomers
Just gangsta niggas, snakes and bitches that meant to spread rumors
Listen, I'm from the Bronx were the gun shoot rabid
Front if you want, but don't think we don't shoot rapids
I'm what some might consider a ghost
'Cause I move at night, plus I'm the type to play a live nigga close
I'm the ultimate, high consulted, rhyme vocalist
I write dope, spit dust and shit cocoa bricks
This is what you dicks need to act-knowledge
Or get the shit smacked outta ya fat cabbage
Don't ask why we act violent
We just killas and thugs
Niggas wit mad talent, that still dabble in drugs
I only rap now to speak to the streets
They say the Squad gotta feed 'em the beef
So we gonna feed 'em the beef
(Prospect)
My nine milly blaze, and hit hard like Willy Mays
Since my kiddy days, grew up with thugs who were really crazed
Ain't no silly games, right here be the truth
150 proof, whoever, I'm talkin' to you
They call me Prospect, I'm one in a mil
One of the real, I rap but I still put a gun in your grill
I'm the reason why I catch you when your car breezin by, with your Iceberg team
You look when the light turns green
Your scared to death, don't make me have to air at ya chest
Or tear ya flesh, for actin' like I carin what's left
Anyone can get it in a minute give it some time, I'm livin' this rhyme
Let my nine get in your spine, sit and recline
Get so mad, forget and rewind
So I can see what I did again and just slide
To the next level, hop on the bike and just pedal
Bustin' at your best rebel, who runnin' to test medal
Let me get settled, lay my mom down in this game
For niggas kinda refain, I push 'em down in the train
'Bout it the same, my three cousins up in the Benz
Big, G Psycho and E, y'all know what this is
(Remy Martin)
Yo, yo, It's the T, E, a R a, a R a, O, R Squad
So you know I gotta be that bitch Remy Mar
With Armageddon and your nigga Joe The God
Tony Sunshine and motherfuckin Prospect
Straight out the projects
A forest, where they kill for mils and they blast the steel
But I'm from murda murda Castle Hill
I got a big ass burner, but I'll slash your grill
Yo don't got no status, don't want no static
They knew you was loco toto, and I don't no Spanish
All I know is how to cock back and aim for the cabbage
And keep on bustin' till the bitch brain splatter
And the kids won't matter, when the crib's on fire
What you spit don't matter, cause this bitch on fire
And I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Any bitch disagree is a god damn liar
(Outro - Fat Joe talking)
Yeah, uh infamous Terror Squad nigga
Loyalty, what does it mean to you
How many a y'all niggas is loyal?
All these Benedict Arnold niggas
Switch sidin niggas, ya heard?
Nigga I throw this whole rap shit out the window in a sec, ya heard?

The savior, Caesar, the streets is mine nigga

(Noreaga and Fat Joe talking)
(Fat Joe)
Yo, yo, one's for the cash, two's for my facilty
Three's for all the M-3's
Racin across the Tapenze
?Matchin' C's? followed by the white Lincoln
Drivin' like I ain't thinkin'
Wit my hats and lights blinkin, let the lah sink in
On the way to home BASE,
First clown in my face is gettin' thrown out the place
We rush shit, untouchable Don shit, that's nothin' new
Sets with stone arms just to muscle you, enough of you
That had a bad case of Joe, some even had to go
Gangsta walk and nines, at times I be the last to know
We laugh and joke, while we bag in the coke
My A done make the worst things out the cast of Different Strokes
I'm addicted to street life, although it doesn't seem right
Many criticize but yo we all go to eat right?
And who's to say that I'm to blame (blame)
We only pawns in this game (game)
Decision: grow cocaine
I don't want no cure for this, you switch, I pour the Cris
And just, stay rich, and reminisce, while I count my chips
(Noreaga)
Yo you scared to death, misery need company
Crab slackers, niggas actin' like they mad rappers
Even wit a record deal, our guns still peal
Break a piece of your brain, wipe the stain
Throw the Range off, police-iano
Watch for hondo, they lookin' at our poster now, playin' us closer now
The funds follow us, what, these bitches swallow us
And you wonder why you can't find us
(Fat Joe)
I ?ton and tender? wit millionaires, gave a million stares
Made a million scared, my beats don' knocked
For what seemed like a million years, yeah
This illegal life I can't avoid, I take the feds everywhere I go
That's why I'm paranoid, but still I choose to ignore the fact
I got the flawless Acs wit gats to get that enormous stack
Joey Crack, the mack without the hat
And all our hoes dine and ride in the back seat of my Cadillac
I bet you hate it 'cause we paid and floss, nigga we laid and lost
T.S.'ll make the baddest crews take a loss
Break your balls like Bahondo, call me Don Joe
Coke slash sweaty rock, niggas drop a dime dough
Booked the nine o'clock, flight to Alando
So-called killers turned snitches like Rivono
That nigga Gauno up in M-C, is bein friendly
Everytime I see his wife and kids the shit tempts me
My heart is empty, never feelin' remorse
I got a sniper one killed in the cross ready to kill your boss
(Noreaga)
Yo, yo Jose Luis, smoke lah like the reverand
Look in the skies, clouds look like coke 'n' heaven
Like whoever sittin' on pies two, gettin' high too
Mad fly too, a thug too
Yo we praise those, however you make your pesos
Keep the shit tight just like, Jose Canseco's
Batting stance, a majorly we glance,
And gotta yell ""What, What!""
'Cause thug niggas don't dance yo
I told niggas, that you did it for show,
But niggas thought you was ill yo
Even your hoe, yo for real youngblood I'm really afraid so
Your colors got revealed and now you buy dough
Impost-o's, locos, morenos, go-golos, boriquas, platin-o's
My niggas rollin' those, fontos and hydros
You know how that goes, DE's light it up though
We stay smokin' it, tone-locin it,
Me and Fat Joe still provoking it
(Ha ha, mad rappers, stain off, range off, watch out
Polic-iano's, pabolos

Where my real niggaz at?
My Bronx niggaz, my (?) niggaz
I see you Lil' Hat! Uh, Ahaha!
It's time to take it to these niggaz right here
Yeah... yo... yo...
Who wanna spaz out? Crunchtime, blow ya abs out
Leave you in the fetal position, witcha ass out
Ready to mash out any crew actin' like
They the true facts of life, frontin through the camera lights
Despite, we hold it down regardless
I got Def Jam suckin me like, ""I wish you was my artist""
For starters, who's the largest cat?
Get a hundred grand from my most garbage rap
Now how hard is that? Everything we spit be hot
Whether it's live on Flex or in front of the chicken spot
Grimed out, we really live whatchu rhyme 'bout
See me posted up in the Tunnel, with my shines out
Ice cold like Alaska when I pass ya
Got girls shakin, losin they breath, as if they catchin asthma
Headed to the bar to pop some bottles
Now we in the car headed home to rock some models
All I hear in the background is Gucci and Prada
But I'm tryna gas these bitches to screw me for nada
We the best that done it, confess you fronted
Anybody wanna test how much straps, you want it?
(Hook - Fat Joe)
Aiyyo the gangsta's back
Stop it right where you at
Let a real nigga rock real murderer rap
Tell them thug niggaz, listen to that
Gotchu feelin' it hard like Joe the God's really bringin' it back!
(Fat Joe)
I'm from my days and legends, since age eleven
I was the cause of dope fiends catchin AIDS infections
Most of us are dead, but the rest is locked
Runnin' in the rec room and check me out on the box
A CEO could get optioned tryna change the channel
It's like tryna take the flesh outta the mouth of hungry cannibals
Joe the God, the flow is hard
Known for packin two dozen birds like Noah's Ark
I'm the realest of 'em, make you feel the pressure
Catch you at a club, smack you up, steal ya leather
You niggaz soften me, beat you out of the mix
Tough talk, tough walk, but you cry like a bitch
I see you downin the Cris', I'm not hatin', I'm just aggrevated
I ask myself every day, how these faggots made it?
Fuck around with the Don and get decapitated
I'm sick of hearin 'em (?) for all the cats that made it
(Hook - Fat Joe)
(Hook 2 - Armageddon)
Aiyyo the kid is back
Leave it right where you at
Let a real nigga hold that, you probably won't clap
Tell them thug niggaz, move it on back
I'm feelin' tight and I'm hot
Ready to pop the crack right through your back
(Armageddon)
That's how Kenny rocks, I'm more advanced than how your learnin
I'm like the force of space balance and planets while they churnin
Poppin' rosary beads, piss on ya candle while it's burnin
Rush ya widows crib and pop ya... bodies...
Now I know you can feel the heat I generate
Imagine when I penetrate ya stomach, and make ya body's center bake
We can argue for days, whether it's faster to drop five shots
In ya astronaut before you cloud the stash box
Splash ya brains on ya birds' laps
Swerve you on the curb, crash the Range, and push the front skirt back
And murk after that, blurtin curse words
Yo I popped that nigga's son one before we catch the first
I'ma kill any murderer, leave a nigga burpin up
Blood, chokin on chunks of his lung interior
Every verse that I spit's a personal riff
I meet a ill key frontin, I'm a murder you shit
Niggaz play me while distrubin the Bricks
I'm like the feelin' of the first time they ever held a bird in they grip
Motivator thug, scrape 'em, shoot the bolts in his butt
Energizin 'em up, make 'em wanna open 'em up
Actin' like I can't happen till I smack him in his Adam's apple
Death to rappin', I don't wanna battle
I'd rather rush your studio session and shatter the booth
Clap at ya face, give the mic feedback the goof"

Yeah, wave hi at the bad guy
And you can ice grill when I drive by
See if I be givin' a fuck
My hands on the woodgrain, fat ass tucked
Ha ha, shit a nigga just came off tour
Mister Mister Rainman, I'm makin' it pour
I 'member when I used to have to play that hard
Apartment 5B, Forrest Projects y'all
A nigga too fat, so I couldn't play ball
So I hit the strip, started flippin that raw
My pants would sag, now they callin me Crack
Used to love graffiti, so I made it my tag
Me and Tone Montana we was bangin' them hammers
Before New York niggaz, ever wore bandanas
Got so much money, a nigga would abuse it
Then I left the streets alone for the love of the music
(Chorus: Cherlise)
You know I never dreamed that I could be perfect
Cause that's the only thing that I've ever been, oh
And when I look back on my life it's all worth it
Because I know I know my people believe me, I do it for love
(Fat Joe)
Yeah, yo
They say Joe too selfish, he won't let us in the door
I say shit I could have left Pun in front of that store
Could have left Remy Ma ass in Castle Hill
Where every other day another nigga get killed
They say what's Cool without Dre?
I say shit, what if them niggaz never met Jose?
Hell 'Ve was a great DJ
Now he produce Roc Boyz, headed for a Grammy
What if I would have told Khaled to stop buggin me?
He'd probably never be President of that company
Shit you probably woulda never heard the movement
I ain't gotta talk, I ain't gotta prove shit
Scott Storch is the best, they kept sleepin' on him
'Cause he's a white boy, he kept ghostbeatin for 'em
Dropped ""Lean Back,"" then that shit hit and guess what?
I made the nigga rich cocksuckers!
(Fat Joe)
I was never into girls, I was just into my music
Dropped so many hits, still them niggaz just confuse it
Went to my old school, gave 'em some computers
And the niggaz in the hood still be sayin' I don't do shit
Bein they ain't got no love in they hearts
I just moved to Miami, copped a crib and a yacht
I bought my little daughter an equestrian park
Now she's ridin' horses, tell me that ain't hot
Sade, Luther Vandross
Stephanie Mills, El DeBarge
I used to look at them like Gods
Now tell me why a nigga wouldn't go hard?
Bye {?} boricua, why you hatin' on me papi?
It's been sweet 16, still them haters can't stop me
In fact man I'm just like Rocky
Lordy we did it baby, you keep goin' shopping
(Fat Joe - over Chorus)
Yeah, man I did it for the music!
I did it for the love
Ha! I mean Mother's Day I'm performin for your mother
And your girl... can't even be with my family man
You know what? Be careful what you wish for
Joe Crack's here to let you know the workin man is not a SUCKER
9 to 5 man you get to go home and be wit'cha kids man
I'm in Budapest somewhere
I'm in Africa where the heat come, Crack bitch, aowww!"

Push me in the corner where I perform the best
Joe crack move packs that's the key to success (ha)
Catch me in the streets ain't a damn thing sweet
It's the belly of the beast ain't nobody safe
Run up on you with the heat, my baby's gotta eat
And killas don't sleep
Nigga show me where the safe
Trust me you want them problems
Pull up on you with the treble and bass
And mop the whole place
Oh no it ain't safe
It ain't safe round these parts
Way before I sold you an LP
I was a giant in the hood passin rocks to LT
I watched fiends get a taste of the sample
The bass send 'em straight to Planet Rock, Luther Campbell
Light 'em up blow 'em out like candles
They scramblin backwards cunningham randall
I flipped the pie to an enterprise
So you stompers were hittin zippers so you could stash the dope inside
Five sixty my niggas yeah I did that
And never ever show a bitch where your crib's at
The next day we at your door, ""where your kids at?""
And if they don't out the raw, nigga click clack
And this is so darkside
I swear a nigga get way more hate than apartheid
Just give me death row we can part ties
Apocalypto flow pull your heart live"

Is somebody tryin' to come up in my crib?
I'm like ""Who the fuck is this?""
Like Notorious Big, he wore a black suit
With a black mask that match
I'm bout to blast his mask off
Push his cabbage back
Make spaghetti out his brain
'Cause I'm steady with the aim
Niggas comin' sideways, gettin' petty wit da game
Musta heard about the half in the safe
The stash in the base, iced out
Medals in the case
Niggas comin' wit da chrome
Tryin' to sneak up in my home, rumors out
I spent a Mil' on the pump piece alone
I got the heat in my palm
Nobody's seein it though
Step your feet on my lawn

Screamin fo' they life

Scheemin on the ice
Wont get you nothin' but killed
Front if you will, get chopped up
Stuffed in the quill
Back to the lab, got these niggas
After my math, these hoes try to play it off
But they captain is back
They must have teamed up
With some niggas thinkin' they sweet
Like I just rapped and
I got a ho waitin in the street
I'm playin' for keeps, I see 'em
Creepin' on the moniters
Got my temperature risin' faster than thermometers
I burn banana clips, make all
My victories unanimous
I'm accurate, once I catch a peak
Hey man, yo ass is hit!
Now I see 'em creepin' through the front door
I think not! We exchange shots
Like cops into getting blocked{*gunshot*}
He busts, I bust back{*gunshot*}
He caught one in the chest
The other two got hit up
In the stomach and neck{*gunshots*}
I'm under the desk, freeloading
Puttin' slugs in the rest
Wonderin what possessed these niggas

Fuckin' with them heavyweights, who had shit sewn in every state
The very sight'll make the average man defecate
Livin' the life of stock, bonds and cars, word bond
When I be gone I'll be worshipped like ?Nicky Barnes?
It's on, you don't want no confrontation
Killer communication, I suffer from multiple lacerations

Spilled your chips in the casinos while feastin on shrimp scallapino

I been plannin my strategy for the next kill
Ninety-five for the real live

Don't know the meaning of real, check the dictionary

Makin' MC's run for the border like the immigration
A Puerto Rican villain who be dealin' and illin for nothin'
You ain't a playa, you just BLUFFIN
Point blank, we can even do this with gats and shanks
It's your selection
I can become President, without elections
I got mad connections, Fat Joe, the rap wizard
Brainstorms come in swarms, get lost in the blizzard

Got a hundred guns, got a hundred clips
Niggaz never listen till they vision turn pitch
Pawn you out of Vegas butt-naked in a ditch

And still the fiends line up for blocks till it ain't no space
Pile high to the top of the Empire State
CRACK! (CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!) Once again so you know it
Ain't been this much hype since that Nas and that Hov shit
Coke spit, the fo' fifth chrome spit
Doe getter since I was small, no better than yours
Truly just check the suicide doors
Thirty inch grill and that black mink floor
Lookin' back I did the shit to death
I guess I ain't killin' it this rhyme I'm here to raise the dead
I'm here to raise the stakes this time it's ten mill
Supply the sink ill, ship five and then build

That's when it became apparent to me
That the pimps and hustlers be apparent to me
I plead innocent your honor
I'm just a product of the streets, product of some beef
Product of that Cappadonna Armani three piece
Problem is when I win, my team eats
But wait, just think the opposite of that
You'll be starin' down the opposite side of them gats nigga

The connections I got, I can lamp while you get done
Remember that, I dismember cats that act
A plain and simple fact is I react on impact
I'm plenty versatile, wild
Have you screamin like your head short a few vials
No more slabs and dollar cabs
Strictly Lexus Coupes with my troops feel the Alpine blast
Extra dark tints, for sticky events
Suspense makes the lead dispense
A baby oil massage when I'm feelin' intense
Fly mami's with ki's taped to their bo-ties
Transportin through a airport securities
In cahoots with the San Juan authorities
Hated by majorities, loved by minorities
Uh, the top dog, ??
Hazardous to your health like smog

Overweight overpaid, pockets bustin' out the seams
While you suckers havin' limousine dreams
I got you all sized up, niggaz wise up
A Fat Beat truck'll be pickin' all you guys up
Word to mother, shit is realer than you think
Hit my lady with diamond rings, gold links and minks
A nickel-plated trey-deuce, pearl handle is pink
So there's no muggin, all you niggaz must be buggin
The mac in the trunk's what I'm luggin

100,She's My Mama,2006,"Me, Myself & I (2006)",Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"You know one man's treasure is another man's cash
Speak on it, speak on it, listen
And you know the man that sleeps on the floor
Can't fall the *** off the bed
Pop your collar to this, it's grills mania, ya heard me?
She's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star
Now she was only sixteen, I had to nurture that
Give her some growth, waited 'til I touched the cat
Told she goin' have to work if she gon' get ahead
Then she drove me berserk when she gave me some ***
She told me that she learnt that from the porno flicks
I said, ?Mami, stop talkin', just suck on this ***?
I ain't say her name yet, so let's say she nothin'
Now watch me turn this nothin' into somethin', get it?
Mami, get in that kitchen, this is free base
Just cook it 'til it's hard, then cut it in eighths
Take the trip cross town to see Tru
Just get the money, don't listen, that *** think he cute
See all this money we got, we goin' shoppin'
Louis Vitton and Pucci, we get it poppin'
We hit the club on some clico s***
See the respect that you get from just bein' my ***
Look, see 'em, they sick, they wan' be in your shoes
That's the game that I hit her wit to leave her confused
I'm just usin' her for paper, she want a man
I'm 'bout to see my other *** but she understands
'Cause she's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star
She's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star
Ay yo, I met her at the Rucker Park watchin' the stars play
I knew she was a Terror, she was watchin' the Squad play
I knew she had her own, she was pushin' the bubble X
Type of eye candy that you see in a double X
Fat ***, long hair, short like Nia Long
I knew she was a victim from the start, my G is strong
And then she said she ain't felt this good in ten summers
Gave me credit cards and debit cards with pin numbers
I'm lookin' at receipts, she spent G's on the kid
I'm pushin' her V, even got keys to the crib
I needed to bag up, I bought G's to the crib
I got knocked, what she did? Put up the deed to the crib
But now she got a new gig at Chase Manhattan
Look my *** is wit ma, let's make it happen
So I burst through the door 'bout a quarter to four
And told every nosy ***, 'Get the *** on the floor'
Then she opened up the bag and started to fill 'em all
Makin' sure that she left the marked money in the drawer
Told security, ?If you move this goin' be your last night
I'm workin' with this Mack 10, you workin' with a flashlight?
I'm walkin' backwards, nobody moved, word to mother
Tryin' not look 'cause I don't want to blow her cover
That's when this *** winks and blew a kiss at me
I don't believe this *** took all them risks for me
That's why she's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star
She's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star
We on some bulls*** right now

101,Shit Is Real Pt. III,2002,Loyalty (2002),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"(Intro: Fat Joe)
Slow motion baby, unh
Tell you what I see through these eyes
All we do is speak the truth
Shit is realla then real
Shit is realla then real
My true niggas walk wit me, yeah
They ride wit me, cook pies wit me, ya heard?
(Fat Joe)
Lord I keep hollering, I hope you listening
How come I'm still stressed and even though the squad's
Glistening?
Why you had to take Pun, someone so young
Had so much more to live for, as real as they come
Dead man can't talk that's why your hearing one side of the
Story
But did they tell you how he provided for forty
Family members, grandmas to shorties
Even my seeds ate off the big homie
How could you deceive your kids like that?
Make 'em believe they dad wasn't worth jack
Listen to the facts as The Don pours his heart on this track
How could I jus stand there and not react?
And I'm jus about sick of all you side line niggas
You know, do anything for the lime light niggas
I'm defending your honor, my brother from anotha momma
I never thought I'd see the day they tried to send you byna
(Chorus: Fat Joe)
Shit is realla then you think, man you must not know
It takes a lot to walk a day in the life of Fat Joe
The place I'm from, MTV don't wanna film
Jus a simple dice game will get a muthafucka killed
The ghetto ain't a place that you wanna take lightly
Same cat that'll spill you, will end up with your wifey
I've seen it all that's why I've picked up the pen
To keep your boy from serving life in the pen, ya heard?
(Fat Joe)
Fuck, the flu season, nowadays it's sue season
Can't even go to the clubs and show my people love
'Cause soon as shit pop off niggas knuckle love
Niggas accusing me of fuckin' 'em up!
I'm like 'hold up, ain't they supposed to be dogs?'
Part time live niggas dabbeling drugs
See a rapper think of a lucrative deal
But youse a bitch if you choosing to squeel
It's more than obvious you don't know a thing about honor
But what goes around comes around, you'll soon learn about comma
As for me I stay being the realest
Admired by politicians, street thugs and killers
I keep feeding the street but the street feed back
Is that police tryna see Joe back in green slacks
But never dat, see I keep long money
And if you looking for dat you'll never see a cent from me
(Fat Joe)
Yo, unh, I stay grinding, everybody counted me out
Now I'm rewinding in my summer beach house
If I'm not in the studio I'm out on tour
Busting my ass to make my fans future secure
Nowadays everybody want somethin' for nothin'
All of a sudden niggas talkin' like 'Joey be frontin'
The hood screaming Crack done changed, he don't holla
I know now Big, Mo Money Mo Problems
Jealousy's a muthafucka
Who'd a thought the same niggas you be feeding be the
Muthafuckaz coming for ya
I'm not stressin, I was born a warrior
Plus I'm too big, too strong, too wise for ya
When it's all said and done I follow my dreams
Could have ended up dead or in jail given the scheme of things
To let chu know I'm the reason you still walkin'
If I said something it was me, not the liquor talkin'"
102,Shorty Gotta Fat Ass,1993,Represent (1993),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"Well it's Friday night, I'm in a club with a crew just maxing
Cuties and booties and yo I'm ready for action
Cause Fat Joe doesn't go to clubs for his health
It's too many skins, so every man for himself
I got me a Sex on the Beach from the bar
I know this girl was looking at me from afar
Plus she with a crew, they all got it going on
She came over and asked me if my name was John
I said, ""Yeah, John Doe, so what's it to you?""
She said ""Sorry yo, I just thought I knew you""
She walked away dissed because I had dropped the bomb
I felt bad so I reached out and snatched her arm
I pulled her back, gave her my apologies
She accepts it, but now she starts to follow me
Watching where I'm going, seeing who I know
Once she saw the Gucci, she said ""Oh, that's Fat Joe""
I could hear the conversation, Shorty was digging me
No way she was igging me, ayo she was big on me
Throughout the night she remained in my eyesight
My man Black Caese was telling me ""Yo she's fly, right?""
No that the jam is over there's no need to front
'Cause she's leaving out the club and I'm right behind her
Now we in the deli butt naked catching wreck at last
Cause shorty gotta fat ass
Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x)
She got a big fat...
Driving in my Five on the live side of town
One of those days I just wanna ride around
With three deep, me Diamond D, and Peep
(Who's Peep?) That's my man that be whipping the white jeeps
So bust it, I hit Fordham road in the town
'Cause I'm riffing in the front fool, Luther Vandross
Never too much, and what did I see?
Honeygrip had a little too much for me
Diamond said ""Damn!"" Peep said ""I know her!""
Yeah right, whatever, I'm still pulling over
Hey mamita, Spanish I'm assuming
A Spanish caught wreck and that ass was booming
I couldn't see her face 'cause she wouldn't turn around
Peep is out the window staring Five-O down (Bo bo bo!)
Chill with that, 'cause I wanna stop and chat
Like a diplomat, yo you're fucking up my rep
She wouldn't turn around so I reached for her pelvis
She turned around, ugly hound dog, and I felt this (God damn!)
Money grip was ugly, I had to find out at last
But shorty had a fat ass
Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x)
She got a big fat...
No need to be ill come all out my face
But the name is Fat Joe and in love I got good taste
Big butts come a dime a dozen in New York
I couldn't help but notice when I watch you walk
You got the booming system and I don't mean sound
I want to smack it up, flip it, and rub it down
I know girls try to say I'm living foul
But you know you can't trust a big but and a smile
I'm not concerned with the niggas in your past
But straight up and down, shorty gotta fat ass
Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x)
She got a biiiiiig...
Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x)
She got a biiiig, ha ha"

105,Still Real,2001,Jealousy Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.) (2001),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"It's so depressing, uh...
Be the realest shit I ever wrote (Money and cars bitches)
Shit Is Real Part 2... (drugs) modern day... (society yaknow?)
See what it's like to walk in my shoes
It ain't all fun and games (ya heard?)
Yo yo
I'm sick and tired of stressin, every days a different lesson
I'm free-fallin' tryna leave this deep depression
My son Joey still slow, my moms got cancer in her throat
My big brother sniffin dope
Lemme know how many motherfucker wanna be just like me
Screamed at and treated like shit by your wifey
This hot bitch be sweatin the coke cash
My baby mother think I grow dough out my ass
It's like, how much fight I got left in me?
Niggaz won't be happy till they bring the fuckin' death of me
But you never see Joe look weak or flow off beat
And Charlie sees the board in four more weeks
You gotta walk where I walked
Bang where I bang
Slang where I hang
To get where I'm going to
Stay where I stay
Blaze who I blazed
Pay dues how I paid
To get where I'm going to
(Fat Joe)
Uh, yo, the South Bronx, nine years later
Ain't nuttin changed, niggaz still playa haters
T.S. the best that's done it, forever live and never front it
Reminisce of when I used to hold heat and tell niggaz ""run it""
Now we flooded with jewels, hundreds of dudes
Crowd the Coliseum to hear they favorite tunes
Then at the time of our prime we caught a sick one
The angels came down, took my twin Big Pun
Shit were unbalanced throughout the whole world
All I could do was try to provide for his seeds and his old girl
Hope your listenin, tell Ton' that we still missin' him
I'm like a prisoner in jail with no visitors
(Fat Joe)
Yeah, uh, aiyyo the third verse is dedicated to you
Even though you switched teams, I'm praying for you
We used to stay up all night countin' dollar for dollar
You was my son's godfather, where the fuck is your honor?
Can't even rap the shit we did together
You'd probably have me shackled locked down doin' bids forever
You broke the first code
I'd like to twist ya wifey till it roasts gold
Snitch nigga, turned state to sold ya soul
How could a nigga that was clappin in the streets
Start yappin to the deez, like what I rightly should believe?
Like ever verse is a charge, for every hurt there's a scar
I never once tried to hurt cha'll
I'm just tryna do me, sell a few CD's
Buy land in Miami and cop a new B come on!
(Joe talking)
Motherfuckers think it's sweet
Think a nigga got money and a nigga don't feel pain
You ain't never feel my pain
You don't know what the fuck I'm goin' through
Niggaz lookin' at me like, ""He got it made""
Like I ain't lose Pun, my grandfather a week later
My aunt a month later
Like my fuckin' sister ain't in a coma right now!
You motherfuckers don't know pain!
Let's get one thing clear; money'll never buy you happiness
My true niggaz walk with me now!"
106,Story To Tell,2006,"Me, Myself & I (2006)",Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"Crack
For every shell that fell
There's a story to tell
They say you hustler then you going to hell
Nah, I know God love's me
Yeah, I know that he fucks with me
Can a gangster go to heaven
Let me in
I call it survival you call it a sin
Damn
I got a story to tell
Yeah, I got a story to tell
(1st Verse)
Yeah I'm right here
Gun in my right palm
Nigga tried and trap me and cage me like my san
Oh shit this mic on
I'm speaking my thoughts Nigga
You catch a hundred if you speaking in court
I'm feeling like Michael
Just before the verdict
Sweat on my forehead
I'm anxious and nervous
These streets ull eat you if you let em
Cop ull beat you
You pumping diesel then them Jack boys ull beat you
I try and listen more and speak less
Cause all that Barber shop talking ull put a Nigga to deep rest
You on the corner and I'm flying buy
Some foreign exotic mo' fucker
You know we flying buy
Oh you got nine lives
I got a pine box
You might as well hop your ass in it cause my iron popped
And I ain't lying Ac
Yeah I'm lying hard
Run up on anybody that's supplying my block
(2nd Verse)
I know this Nigga named Shaheim
An old school cat
Did Football numbers
And never once rat
Now he back on the block got 'em slinging them packs
And his rep's kind of crazy
Known for slinging them Macks
Got a baby with Sandra
Names him K-Sacks
Cause that's where he did his first bid way back
Now this Nigga Sha' got like a memory lapse
Basically you give him work and he ain't payin' back
Now with some connects you could away with that
But he must of fucked wit the wrong Columbian cats
Now these niggaz comin' strapped they want they money back
And you can't tell the difference cause some of them look black
Now Sha on the block thinkin' life's a joke
And his Mama just had a dream that he might get smoked
But he don't give a fuck he been through the best wars
Knife to knife
The yard to mess halls
And these niggaz here have something else in mine
Like a hundred shots fired at a pretzel less spine
Uh huh, you guessed it
Just a matter of time
Another soldier down he got hit with a nine
Dang
(3rd Verse)
Nah I ain't a rapper
Motha fuck rap
They snitched on Kim
How lame is that
This game ain't shit
But snakes and rats
Fighting each other for loose change and scraps
My Nigga kicked you right on your back when you down
No life preservers
They wanna see you drown
Pull the trigger myself
They don't want know help
Now the only Nigga tell on myself is myself
Money Power Respect
You heard the Lox

But it's always room for riches and deep ditches
That's how it be in this everlasting game
Declaring war on cocks, and leavin' chumps slain
So maintain, and put the frontin to a rest
Or today'll be the grand openin of your chest
Success, triple beam, knahmean?
Dolla dolla bill
The streets are full of vengeance, and it's expensive
If you don't organize your words right in your sentence
Twelve gauge holes take souls and lives are lost
Who said an arm and a leg was a high cost to toss?
Things are done different, in my zip code
Hollow tips implode, dum-dums explode
Now your crew is screamin like they see demons when I reload
You can't comprehend, act like you want it for clarity
I'm pushin wigs, handin out jigs like charity
You best to get your groove on, or get moved on
Or play the hot steppa, and die with your shoes on
I collects ass and cash
While my crew consumes liquor and hash, and keep the stash
Whether, hustlin or dustin we get busy with ours
T.S., T.A.T., respect for miles
The Bronx is the turf, South is the area
Bring ten, bring twenty, the more guns the merrier
Nobody's bad as me, no cops nabbin me

Maybe it's the TS chain (I got 'em right)
Maybe it's that Escalade (Come get 'em right)
Maybe it's the way I do (Keep mamies like)
Joe I wanna fuck wit u (Keep sayin' that)
I don't know what it is
All I know it that this chick
Is gon leave wit me
Gon creep wit me
Gon freak wit me

I know it seems every song, is about like the same old thing
But when you rich, ain't nothin' to do but fuckin' hang
Eat good, spend money, count chunks of change
Keep mah ladies lookin' good, when they touch the Range.
Never fuck wit a bitch, if she can't be trained
Never leave wit a chick, if she don't give brain.
We could leave on trip, I got a private plane
I don't fly, but we could park it up and blaze.
Joe's the God
And I know you need somethin' to praise
Just have a lil faith, and you could be saved.
Uh, it's not mah fualt if they love the kid
It might be the chain or the whip
I don't know what it is.

Umm, I don't mean no harm
But their ain't a chick sicka then Remy Ma
And all the hot boys wanna fuck wit Rem
And I don't turn 'em away
I'm like, I'm the bomb now.
Where's your gurl, don't matter to me
I'm way out of her league
She can't keep up to mah speed.
She's weak, she don't need to smoke weed
And wherever she's at
Is where she should be.
Now, where's your wife, I don't care
I'll be at the crib, when she ain't there.
Baby do mah nails, and lace mah hair
Take me out on trips and pay the fare.
Maybe.

Damn, look at all the rocks he got
Ferrari drop 360, hard to top
The party's hot, all white linen affair
I'm doin' the suit thang, white Nike Airs.

Shorty whistlin in mah ear
Told me what she wanna hear, she said
""We thuggin'
Smokin' on sumthin
Down to leave wit y'all, As long as y'all fuckin'.""

Whooo... friendly day in the neighborhood
Birds is chirpin (Hi neighbor!)
Niggas walkin' they dogs, ha ha, watering they flowers
That's my neighborhood... FUCK NO!
I'm from the streets of the BX Boro where niggas push packs
This is that surge shit, that full flex shit, Al Groh shit
Raul ya heard me?
Macho, Jigga Brown JD, Charlie Rock LD, Remy Ma, unh
Sound boy turn this shit up right here
(Fat Joe)
I'm your idol, your highest title, numero uno
Yes I'm Puerto Rican and I speak it so that you know
Stomp... yeah that's the idea
Leave that nigga leakin from ear ta ear
Listen here young bruh, man ya end is near
They probably, find your body at the end of the pier
Niggas must be crazy to mistakin me for folk lore
I put the eighty to your baby man I told y'all
Fuckin' wit crack's like fuckin' wit Crack
What? Pull out the pipe or push your weight back
Look, ya hate that, look we stay straped
From Crook from way back done took the game back
Ya shook, remain fact top of the world, stop knockin' the girl
She in the drop with already rock lock and the pearl
Fish Scale ta Heron, live well from here on
Half a mil in ya grill, of course we bare all
Niggas thinkin' that this rap is just words
I pull up in they curb, pull a Desert Bird
And clear the block in no time
Get off my dick, stop focus shit and getcha own shine, muh'fucka
(Chorus: Fat Joe)
Take a look at my life, and you can see that
I'm from the Bronx where it's known to hear the heat clap
Y'all need a nigga like me to point cha fingers at
So stop hating on The Don, you know ya need Crack
Take a look at my life, and you can see that
I'm from the Bronx where it's known to hear the heat clap
Y'all need a nigga like me to point cha fingers at
So stop hating on The Don, you know ya need Crack
(Fat Joe)
First we was thuggin', then bust sluggin
My Lifestyle the shit, really had the streets buggin
Oh no he ain't come back like that
Not Crack with a platinum plaque, yo!
It's the thirteenth al spinna
Niggas use to doubt now we even made Craig Common look like a winner
Me and Diddy skippin out on bills
Just copped the house on a hill, now how that feel?
Fuck, alot of y'all niggas, you been shittin since the first song
Now we rip it down spring break with no shirt on
Ass all out, just swoonin the crowd
Same damn mean bitches wanna move in my house
You see us back to back in 'em snow white trucks
Chain hanging off the rim, you not giving a fuck
You must not be reading it right
Ice so bright, we don't need headlights at night
Yo, crack niggas, ask niggas how I smack niggas
With the mac flast 'cause I am what I rap, nigga
TS throw in your hands, make 'em pack nigga
To never let another crew move his back nigga, what!
(Outro: DJ Kay Slay)
Yeah, DJ Kay Slay a.k.a. Slap ya favorite DJ

Motherfucker die - don't look in my eye
Take this wit'cha nigga, tell the devil I sent ya

Yup! Death ain't sweet man
But it's a fact that one day ya breath gon' cease
Some niggaz get cremated, others rest in peace
You can get shot tomorrow if you test these streets
Go against Crack - hehehe - that's a problem
I'm a driveby, stabbin, napalm kinda problem
Choose one, the AK or revolver
I'll leave your body leakin layin on the carpet
Yeah, this nigga don't care
Have your head spinnin like that chick Linda Blair
I'm the Exorcist, niggaz don't know when they exit is
But I keep a K that cause a mass exo-dus
You don't want no problems, problems
Fuckin' with these frauders {?}
I had the ambulance racin the street
Have your poor momma raisin the sheets, muh'fucker
(Fat Joe)
Let me tell you 'bout myself, you can find me alone
On the streets of the Bronx, that's the county I own
Well at least that's the one I'm claimin
You know a muh'fucker that's realer then name him
Damn near a decade done passed and we still on top
My nigga Pun died, niggaz thought the shit gon' stop
I'm not concerned with the rumors and the small talk
Thought a nigga learned when he caught it and he walked off
Shoulda put the burn to a nigga so he'd slow down
Niggaz won't be thinkin', that's it rap, when it go down
In L.A. we got Bloods and Crips, in Chi-Town the Kings
Got other mob bosses kissin' my ring
Don't confuse me wit'cha favorite MC
Difference is this man'sll kill him as a favor for me
Until then it's just...
(Fat Joe)
Yo - wake up in a cold sweat
5:15 in the mornin, hear my phone ring
It's my nigga Ant speedin, slow down dog
You actin' like the po-po chasin ya, be easy
He tellin' me, ""Crack where the fuck is you at?""
I'm at the hotel Radisson, hour ago
I did a show out in Patterson, took the bitch home
Nigga you know she was the baddest one, as was the Fattest one
This nigga Ant yell, ""Crack what's her name?""
Carmen, why you stallin, why the fuck you callin
He said, ""Joe they tryin' to set you up
Put you six feet deep tryin' to wet you up
You know that nigga Pablo from... Ave
Now he push pounds of blow, niggaz swear he bad""

And ain't nobody smirk my way - nope - keep speakin' that hot shit
And you can get merked today, check me out
There's some rumbling on the blocks, struggle on the streets
That's why I had to leave that bitch bloody in them sheets
Go 'head and think Crack just rap
Fuck around I'm gon' really have to clap these cats

I tried tell you boy I'm lettin 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I'm tired of talkin' boy I'm lettin 'em go

Does Crack think he live
Just because he had poppin' in '88 and his boys served time
I don't care 'bout that neither
I don't give a fuck about him, T.S. or the fever
Yeah I said it, when I see him I'ma pop him
I know he big but this here 9 gon' stop him
I'm in the streets everyday in these projects
I ain't scared nigga, man I'm dyin' to get it poppin'

Pussies loose these days, gotta tighten 'em up
Think they comin' of age till you lighten 'em up
Momma screamin cause you lyin' in dust, I ain't lyin'
Who the fuck you think supplyin the drugs?
I'm your boss that's boss, pretty much I bought you that Porsche
And pretty much I'm 'bout to auction you off
To the highest clapper, get your head spun backwards you bastards
For thinkin' Terror Squad just rappers, we'll blast ya

Status, motherfuckers. Eat a dick!
Now who's the underated pro, they scared to play on the radio?
Who lives the lyrics, all my real niggas already know
Flow for flow, no crew can step to us
And blow for blow, I'm pretty sure that you heard the rumors
I give tumors to niggas and comas to bitches
No one's against us, roll with the riches
And float with the fishes
The revolution has started that's why I'm undercarded
My Squad will turn to the most feared into the dearly departed
As hard as they come, they all fall like the Great Wall
Make no mistake, I take you straight to the state morgue
Swarmin informers like cops at drug corners
Feds got the bugs on us, tryin' to lay the law on us
They want us in jails, with bails too high to bond, but am I the Don?
Shit, I'll be out by the morn', word bond
My game is on lock, till you bawl cop
And it's never ever gonna stop
(Prospect)
Yo, yo, I play the game with caution
Sun changes, gave power creative activities
Bring fame and fortune
Why can't you live this? All day hands on bitches
With financial ventures, enhance the riches
Gotta hold the cake, my grandmoms had dreams
But it seems I couldn't graduate or go to Drake
It hurts at nights I gots to reimburse the vice
Niggaz is worse than shiest for the merchandise
My words precise, 'cause if not I wouldn't speak it
I rock shit everyday of the week, especially the weekends
Outside, these pretty clothes I live, but with the titty-ho
Knock a nigga out, for the shit he stole
We already degraded, me and my family the most hated
Bitch were barely both made it
See the thinly related, to everything in the street
I'm sellin coke, crack, and dope, plus swingin' the heat
Chorus: Triple Seis
We got drug dealers and bug niggas, who love killin'
Slugs killin', ya touch feelin', just for the thrillin
We bust feelins, dump bodies in crushed buildings

I got rubies on my Uzi's and gems on my Mack 10's
Diamonds on my nines and golden bullets just to match them
Platinum magnums with silver clips, real begets
Shit, I'm gonna milk this bitch till I'm filthy rich
Filled with chips from the floor to the ceiling
Just flossin and chillin' in a Porsche full-a-women
I'm one in a million, get on the deal already
My skills are sharper than a steel Maschetti
Realer than the military
Killin' every track I'm on, Link and Joey Crack the Don
Flippin in my Cuban Caddy, wit the hazards on
(Triple Seis)
So, come on if you gon' ride with us, live niggas
Hop with us, quick to try to triple five figures
(Big Punisher)
Your style is unoffic', niggaz like you stay on my wanted list
Pun and Prince, we're walkin' on kings, like a son-of-a-bitch
Fuckin' with this is hazardous to amateur battlers
Average niggas get lost in the course of embarrassment
Of course you don't have a chance, I'm the boss in your emminence
Get tossed in the ambulance with the force of an avalanche
I'll torture your fragile ass with rhetorical paragraphs
For all of you that'll laugh at a historical aftermath!
I come equipped, my tongue and lips are like a hundred clips
Look behind you, I'll blind you like when the sun eclipse
Ain't no second chances, I glance at niggas
Make 'em wet they pants
The chances are slim if Twinz done swing the rest of the ransome
The best and the champion, that means I'm far beyond
Dionne read my palm, told me to get on and put my army on
Come along, follow the Don, my motto and song
Live for tomorrow, cause today's almost already gone
Let's get on, split your belly with the Maschetti, long
Tears your arms of your shoulders, and tell you to, hold on
I know it's wrong, but it feels so right
I used to bust steel all night, but now I gotta deal, all right
(Armageddon)
Fuck a Toe to Toe, give me a forty-four and a foe to blow
To make it more dramatic, I quote Jehovah holding the scroll
Open your skull, show you shit you ain't supposed to know
Break the world in half and spit the ocean from coast to coast
(Just to let you know) That I'm zone coasted
And play the visuals from the top of my verse back in slow-motion
Assassinate the Pope with no emotions
So why should I hesitate to crush a campaign like I wasn't votin?
My brain floatin away, above you niggas like I make time pause
Checkin' my Rollie watch my diamond Roman digits
Golden riches, better hold 'em bitches
'Cause we robbin niggas way before
The translation of Holy Scriptures
I was Armageddon before the motion picture
The last nigga to drop his verse and have the globe shiftin
My Squad's hard and far from Puritans
Robbin and killin' men like we proud to be Americans"

Don Cartagena, bring you the best in hardcore hip-hop
""J-J-Joe Crack returns bangin""
Yeah, uh
Yo it's the Don of rap, sippin Cognac, hit you on the back
With the Mac (CLAK CLAK) slip you into cardiac
It's the art of rap at the illest form
From a killer's point of view, who thrives off the area jealous ones
You could tell it's on from my introduction
Hibernate the junction with killin' somethin' when you was barely dumpin
You ain't even nuttin to worry about
I flurried your mouth, with about thirty right in front of your house
Then I'm hurryin out in the expedition, professional hit men
The vestibule shit from the credible disses
Federals is listenin to my conversations, tapin all the songs I'm makin'
Shakin down every ounce of my congregation
John Blazin', raisin the stakes, changin your fate
Tied up in my basement with a gauge in your face
Make no mistake, that's how I do my thing
Blow out a lot of brains, I'm sayin', it's not a game
""Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you"" -- Mobb Deep
Uh, uh, yeah
Joe Crack takin' a L and make Tone roll over in his grave, never that
T.S. got his dreams and discourage the brave, remember that
I been bustin' guns since the infamous days of leather hats
Varsity sweaters with big letters black
Pushin the illest whips down fifty-fifth
Where killers riff, without havin' to split Phillies and sniff
And Willies who shift jobs from Chili willin' to leave you stiff
Fulfillin my biggest wish, in this illegal shit
Quarter Maris stay slugger with karats, never offered marriage
When my corpse is carried my moms'll get all my cabbage
Terror Squad is savage, draped in the finest of fabrics
Floss like it's a habit, eight shot up in my Louis baggage
You knew we knew we had you, lay half your crew in gravel
Caught you slippin with your Boo and started shootin at you
Out of captivity, left Relativity
Now we on the Big-ger Beat, Terror Squad trilogy, what?

117,The Hidden Hand,1998,Don Cartagena (1998),Hip Hop,Fat Joe,"Yeah, time to educate the youth (Speak on it God)
'Cause if we won't, then who will? (True)
Terror Squad style, yo
(Speak on it God)
Yo, I was a wild adolescent, blessed with the foul essence
Messin around with the wrong crowd, I learned my lesson
Stressin all the things that I have not
I pray to God I get my Uncle out the crack spot
I hear mad shots, homicide come and play Matlock
But never crack the case cause the defendant's a bad cop
You feel me fam? The devil's got a plan
That's why Farrakhan formed a Million Man up in Washington
The Hidden Hand even planned this man
Have me goin' hand to hand, killin' my own clan
But now I understand and see the big picture
Fuck cryin about the struggle, I teach you how to get richer
(Cuban Link)
Shit is a hassle in this rotten apple, kids robbin coppin capsules
Rockin' tattoos, boppin with ankles locked in shackles
Got the cops joggin at you, spittin' rounds of clips, they down wit it
New clowns'll make you feel as if the Bill of Rights is counterfeit
Now it's been written that all men are equal, but then it's legal
When they beat us and treat us as if we're different people
We go for delf, fuck the cop's health
I'd rather drop shelf and let off shots until my Glock melts
Cause God dealt us a helpless hand, they made us sell this land
So the palest man could build a selfish plan
You know we can't trust the government, cause Uncle Sam is smugglin
Drugs for us to hustle all the stuff for him
Even McGruff is in it, gettin' a percentage
Takin' advantage, punishin just blacks and hispanics
(Big Punisher)
My heart is cold as ice, so I know I'm sheist, Big Pun was the kid
That no one liked, my whole life, is one big roll of the dice
Payin' a price twice as expensive as white kids
Destined for Riker's not knowin' my existence was priceless
IT'S LIKE THIS, my soul was lifeless, I earned stripes
Fightin the nicest in the crisis I slice 'em in half and make 'em dash
Like hyphens, invitin any rapper to Clash With the Titan
The writing's like fighting cause rappers be biting like Tyson
I'm hypein the crowd, keepin' 'em Loud like my label
I'm proud I'm able to lift from the bowels of the ghetto
I found me a little sanity inside a career and a family
No more wars and renderin tears to insanity
So keep the salary and tear the mic, 'cause I love it
There's my life, you judge it, fuck it Seis, I don't want it
(Triple Seis)
I'm a Dominican, stranded in New York like Filligan
Don't wanna get locked up in the pen again
But here they come, the faggots and cuffs, searchin for guns
Turnin' they ride on the side of the curb to see who runs
They authorize the beast to walk the streets holdin' heat
Four deep, we puff production, my cheek, you know my steez
Fuck the police, usin' ""probable cause"" to break laws
Behind the badge you try to cover up your racial war
I got somethin' for you boys in blue
The system poisoned you, blew your cover, now what you supposed to do?
I never let the faggot pull the trig first
It won't be no American flag over my hearse
What's worse, you know they disperse for bucks
So take caution in the streets cause our protection sucks
(Armaggedon)
This dude, he had the darkest pads
Who dressed up in the heart of brash
Forever talkin' trash
How he stacked niggaz to almanac
Gunshots to corner four police informants
Stood like he modeled the latest fashions, sidewalk sideshow performance
He raised the pull of grace, a razor blew his face
Force calm the ?sere? plus a pack of the ?dunga dun? laced with toothpaste
Life ain't to be gambled son, you could get trampled
By people that act more like animals than mammals high off enamel
That's what his poppa said whose locked for droppin' Akmed
In the candy store robbery probably to get his veins fed
He ain't listen, he became a braindead cocaine head
Older Mexicans knew, they killed him eatin ?bagualitos?
But hey little kids, don't follow these dopes
(Prospect)
What? Uh-huh, yeah I can dig that
They call me Prospect, I just came back from?
Had this track on pause, now I'm back on course
It's lost on the Ave, tryin' to take my life from the past
Get this legal cash, ? without dad
Kinda sad how he got dragged down to negativity
Only if he had one love, trust for liberty
This world would be a better place, get what it takes
In a race to racism replace the snake in em
Bad ones, want to spend lives and discriminate
I'm tryin' to keep this positive vibe, and from that
I generate to the top, like Puffy won't stop
I'm mature now, with one knot, from tryin' to get locked
And to the shorties on the block, tryin' to twist 40 tops
Get your act together, do some carpentry with a Black 'n' Decker
And stop speedin like a Kawasaki
From my life, to your life, I'm touchin everybody Twinz watch me
Everything we speak is the truth
From Prospect to Munroe, here in a hot second
The whole world run know, everything we speak is the truth

No mean to disrespect but a lot of ya'lls frontin
Shook niggas, me and the Squad done took niggas
Flex drop bombs but you seem to overlook niggas
We the nicest in the game, even lifers know the name
Throwin' blows like Tyson when he rained
Fuck the ice in the range, I'm tryin' to get stocked
Generate mil's so I can buy back my old block
It's like the rap games far from the crack game
Niggas is mad lane (How come?) They act tame
You can tell from my scars life is hard
Shot down in broad day life in front of my Mom's
And the feds never give up, they tryin' to kill us
I'm stressed drinkin' (?) tearin my liver
Livin' my life like I don't care
I'm out to take the throne
My mom's in the window hopin I'ma make it home
The streets is funny peeps'll kill you
Over piece of money, 'specially if you sleepin'
And don't keep it gully, I'm from the bronx
Home of niggas that'll stalk you senseless
Don't resent this, I'm knowin' that you comprehend this
It's the wild life, niggas done lost they mind
It's the wild life, everybody wanna floss and shine
But could you blame them?
Niggas is brought up with anger
Pops in jail, Moms get tossed up on stangers

Yo it's the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo it's the wild life

But who the fucks to blame
He did 13, and wonder why the steets my name
And he's my game, 'cause I'm the type
To leak your frame, give you a slap
With the cast, you can meet my pain
Defeat I bring, to the nicest rapper you know
I ain't a killer but I still might clap
At shooters, you for real here
Niggas be followin with steps
I made my own moves, so the tokers
Could swallow they breath
Acknowledge the best, and do what I did
Like I'm blessed, 7 days in a coma
This is life after death
I'm in it to win, ya heard?
From beginning to end, you could get shot
Even though you once considered a friend
Sometimes my minds driven to win
Tryin' to scare society
But can't slip again 'cause my lil' man relyin me
Everyday I put through a test
But still progress
I'm tryin' to climb hills
And tryin' to make me kill for less
Yo it's the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo it's the wild life
We all brawlin, fight to eat
The enemies and the deeds lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up
Like ""Yo, why me?""
(Xzibit)
Yo it's the wildlife
Straight kidnappin and carjackin
Yo it's the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin, we all packin
I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin the turf
Sraight to the dirt
We niggas known for puttin' in work
(Verse 3: Xzibit)
I make it all go down right
In front of your face
Another life goes to waste
For names sake of the paper chaser
It ain't safe here, the bright lights cablide you
Mix sedica, swollow you whole
They can't find you
Worst thing is walkin' these streets
I need clarity, peace and prosperity
Is never gon' see, so niggas with beef
Niggas bumpin they gums and teeth
Straight to the police
Tryin' to plant us six feet deep
But I ain't goin' for that
My shit clap through your starter cap
Pull your socks back, we ain't runnin' from nothin'
Comin' from nothin', makes you struggle harder for somethin'
Shit is disgusting, you can even trust who you fuckin'
The wild life! Colder the nights
You niggas ain't nice, put yo money where yo mouth is
And roll the dice, puffin canibus and tiva
With the Don Cartagena, believe a nigga
When I say, don't make me have to spray ya
Yo it's the wildlife
Straight kidnappin and carjackin
Yo it's the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin, we all packin
I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin the turf
Sraight to the dirt
We niggas known for puttin' in work"

New York
Yeah we G'ed up
Act up
Clap the back of your knees up
Packin' the Mack in the back of the Beemer
Taxin' your cash and you asking to ease up
I want to rock now
Comply or get shot down
I know
You goin' hire some cops now
Coca
Sun down to sun up
Kily Cartel use to be a runner
D Boy
Stamp bricks with smiley faces
Show you how to turn that powder to a hundred acres
Let's get it
Thank god for making crack raw
Now how you want it
The window or the chainsaw
Crack
Yeah I'm nice with the knife game
Ice pick change your life with one strife man
Too much rappin' and we don't rat
We do it for them trap stars serving them packs
And e'er nigga know from way back to Houston
Joes a go when push comes to shootin'
The four four will loose more then just a tooth man
A hundred shots will rip your top like where the fuck the roof went
I think he said something
Bring 'em back to me
I let the chopper groove
And let the Mack boogie
You better think about it
Boy you better think about it
You better think about
Boy you better think about it
I got no papers on all them guns
So when I pull 'em out your ass best run
Crack
You better think about

This ain't for the niggaz hob nobbing in closets
This is for them niggaz that suppling their projects
Man catch beef say my nigga I got this
Right in broad day twist a nigga then pop shit
I ain't playin'
I got big guns
My niggaz barely speak English
They'll lift son
The strip is mine
Naw, you ain't eatin' here
I run this shit
At least in some recent years
And y'all know who rep the streets most
Terror squad we put the E in East coast
So be easy like T I said
Or them things ull pop up like a Chia pet
Or Chi Ali or any given clapper
Exorcist style get your shit spun backwards
Them pistols ull go your brain go's splatter
A minute ago you said you'd get at us
Now why you have to go talk like that
Get ya body outlined with the chalk like that
I guess he must a thought I'd a fought them cats
The oldest rule in the books
You should have brought them gats"

(Fat Joe)
Since day one, niggaz died at the Don
'Cause I was anon, now Terror Squad is a thousand beyond
Not only strong but we loyal and royally treated
Quadripalegic any squad that wanna squab when I'm heated
Not even God can believe it, the way we regulate
And levitate, heavyweight niggaz like they was featherweight
Every day I do the same thang
It's the paid game, to amputate more body parts than gangrene
(Big Punisher)
Yo this a man's game, it's a shame how niggaz truly mock me
But who can stop me, from breakin niggaz off like Fujiyaki?
My crew's probably the only niggaz that really live the lyrics
Niggaz really fear us, they must of heard we really killers
We're Philly fillers and 40 guzzlers with millimeters
And army cutters Willie niggaz that laundry dollars
I'm Nostradamus predictin the future, my position is crucial
With a known friction obsession addicition to shoot ya *BLAM*
(Fat Joe)
Hey yo I'm better off dead than givin' the feds the satisfaction
Subtractin my freedom have me missin' in action
(Big Punisher)
A fraction of y'all, raw like Colt to the jaw
The rest of y'all, fear war, and couldn't follow out the protocol
(Fat Joe)
Joe the God is like the angel of death, strangle your neck
That's why Don Cartagena's the name your respect
(Big Punisher)
I bring the pain to your chest, that'll make you question your threshold
Flex like you been forced, still ""bless you"" like a chest cold
We destined to explode, that's why I stay on flip mode
Your dick rode me long enough Dunn, now you can let go
Chorus: Big Punisher
Every man in this world has a destiny
Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me; unless you just
Def dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because I'm veddy and there ain't no gettin' rid of me
(Fat Joe)
Uh, uh, uh, yo!
Somebody hold me back, Joey Crack's about to load the gat
And blow this track to the stars like the zodiac
Hold me back this max 'n' better, out for the ass 'n' cheddar
But fast cash don't last forever
(Big Punisher)
I asked the felons, if I don't stay wrapped in leathers
And hats with feathers, I got all the ostriches actin' jealous
Track the trailers in chrome black Cateras
Two hundred inch Mickey Thompson's, flown back from Paris
(Prospect)
Dat dats the illest, these body tracks make a rap killings
Others is trying to stack billions out in crack buildings
My destiny was to shine, ? to climb
Especially in time, with the recipe in mind
From the jump start, they ain't have to pump hard in this
I was a part of this, and marvelous stats, it wasn't hard to miss
And yo, I had to burn cats like arsonists and still continue
Whose on my menu? A record deal they couldn't lend you
I had to burn my glock and earn my spot
The time flew by, had to turn my clock
And start with a new resume, not really that bitch named Des'ree
She ain't really my dream there's a better way -- what?
Prospect'll have to collect dough
Dialin 905 to L-A-X with somethin' I was tryin' to drive
A life that's trife for what I wore in the fuckin'?
A thug in pain, I swear to my little cousin's grave
(Big Punisher)
Every man in this world has a destiny
Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me; unless you just
Def dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because I'm dead in a minute if you're?

I want 'em all dead!
Aiyyo they left me for dead
Amongst the roaches and the maggots
I can still remember shovels spillin dirt above (this bastard?)
I waited for an answer, but god ain't call
I'm hearing demons and the devils and the shots they call
They want crack; I hopped out the casket, that's it
Time for some actions, consequence is very tragic
I call my crew the Darkside, we all ride
Keep them other crews running running (can't keep running away) like The Pharcyde
Triple Black Louis V's provided by the Sudanese
Walking through the desert conversating like it's you and me
Kanye shrug, paparazzi taking pictures
See it in my mugshot; Mob Boss slash killer
Triple Beam entrepreneur, they live for only pure
The world's only cure, fiends keep fiending more
Crack!

Middle finger to the sky, screaming fuck the other side
Thinkin' money get, money got, money on my mind

To capture niggas for the deeds we do
And the cars we drive
Red Ferrari California on my way to Arizona
Mexicano at the border
I used to play the corner, Blair Witch on a nigga
Dump your body in the woods, dare snitch on a nigga
Listen; Black mask, black gloves, rope and duct tape
Put you where the spare tyre be at; trunk space
Can heaven be just a distant memory?
They say you live a fast life but death'll come eventually
Maybe in my past life I wasn't listening cause this the
Fuck Tha Police, judges, P.O.'s and the witnesses
Heronious charge, an Appolonian broad
Another day in the life, another bitch to minage

Verse 2-Fat Joe
I once knew a girl by the name of Savannah
Met her backstage at a show in Atlanta
Seemed like a nice girl, class and well-mannered
When I took her to the hotel the bitch went bananas
Did my eyes deceive me
Was she suckin' three pee-pee's
Caught it all on tape so I could watch it late on TV
Couldn't wait to beep me
Started in the car shorty caught the quick train from the Trinity stars
Big Joe'll railroad
Any frail hoe
Have a bitch scream and yell throwin' elbows
Now who the hell knows
Why these girls fuck for cell phones
Turnin' tricks for material shit
Now bust it, You wanna hit it gotta pay top dollar
These chics is hott rodders
Wit grips like Rottwilers

Hey yo Armageddon, let these motherfuckers know

You look, I look, you invite it, I took
I forever wearin it, you know stone cold crook
What's truth, what's lie? Who's people, who spy?
It's life and death, choose live or die
Ultimates who made 'em why do we even exist?
When we die is there heaven or is it total blackness?
For any touch there's a feeling
Touch and y'all felt
We can exchange shots, until our chambers melt
There's mad tension in the air (mad tension in the air)
Over one man's stare, you wanna dare, yo Crack
Eject the Czech from the glove compartment
Lay out the lead spray, and flame him up like arson
It's dangerous business
Opposites, these strangers be bendin opposites
So put your face in mine, best brace your spine
Cause opposites may attract, but they don't combine
My impact so fat, you feel your vertabrates grind
Now delayed second thoughts run through your mind
When my slugs connect, and strike your major arteries
When my fists connect, they causin major injuries
What you know Junior? You not evil

I don't know an MC who has enough balls to diss it
Whether rain or shine, we be bustin' out nines

My nutty wrath'll live as long as I'm a nasty kid
I blast a pig and slit his throat just for ? L
My skills {undecipherable} puffin boom in Hell
I doom the world like I was God and throw my gun away
Then snatch the moon out the sky, and blow the sun away
Me and my brothers play hardball
Strictly hardcore, lyrics till I'm finished breakin God's laws
My job's raw but I gotta do it - I'm feelin' high then buddhaed
So you might get shot and lose a lot of fluid
The spot I blew it at an early age, ever since the curly braids
I would earn a wage with the thirty gauge
There's dirty ways to get paid if you got the balls
Just load the glock and cause the hardest cop to drop his drawers
Don't stop or pause, let the shotty go up his butt
To finish up, punchin body blows and uppercuts

The South Bronx is the wrong place to visit

Well I'll be god damnit, I kick ass like I'm yo' parents

Got kicked out my church 'cause I got caught fuckin' my preacher's daughter
Menace like Dennis on the M.I.C.
You best run son, I'm sendin emcees up shit's creek
So don't sleep, 'cause I creep, on New York streets
Like I'm a big fat dick, wack emcees is ass-cheeks

You lose, 'cause I got, the ill street, and still keep

If you took what you got, lick a shot (Pump pump!)
When the dough is low, we go (Stick up, stick up!)
You get knocked on the block, we say (Big up, big up!)
Check the misfit, time to rip shit
Time to get with the nitwit lyrical lunatic
In the street I stay strong 'cause I'm armed
With a nine, what up nig? You must be out of your fucking mind
I'm much more than you expect, kid
To identify your ass they'll have to use your fucking dental records
So step up, come come, don't be bashful
I got a steel toe and you can get an assful
'Cause if it's me you think you're better than
You'll need a sniffly, sneezy, coughing, stuffy head, get your ass with medicine
You can feel, shit is real, my mind can set me free
So I can continue my MC killing spree

I got 'em ducking and bucking, so I don't think so
I bust your whole shit if you're not kind

Snatch your bitch up at Crystal and then I fuck her with a pistol
A nigga with heart, walk through a park in the dark
Fuck the drug marks stomping me, I'll play your fucking heart, so be smart
Cut all that bullshit and clown, I'll be the only nigga laying down
When everybody else is sitting
So who's the next man to hit? I slip in a banana clip
And I hit, come and get your bandana split
Shit, fuck, bitch who's the snitch?
You may be down with Mikey and Ikey, but you're laying in a fucking ditch
With motherfucking maggots with the rest of them faggots
Cause your license to kill was from Tagget's
I warned a brother of another brother's glock
And I said ""What's up, duck?"" And I had my motherfucking gun cocked
So be a sport, another lesson drug
Holding down the fort and a stupid-ass nigga got caught

Hanging motherfuckers with a mic cord
I'm a rap lord, suckers always get me bored
Saying that they that and this
Ayo they get me pissed, cause motherfuckers ain't jack shit
I'm here to represent the Boogie Down
Making niggas leave town before sundown
And if you don't listen, G
I'll stick a knife up your ass like ""American Me""
I'm serving motherfuckers like Wimbleton
I shock a crowd like a bottle of insulin
And niggas always get me vexed
I'm tired of motherfuckers trying to sound like Das Efx
You'd better hold your own, child
'Cause I'm laying suckers like rugs and tiles
This is the bigger nigger with the mad lines
You step to me? You must be out of your FUCKING mind!
