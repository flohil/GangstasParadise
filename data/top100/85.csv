0,A-1 Performance,2002,Aziatic (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,AZ,"(Talking)
Y'all can't be serious, this is A-1 performance
Your boy wit' the million-dollar vocal chords
No more Cristal and DoM P, straight Gatorade
And they say in death, all life questions shall be answered
But this here started before the womb
And will not end after the grave
Y'all can't disturb me
(Verse One)
Critically acclaimed, verbally I'm sickly insane
Officially, I remain the Ripleys of the game
Believe or not, the hustler's here to retrieve his spot
From y'all dungaree thieves that mislead the block
No rehearsal, nothing's controversial
Relax homie, react, one response'll hurt you
I know death, I was there when souls left
Froze holdin' my nose, over decomposed flesh
It's deeper, brown reefer, no beeper, low ceaser
Outta sight, the life make the doe sweeter
The raps Derrick Jeter, veggie-eater, half-ebonizer
Love leisure, crewed up, in the stretch 11-seaters
It's either; move accordin' or, lose an organ
It's sorta like an abortion, you choose what's more important for ya
Pimp to poet, from prince to heroic to
Now, King of New York now, as if y'all don't know this.
If you, If you think you want it
You know y'all can get it
Nobody doing it better than AZ, no, no, no (2x)
(Verse Two)
I done did the ostrige, the gators, silver foxes
Silk boxers, rocked ice so obnoxious
Wore pradas, Taj Mahal more dollars
What other motherfucker y'all could call hotter
Street affilly, sweet swisher, switch from willy
This so amazing, MJ style the flows Cajun
Connect wit me, absorb, reflect wit me
Respect I'm so N-Sync, I could sex Britney
Been about it, no comparison, send 'em a stylest
They too old for gold, and they dress code is childish
I'm grown music, so I ask don't confuse it
Consider, I'ma soul food this Howard Heuwit
Sos the don, so seductive overdose 'em wit' charm
Paranoid, sorta, so please approach me calm
Clothes and money, hydro, hoes among me,
Emphatically, the truth is y'all can't take nothin' from me.
If you, If you think you want it
You know y'all can get it
Nobody doing it better than AZ, no, no, no (2x)
(Verse Three)
Although it's all music, at times we misuse it
Confuse it, like we back on the block suited
Born-thugs now get recruited, but listen youngin'
You still a student I spit twirlin' tricks wit' a toothpick
Taught ya teacher, I'm the source for seekers
Resurrected like Christ off the cross on easter
Zone excessive, seven different home addresses
So many years lost through tribulations, I've grown possessive
I, earned my title, I learned survival
Self made, never too concerned wit' idols
The earth and the moon is one, and I'm the sun
So all competition is none, get ya gun.
If you, If you think you want it
You know y'all can get it
Nobody doing it better than AZ, no, no, no (2x)
Nobody, doing it better than AZ"

It's another interlude motherfucker
You know it's Animal the Mixtape Bully nigga, MTB
You know how I do it the way I do it when I do it the way I do it
Motherfucker stab you in your throat with a icepick
Shoot you in the face with a beebee gun
Whatever I do to bring you to the conrete I'ma do it, you heard?
My motherfuckin nigga A, it's the closin of the album nigga
I salute you nigga, for never bein a bitch
For never bein a bitch-ass nigga {*music starts*}
Cryin, retirin, sayin' you comin' back to the game
Go findin God and comin' back, keep gettin' shot and comin' back
Niggaz doin' mixtapes and comin' back
Lyin' till y'all caught with guns and comin' back
Keep comin' back baby, you in the top five man
Y'all niggaz pay The Source for mics man
Cause you don't know how to be an original nigga from the streets
I respect you man, close it out like this, 2-double-oh-5
Fuck the world, you heard, say what's up A.W.O.L. take it
(AZ)
I am one of the flyest, crew is like the Al'Qaeda's
We war like in the mess halls of Elmyra
Bodies get caught, predicate spells is higher
Why talk if you ain't walk through hell's fire
All-nighters, upscale attire
In car get new cars you and your man's admire
Young messiah, back bottom guns for hire
I am that what the rap contracts require
Ghostwriter, coast to coast cyphers
I do this for them grown men in diapers that don't like us
Though, still the nicest, sendin kites to Riker's is priceless
Reminiscin on past life fights with Cypress
Hung lifeless, sprung from financial crisis
Never ran, I stand amongst the righteous
AZ-Q, dark denimy V suits
His, arson is lethal, only pardon his people so
Just ask it open the closed casket
Coke or the dope acid I'm back on that old Shaft shit
Got my ratchets, army fatigue jacket
Fitted cap on backwards with them cats from Flatbush
Bravehearted, fuck if they say squash it
We remain the largest, we invade regardless
Trains to Spofford insane with a brain from Hartford
It's hard to explain my artwork
One for the haters, two for the true and the raiders
I know dudes who eat your food with a razor
It's major, barbaric, brutal behavior
Called addict, I talk about the jewelry later
My respect is for the DL cartel connects
And the crews that came through and left arise well effect
Finesse, big boys only play with the best
It's no regrets, bein dead broke and raised in the 'jects
I'm a vet, cousin Comstock callin collect
Sayin' he just left the box hot annoyed and depressed
Claimin he stressed did a 3 still facin the stress
I'm like look this ain't the vote and you ain't facin your death
So save your breath, tie your boots up and bang with the rest
Cause in reality they just incarcerated your flesh
You know the deal, I pray they process your appeal
Cause on the real, I still got my hands on the wheel
And I'ma drive till the gas run out
Either crash or a wrap till a smash come out
We them real niggaz"
2,AZ's Back,2001,9 Lives (2001),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,AZ,"Everybody wanna take chills
It's either that or nigga wanna play sales
Try tha floor when I bound wit a fake bill
When I see seven niggas I don't say shit
Motherfucker like me try to stay big
Who you got laying down in a ""stay there""
If a whips I can do it any kind of way
From this A to the Crist to the Chardonnay
Through the belt, from tha pipe to the parkway
Everything a nigga touch is like park-ay
Get it right, bill nigga let it light
From the stand though, two mil, living life
And this chicks from the streets better get it tight
Their pussy laid out better get it right
So where we at now
AZ's back (come on)

(What you like, what you like from me now)
No niggas from both coast
Everybody built pride but they hold toast
No joke, fuck co' but a whole load
Lone cones got bombs and .04s
'91 put cha stickers wit the low cone
Who's down getting' blunted and tryin' blow smoke
Take notes, love cars only one side
Always talk to blend in wit the young guys
Hustle up, play the block till the sunrise
Fuck wit us, bro', fuck you just gon' die
That's that, where are the real hard haters at?
Only who jack niggas sittin' back
Hit the broad, let 'em ball, nigga play it all
Wanna walk wit cha guns, nigga make the call

Run away from the funny style,
Cut those fake niggas wit tha funny smile
Every hater in the game wanna run me out
Everybody that's broke wanna run their mouth
What that be about the time nigga see the cloud
Won't stop till every last dollar, we even now
Give it all back, bills in a small stack
Stack a whole lotta shit in the door crack

(AZ)
AZ's chillin', Brooklyn's chillin'
What mo' can I say? Why catch feelings
Used to hide the crack in the hotel ceilings
But that was way back when I was wholesale fillers
We made a killing off our little bity buildings
But really them lil' gun silly niggaz still illin
Clip is chillin', chips to the ceiling
Shot in ninety-six June this wound still healing
That's right, this three-wheeling got it good
And if you never had it locked in your own hood you should
Stop frontin, and lookin' hard
'Fore the gym star sneeze, leave your face scarred it's
No more bosses, girls think that I'm god I'm a
Young full artist either eat or you starvin
Either beef or you barred, the finger either the yard
I'm sittin' peepin my odds before seekin' peace in the Mars but
Still do me 'cause it's easy to do
So the fly CEO, I ain't easy to jew
And that's how it is, you can ask Blitz
Jail, for more than aggravated assault
Wild Style took it to trial said it's all his fault
AZ's chillin', Brooklyn's chillin'
What mo' can I say? Why catch feelings
My cons-tributions to this jam
Is confusing because I am...
... Low key and y'all know the deal
And when you real then you real no need to ice grill
YES, I'm nice still, YES, my mic skills
Is so ill for real give myself slight chills
And I get money, money I got
Big bottles of Belve keep the bloodflow hot
Bone's up in queen, wood in the feds
Wild born and barred niggaz hold your head
'Cause I'm still here, hustle with no fear
The muscle is still here that love be still sheer
I dare, a muh'fucker pull my card
I got more than a great big bodyguard
So press up if you wanna get served
I survived in the hood, now I'm all in the burbs
With the bass on thump, suitcase in the trunk
Probably UV with the tooly lettin Akon pump
AZ's chillin', Brooklyn's chillin'
What mo' can I say? Why catch feelings
How long can I lay to touch millions
'Fore that AK spray or sprays on civilians
I'm five for five, I'm rated R
I'm gifted, and I'm goin' far
Down the ave, to the spot
Four dubs of 'dro that's all I copped
No mo' but chammy that's all I pop
So solo with the fam that we all we got
Hate for what, I live that life
I done drove every car, I did that ice
Done touched a few broads, some hid they wife
I was too large to dodge, had to deal my life
I kept it fair, I played the game
Now it's time for the whole world to know my name
AZ's chillin', Brooklyn's chillin'
What mo' can I say? Why catch feelings
Just do the dance that's easy to do
Lean back or that two-step, what's easy for you
This jam is on and on and on
Guaranteed airplay till your breath is gone!
I get the money so I don't care, I do-I don't care, I do-I don't care
New York get that money so I don't care, get the-get the money so I don't care
Cali get that money so I don't care, I do-I don't care, I don't care
Miami get that money so I don't care, get the-get the money so I don't care
Detroit get that money so I don't care, I don't care, I do-I don't care
Chi-Town get that money so I don't care, I don't care, I do-I don't care
Atlanta get that money so I don't care, get the-get the money so I don't care"

This is what... this what they want huh?
This is what it's all about...
What? Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, youknowImean?
Niggaz comin' sideways thinkin' stuff is sweet man
Yknahmean?
Niggaz don't understand the four devils:
Lust... Envy... Hate... Jealousy
Wicked niggaz man
(AZ the Visualiza)
Yo, sit back relax catchin contacts, sip your cog-nac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack, a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines, and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who pull the late, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break, undress 'em tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettucini Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black
(Cormega)
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die - he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin, they found his head on
The couch with his dick in his mouth, I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up on your heater all your cream go betweeen us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with, niggaz that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream, and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggaz to fiends
U-Conn's and ninja black Lexus, 'Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it
(Nas)
Yo, my mind is seein through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sippin on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickenin, he just finished biddin upstate
And now the projects, is talkin' that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke, know how to expand coke, and Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
""Life's a Bitch,"" but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meetin Foxy at Demars
Movin cars, your top papi Senor Escobar
(Foxy Brown)
In the black Camaro
Firm deep all my niggaz hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel, I got visions of multimillions
In the biggest bundle, in the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
He money bags got Moet, (Sean Don)
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team we shittin hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega, and Escobar
I keep a fat marquis piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Hebrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the 'Bridge
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh!
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggaz in Marcy
The Gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Papa Chula spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed wit leak that's pure though
Flippin the bigger picture, the bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper, he had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait it's half and half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half, get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen, now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred, cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three, we got three quarters of another key
The Firm baby, volume one uh..."

(Foxy Brown)
Protect this nigga for the necklace
I though of the death wish
The pretty slim sex shit the rep this
Remember Fox said this
We on some neck shit, we blessed this
The scars on our back, we met this
The live form, the 25 sentence to keep my eyes on 'em
I'm straight, knowing Allah shine on 'em
Shitty drugs and drama I present 3 pretty thugs in the dime mama
Feelin' the rest, its illa chest when booked through the kiss of death
It was over and we laid out
Chill I was hoping of the way he ate out
It was real, for real I was fuckin' with Mills and he was fragile
We wildin, the brown stallion, stay stallon
On the low foulin the whole Firm wildin
You lucked it, I know the trick bitch he fucked wit
On some duck shit, heard through the grave that she sucked it
Firm: Sos and Esco, mad loco, Fox and Mega for whatever
And through this cheddar, we going to stay family until we fry though
The fam will never split even if one of us die though
Along with our get-go, we gonna blaze bricko
Peeped the nana, sweet taboo the firm tattoo on the dada
Now tell me what crew hold it down like we do dada
(AZ)
Till the death of us murders moves pursue efflux
Ice necklace high price dress executives
Peep the grammar, slim built strong stamina
44 nickel plate long with the silencer
Play for keeps in the shut eyes, you stay sleep
Shit remain deep cause shells thrown at range jeep
Giuliani suite got all the kings going at creek
Devil light beers, now who left controllin the streets?
No intelligent, strictly slow niggaz mind we negligence
It's evident, past vest up, bring your residence
We often livin' heavy weight firm division
Mind, I check mine, eating swine cause my religion
You know the steeze, take game cock and squeeze
It's the prophecy, not the philosophy Socrates
Next up...
(Cormega:) {Yo I believe that's me}
Aiiyo Mega represent for the family
(Cormega)
Aiyo, the feds got me in the top 10
'Cause when my crew I got knocked in
My 4-4 main cocked in
My sinister mind shines like dillenger
Mega exhausted baby face crime emperor
Yo, life is based on poachers and grease
And peep the way drugs feed thug nigga sees
I seen niggaz light up, hand cuffed and tied up
Coke price rise when drugs supply dry up
The millennium drives up
Rims semi blind your eyes temporarily
Mind Mega be heavily arm for felonies
Shine you could never see, the next fat cat out NYC
It Was Written like, ghetto life hieroglyphics, livin'
Since my real niggaz bailed me out of prison
I'm not schemed cause the narcotics team in Queens
Have more dollars than the knowledge of fiends
My dreams is the legacy of Montana treasury
Fake thugs could even take slugs or bury me
(Nas)
To all thorough breads taking corners y'all need to join us
Firm most powerful nation of rap performers
High class, generals, confident paying loyals
Sweef as Oscar Delahoya green baret warriors
Face I peep like 'em like the J. Kennedy tape
In a new with dudes bustin' all in the face
Another word you see threw
My men build Sugar Hill from a sweet tooth
We all eat, 'cause I speak the truth and educated
Black youth's street diploma, teach Greeks and Romans
But the legacy was stolen, it's a Firm thing genuinely gleam
I wrote theme on how to sell millions
While y'all crabs mad at your promotion team
I roll with nicest, fox, the black ices, push your Benz without license
Gear, tight as bike clips, Nas got 19 wifees
7 shiesties, non of them pizies, 3 white meat under tight jeans
Wildin, big links is heavy like wink that you shoot on your pitbull neck
While feeding him raw steak, its court take, more cake
I take the crown of the so called king of the town and lock it down
(Outro: Jungle)
Yeah dunn, that shit dunn, y'all niggaz ripped that shit yo
Word is born, that's that real shit, for all y'all fake
Motherfuckers out there yo
That's how we do it from Queensbridge nigga, The Firm
What
This is Jungle, yo big Jungle boy what?
Y'all niggaz don't want it

Who you are, where you from...
This is... this is projects
I don't give a hell what you spit
Who you are, where you from
And who the hell you be gettin'
Urban wolves
Dream team baby
The sosa of the game has returned
Brooklyn
Black sopranos
Let's play
Nice and smooth, white knights, icey jewels
So cool, but the slightest shit ignite my fuels
Love it low, stay in mine, attach semi
'Cause its hard to enter rap just passin' by
XK8, it's all good, the next they hate
Was never the type of nigga that flexed his weight
See, frontin just ain't my forte, I'm all foreplay
Hoppin' out the porsche, drop products on graves
My slow grind story niggas cosign for me
Y'all slouch rappin' fake trash niggas' rhymes bore me
Adore me, respect niggas way before me
Since a shorty, in love wit big guns and orgies
Engaged to it, guzzlin' that beige fluid
Spazzin' like it's the music that made me do it
Move through it if you that thorough, I'm certified
Through the grapevine, I know that niggas heard I'm live
I don't give a hell what you spit
Who you are, where you from...
This is projects
I don't give a hell what you spit
Who you are, where you from
And who the hell you be gettin'
Look, look, I be postered up like I'm toasted up nice
Stop niggas from gettin' killed, broken up fights
Blunted at the park jams, opened up mics
Now its on us, in the ??? I focus on right
Its hardball, now niggas can't call foul
Y'all can't get wit me, I can't fall now
Immune to the murderous plots
Been about it way before niggas heard I was hot
Heavy jewels, the type to keep the herb in the sock
A fresh pair, and I fuck wit them Germans a lot
Let's play, pop bottles like its no tomorrow
Ricky Ricardo, the young black Leonardo
Part Spanish, my robe'll make the dark vanish
Too complicated for y'all 85's, don't understand it
Respect game, there's rules as a criminal
So recognize I'm a five star general
You touchin' who
Yo, yo, at time its hard illin', it kinda scars the feelings
But what y'all want from a game that's involved in millions
Cars, and chillin', sex wit' they broads, but villain
It could find a broke man, have him harm civilians
It's like a larson and razor blades but robbers spinnin'
Niggas runnin' from court tryna dodge they sentence
The odds is endless, moms can't calm the menace
It's like Saddam's in us, comin' fully armed for business
Chrome pubelies, smoke great, two tone seventies
Five miles on the same line, the zone is deadly
Hope heaven got a ghetto for us
In the hood, for the hustlers that bled before us
Weep slow, soak in, feel the Schweppervesence
Specialize foot notes for the adolescents
Locked in, there's beef in the game now
I know its deep but the streets know the name now
The war is on"

Who you are, where you from...
This is... this is projects
I don't give a hell what you spit
Who you are, where you from
And who the hell you be gettin'
Urban wolves
Dream team baby
The sosa of the game has returned
Brooklyn
Black sopranos
Let's play
Nice and smooth, white knights, icey jewels
So cool, but the slightest shit ignite my fuels
Love it low, stay in mine, attach semi
'Cause its hard to enter rap just passin' by
XK8, it's all good, the next they hate
Was never the type of nigga that flexed his weight
See, frontin just ain't my forte, I'm all foreplay
Hoppin' out the porsche, drop products on graves
My slow grind story niggas cosign for me
Y'all slouch rappin' fake trash niggas' rhymes bore me
Adore me, respect niggas way before me
Since a shorty, in love wit big guns and orgies
Engaged to it, guzzlin' that beige fluid
Spazzin' like it's the music that made me do it
Move through it if you that thorough, I'm certified
Through the grapevine, I know that niggas heard I'm live
I don't give a hell what you spit
Who you are, where you from...
This is projects
I don't give a hell what you spit
Who you are, where you from
And who the hell you be gettin'
Look, look, I be postered up like I'm toasted up nice
Stop niggas from gettin' killed, broken up fights
Blunted at the park jams, opened up mics
Now its on us, in the ??? I focus on right
Its hardball, now niggas can't call foul
Y'all can't get wit me, I can't fall now
Immune to the murderous plots
Been about it way before niggas heard I was hot
Heavy jewels, the type to keep the herb in the sock
A fresh pair, and I fuck wit them Germans a lot
Let's play, pop bottles like its no tomorrow
Ricky Ricardo, the young black Leonardo
Part Spanish, my robe'll make the dark vanish
Too complicated for y'all 85's, don't understand it
Respect game, there's rules as a criminal
So recognize I'm a five star general
You touchin' who
Yo, yo, at time its hard illin', it kinda scars the feelings
But what y'all want from a game that's involved in millions
Cars, and chillin', sex wit' they broads, but villain
It could find a broke man, have him harm civilians
It's like a larson and razor blades but robbers spinnin'
Niggas runnin' from court tryna dodge they sentence
The odds is endless, moms can't calm the menace
It's like Saddam's in us, comin' fully armed for business
Chrome pubelies, smoke great, two tone seventies
Five miles on the same line, the zone is deadly
Hope heaven got a ghetto for us

Realism of life in actuality
Uh huh,
Yeah
I wanna tell you
Uh huh
Fuck who's the baddest, only the real could relate
Bigboys,
Nothing changed, they know
The Players of the game
Realism of life in actually
The Pioneers
I wanna tell you
This is the essence right here
Fuck who's the baddest, only the real could relate
AZiatic,
Nothing changed, they know
I rep pure realness younahmean?
I wanna tell you
For the deceased, and those still carrying the torch
Hold your head though, ya heard?
Once again
I wanna tell you
Realism of life in actuality
I wanna tell you
Fuck who's the baddest, only the real could relate
Nothing changed, they know
Realism of life in actually
I know, it get kinda hard sometimes
We all looking for some kind of, outlet
To plug into, but ah,
From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
Every hood
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
It's on you
All the haters wanna see,
Uh uhn
A niggas life in misery
Uh uhn
But I'ma keep on doing me, till I die
Handcuffed by the wrist and tied in the feet, so stressed
Wish that I could die in my sleep
And Lord knows, through his grace I done tried it wit peace
But it's like niggas ain't happy till they find me deceased
Feel the grief, of a street, nigga that turned to rap
And just applied Everything that he learned from crack
I'm in now, it's life ain't no turning back, it been foul
So what kinda concerns is that
Peep the signs of the eyes 'cause it tell it all
One of the few in the Streets that was selling it raw
Made mistakes, but it made me intelligent more
And how I move, you could still look and tell I was poor
How can the hate from another man stop my flow
That's like another pimp thinking he can knock my hoe
I'm here now, just trying to copp and blow, couple of cars and lot's of Doe
From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'ma keep on doing me, till I die
One by one, seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall, you seen one nigga ball
You done seen 'em all
Even standup niggas seen 'em lean and crawl
What makes a man wanna fiend for more
Life itself is more than a trial or a quest
Intelligent wise, it's like I done ran with the best
And very rarely, you can catch me casually - dressed
I'm more relaxed in a hat and some sweats
Doing me, been amongst some of the street's most strongest men
Around for months then they gone again
Incarcerated, penalized for the love of they acts
Criminals, cold-hearted, now what's fucing wit that?
Where we at? hit inside of a life that's rarely exposed
Spoken in codes for the killers that daily'll dose
Get yours, hit a quota then get indoors, get legit
Then hit them stores
From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'ma keep on doing me, till I die
So now it's on y'all, could see, I figured it out
Only a few could say that they been in my house
And caroused at my wall color, blend with my couch
I'm as low as you can go in the south
When it's too deep, it's hard for the mind to relate
Some say I'm too street and way too involved wit the snakes
What make a man bigger that life, I'm twice his age
Understand I'm a sinner but I'm nice some ways
Knee deep in what I speak 'cause I spit the truth
I become angelic when I sit in the booth
Just a thought of all the ill shit that lurk in streets
How can another real nigga wanna work wit police
Bad enough you got thiefs and the beef is rough
I took an oath just to smoke, eat, sleep and fuck
Knowledge of self, I'ma do this regardless of wealth
Regardless of how the deck and how the cards get dealth
From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'ma keep on doing me, till I die"

Nah, it's time to go to...
C'mon listen...
What happened?
I went to school today I said AZ's my daddy, they said, ""Jay-Z? Nas?""
What, what?
Tell me the story again?
Ok, ok.
Aight, this is how it went down...
We talkin' a few years before you even appeared
I was into my little gear, yeah
Weed and my beer
Hustlin out of fear, fear of bein' a square
Like them cowards with no gear
They just breathin' the air, son
Clear, but didn't realize life ain't fair
With one drive-by, it could end your life right there
Though I'm a fly guy from ????
My knife's like chyeah
Fuck the world we can fight right
I don't scare
From beer
No more nightmares here
Not a tear
I was strighter than the white man's hair
Met Nasir, had that hype that jeer
Like a kite, threw me a mic
I took flight right there
That ain't lies I was nice I swear
Went fool with the jewels, even iced my ears
New school, I was cool, wanted righteous wears
But from the door they didn't like that there, I ain't care
As long as I left the china white right there
And understood that you could change a life through prayer
It's all good
Police even politely stared
Was unreal, but still now it feels slightly weird
I was spared
Gave love, taught my peers
Though it was buff, never gave up, fought my fears
Now it's like ""what?""
I'm G'ed up, awesome blair
Entertainer from the streets with a sportsman's flair
Yeah, that's good enough for you?
Dad, Dad, what's ""G'ed up?""
Listen man, don't worry about that now, just go to sleep
Ok, ok.
I'll tell you that later on. But you know what?
What, what what?
I got one more quick story to tell you.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Maybe you could take this story, and tell your friends at school this one:
Heeeeere we go!
Out the gate, he who hate himself ain't straight
He a snake, he the type who send himself upstate
Catch a case for a plate
He ainn't have to take, he coulda
Played it safe, said his grace and ate
But it's fate

Betcha don't know what's goin' on
If you don't know, we're gonna show you, ooh
It's on now, New Year, pop the pain
Sun blaze through the grey cloud, stop the rain
Shear shirts by Chanel, baby, feel the breeze
Drop top, me and shorty, while she be at my knees
Let the wind blow, low fade, peep the glow
Know my style from the foul days, keep it low
Got new plans, worldwide, livin' the life
Any chick I make wife gon' shiver tonight
Know the game, it's ups and downs learnin the ropes
26 years of age, just learnin to cope
Came a long way but still got so far to go
So by now, I guess you know, talk to me
What if we all had minds alike? Thought the same
Only few was taught to get this, divorce the game
Visualized as a young cat, saw the dream
Get large, shit hard, and assorted CREAM
So many came that I saw and went wise on my ways
Made livin' for me more intense, divided my days
Weekends, party nights, raffled the stakes
Love sophisticated women, those that rather you wait
Tipped it off from the finest juice to 90 proof
Rocked it all, from designer suits to climbin boots
All in the summertime, workin the courts
Lookin' mommy wit them thick legs, hurtin' them shorts
So many ladies in the world today searchin for mates
Got these non-players perpin for dates, hold up
Give me love if you've got it in ya, hot as Virginia
Hot enough for me to slide this up in ya
Got the solar, Nat King Cole in his prime
So behold that, shoes unfold in each rhyme
Move accordin like the Chosen Ones roamin the Earth
Gettin' head until I'm dead, decompose in the dirt
Play the same spot, bitch cast, lost it all
Rollin' dice and G you're better, now you forced to ball
Havin' fun at the main event, toastin cups
Quarter pieces tryin' to get yours roastin up
Play the game if you got toys to match your words
You a vet, throw your net, nigga, catch some birds
Only a few left, still sincere, spread love
Thank God, it's a heaven above, talk to me

Even after Remi still seems I'm sober
My cream got lower them things got colder
Ever since the last thing I caught in October
June's now here move around where
Parts of D.C what y'all doin' down there
Dough gotta get flipped who gotta get hit
Got a lot of work can't let shit sit
I know down there it's slow down there
Everything's double I can blow down there
Next flight out I'ma jet right out
Got the white floating on the 95 south
See y'all soon it'll be around noon
And y'all know a nigga style I'ma leave y'all room
Dressed in old clothes step on no toes
Money over bitches sexxin no hoes
It's shit like that'll make you slip like that
Crossed all up and get you hit like that
The game ain't fair names ain't clear
Everybody wanna hustle it's a shame I swear
Bodies Gotta get caught (Niggas gotta die)
Everybody wanna shit talk (Why niggas gotta lie?)
Somebody gotta get scorched (Niggas gone fry)
It's time niggas get taught (Stop gettin' high)
Ain't no rules no more nobody's cool no more
But I ain't never give a fuck so screw y'all all
Love to ball since school got moves and all
Sweet J's three play I abuse the floor
And there's certain niggas now I refuse to call
Swtiching up on the cards only confused them all
You got blocks go head move that wall
Like to break shit down I give 'em two for four
I'ma get my run few trips I'm done
Wanna fuck but the work can't mix wit fun
See the shit don't stop till I'm sittin' on top
And ain't nuttin like floating through picking up knots
Y'all know that vibe a nigga's soul done died
Play the board till the lord above close my eyes
It's real like that why I feel like that
Couldn't understand till I had to conceal a ghat
But SOS don't play it goes both ways
And we love hittin corners just like roach spray
So if you love yourself you won't cross my path
I gasoline niggas up and torch they ass
40 yards from the field goal caught the pass
While you fumble shit knocked off half ya stash
Had to be your work I see your hurt
But any fool on the street gotta eat first
I earned that right I've turnt out nights
Just now taking time out to learn about life
It's more wise to it like why did I do it
Why if I do it y'all would die if I use it"

Who planned it? I guess they panicked, 'cause they left him in Boston
He died... for a pie, identified by his porcelains
It's caution, Unc just got a chunk of some fortune
Bossin, I guess the paper supportin extortin
Tossin it to them dealers, takin' it like Lakers did Portland
Cases is costin, so faces wont make it for talkin'
It's basics, they mistake once they replace it for flossin
It soften, never high when dividin my portion
Why forever fly till I die, dry from exhaustion
Move accordin, like they keys on a organ
No sneezin or coffin, I weeze when I'm walkin', indeed
We under siege from those D's 'cause they stalkin
Cars is auctioned, homes is seized
OG's extortin the seeds, now it's the new breed absorbin
The names is changed, the games the same
It's playin' fair, but years of Nightmares, like Dana Dane
It ain't clear, but I'm right here still and sayin' the same
Refusin to shed a tear, tho the pain done came
Provin I played the game, from cocain to fame
From rope chains, gazelli frames, I remain to blame
It's deep, but never speak certain names in vein
I know beef, and when it peak, it can strain the brain
No police, its just creep creep, bang for bang
No grief, brothers deceased, others arraigned and hang
None of us just eatin, maintain the strains

Way when Rakim was knockin'
Streets was what it was when, thugs was thugs and
Gun wars galore goin' slug for slug and
Jewels drugs and all, niggaz love is love

Stole this lady I, drove her crazy
You ask me why cause her man tried to play me
So V low quickly and, you better hit me while

Steppin with double-oh-seven better make it snappy

No cases pendin though I got dawgs in prison
Reckless livin' though, rest is like the Mets in them extra innings

I got a look like Tevin Campbell
But still I gamble, hustle and scramble
Cause money is muscles in this damn zoo
And in order to make it, you gotta take it
Be the boom blast booze bend or break it but don't fake it
That's why there's no guilt for these trife niggas bloods I spilt
Took what they built, flippin they drug game on tilt

You either sell it, smoke it, shoot up or snort
Either way you're caught

Cause all my peeps be playin' for keeps
Straight out the litter, so bitter
These bandits don't even need sweets

Havin' hoes playin' me closer, sexin on a silk sofa
Livin' the life of the rich and trife
Rugged but sharp like a kitchen knife
Without stress from some bitchin wife
What a life, that's why I be on what I be on
Always ready to war for a score that's sure to put me on
And until then, I won't seal in what I'm feelin'
It was inside that I cried, but now its spillin
I'm goin' all out, until I fallout; so much of a menace
When I finish milkin New York I'll have to fall out
On the run, 'cause I know feds'll try to knock me

It been foul so what kinda concerns is that
Peep the signs of the eyes 'cause it tell it all
One of the few in the streets that was selling it raw
Made mistakes, but it made me intelligent more
And how I move, you could still look and tell I was poor
How can the hate from another man stop my flow
That's like another pimp thinking he can knock my hoe
I'm here now, just trying to copp and blow
Couple of cars and lot's of doe
From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'ma keep on doing me, till I die
One by one, seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall
You seen one nigga ball, you done seen 'em all
Even standup niggas seen 'em lean and crawl
What makes a man wanna fiend for more
Life itself is more than a trial or a quest
Intelligent wise, it's like I done ran with the best
And very rarely, you can catch me casually dressed
I'm more relaxed in a hat and some sweats
Doing me, been amongst some of the street's most strongest men
Around for months then they gone again
Incarcerated, penalized for the love of they acts
Criminals, cold-hearted, now what's fucing wit that?
Where we at? hit inside of a life that's rarely exposed
Spoken in codes for the killers that daily'll dose
Get yours, hit a quota then get indoors
Get legit then get them stores
From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'ma keep on doing me, till I die
So now it's on y'all, could see, I done figured it out
Only a few could say that they been in my house
And caroused at my wall color, blend with my couch
I'm as low as you can go in the south
When it's too deep, it's hard for the mind to relate
Some say I'm too street and way too involved wit the snakes
What make a man bigger that life, I'm twice his age
Understand I'm a sinner but I'm nice some ways
Knee-deep in what I speak 'cause I spit the truth
I become angelic when I sit in the booth
Just a thought of all the ill shit that lurk in streets
How can another real nigga wanna work wit police
Bad enough you got thiefs and the beef is rough
I took an oath just to smoke, eat, sleep and fuck
Knowledge of self, I'ma do this regardless of wealth
Regardless of how the deck and how the cards get dealth
From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'ma keep on doing me, till I die"

Cross! Angry! (Yeah!)

If you Crip get your Crip on sip get your piff on

Never riff see me fixin on my lip balm
Chip charm chillin' with them Gucci kicks on
But like the Kiss song niggaz get shit wrong
To a bliss fully flipped and they gettin' pissed on
Life ain't a sitcom gotta keep your wisk on
Shit niggaz bitch other snitch like Nick Bonds
Pick chrones pick 'em up switch pawns
Pick 'em up get 'em tuck get gone see it's on
Some got warned got laid got torned
Got shot got saved got mourned
(Chorus: Bounty Killer)
War dem want with us, why they come start it up
We know they won't give up, when they gone bite the dust
They are envious, so our guns we buss
In the lord we trust, war they wantin
(Verse 2: Bounty Killer)
Yo! Who now piggy gone a yuh a mystery

Gunshot a mek di fassy speak inna gypsy
From Brooklyn to Poughkeepsie, cross

War dem want with us, why they come start it up
We know they won't give up, when they gone bite the dust
They are envious, so our guns we buss
In the lord we trust, war they wantin
(Verse 3: AZ)
I'm cool with them Pirus cool with them die moves
Any death this way niggaz a die too
Cry who y'all won't do me like Ja Rule
Jewels all sky blue smooth since High School
Fuck with a why do with me it's why who
You sneeze you liable to leave we hostle
You apostle, son of pop duke
Cop cruise to move to top roof
Got loose and left them high stoops
The rest is my new respect to my troops
Give me boose some juice some grey Goose
And word to Jesus it's back to Beirut
(Chorus: Bounty Killer)
War dem want with us, why they come start it up
We know they won't give up, when they gone bite the dust
They are envious, so our guns we buss
In the lord we trust, war they wantin"

Any stagnation, I rise beyond
Get it right, understand ma, ties are strong
From the streets where it all started, back in school
To the dough stacks, and nigga start actin' fool
Who's be the loud type and like to flash the jewels
Hit something nice then broadcast the news,
Facts and weed, this slow track that we
Did it all in the hood, had to leave
Asthmatic, guess I had to breathe
Short nigga wait up, suppose to grab the 'vees
Blasted for few winters, rejuvenated
Return like you remembered, but more swifter
Stronger than your malt liquor,
Money, hoes and clothes, don't let them hoes get cha,

If you lie, that's the only way I let you inside
Drop them or not, probably for the love of the block
See me solo in a photo, hands under my cock
For face, the white clock and tainted shades
Take for fake, got a face that just say for raise
Get in the mix, sittin' up in cinema six,
Multi-complex, go before the end of the flick

So I won't stop till I'm sittin' on top,
To every home phones and cells get blocked,

Wait till the lord they don't hit us,
I'm so iffy, keep the 'dro sticky

Bring some cups in the clubs and toast with me,
So small crispy, man I flow sippy
And the last Griffin, play chef in the kitchen
Back shots, ass in the air, best position

Anyway, the food will be ready in 20 minutes
Peace Allah, hope tha scribe reach ya hands in good health
As for self, no sense of worrying my cards been dealt
Sunk in a cell, fishscale, fifth year of my bid
Finally got a chance recent to connect with my kids
It's kinda hard through carelessness I scared they moms
And temporary I was barred voluntary the bond
Nevertheless, it's issues I need to address
Pertaining the certain statements that made me confess
Faced with life, it bites when reality hit
And wit crime come a lot of technicality shit
Through many co-defendants conspiracies linking
Like the court system designed to keep the mind from thinking
Fog ya vision, guess it's just the odds of living
But like me, most great men became god in prison
Since Illmatic, first heard ya bars of life
I was up in Cansaki, *****s started to fight
You touched souls to a lost population of men
And no doubt, if ever out they'll never lock me again
Faced wit 10 on state time, wit life on the back
It's fucked up when your own folks ain't writing you back
Learn to relax, spoke wit certain cats that helped adapt
You know the streets to the pen it's kinda hard to transact
All the cars and the pretty women, condos,
The clothes and the city living
I seen division, breakdown of the population
It's either submit, death or incarceration I felt the combination
Torn between reality rap and the fakes
Some do it for the salary cap few relate
And been through what I been through at least in fraction
So when they spit you could feel the passion I see you maxin'
That Nas and that Jigga riff started some shit
It departed the prison system we should argue a bit
It's a glimpse of what's to come
The past follow, hold the voice just hunger me holdin' my last bottle
I live like that of a star without the title, I had to write you
It's beyond trying to enlight you
It's a token of appreciation for being that poet with no abbreviations
Much respect from us all wish you much success
Get yours take money nigga fuck the rest I'm signing off
And leave in the way that I greet and say peace
Keep in mind always rep the streets, you that nigga.

Got a few more

All right, gimme a minute

Oh shortie from Nashville, all right lemme see this
AZ, this is Camille since Sugarhill been a fan
And since then to me you still a man
A real card player rarely reveals his hand
And sincerely, I could say the hood feel ya jam
I sit and listen to your last edition
Washing dishes in the kitchen
Or twisting the baby dreads on little Christian
It's so sickening his father we both miss him
He was killed in a '99 car collision
I guess the best ones God get them the tar sniff 'em
It's just the way it is in this bizarre system
You remind me of his one concerning words when you speak
You and him both got that funny type of slur in y'all speech
At night it's like his face just emerge in my sleep
I smoke herb so that grief can stop disturbing my peace
My life's deep, it coincide with the way that you rap
I hate it when them commentators say that you back
You never left you was always years ahead of the rest
My baby-father even felt your style he say you was best
How you dress how you move when you in the public
Without a lot of luggage gotta love it that's how you thug it...

Hustler or rap nigga toured on both sides
It's all the same, spot game do a close die
Won't close shop until mother-fuckers know tie
Recognize prepare for the second rise

So pay homage, relate like the Masonic
Knowing no man ever really escaped bondage
We all trapped, don I started all of that
Jewels and bottles, y'all bums y'all need to fall back
Y'all all birds, speaking using wrong words
Fuck a woofer, this winter I'm rocking long furs

Bongs to breathe through my first time was preeschool
Get high, Get fly, Get lye

Automatics love to tug those back
Snubnoses for my hoes that pack
Big toys like them boys in Iraq

I got it for the spring, the summer, the winter, fall

Tims and hoodies just for war
Suits and hardbottoms respect no law
Open in the mall the first time I Balled
I got chicks that's all thick and in shape, and love it
Flicks and videos, shit, I does it
Some that cry, cum, and some that's rugged
One that's sprung when she done she hum it
One home body and one I run with
Ménage, massage, and word to God
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

I got cribs in the suburbs, the hood, and the city
A low crib with the wiz that's pretty
A crew crib where niggas bring biddies
A crib out mid, that's hid like Diddy's
A tropic spot out in the Caymans
A Cali spot the first time I copped
I got love for thugs and hustlers period
Hate for snakes I take that serious
Respect for ballers and those that stack
Appreciation for broads with back
Death for losers that snitch and tell
My homie homes first day on bail
I got 5 albums out 4 to go

Gimme, just gimme, for the NYC
Gimme what you can't get back
Gimme, why don't you gimme the world
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five burroughs
Verse 1: AZ
Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money-gettin' niggas
Need my assistance to stock figures, beyond non-existence
Fuck keepin' my distance, 'cause bein poor produced persistence
Plus plea's, a hundred G's, I had me blockin out of jail centres
I'm recognised by the illest of individuals
Killers and criminals, even willies that's really into jewels
But still sceptic on who I cling to
'Cause every single nigga that swing through, ain't my man just 'cause we mingle
To mistake shit, even females be feedin off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high hopes help me escape it
Temporarily the window world, don't read the wise
Verbally nourish me, properly with that inner city, urban GC
I fucked with those beyond my age bracket
'Cause they analyse and mack to get the papers and stack it
Leavin' no trace to track it, keep on thinkin' tappers is accurate
That mack shit, livin' the lifestyle, we filled with black wit
Chorus: Nas, (AZ)
Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (Rollin' trees, stackin G's)
Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin' wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five burroughs
Verse 2: AZ
So in God I trust, I lust for a 850-deluxe
And in too, I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss
Diamonds and double-digits, Gianni Versace down with lizards
It's realism so I visualisin to live it
Movin cleverly wit intentions of longevity
Strong pedigree got me touchin papers, others would never see, G
So do the crest in my claw, flourescents
Symbolises the essence, you're sailin in a sweppervescence

Gimme, just gimme, for the NYC
Gimme what you can't get back
Gimme, why don't you gimme the world
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five burroughs
Verse 1: AZ
Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money-gettin' niggas
Need my assistance to stock figures, beyond non-existence
Fuck keepin' my distance, 'cause bein poor produced persistence
Plus plea's, a hundred G's, I had me blockin out of jail centres
I'm recognised by the illest of individuals
Killers and criminals, even willies that's really into jewels
But still sceptic on who I cling to
'Cause every single nigga that swing through, ain't my man just 'cause we mingle
To mistake shit, even females be feedin off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high hopes help me escape it
Temporarily the window world, don't read the wise
Verbally nourish me, properly with that inner city, urban GC
I fucked with those beyond my age bracket
'Cause they analyse and mack to get the papers and stack it
Leavin' no trace to track it, keep on thinkin' tappers is accurate
That mack shit, livin' the lifestyle, we filled with black wit
Chorus: Nas, (AZ)

Verse 2: AZ
So in God I trust, I lust for a 850-deluxe
And in too, I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss
Diamonds and double-digits, Gianni Versace down with lizards
It's realism so I visualisin to live it
Movin cleverly wit intentions of longevity
Strong pedigree got me touchin papers, others would never see, G
So do the crest in my claw, flourescents
Symbolises the essence, you're sailin in a sweppervescence

They had you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enormous

We surfaced consumer's pre-purchase
Guess who's back on the charts and he's nervous
Elite service, amongst men that beat murders
Fish-fillet lover, brother, don't eat burgers
Rap slowest, those that hold the gats know this
Biblical facts I'm about to re-enact Moses
Uh huh
Misery's back, I'm calligraphy on niggery tracks
Epidemy, it's seems like most consider me that, literally
It's like wizardry with me and the raps
And getting rid of me, somebody's insecurity lacks
Lucid, never biting or track boosting, it's too confusing
I supply what the fiends shooting
Front's is needed, I was once young and anemic
Till I found a few players to team with
When the song come on hands in the air (4x)
I'm like the spring in a .45 colt pistol
Know the initials I gleam like a coke crystal
With most fickle, too serious to joke with you
Weak lungs was too laid-back to blow whistles
Far away and two cellphones with calls waiting
Parlaying two red-bones and I'm more patient
Spreeing on the form's fragrance
Leaving stores on every floor evermore vacant
We all chasing the thoughts of assort places
Bringing serenity back from all the court cases
And lost races, chose to expose little
Rap rugal, cockback smack your screw's loose
Axe Noodles rose amongst who ever
A Jewel tellers smooth fellas
Elders schooled me to do better
When the song come on hands in the air (4x)
O's kept, dice out, no bets
Lights out, I'm a Vet, y'all no threat
Piped out, something stretch, it's cold sex
Nice house, run around, in old sweats
Can't see me, don't try it, can't be me
Won't tire, y'all cowards can't leave me
Locked in, flow-wise I'm top ten
Hop in, low-ride, I'm not him
Hold heavy, it's hot, hope glow's ready
So deadly, this is not Hov' and Kelly
We hog tie 'em, nothing's plated, dark iron
The god's rhyming, through the conduit the car's flying
Coke wit it, the doe did it, hoes get it
Unstable, still able to blow digits.

Invites only, don't tell no slouch
How you feel around some made cats, really on chill
Laidback with the Alize, merely's conceal
Conversatin' like some whore pimps caught in the mix
Wasn't taught shit stressed out supportin' your bitch
Let the eyes shine, easing my mind with white wine
It's your lifeline, sqeezing my nine the right time
'K imma floss life, feds almost bagged the guard twice
Bizarre nights move on the grace of a lost light
All them horney whites feeling like Christ with the army
Tight cons be writing all my life
It's based upon on how you burning incense
With intents to school the infants
The rules are different so for those that chose to listen
It's a dice game, never know, plans might change
Stay in your price range, far from the stress of night pains

Blowing through the sweet night breeze where ever life leads
Anything's better besides a tight squeeze, sliced cheese
Even my pieces put your nice V's dress precisely
Hoping soon will be the wifey, it's working well
Process words up in the pro's you sell, a urban hell
Playing park benches, burning L's
It's all basics, probation, open cases
We ill natured, being trained young from hatred
Trapped in the arms of Satan, congregatin'

My mind goes deep these cold streets rock a diamond chip, goutee
Trying to stay sane, amongst the madness and maintain
Though the game changed, the message evolved or made plain

Joint what's up?""
AZ - ""I'm sayin' there mad dime bitches up in here though.""
Guy- ""Let me tell you though, it ain't time to subtract and add on.""
Jackie- ""How you doin' AZ?""
AZ - ""Ooh you definitely thick no question.""
Jackie- ""Yeah, but it cost.""
Guy- ""Yo man give me change for a penny, I pay for that, I know who
You is Hoe Happy Jackie.""
AZ:
Whoever thought that, that sweet thing born model material
That hated hot cereal, could grow to be a high silly hoe
Really though it's a shame for this damn thing
'Cause everything's brand name
When will she get enough of these damn games?
Struttin' wit her unbuttoned blouse like it ain't nuttin'
Draggin' her wagon, knowin' fellas be flaggin' and frontin'
Hopin, by keepin' her gear, wear, & hair dope &
Some really Big Willie nigga'll dig her and get open
And give her what only a tenderoni would deserve
She got some nerve thinkin' every nigga's a herb
That goes around trickin' on every chicken that he's stickin'
Male of female, whoever cats that need and ass kickin'
'Cause if it's more than one fella tryin' to get wit her
To hell wit the fly, she only sliddin' wit the highest bidder
But if you aks me
She's nothin' but a nasty, money hungry, unclass, Hoe Happy Jackie
Guy- ""Yo, son word to mother, let's keep it real, that bitch ain't
Nothin' but poison man, every nigga that bitch fuck wit
Somethin' happen to, she see a pinky ring shine
She up in the nigga mug piece like he handlin'.""
AZ:
Check it, this one Jamaican wasn't fakin' wit the bacon
'Cause ever since him, she was on if I'm not mistaken
But then again, this money gettin' Dominican
Caught her when she was fallin' off, & made her win again
Now nothin' can stop it, once she in a nigga pocket
She be seein' more profit, than those livest weed spots get
Makin' her income and then some
'Cause even a weddin' band on her hand, won't stop a man who wanna spend
Some
Diamonds, & furs is all she want, that damned Glamour girl
Lovin' it, out there clubbin' it, dancin' like one of Hammer girls
Happy Jackie the jigga hoe
Her job is to jack niggas doe, I call Jackie the jack a nigga pro
And it's true, count all the fellas she flew through
She even juiced Jack the Jew
Jackie I'm scarred of you
& I remember that '87 September
When she was slima, she was a hoe hoppin' beginna
But now from acne, nappy hair, and gear that was tacky
She's on (She's on, she's on, she's on)
Jackie- ""Yo I got that sucka ass nigga.""
Girl - ""Ooh yes you do (I'm sayin' though what's his name?)
That's AZ from the Eastside. Girl you better work dat ass.""
Jackie- ""Is he trickin' boo?""

95 I'm gettin' it all
Girl - ""Yeah go ahead girl.""
AZ:
So all the sugar dick, dirty devil dog, slick daddies
Don't get out foxed, and slicked, and turn into a trick daddy
Trickin' ya whore, hustlin' end for some skins
'Cause next you be trickin' on all you family members and friends
She got a way to make ya feel like ya gotta stay in
It's not a way she'll pay, it's bills that she gotta pay
So married or single, watch out for Jackie when you jingle
She might sting you, and ain't no tellin' what that stinga bring you
You could fall off point and get careless
Lose all awareness, go hairless, why she wouldn't care if
You go bankrupt
Her lifestyle's corrupt
So knowledge before your wisdom of understandin' is fucked
'Cause if you ask me she's nothin' but a nasty
Money hungry, unclassy, Hoe Happy Jackie
Jackie- ""Yo what up AZ? We out?""

If it's on you it's all good.""

This is vintage
Allow me to vent
Street of course, gangsta because its necessary
Homie to homie
United we stand, divided we fall
Once divided, both got excited to ball
Plans on living major, no intentions to fall
And if indicted, guess the judge would be lynching us all
From breadcrumbs we made a loaf, it made us close
Champagne toast, our glasses to the game in our oath
But its funny, so many stories go untold
Until faced with incarceration and shit unfold
Was we ever friends or was we just chasing the win?
So many niggaz wanting paper just to make it and spend
Purchase jewels, get a whip, lace it with rims
Guess greed's the state of mind, must escape in the wind
Like so many plots, guns played a part in our feuds
For the fact nobody got shot, shit was excused
Guess it's all the game we go through in life sometimes
Win or lose, you pay dues in this life of crime
Made for thugs in the world of sex, money and drugs
Love is love, but live niggaz hold no grudge
(Someone talking)
What up son? We was gully from day one
If we had drama, both'll bust our gun
Feds came with 848's, it wasn't hard to find K-1
I was the pure mastermind of organized crime
(AZ)
I touched more than the average nigga's touched in this game
How many niggaz fucked stewardesses up in a plane?
Lived the best of worlds till the shit went foul
From rich to being fucked up and wondering how
Was it the, negativity all in my midst?
Getting sick of all the cars, bitches all on my dick
Guess that there was the living that burned me out
From the hoes, clothes and money rolls that turned me out
Paperchase, saw the whole shit explode in my face
Young hustler, with good intentions going to waste
Is the road that we all take, thinking its right?
Hypnotized by all the bright neon lights in the night
Fascinated by the pretty things and growing wealth
Can saturate the mindstate and make you go for self
Made for thugs in the world of sex, money and drugs
Love is love, but live niggaz hold no grudge
(Someone talking)
Y'all niggaz trying to shine
Back in the day, we was before our time
We had more determination on our mind
Than all the big niggaz in the Fed joint combined
Y'all need to wake and get this money
(AZ)
Was it all a dream? Sometimes I sit and I laugh
Was it for the cream we sit there, subtracting the math
Reminscing how we had it smashed, chopped it in half
First Lex coupe kitted, niggaz copped it and crashed
Moving fast, still kept the cops on our ass
Thank God for the radars on top of the dash
What a life, scrambling nights
Was it right, or was we just hustlers caught in the hype?
Poor or rich, I suggest niggaz never to flip
Its cheddar to get, today we get whatever and split
So till death do us, from O.D.-ing with the Tech shooters
To Lex Lugers in this game full of late doers
Made for thugs in this world of sex, money and drugs
Love is love, but live niggaz hold no grudge
(Someone talking)
I know the game is y'all fix
Rule number one, anything can happen in the mix
Real niggaz don't lie and real niggaz don't die
They get eye to eye and meet each other halfway across the sky
That's why we stand like we stand, talk like we talk, bop like we bop
Jump in the motherfucking Maybach, and hop like we hop
Know'm sayin'? We been doing this shit since British Walkers
Lees with the sown-in crease, ten thousand dollar Jesus piece
Rooftop of V.I.P., fondling Patrice
Whose that, whoever the champagne kings meet
Now y'all niggaz into rap and don't know how to act
Talking like y'all retarded, y'all niggaz wasn't getting G packs
You know about the real acts?

Lay it down if it's love then I'm outa town wit' 'em

Finesse, I move off the love of the sex
And if it's over you can bet my hands is huggin her neck
All the respect never one to try and spoil her rep
But if she stress gotta play the chick more to the left

I die black, we see you in Allah Kingdom you try that
Check the fly cat, 2 point 5 multiply that
Cash rules, on my arm I flash jewels, and tatoos
You can look, but don't touch we bad news
AZ: {Verse Two}
American Me, elgancy, treasury
Wit the hopes to be rich before the bury me
Born a Baptist, but moved on to higher practice
My fire ashes, only macks I interact wit
We all Dons, strong arm, all on calm
But if it's war we on, comin' for niggas who crossed me wrong
Select features, sit back connect the pieces
Inject the thesis, spoke to my pops and left him speechless
He saw me sprout, goin' through worlds that wore me out
Never call me out, bitches and money, that's what we all about
Through all the routes landed here, beach houses wit the chandaliere
Me and my crew, mad cans of beer
It's copin', live vibe, still eyes open, it's clear
Presidential Suites at the Tangiere
Nas:
How you livin' on your block?
AZ:
Mines is hot, how you livin' on your block?
Nas:
I got it locked, what's goin' down on your side, who got shot?
AZ:
Same shit dun
Nas:
Yeah, all right I'll meet you up top
AZ:
Yo it's hard to shake this feelin' that I might get knocked
Nas:
Dun you know it don't stop, we can't close up shop
AZ: {Verse Three}
VVSin', nuttin' less than how we steppin'
Coupes kidded, cuties wear the sleazy dress &
See me flexin' through the hood, d's be stressin'
Illegal search, tryin' to find weapons for gun possession
Never want for questions, every move made is destined
Black professors, let's take it back to the essence
Another version, of the Goldie, mack, pimp servin'
Convince the urban, project, ghetto prince emergin'
Half Hispanic, hollow tips, massive damage
The path was granted, loaded gats, blast the cannon
Chipped up, live by morals don't get it mixed up
Dis what?, millionaire strut, wit the Crist cup
Switched up, slow goin', gold showin'
Doe flowin', eyes don't lie, hoes knowin'
Main attraction, lace love in the latest fashion
Trained in mackin' never, rockin' Gators clashin'
Assorted wear, AZ, Firm extrordinaire
Make it more severe, lockin' shit down all this year
Nas: {Verse Four}
Nowhere to go from here, but the top of this sphere
Nuttin' stoppin' us here, we lockin' this here
Wit the black toaster by my hip bone, fuck a holster
See me at the Copa, platinum choka
The God's wit me, mad blunt smoke, it's hard to miss me
Pick one out of two dimes to twist me
New nines is crispy, mind on chips, rhyme on shit
That's strictly made for cats whose rich
Excuse me, is that your bitch in my 6
Turnin' up the volume when she hear my hits
On her wall mad flicks, now you want me blasted
But don't get it confused over this rap shit
Kinda laced, lookin' at diamonds in my onyx face
Oyster perpetual Roly wit the day and date
Y'all playa hate this
To fly for female singers who get face lifts
& Fake titties
We rule the world and take cities
I dreamed of this son
Happy we made it past the jakes, fakes
And fiends of the slum (Wor)

I didn't fall from heaven, I rose from hell
Bigboy, get bagged, he gon' hold my bail
It's like Attica '67 when they, closed the jail
Be careful, but promote yo'selves that's what they told me
Involved but unconcerned fuck beef when it dissolve it does not return
I don't leave, stagnate nor move off-beat
So discrete very rarely do I move on feet
I rough-ride twin rugers on the sides of my seats
Drive-by's, bodies left on both sides of the streets
I blacks out never blind by the size of the image
No disguise, homocide don't rely forensic
Homes's finished, scrambling caught in the scrimmage
12 shells ricocheting and it pours from the hemorrhage
Get the casket embalm and forget the bastard for moving backwards
New York's number one draft pick
I'm a hustler, not by choice (4x)
(Trav)
All this nigga know is, get money burn a lot of smokes
Lazy niggas was sleeping, I was wide awoke
Not a joke, creep on snitches, niggas gotta choke
When it's time to sleep with the fishes I supply the boat
And I swear it hurts, I supply the coke
'Cause don't nothing scare me worse than dying broke
Iron poking on my ribs while I'm laying in a Taurus
I live this shit y'all just performers, it's a dirty game
I seen thugs turn informers, crooked cops run in the crib, no warrants
Money talk though, never stuck in a grudge,
Got a female lawyer and she fucking the judge
I was once told, that you reap what you sow
And a, the scent of weed always seep in your clothes
And a, it's Quiet Money so we speaking in codes
Like, why should I trust ya?, nigga, I'm a hustler
I'm a hustler, not by choice (4x)
(Animal)
Unh, Yo, Jesus Christ yo, he just nice
Like a ginszu blade nigga, he just slice
And get y'all out the game, dog, it's not long
Anybody can spit, faggot, but can you make a hot song?
You're not wrong, like Biggie said you're dead wrong
Need to get your flow tight, gotta get your head strong
Watch us, the way we floss up in coat lockers
Walk right past security, flippin' poppers
Like what? who the fuck gon' stop us?
Y'all wait until the summer, when this fucking album drop us
I know y'all hate it, because y'all flows outdated
You finished as an artist and I finally made it
But I paid my dues, in this game patiently waited
Niggas ain't gimme shit, I had to take it
It's A dot, all year 'round I stay hot
Nigga I play not, ride through you're block in that grey drop
They call me headhunter, the head is all I aim for
The top spot nigga, what you think I came for?
These words touch you, cut you open like a chainsaw
And now you're your man is like, what y'all said his name for?

This here is classical
I'm a genius!
Allow me...
Scrilla rap spitter, silverback gorilla, mass killer
Heavy hoodie cow, hide, half chinchilla
Watch for scrilla's 'cause they hastle the dealers, for reala
Y'all little niggaz, me I lex and grilla, I'm chilla
Pillows of purple had to seal up my circle
It's serious, when your seralbello senses alert you
Pollack church shoes parolee homie's home on curfew
Who's commercial, I verbalize universal
Uniqueness, I'm nonchalant nigga no secrets
What ambiance never show weakness, control leakege
Live niggaz know I speak it
Verbalize outta eye, 'cause we cohesive
Flow's freakish
Dough is just honor the pieces to the puzzle
Like the streets always been to the struggle
I am the truth, truth
On a whole nother level
From the stone to the bezel
To the chrome on the metal
I zone for the ghetto's (Huh! Huh!)
I am the truth, truth
Every coast gotta know
I'm the most with the flow
No joke I'm a pro
I'm like the pope on the low
Soul music so intense so live
It's, no excuses y'all been so deprived
This is so exclusive and I'm so obliged
Certified superhero with no disguise
Force the vibe for the niggaz got tossed aside
And the misfortuned that lost they lives
I survive, I weave from side to side
No when to slide, stay hush, use my eyes to guide
I'm straight up
Too tough try hide my pride
Grew up amongst sky high homocide
Who am I besides homie that exposed to phoneys
The one and only still intact without the matrimony
Still on track I cock back and, black like Toby
Y'all bastards know me, no wolfpack attack for doly
I am the truth, truth
On a whole nother level
From the stone to the bezel

No joke I'm a pro
I'm like the pope on the low
Certified murder ties
Been in beef, burglarise
Been a beast, purchased pies
Hell heat, perfect size
Felt defeat, felt the rise
Seldom sleep, dealt with lies
Been Tel-Aviv through certain rides
Smelt police, I works with high
Hood legend, household name
Presence is felt, real niggaz vouch for my pain
Ahead of myself, what else is there about this game
The letters is spelt, so know when he drouch the same
Measure my wealth with realness, I know what's good
No mills missed, keep one foot in the hood
I still spit like a lot of niggaz wish they would
Can sell shit till I'm stiffed and shipped in wood
Misunderstood, mama's only son she's stressed to get it done
She knows I'm the last one left
I am the truth, truth
On a whole nother level
From the stone to the bezel
To the chrome on the metal
I zone for the ghetto's (Huh! Huh!)

White Denali, teared it up, flagrant rims

I hold heat, but no need to go in the deep
Don for real with the same gotti traumata pill
Von o niel, embraced by the arms of the ill
Art of war, a hundred men, cars galore
Wanted men, who couldn't see in robbin the law
Live or not, I'm one half divide the block

Been indited so watch, rhyme, pull on my trial
Blow with me, I'm like the life of that old 50
I dose quickly, moves is so shifty
Days been broke, on corners with them trays of coke
It was the dirty hustle money that raise my folks
Tights from jail, few niggas might see bail
It's kinda foul when you watch niggas wifies tell
Flip-on who?, I still wore wrist on blue
Y'all know my style, M.I.A. but I miss y'all too
Tryin' to remain breathin, hot blocks never change seasons
Bodies get caught for the strangest reasons
Breath the smoke, and time for me is need to coke
Won't stop till I stack it all and flee the coast

Niggas is sissies, I bought some men with me
Wait till the Heny' hit me, hope that sin lift me
Never smile, style is wild, only grin strictly
Your main supplier, for days in the same retier
Sat and watch niggas used to get it again and expire
Deep in thought, spit it like a street report
I rep alone still I stand without no feet support
Fuck the threats, I rip necks of suckin a tech
Either that or ice picks stuck in ya neck
I play different I put a work stay consistent
I love paper, plus a nigga praise commitment
Dead the jokes I'm near when the bread get boast

41,I Feel for You,1995,Doe or Die (1995),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,AZ,"Sketchy, witness the relentless, the manhunt is tensin
The Tek left behind was printless
Narcs and Homicide, Feds and armoured rides
Hell se-la-cia, I'm vest up, armed to die
Forever will, glock shots, shoots to kill
So what the deal? Violate, feel the steel
The cleverest, so whoever slips
I'm roamin and holdin', terrorists born wit dis, gettin' on wit dis
Makin' moves while you fake moves, you and your frontin crews
Dressed pawnin jewels, livin' in 6-2's
But now it's on, the end justifies the means
Lye smoke and CREAM, is all I fiend
It's in my genes, I float through the streets and seen
In a tinted European and 50 coupe, it's green
Nothin' in between, me and my team, we ill too
Respects due, oh I feel for you
We got this locked now, pure official, white crystal
The hypo get you before the snipe from the pistol
It's potent, just one whiff'll have you floatin
Hot and soakin, while I'm sellin, y'alls is smokin'
Forever shinin, but strictly through diamond's prominent
And dining with wealthy, old dime bitches rich as from cosignin
And Gold and American, Visa Charge-card, hold while I'm rollin'
Affliated with hoes that is just bonin
So knowledge me, and analyse all of my qualities
You've crossed all apologies, my lifetime policy
Plus playin' for keeps in these New York streets
It get deep so hold heat, and try and control your sleep
'Cause umm, the life I live is deeper than the Mississippi Rivers
Me and my niggas only drivin' what a ride give us
Puffin lye, gettin' high till we die
So fuck it, whatever nigga try, violate and fry"

Turn my mic up... let's do it, let's do it...
Spirit of Marcus Garvey, Farad Muhammad
Medgar Evers and Bob Marley, I'm God-Body
The scripture says Allah's inside me, show love
I was hugged by the arms of Gandhi, gave me my strength
You could tell somebody raised me with sense
We all need somethin' to help us through our daily events
Bear with me; the toughest niggaz tear quickly
No lie - pops still cry and he near fifty - freedom or death
I give niggaz a reason to sweat, there's no test
Verbally it's like I'm seen as the best, who wanna try me?
(Yeah, yeah-e-yeah... I'm back!)

Sent to express grace
Seperate the weaker niggaz is the best way, fuck how y'all feel
Y'all cowards now fuckin' with real
I return like McGrady got caught with a pill, let's get it poppin'
I move like a nigga coppin
I know the stress from the streets when I was diddy-boppin
Playin' the corners face to face with the faces of mourners
It's hard to trace the informers until it's too late, Jake rest on my corners
The focus is back, I play a part in this culture of rap
Bought some whips so I relate on how these vultures attack
Flippin and runnin', double-park, rippin up summons
How many niggaz hittin twin sisters and flippin they cousins?
Call it finesse, the game give it all I possess
Nothin' changed, I'ma ball to the death

(El Shaber)
Yeah, that's right
Show these cats how we do this here nigga
I'm like a, rose in the desert but how can one grow without rain?
How can one experience happiness without pain?
And how could I fall to the violence of hell and still remain sane?
And how could I still remain on top of my game?
When both the black and white devils seek the power to rebel
Seek to defy my radiance, I shift gears to another level
I'm focused, but it's like I'm playin' a cold hand of spades
I got a lot of hearts, but these fools tryin' to cut me
And I'm tired of these jokers
Vengeance is mine, I plague the whole planet with locusts
I survived the mayhem, my advantage I've been the brokest
I wasn't drugged and inhaled by all the smokers
Then I became the love absorbed by all the cultures
I can't trust women because my heart was scorned
It's hard to trust yo' comrades, when yo' heart was torn
One-nine-seven-oh the God was born...

I was hugged by the arms of Gandhi, gave me my strength
You could tell somebody raised me with sense
We all need somethin' to help us through our daily events
Bear with me; the toughest niggaz tear quickly
No lie - pops still cry and he near fifty - freedom or death

Laid up with this skinny chick, Balley's with the Henny mix
My man Bond sent me flicks, claimed he ain't seen me since
96, since he blew trial for them 3 attempts
Street events, Feds on the sweet, but you see me tense
Chill a lot, niggaz wanna know if I'm real or not, kill or not
If I'm holdin't what kind of steel I got
False alarms, tatoos all across my arms
Bail bonds, a while back almost lost my moms
Check that, taking this paper you can bet that
No set backs, shittin' on niggaz wit out the Exlax
Ice showin', Polo sweats all whit glowin'
Blunted, Suzuki 600, twelfth Riech's blowin'
Headline niggas, Fed time niggas, crime niggas
Street worth 9 figures
It's a war now, hard to the core for sure now
Raw style, four fours to your door now
Doe chasin', in the race niggas slow pacin'
Temptation, send a bitch to blow your face in
Plans rollin', handsome nigga's hands golden
Stand chosen, pockets on my pants swollen
Pleed the Fifth, real niggas don't need to riff
Automatic shit, for fakin' that's what you faggots get
(Verse Two)
Out of 30 men, know 20 that's worthy men
10 is friends, the other 10'd probably turn me in
Phone tapped, born in Brooklyn, hold my own gat
Unknown traps keep jail niggas goin' back
Time tickin', young shorty mind flippin'
Blind addiction turn a killer from a fine Christian
Streets ruined from sneaky shit niggas keep doin'
Snakes, that's why I hand shake and keep movin'
World supremest, cook Coke like a chemist
But it's finished, a little jail time helped me replenish
Thank God, almost bagged a rape charge in '86

He paid a heavenly price
By giving His life

I'm ready to go that distance
And God only knows when that might be
But oh, what joy waits up yonder
Once this old world sets me free
When there's no tomorrow
And glory has come down
Those without Jesus
Are lost and never to be found
So please listen when I'm talking
I'm just saying what needs to be said
Make plans while your still living

Ice the bracelet, 3 karats, custom made shit
Love or hate it, had two bitches playin' day shit
Kept a cheese line security, holdin' three nines
I'm tryin' to see mines, knowin' diesel's on the decline
Whip the work up, more than traffic, who's the first up?
See them young cats fuck wit that Crack, but be the first stuck
Too many on the same block, same talk
In fact they all probably cop from the same spot
I'm heavy in it, every car got the celli in it
Dash board Amor Alled up Cherry scented
Trees mixed wit it, different pagers every minute
Play the block smellin' easy miyach, I'm buried in it
It's boss playin', respect the lifestyle I'm portrayin'
Play the streets wit a freak up in my loft playin'

What nigga? Nine on the cut, shit is crispy
What makes a man? Most y'all niggas fakin' y'all hand
Wrong shit up in you cake mix takin' your grams
If you a hustla do it like the hustlas do
Clientel first before you try stretchin' your stew
Big boys play for large sums
Stack up, strategize, watch the cars come

Verse 1: AZ
Yo, blesses to the young ones trapped in the world
Never hate the next man that be tappin your girl
It's just a hype, shoot anythings a man vision through life
Help me to understand the chosen ones livin' through Christ
Blinded time from so many signs shown from greed
Tryin' to calculate all the funds I blown from weed
Started out just a young shorty, wakin' the rules
Turnin' out to be the wise, educatin the fools
So many lost in these last days, closed curtains
Tryin' to change from my past ways, I'm soul searchin
Diggin deep, tryin' to feel within, it's real ill
Takin' time just to chill with friends we still bill
Always told when I kick it with moms, to stay strong
Watch out for them bitches that's wicked, they play wrong
Keep your game strong, maintain yourself and live

Verse 2: AZ
You got to know when your end is near, I been there
Seen years disappear in thin air, nobody wins here
Swore on the population, we fightin blind
For sure, we need to stop the hatin', enlightin minds
Many die from a tragic death, in cold blood
Behoggin niggas lost or lack respect, show love
Sometime I wonder, was we ever free? High officials
They move so cleverly, don't ever sleep
Got my mind on the proverbs, ecclesiastics
These Bible words, so absurb, I read 'em backwards
They open doors, gave me a cause to stay swift
And reward, it gave me the sword to stay rich
Understandin is the best part, besides that
I fell-a off to a fresh start, no time to sidetrack
So much more still to come, it seems strange
I was much more iller young, but things change
Tryin' to grow old, so many sights to see
Told it never fold, just more righteously, you know?
Verse 3: AZ
I never knew any Bloods and Crips, but they exist
In New York, it's just thugs and clicks, we offer tips
Makin' moves, tryin' to stay afloat, it get deep
In these streets, you either stay or walk, or get beat
So strategise like the wise king, respect due
Brothers get high and let they mind scheme, I got Tek cool
In this world where so many stress, understand
Ain't nuttin left but the thoughts of death, we're sons of man
So off track it's a shame to see, it's open season
Got police movin dangerously, for no reason
Hopin soon we can all adapt, get wise
It build lies, it was all a trap, in disguise
Assassinated by my own kind, so why ask
Because blacks to have a closed mind, deal with facts
Keep your eyes open, never rock yourself to sleep
Love to the East, let the dead rest in peace
Outro: Monifa
We gotta do, what we gotta do
Brothers, sisters, you gotta wake up, you gotta wake up

Long cons, diamond rings and the kings that blow
To all the killas and the hustlas, some seem some low
What the deal daddy, it's all good, get that dough
'Cause a y'all, I praise clothes, jewels and cars
Paid dues, been schooled but can't remove the scars
Boxed in, it's my life now, part of the game
On the streets with the hustlas who hustle the same
Some of vein, let's toast to all the guns and the gangs
All the wheelchair victims and the one's with the cains
I'm numb to the pain, it's realness that runs through the vein
Becomin sane, so many throwin' slumb in the game
So let us toast to the ones in memory of
All the ??? jams we remember we love
We remember we thugs, ???, Crips and Bloods
Latin Kings, Five Percenters, thieves and pimps because
Whatever makes the world go 'round, we down
And we'll react as this world go 'round, we lounge
So raise your cups to the real dogs that raised the pups
And all the young chicks finally at that age to fuck
The razor cuts, gun wounds that laid us up
From the beef and all the streetsweaps that made us rough
Made some suck, some wasn't made to trust
So I toast to the east coast, the stage is us
Throw it up for the niggas that could, hold it up
Fold it up, if it's fast money, slow it up
The streets need it, it's gangsta when the beats get pleaded
Sleep, eat and breath it, it's the life, love it or leave it
To the playas and the hustlas, pimps and kings
Rich niggas sittin' on mils with ice in their rings
To the bitches and the real hoes, let's raise a toast
Show love, who could take paper the most
So from the streets where the hustlin brought us to life
From the beef and all the scufflin that tought us to fight
The poisinous bikes, police gun wars in the night
The whores in the night, fiends up four in the night
Gave us new style, but some just became too foul
Now it's two-thou', year two-thou'
So I toast to the live that know they broke
Cookin bag they own work and know they coke
Roll they smoke, the underworld that know they loc
It's the life when you catch strikes and hold no notes
Nothin' to lose for some that's all out for game
Fued in school, show us all out in vein
First chips niggas get, out comes the chain
That's it, soon his name be, out the game
It's the life, it's like dice, some win, some lose
We pay the price but it's the life that the real ones choose"

I'm numb to the pain, it's realness that runs through the vein
Becomin sane, so many throwin' slumb in the game
So let us toast to the ones in memory of
All the ??? jams we remember we love
We remember we thugs, ???, Crips and Bloods
Latin Kings, Five Percenters, thieves and pimps because
Whatever makes the world go 'round, we down
And we'll react as this world go 'round, we lounge
So raise your cups to the real dogs that raised the pups
And all the young chicks finally at that age to fuck
The razor cuts, gun wounds that laid us up
From the beef and all the streetsweaps that made us rough
Made some suck, some wasn't made to trust
So I toast to the east coast, the stage is us
Throw it up for the niggas that could, hold it up
Fold it up, if it's fast money, slow it up
The streets need it, it's gangsta when the beats get pleaded
Sleep, eat and breath it, it's the life, love it or leave it
To the playas and the hustlas, pimps and kings
Rich niggas sittin' on mils with ice in their rings
To the bitches and the real hoes, let's raise a toast
Show love, who could take paper the most
So from the streets where the hustlin brought us to life
From the beef and all the scufflin that tought us to fight
The poisinous bikes, police gun wars in the night
The whores in the night, fiends up four in the night
Gave us new style, but some just became too foul
Now it's two-thou', year two-thou'
So I toast to the live that know they broke
Cookin bag they own work and know they coke
Roll they smoke, the underworld that know they loc
It's the life when you catch strikes and hold no notes
Nothin' to lose for some that's all out for game
Fued in school, show us all out in vein
First chips niggas get, out comes the chain
That's it, soon his name be, out the game
It's the life, it's like dice, some win, some lose
We pay the price but it's the life that the real ones choose"

I wanna toast, on behalf of y'all
'Cause the more we get, the more we takin' from other people baby
Brooklyn!
Here's a toast to all the dons, dope fiends and hoes
Long cons, diamond rings and the kings that blow
To all the killas and the hustlas, some seem some low
What the deal daddy, it's all good, get that dough
'Cause a y'all, I praise clothes, jewels and cars
Paid dues, been schooled but can't remove the scars
Boxed in, it's my life now, part of the game
On the streets with the hustlas who hustle the same
Some of vein, let's toast to all the guns and the gangs
All the wheelchair victims and the one's with the cains
I'm numb to the pain, it's realness that runs through the vein
Becomin sane, so many throwin' slumb in the game

Yeah, poet, politician, playa when necessary
This is AZ
I'm your host for the evening
It's Magic Hour
How we gonna do this?
No stress, we on the sands in Tahiti
Bare chest, you pass this dirty gram on the pinky
Respect, finess movements like your hands in graffiti
Grey Goose, mixed with grape, cran and the kiwi
It's truth holds galore
Rolls go clothes galore; take paper till they close the door
Either or, corner hustle or hustle on tour
To seen it all, nothing left but to stumble no more
And the sex is fantasm
Flow, campaigns 'em
Dough, can't change 'em
Courts, can't arraign 'em
It's sports, Titanium quartz, Iranian taught,
I came in force, all the bangers is brought
Brought the bang at your fort, torch and tangle your thoughts,
Scorch and stand if you're short
So of course, just to chill and conversate, Mil- and Salaam-ulate
Millions I'm trying to chase illin' from out the gate
Get it right my feelin's is not awake
Ducatti bikes, shipped from out of state
The pressure is on, the blunts is lit
My presence is strong, it's real I'm amongst the mix
The Wesson is long, I move like I'm on some shit
So testin' is wrong cause once guns is drawn that's it
The beats the rap the game is done
We leave, we at, we smack, we bang them guns
We beat with bats, we scrap, we came, we come
So, peace to that he's back nigga one
(Talking: CL Smooth)
Yeah, Chairman of the Board, man
Black Leader, the Mecca Don
El Presidente,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
All I do is bring the life to a dead game the moment I came
Under my umbrella, my flag, my name
If the ship leaving the port, cruise to the resort
You can't be serious baby, this is sport
Gotta make my rounds, head wolf of this pack
Till it's me an A' steppin' out of both sides of that Maybach
We can eat lovely, just don't interrupt me
And mix all this checkmate with that quiet money
I can see it all bubblin' the move is no troublin'
I'm a give you the plug and the Sosa
They all love CL, no jail for homie
Only gotta tell me one time, Don't fuck me Tony
Just buy weight fly straight and keep me right
And I don't care what I spend on security
It helps me sleep at night
Scene of this sharp as me
You take it in air, you can't compare
To the initials engraved in my office chair
The boss is here, we deep in the game
You can't do it the same
You gotta bring a strong leash for your dame or pop up
Speaking of cheddar, me and son peak it together
Can't feel it's the real deal or let the meatballs meet the Baretta
Smellin' like fresh cut leather
Odd color called sarsaparilla
The curtain is drawn the seat's vanilla
Let him see heat forever
Taking that seat empowers
All you wantin' is Magic Hour"

Chop the pie up, four ways get light up
Infiltrate never violate get tight up

True lies wives guys bumped invest the game
Broke shit pop your broke you let your man get lock
I live this hip-hop, stop the bank let the crys pop
Beep the next shit, push a big Benz fuck a Lexus
The streets is too hectic so I stacked then made my exit
One dough to get focus my thoughts for me to go legit
Voracious shit, cop a huge cats who on a ocean cliff
Imagine that a few years back I was baggin cracks, magnet gats
Playin' street corners committin sabotage, twistin up
Nothin' but love for niggaz sittin' up
Hold your own try to comin' home without gettin' touched
Two for one laws made foul how they do the young
Was new to come try to tell shorty he should of threw the gun

We pop crys on the horizonin
Topless chicks with thick thighs'in

Temperature risin', Lo Huimin gave me the guidance
Told me to leave those 85's alone
Blend with the wise men, that bought 80 G stones
Twin Mercedes on home, fucka you spend 10 G alone on chrome
When I die take my chromosomes and clone clones
200 and 8 bones, microchip kids we most dominate
You know what time it is that's why I exist
Jump out a limo lands fire the place
Why scientist supplyin this violet then why this?
I'm survivin this quiet tribalness
Finalist year 2000 flyin the whips
9 cent, mind bent, 1999 rhyme align'meant

We went from arraignments to entertainment
24/7 after the same shit playin' the strip livin' dangerous
Bottle after bottle soon became obitual
The patterns we follow others found 'em difficult
I guess it's obvious as to what my hobby is
The ruler of all evil pollute same niggaz body kids gettin' caught up
The same gang that left more stuck
I reminisce on VS touchin my fourth cut
Me my only problem is I'm all fucked
Knowin' in my heart I can't sleep, till I bust off nuts
We religion for all my niggaz that beat the system
And those who bidden sittin' since Coneto vision
Y'all need to listen, it's journalistic
Y'all hear the whispers the niggaz in the Firm is twisted
Spit that fly shit that earn the bitches
Whip the chrome 6 up to FDR, its bless we are
See I never let them stress me God, forever stress-free
While twistin logs for that nestle
Who are you to question me?
It's just my destiny to kick back kill time and live successfully

I taught them logic gaining courses in college
Chased dollars but to me what's most important is knowledge
Know the ledge for y'all niggas that so on the edge
It ain't nothin' for an infrared to go in your head

I'm trying to eat don't have me put two in ya feet
99 ways I made out to never fade out never get played out
Got guns blast ya way out
Saw the worst when I was growing
Unknowing my quest until I had reality thrown at my chest
Why would it stress it seem a nigga zone at his best
Is it a test at times I feel my soul is possesed
Flavors of Guess throw key at major connects
Crazy respect goin' through it made me a vet
Gettin' down on grounds forbidden
Made bails from ?????? to the cells in Clinton listen
We could war till we no more either or
Or just ball till we all score it's on y'all
Did this one for the streets watchin
And the D's in the streets let them keep clockin
We clean got love for the whole game
To go change fake I.D.'s and the code names but no lames
3 op's and there's more to come we all as one
Recognize I been this raw since young
Was I sent for the sinners that never repent
Or just another thug bent trying to pay for his rent
Days in contempt I see how y'all amazed in suspense
Ways spent catch me at the major events
So blow a herb on ya corner curb my word
Doe or Die I was born a swerve bet that
From 40 bottles to the champagne twist a pop
White Lables to the brand names kids on top
And let's toast for the lost souls
And pray enough to hope and meet 'em at the crossroads reunite

Hung up my scuffed soldier boots I holds no gat
Gotta crew of 'lil homies for that... where the love at?
Still standin' I ain't strung on crack
Still handlin' like Pun on tracks

Street of Philly was born willy arms is chilly
Neck froze, fresh clothes, the specs is silly
A don for really, war like the lord Achilles
I'm too illy, worth more than half a billi
So please feel my I'm direct effect
And since a kid at fresh ? I've been fresh to death
You know what it is... ayo Fresh come on man, it's how we do it... let's resurrect the hood ya heard?
The coke game is a regular, the stacks uneven
Pimp game's still cellular, but rap I'm eatin'
Used to pitch packs in streets
Took it to the next level hard face watch made by Patti Philipe
Jars of dro the chalk just added to beef
Bars stay hot with raps that's grabbin the beats
Double nickel deep down in the bucket seats
Yatch match the Rolli, where my fuckin' freaks?
Flow fast and gawdy with chinchilla minx
Hoes trash they ? and can't barely?
Ma we can take it to another life level
Somethin' like whole diamond round ya ice bezel
I heard a few niggas hatin' on your nice fellow
But did they know your range cherry and ya ice yellow
I holla at you necessary when it's nice hello
It's Fresh, 50 bricks nigga on my grind level
Ayo A talk to these niggas... you know we poor but cop chilly wrists niggas... stackin chips niggas... and official hood figures
Been locked in since them wally moccassins and them drop top bm's
Y'all shoulda cock blocked me then
Now a dime later haters try 'n' box me in
But like Iverson I skip hop to the rim back spin whip wop fake cock it again
It's understood I'm the hood Hitchcock with a grin
Came in the spot wit 6 bad brawds, lift Jag doors
Never too gawdy but my wrist wrapped raw
Flip packs of raw, slick black valor
Reacquainted with rap now we rip half of these tours
Pull up at the summer league games Ashton Mar's
Hopped out the whip prada shit straps and all
The crack game is back so its fresh to ball
330 hard top cherry red bar watch
(?)
I handle pop niggas CL split top
So listen up to whos runnin' the game
You know its Fresh 50 bricks plus the shit on my chain
Polo mitts so sick they just stick in you're brain
(?)
And you could see Fresh livin' good enjoyin my health
Now we runnin' in the bars and we buyin the shelfs
M5 burn rubber we denyin the belts
Big bottles of that Don and we dyin' for help

That was lightning and rain drops
I'm tied up in the basement cocaine spot like Bangkok
I'm blindfold, Vietnam type mind control this torture

Says his attribute, was satanic, masonic, ironic

And winters, blinded till the flashlight enters

Scent of a rose on the graveyard for real now
The stakes is up a half a mil now
I tried to grab him with his shield down
Four walked in, they're crazy paid up
Sharp but straight up
Gators from Barbados, never seen nobody play those
Lay-Low's what they called him, his head baldin
Sippin cappucino, spilled on his silk suits, was scaldin
Laugh was vulgar, canvas paintings of the Isatollah
And on his arm he wore a priceless vulture
Tobacco pipe smoker, Escobar your life is over
Justify the righteous nova
Bullets flew out his right shoulder
Corpse leavin' a foul odor, The Firm Volume 1 adjourned
Bring it to a closure

So know the difference - from supreme solo

Crime invades the minds of youngsters
Where it's pitch black they can't see you
Godfather 3, fallin' for dead, in a cathedral

Now you're forced to listen
I got the mind of a grad from Princeton
Play your position, or soon you'll be lost and missin'
It's far from fiction
My presence is like that of a christian
With ammunition puttin' states under submission
Street addiction, got me tied in thorough with buroughs
Still in the ghetto, but in the cut where it's mellow

That was lightning and rain drops
I'm tied up in the basement cocaine spot like Bangkok
I'm blindfold, Vietnam type mind control this torture

Askin me, my atrophy stabbin me gradually
Says his attribute, was satanic, masonic, ironic
I felt reminded of my fast life ventures
And winters, blinded till the flashlight enters

Call connect get all the tech's
I'm vexed, this nigga soft as sex
Lost respect, let's off his neck
My calibre, got me thinkin' on a higher algebra

But you ain't got no style in ya
I'm into bigger cheddar, G's and better, Armarett-ah's
Armani sweaters, plus these crabs could never dead us

Scent of a rose on the graveyard for real now
The stakes is up a half a mil now
I tried to grab him with his shield down
Four walked in, they're crazy paid up
Sharp but straight up
Gators from Barbados, never seen nobody play those
Lay-Low's what they called him, his head baldin
Sippin cappucino, spilled on his silk suits, was scaldin
Laugh was vulgar, canvas paintings of the Isatollah
And on his arm he wore a priceless vulture
Tobacco pipe smoker, Escobar your life is over
Justify the righteous nova
Bullets flew out his right shoulder
Corpse leavin' a foul odor, The Firm Volume 1 adjourned
Bring it to a closure

So now you're rollin' wit us,
Like co-defendants, no phony business
So know the difference - from supreme solo
It's the styles ancient as Moses scriptures

Crime invades the minds of youngsters
Where it's pitch black they can't see you
Godfather 3, fallin' for dead, in a cathedral

Now you're forced to listen
I got the mind of a grad from Princeton
Play your position, or soon you'll be lost and missin'
It's far from fiction
My presence is like that of a christian
With ammunition puttin' states under submission
Street addiction, got me tied in thorough with buroughs
Still in the ghetto, but in the cut where it's mellow

You know the happenings, homies just yapping and
Hand shaking, laughing, and exchanging all they math again
You usually lose touch when you traveling
A few dudes bruise up in the batteling
Parked on Madison across from the Radison
We talked about the taddling some niggaz did in Maryland
Plus discussed, no homicides unraveling
I asked was he dabbling he laughed and said he managing
His Cardi frames was as clear as a camera lens
He hardly changed, I was near in comparison
We joked about how police choked him out
And he claimed as far as fame I had enough to bust in Operas mouth
In other words, I was up in clout
And from the curb I need to pull a Larry Bird fore I'm up and out
Without a sound, snatch my Guinness off the ground
Rose up, gave him a pound and told him, ""Homie, hold it down""
You know the game insane in the brain
Big thangs in the Range, real niggaz never change
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
So through the fame, through the fire and the flames
I adapt to the pain, real niggaz do the same
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
It was Tuesday when I saw him, figured Friday I could call him
Woke up early Wednesday morning, flew a chick in from New Orleans
She ain't that average bitch who be dogging for dick
You know them chicks that get you sick when they keep calling
Up in Nostrum's for a fresh pair of the Force 'em
Of course with footwear I be that first nigga that sport 'em
Caught 'em, before the salesmens even had time to assort 'em
Bought 'em, before any celeb stylist eva saw 'em
Warm soon as I copped 'em in the spot playing possum
Debating my destination, lacing, weighing my options
Celly started rocking, I answered, ""What's poppin'?""
They answered and said, ""They shot him, now the hood got a problem""
I had to swallow, reaching out for my water bottle
Tryin' to figure what nigga, why and by who, then
Before you know it, the other voice told it
It was homie from the old click I just seemed to spoke with
Oh shit, this can't be serious, that's my word, pssssh
It's Doe or Die, we survive till we slain
And it's no surprise, homie was prolly high when they came
I know the guy, he was fly, him and I was the same
A Gemini, with a status symbolized as his name
Godly trained, he could camoflague on any terrain
Cardi frames, we go back like bottles and James
It's a shame 'cause they say his baby mom is to blame
But nonchalantly I refrained 'cause it constantly changed
From close range, somebody please slowly explain
If they just wanted some jewels why didn't they go for the chain?
If they just wanted some news they coulda left him in his Hanes
But no, they just left a nigga breathless and banged"

Play the game for my people stay in charge of your dreams
Keep your vision focused, get wise, and largen your cream
Marketin' schemes, so many in the dark that's unseen
Caught inbetween, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be keen, from hustlin', supportin' them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rockin' birth stones, my first, get bent nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I realize I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish minds design tricks, leave you blind quick
Cause you to die behind shit, Math-e-matic
Master one twenty, I'm Asiatic
Amazed with magic, 'cause it's illusions that made me savage
Life change once you establish the right game
Love the night rain, found a new way to fight pain
Clocks never stop, It's all a race to the top

Protect your dome, I'm warning you, what harm I do to the kid
I have you on the floor with ya armor loose
Break the raw down and sign truces
Then switch the next muthafuckin' date, fuck all excuses

So every soldier that's armed, remind your general

Did ten hours long and try to wrap us up

Hopped out to get a dutch, but he left with his wig splitten

We runnin' with a hundred heats
When beef pop off, we ain't the one to speak
Dressed in all black, driving six feet hurses
With sixteen niggaz, dropping sixteen verses

Had to run astray, pack up and run away
Fountain of youth, found it, feel like da younger A
Make sure my son okay, shit, that's the da mission

Fuck if y'all don't like I'm here and I'm shown niceness
Appear in my own likeness, I zone as my own phychic
Flow if a niggas holding my clothing'll get you open

And ready like military I'm varied like Ben and Jerry's
Comparing me to him is scary I'm leery as cemeteries
And losing is not inside me stay moving from paparazzi

From snortin', my feelings is as cold as my chain

For the return, it's the second coming, left my woman

Fuck wit me niggas would be you breathless, leave you naked

At fifthteen my brother told me get them digits
Told me every penny count nigga hit them trinches
Don't floss to hard don't burn no riches
Don't trust no bitch if ya doe is heavy
And don't smoke with her if the blunt rolled already
No ass betting if you show it you betta blast it
Math class on the corner yeah I past it
Die right now take twenty from you bastards
Fuck it throw a fifth of henny in my casket
Never got my ass kicked, never had a pitbull
I just went to high school with the clip full
First nigga act get a clip full
Mama raised me but the streets made me
Rum got me hAZy chasing this cream
Fuck a dollar in a dream hundred grams and a thro team
And I'm gone make the block work
Sos reing me up got the hood on clockwork
Bedstuy nigga you know its on
Gotta flow so strong you could put it in a bomb
When I die I'm gone go in fashion, guns blasting
Cash inside coffins, Memories get lost when you die
The legacy is eye for an eye but overall I will survive nigga (2x)

Catch you why you copping at that weed spot

Where all the guns at
Where my shorties flip them ones at
That's where my son's at
You speak of war but you don't want that
I blew the timbs out and blow the GS wit the rims out
I air your bens out baby moms and her friend's out
I knock a lens out, I bring the boys and the mens out
I leave you lace up, you paralized from the waste up
I'll fuck your face up, when I finish tossing cakes up
I'm eating the kris up, I iced the finger, neck and wrist up
If it's a mix up, look at all the ones that I fix up
I mean I fucked up, fuck around you getting stuck up
Press ya luck up, back this motherfucking truck up
I'm bout to black out, it's up to me to close this track out
I pull the mack out, I blow your chest and your back out
And knock the glock out, air this whole fucking block out
I knock a cop out, fuck a high school drop out
Attempt murders, two to sixty on a cop out
I'm fucking with my nigga's up north on a lockout
The M A S A, You run your mouth we smack the taste out
We blow your face out, Pay the judge to throw the case out
Check the game and the cats that play in it
Quiet money youngest luetenit
Yeah world it's been a minute, I'm in it
To my heart stop or blood touch the concrete
Beyond deep, these streets got me gripping my heat
Losing sleep, breaking day sling crack to fiends
W.D. forty to sixty having backwards dreams
The cash the cream, from the cradle to the casket green
Got the game tied up we the nasties team
We flash we steam if its on then we mash your beam
Yellow tape the sidewalk and leave a nasty scene
Your back is spling ya brain, face and chest get sprayed
The desert the miss the spot when it bust your way
We touch we lay in the streets it's a must we play
We cook, we chop bust pots down and clust the way
From light to day its only right that we cock and spray
We speeding on could spot a snake from a block away

Verse 1: AZ
We was already loyal to people's minds and mulianis
Now we more fucked up with a mayor named Guliani
You can try to bomb me
Analyze but can't define me
My mind's divine heavily entwined with Gandhi's
Far from feeble, I leave your nostrils hard to breathe through
Cause my cerebral's are more of a higher plane
Than the Hebrews
My mic devotion brings out my deepest emotions
Overdosing wannabes posing
Sending them through convulsions
To hard to follow, you took a bite but couldn't swallow
Your mind's boggled
But I'm as deep as Donald Goines novels
My whole persona's kinda laid back like a recliner
And since my mama, I been fucking with marijuana
Wavy-haired, my skin got a money getting glare
Strictly menace wear, macking offa Guinness beer
So where it all begins is here

Brains give birth to thoughts in triplets
Fuck it I'm on some flip shit

I got styles sick as hell, sicker than sickle cell anemia
Slaughter your circulatory like lukemia
Filled with larceny, who want parts of me?
I'm vicious, mad malicious
'Cause it's real on this road to riches
I got this mastered, other rappers'll craft it
Weak and wicked camoflauged as killers
How they speak and kick it
Peep this uniqueness
Nonbelievers I'm leaving speechless
Left to chokers and skunk smoke
Was coming through the speakers
Surgically nice with any verbal device
Trife, breathing life into mics

Stress mics I blessed
Puffing trees to get me high as trapeze
Flipping Japanese at ease when I'm stacking G's

How the rhyme forces the source for thoughts that's lost
So don't cross cause it'll cost

For allowing me to have be on the Illmatic, and that Stillmatic Joint
Changed the game a whole lot, secondly I'd like to thank the Notorious B.I.G.
Who put Brooklyn on the map, you the revolution of that era
And all the artists that came after the era we started
I'd like to Thank the East Coast, West, the North, Dirty dirty
This is my story, welcome me back
For all those I still speak to guess we still peoples'
Life's more peaceful when you low and you eating legal
Certain niggas never spoke now it's peace to see you
It's a different side 'cause it's the streets too, pleased to meet you
Just think I was a thief and kieful
Sold coke even dabbled in a bit of diesel
Scare ridded saw the light and I slid wit it, left the life
But for the price I can live wit it we all pawn
Know a few niggas that's coming home
Could see 'em now in that '86 summer zone
Hope they adapt, whatever led niggas to smoking cracks
Knew a few that went too far for me to coach 'em back
What a waste, this little blood niggas'll cut ya face
Catching a case'll make you fuck around and touch your safe
This all I know, intelligence is all I show
I'm from the roots and the truth is that I love the doe, welcome me Back huh
You attract some of the baddest when you platinum status
That's why I stay with prophylactics after what happened to Magic
Six days of my creation had to relax on the Sabbath
Remember asking certain niggas to past me a package
I was blind moving ass backwards
But you can bet it was the grind that made the cash massive
Back on my feet, accapella used rap to no beats
On the run, dun, was the first one to clap at police
I ever saw, can never catch me in the presents of flaws
Push the Accord in '94, Mack11 in the board
Who wanna bring it? Since Nas, niggas swore I was Queensbridge
That's surprising from the wise I was taught to be lenient
Move in silence, my moms claimed my music was violent
Had to school her, let her know that I'm a user of talents
Many faces, Gucci sneakers with the skinny laces
Fendi sweats and Begets all up in the bracelets

It's that big boy music
Yahmean?
Thinkin' of a masterplan me and my man
Hand to hand on the grind since a half a gram
Understand even then you couldn't pass me hand
Was on the land all geared up and Dapper Dan
Around the year of them classic jams
I done seen niggaz get bitch slapped and ran
Word to yam a few got rich and swam
While I was sunk with they G packs trying to pump
It's over, no closure cars gave niggaz exposure
I was carried by Allah on his shoulders
Sober my first AR in the hood
Would of stuck a muhfucker and bring his truck if I could
Understood I was strong headed
But them streets and them guns gave me the wrong fetish
Cool whatever, I'm here we can do whatever
From the cars to clothes to the jewels whatever
Why worry? I'll rest when I'm dead and buried
So for now I'ma dress, get head and be merry

My minds still in the grind you wouldn't understand
It's been a long time since we was going hand to hand
When the block was too hot we had the look out man
Playing the corners to warn us soon as he saw the blue van

Plans to conquer the street
Branded in my head like the mark of the beast
My knowledge so ominous I plot in my sleep
When I eat my niggaz eat
We take the bitter with the sweet
If I die few'll cry, less'll do a bid with me
Once intrigued with money and fast cars
Stubbornly I sold crack to my man's moms
Suddenly it troubles me so I asked God
Forgiveness for pasts wrongs and future sins
Presently the coop I'm in
View as heavenly as the roof of ?Sens?
Like Vince Carter I'm too intense
For dudes defense to stop me I abuse the rim
Anybody can ball I do it to win
Son it's +Doe or Die+, all that other shit aside
Any sign of betrayal my nine'll improvise
I spit the sickest rhymes
Daydream of getting mines
Fuck scales and just as I ?tri-beamed to digitize?
Pure white perrico I cooked over a greasy stove
From Brooklyn to Queens to O-T
With keys I sold in a V
So cold when I hit the street many people froze
My team deaded the block till it decomposed
And was under our complete control to each his own
I don't sleep on niggaz in the street no mo

Wah'n't worth eight years for your first time pop
Now you back rehabilitated, punchin the clock
Old neighborhood witnessin your man and 'nem drop
Got the drop on that nigga said he runnin' the block
Graduated from the greens to servin' up rock
So you plot and you think and you sin on the plan
On some scheme-ass shit but, that's your man
I'm sayin', you tryna push reasons to the front
And put a block on that other shit you want
But the streets keep callin ya name
An 9-to-5 slave to the rhythm ain't bringin' you fame
So it's back to the game, round up a lil' gang
Set it up to stick ya manye but he stick you first

A new ideas for the lines that I exchanged
'Cause I can't be, a laughingstock homie, that'll be a crying shame
All I need is six bars and an intro
'Cause I relate to these beats like it was kinfolks
And the flow's so fresh like Mentos
And this is all real talk, that's for your info
Cause that's where I been, yo, ho!
I seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall (seen 'em fall)
Seen 'em come, seen 'em go, seen 'em all (seen 'em all)
Seen stars wit dey name on the wall
Till the money get tight and the limelight's gone (light's gone)
(Phonte:)
Uh, 3 A.M. in the backseat leanin'
Thinkin' 'bout all the things I've seen, man
(AZ:)
Grindin, time limb
Muh'fucker back up, stepped-up muh'fucker
So quiet, I coulda crept on a sucker (ah!)
From behind and blew the breath out the busta (poooow!)
But instead, held my head like a hustl-er
Pumped-up and get the sound of the muffler
Heard him clown bout his pounds bein fluffier
Tellin' niggaz outta town they be luckier
And get sad when the hood had enough of ya
Broke niggaz buck at cha, poke you in ya jugga-ler
But when you high, you feel niggaz can't fuck wit ya
I'm surprised some niggaz still had customers
(?) My eyes and inhaled my smoke
Tryna decide, should I let him slide - but nope!
He broke ties when he spoke his lies
Tell his pi's that he hope I die, so my reply is
To ""Keep it real, I hope you could fly""
'Cause I'ma send him to them open skies
(Gah! Gah! Rrraaah! Rrraaah!)
I seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall (seen 'em fall)
Seen 'em come, seen 'em go, seen ï¿½em all (seen 'em all)
Seen stars wit dey name on the wall
Till the money get tight and the limelight's gone (light's gone)

Yes sir! Another year, ha, ha, ha!
Toast ya glass please, this is champagne
You know what it is...
I love when the music sound so vibrant
So refreshin', all right let's get down to business
(Verse 1: AZ)
It's a - thin line between love and hate
And due time, a stable mind separates what's fake
It's Two kind of paper takers, make no mistake
You got those that touch a little
Then there's those that rape
I've been embraced, got a face that the game can't shake
I'm known well like a Coke scale, my name hold weight
Impeccable taste, medallions in symmetrical shape
Since '88 been wildin' wit a Electrical tape
Was a Ape to that street rap presented itself
Who could beat that, so like Lennox I surrendered my belts
I was felt wit five funnies, my cars was dealt
Wit my money and subconscious, I was God himself
The weed helped, but overall I was so Hip-Hop
Certified as a cool guy to be so hott!
Verbalized like 2Pac, wit a East-Coast bop
Then the shit just changed, had to switch up lanes
Past predicted the future, though the present exist
Poetic wise I'm Kama Sutra, it's a heavenly bliss
Schooled as a little dude, only dealt as diss
But you know 'em people is sick and they medicine mix
So 50 it's only a run, enjoy this here
Matter of fact you ain't done, enjoy this year
And uh it's only fair I make this clear
You could neva fuck wit me, so don't neva fuck wit me
If money makes the man then on Iraq land
Saddam statue will still stand on top of the sand
You a fan so overall respect my hand
'Cause I can see what's goin' on, I respect your scam
And we can toast to the life that showed us both
That trials and tribulation only bring forth growth
And when we bhost, you could bet who be felt the most
So live your life till the reaper approach...

I'm about to get on some Norman Bates shit, and go psycho
Shit, get the right speakers
Let me start a little early, that's what I do
(Rapping)
You know my persona, let me kindly remind ya
The Gucci, Garbana, the New-E, the Low, Evisus, designers
How I post up, probably amongst pirahnas
I'm the urban version of that turban-waving Osama
Last of a genre, there's nothing to mash your mind to
Y'all trash, I'll leave half of y'all niggaz in trauma
So I laugh, 'cause I'd rather clam in vagina
Splash a few grands on some high sand in the sauna
Usually ponder when I puff my little ganjas
Somber, feeling like Don Cheetah in the Hotel Riwanda
You know karma, increase when you cease your drama
It's deep, but you sleep when you feel there's peace upon you
Keep that armor, I formerly greet as a charmer
But beneath is more than mystique, I'm a monster
Came to conquer, no games I came to regain my honor
No lames, it's the same as the brain can conjure
Why launder, when I can outsell the bomber
Miskel, tell Mel, he'll be out of jail by Kwanza
From Tompkins to Guanas, to the hills in Brownsville, I sponsors
Nothing to cock back the Black P-80 Launcher
Any hate can haunt you, I'm straight from the L.I. gates of Yonkers
Down to the Southern states to Great Lakes in Tonker
Young, majestic, the beams from the Sun reflect it
Numb before Bush Senior's son was elected
Eclectic, world respected, like Brother Ube from Dure
But hey, what you expected, perfected, connected
So exit, or have it all in here
We can war when we're, nigga I'm so sincere"

Let's go
Yes I'm Brooklyn's best till I'm put to rest
I heard tales a nigga sin to shells to cook my flesh
No jail, never stale homie look how fresh
I'm low key like them old G crooks out west

Shit happens but believe I'm back blastin' ?another?

Zoning on owning co-ops, foreign drop-top, coups and yachts
Guzzling straight shots-a scotch,
Formulating up plots ta escape from Salems lock 'cause it's scorching hot
Making it hard trying ta figure who's out ta trap me, Pataki
Got all kinds of undercovers who's coming at me
Perhaps he, won't be happy, till they snatch me
And place me where half the slacks be, sitting in Catsaki

Reminisce on a good time
Cop come on boget.2x
Yo when times get trifle
I'm subjected to street survival
See many never complete they cycle
Other retreat to bibles, living holy
But currency seem to control me, moving coldly
In the presence of old parolies
My mind mold me, keep me in mack mode like Goldie
Police know me, but ain't got enough to hold me
I follow rules, through the knowledge, swallow jewels
A form of teaching, from the streets never taught in school
You caught you lose, a wise man utilize tools
Solitude certifies all moves
So I walk this path of the old dread, that lead me off the Ave
Absorbing fast, learning from niggaz I lost in the past
Its poison plays in these foul days
Housing cops and they foul ways, I'm walking through a wild maze
Holding my brain trying to maintain
Sleet hell, snow, or rain, I guess the game will never change.
Sunshine - we hustle to the moon light
Reminisce on a good time
Cop come on boget.2x
Since the genesis, paraphernalia circle my premises
Poor images, project life drained my innocence
It's all the worst genocide, I guess the water's cursed
My old earth identify, though her soul is for the church
She prayed for peace, hoping I'm saved before she lay deceased
To say the least, the one to wise to play the streets
I know the ropes, certain niggaz to slow to cope
& Though I sold some Coke, it was only to stay afloat
Amongst the frozen hearted, some bending, some departed
Inhaling chocolate, tracing back to where it started
The Crack wave 2 for 5, deuce and trays
The Mack sprays, puffin' lye, truth and days
& Though it sound ill, through all the foul shit, I'm down still
All around real, rough is the grounds in Brownsville
I know the ledge, meditating, holding my head
Eyes red, it's ""Doe or Die"" till I'm dead.

We in Germany on the auto-don
And I'm the Don and he the Don
The girls wrapped in our arms, seen accentuous charm
Hate if you want but don't front!
It's the billion dollar boys with the billion dollar toys
With the billion dollar bitches
With the maintenance on livin' about the minute a month"

Hit me up as soon as possible
Got it on right here for you baby, take it from me
(AZ) Keep doing this, man
We could do that little bit ya like
You know the one that keeps us up all night
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me
(AZ) Amusing me, huh? Okay
Look, I just landed, your request is granted
I'm in some 2-seater, pumping the best of Janet
Be through in a minute or two, I'm wit the fellas
Bullshitting, trying to finish my brew
But I'm here, it's nice weather, short-sleeve
Ice weather, had on the matins but the nikes was better
Hope you relax and tonight's whatever
Fatal attraction, the life of pleasure
Got bottles of the L-I-Q, champagne a little 'gnac
You can tell I knew, talk to me
The house or the 'telly suite, I need to know
The perception on my celly's weak, batteries low
If tonight's the, night then let me know
(AZ) Hello? Yo
Hit me up as soon as possible
(AZ) Damn
Got it on right here for you baby take it from me

We could do that little bit ya like
(AZ) Gotta give all this up, man
You know the one that keeps us up all night
(AZ) Crazy
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me
Listen, I need a diva that could roll cheeba
Blow in and out of town on her own leisure
Love shopping, kalhua's when she club hopping
Pretty toes, love the pose when the thug's watching
Play fair, hair done, face clear,
Type of chick any playa wanna take care, she that nice
The truth is that I've been trapped twice
Told her my life, need a wife for me to act right
Or could it be, just me on a hoe spree
Nowadays, live alone and I'm lonely, spreading my wings
A player in prokeds and some jeans, a pioneer
And gettin' slow head is my thing
I'm in the mix, wit the lies come along wit the tricks
Improvise, pretty thighs come along wit the hips
I can't knock it, try it but I can't stop it
It's in my blood, like the same way I love chocolate
And all I hear is
If tonight's the, night then let me know
(AZ) Whoa
Hit me up as soon as possible
(AZ) It's on now
Got it on right here for you baby, take it from me
(AZ) Gotta get away man, gotta leave this alone man
We could do that little bit ya like
(AZ) Can't keep living like this
You know the one that keeps us up all night
(AZ) Just one shortie, one, one
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me
(AZ) That's all I need one, wordup
I'm in my prime wit a lot on my plate, the party life
Clear my mind when I'm out of the states
Feeling relieved, revived when I'm feeling the breeze
I'm at my best when I'm chilling and I'm feeling at ease
Ladies respect
It's hard when I'm backwards balling, playing the field
And a whole lotta ass be calling, nothing is real
Is it wrong 'cause I'm doing my thing?, pimping if, either or
But I do what you dream
Follow the leader, I've seen what I needed to see
Leave it to me, and believe I'm not easy to g
Don't even try it, so ladies, all together, let's sing it
I know your needs and your wants
And if you want me to bring it, I gotta hear it
If tonight's the, night then let me know
(AZ) Okay
Hit me up as soon as possible
(AZ) I'ma figure this all out
Got it on for you right here baby, take it from me
(AZ) I don't if I'm getting used
We could do that little bit ya like,

You know the one that keeps us up all night
(AZ) I'm getting ready to go through though
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me
(AZ) Try that, you'll find out where you at
(AZ)
Hold up
Yo dun lemme use your cell for a minute, men, my

Getting ready to break out, yeah, try that

Baby you got what I need now
Couple bottles of cris, let's get it on now
From the front of the club to the back now
I just wanna see you take it off
Watch me move and it shake the whole place down
Pull up in the whips so we can get down
'Cause it me and my girls now, you and ya boys now
Sarafina, grace of a ballerina, small waist
Ass shake like Trina's
Pretty face, tougue taste like zima, if I
Wasn't a pimp I put a ring on ya finger
Freak for sure, knew her for a week or more
And already wanna beat up raw
On the dance floor dancing till my feet were sore
I just wanna she you take it off
Even willing to, piece her off, had my
Hands on her rear, cheeks was soft
I was all in the air letting that reefer talk
And like magic, in seconds, I eased her thoughts
Told her, get a drink if she need support
Just order don't think, I eat the cost
The car's close if ya legs are too weak to walk
I just wanna see you take it off
Baby you got what I need now (what)
Couple bottles of cris, let's get it on now (what)

Pull up in the whips so we can get down (what)
'Cause it me and my girls now, you and ya boys now (what)
Weekend's here, told boo, be sincere
I wanna see you in ya evening wear
Had her doubie wrapped up, made her release her hair
Lights on, made sure the grease was near, Nikes on
Kicked 'em right off beneath the chairs
Tan lines lit up nice, made her features glare
Tattoos, smooth skin, plus her teeth was fair
I just wanna see you take it off
Doe is here, I, know affairs, love cars like clothes
I, drove for years
Love a massage and a chick to let me hold her ears
Who's willing, no feelings, I'm cold as beer
As long as the zone is there
And as long as she bathe and comb her hair
We can light something nice and cologne the air
I just wanna see you take it off
Baby you got what I need now
Couple bottles of cris, let's get it on now
From the front of the club to the back now
I just wanna see you take it off
Watch me move and it shake the whole place down
Pull up in the whips so we can get down
'Cause it me and my girls now, you and ya boys now
Now you good, quote ya price if ya toes is nice
And if you got fitted jeans that promote you right
It's never a such thing as clothes too tight
Hype, hair color, skin-tone too, light
I love sights, I'm a old school type, tits, lips
Even marry hoes I like
Rarely kiss but I lick, twist, roll it right
I just wanna see you take it off
We can do it with a, bowl of ice
Take you out, you could, pose as wife
Teach you how to hold heat, unload and wipe
I just wanna see you take it off
Give you a different roll in life
Lemme show you that tonight's your, chosen night
Take that, take that. Uh huh.
I just wanna see you take it off
Baby you got what I need now
Couple bottles of cris, let's get it on now
From the front of the club to the back now

Hit it straight nuttin' to taste wit it

Know where we goin' {*scratched: ""AZ""*}
Uh-huh {*""AZ""*} {*""Streets is yours for the takin' now""*}
Feels so good {*""AZ""*}
(AZ)
You know the come up, stack get right, put the gun up
Laugh, get nice, split the blunt up
Pray blue and whites don't run up, remain humble
You see the change when the Range come through
When all the fame ups your game cause your name's mumbled
The chicks notice, usually it's like hypnosis
It's ferocious when broke niggaz get focused
The cars come out, bottles at the bar run it
You know you're large when you in car could dodge a drought
But here's the twist up, when beef and the money mix up
Skirts lift up, a few fights, few stick-ups
Then one little thing just, leads to the next and
Here come them hot boys to breathe down your neck
Now you gotta pack up, flee from the rest and
Just so we can go, you was free from the stress
I guess it is what it is
(Chorus: DJ Premier scratching)
""Creepin' on a come up"" ""Streets is yours for the takin' now""
""Creepin' on a come up"" ""I'm from the place where hardcore is beautiful""
""Creepin' on a come up"" ""Streets is yours for the takin' now""
""I'm rather unique"" ""I'm from the place"" ""Brooklyn""
(AZ)
You know the saga, who liver, who hotter
Who shot at who at the Ramada
I knew about beef since Bambaataa
Before ""Beat Street"" streets was heavily deep with the riders
Guns and money, some was hungry
Dysfunctional families that come from junkies
Jailbirds with wanted warrants up in countries
Just jungle survivin like a bunch of monkies
Marked dollars, D.A. NARC's with collars
Niggaz snitchin, but still got the heart to holla
Hot chicks in short skirts and damn near topless
Play fly and they gossip, stay high and just ride dick
Can't call it, too fresh to spoil it
Two tecs to war with, grew up next to all this
So understand I know from firsthand
The lies of a church man, high off his first gram
(AZ)
The jails is packed, the streets is wack
It's even worse when your workers tappin your beeper sack
Wifey's gettin' feisty, she's beefin back
Though it's unlikely, it might be her Visa's maxed
The coke is up, so now kush and dro's what's up
And the Ricans got the game in the cobra clutch
The D's in the Capris too close to duck
But what the fuck, they can suck on some coconuts
The stress is real, it drains all the sex appeal
Nuttin left but jail death or a record deal
Vibes is weak, hoes wanna slide and creep
Even fiends got a thing for that hide and seek
Stick-up kids, kidnap, switch up cribs
It's still crazy how them cocksuckers hit up Big
'Pac is gone, the state of hip-hop is wrong
You want more then long on to A-Z dot com

Follow, I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the player haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play wit me, I'm modest till them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggas, 'cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance
(Nas)
I do what I can do when I can do it
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feeling
Live how I live it's only 'cause I been through it
Learn to try it like to eat it and shit it's nothing to it
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while driving outside
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they staying, evil be gone, say it
I'm proud I'm ace but giving himself to the Lord
Wanted his Faith, think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changing
We ain't these little niggas no more, running dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be having they legs shaking, stab 'em, break 'em
I'm Hercules Hercules when having relations, the fliest
(Nas)
We put this on the, soul of our born
(Azv)
As we hold the Qu'ran
(Nas)
Kamikaze style

Older cats coachin us on

Yo it's kill or be killed

Understand, real'll be real

Identity sealed, protected by

Our energy shield

And fuck a drop, cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed
(Nas)
Close the books
(Azv)
Was taught never expose a crook
(Nas)
Between the knight and the bishop
(Azv)
Want to knock ya rook, I'm a rare breed never had a fair to lead
(Nas)
I ain't light niggas recite
(Azv)
Too impaired to breathe

We both hard hit just like Camacho and Vargas, who's the target?

You know the chronicles the shit that if momma knew
The stress, the drama dude, the tech's phenomenal
Rapid fire, pecs through the adominal
You bastard liars, it's me who's the honorable
Bathed and clothed up, shaved and close-cut
Restraint from temptation was drained from both nuts
Heh! Now in the physical form verbalized through the scriptures; I was Biblically born
It's I, a Jeremiah, conceived through the blunt fire
On Kawasakis, could wheelie up on one tire
Well respected, gel connected, got the method for the woody females perfected
For sure, very few flaws, heavy Chevy two doors
Candy-painted to give a nigga the blue balls
'Course, this the life I chose
The bid, the 360, the cipher's closed, c'mon
The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ
Still, I don't have to run no games--I've done those thangs
Young and gifted, my tongue's prolific
In the beach bungalow is how I brought in Christmas
From the streets, I'ma flow from the hungriest districts
Switch kicks, crisp when I come to them picnics
Play it slow, paper chase, stack, and lay low
Range Rove, tinted all black, the same old
Psychic mind, writes his rhymes
Still turn the new leaf on my life of crime
No concerns with new beef who's as nice as I am
It's confirmed from feet--I'm still a sniper blind
Built my fame, spilled my pain
Politicking daily--still tryn to milk the game
Its obvious that I'm real, rap skills remain
I took some change and I'm still the same
The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ
Still, I don't have to run no games--I've done those thangs
Learned the system, burned some izm
Jotted my jewels down like journalism
How I maneuve', now it emerged through wisdom
A pilgrim prophesied, puttin' words to rhythm
Relatin', an Adam Clayton in manifestation
Patient, meditatin' with them animals waitin'
Pacin', like an M-8 that sealed its fate
Let some years escape, but I'm still in shape--I'm Chillin'
Deeply rooted, a beast with music
From Bed Stuy to the East, I'm too at peace to lose it
But love it, I still does it
Breathin off a Trump budget
Fresh outa Bloomie's with the Louis luggage
The format is real sickening, contagious

Yes, yes, ladies and gentlemen
I'll like to thank you for your support, love
Not only to me, but to the whole hip-hop industry itself
We as a whole, we've been weathering in the Storm
From the start, 30-plus years ago to now
But uh, like all weapons of hate, we perceiver
So allow me to speak not only for me
But on behalf of the hip-hop coalition
Every hood, every ghetto across the United States of America
(Verse 1: AZ)
Yea, as a youngin' I was sittin'- spittin' sponge-in'
Just learnin' the life, and Christ second comin'
Well mannered and nice, got advice from women
But when the money get tight, the stomach start grumblin'
It was some of then, wasn't all Hammers then
Went in the Benz, it was kingpin and bubblin'
We started huddlin', puttin' in, and jugglin'
A shear later we straight, no more strugglin'
But that was only the start
The love between homey started fallin' apart
I guess anything's addictive when it's callin' your heart
Death and incarceration had us all in the dark
We was done, some'll say ""we had a beautiful run""
And the beauty is skin deep was beneath the slums
I was numb, that was like speakin' in tongues
So relax, I adapt within a week I was sprung
Spoke facts on the track, it's like squeezin' a gun
No more crack, all the boys on my back hearin' ""RUN""
Yea, I changed & came, all them years, on the stairs G Rap & Kane
I felt pain, them beamers still lurkin' my brain
But the ways is the most high is to preserve to explain
It was the fame, that focused me, perfected my game
And like that, there's so many others that this rap will remain
And in exchange, we give fans the force of the reign
To feed, nurture, and breed, and be the voice of the slain
It's a shame, but that real shit come wit the life
And in order to obtain you gotta sacrifice
It's like cuttin' your bitch shorter, don't pass on fights
I'ma tourer, so you know all my facts is right
Plus my Aurora is like used spoilers on the porch at night
So be polite, just go for them critics that write
This is Rap, we from the hood, just tryin' to get a slice
Some'll bite, but the most just coast wit ice
And rock a little chain, get a little brain
(Immediately changes to AZ talking)
Ha ha-ha ha, yea, hey, it is what it is
You know Rap has no rules
See my enlightener he-he once told me once said
""If there is no devilish-men, then there won't be Godliness""
""One can't exist without the other""
Knaw'mean?, it's like a Doctor is only needed to heal
And he caters to the sick, so the sick must exist, ya heard?
A Minister - he only gives sermon to - uh you know -
Those seeking for forgiveness - so them sinners must exist
You know? it's simple simplistic, ha ha-ha ha
It's AZ the GOD - Constantine - Quiet Money for life

It's like them hoes can't wait
Stimulate the minds of them killers upstate
And these snakes among deceive I diss was dead weight
Use to hit niggaz with work and the crate
Guerrilla rap will still smack the smirk of your face
Was jail baited bounced from strip bitches got raped
Now the dick game is so insane I can't fake
The stakes when you fuckin' with chicks chasin' them brakes
So if they ain't holdin' bank then they can't get the H.N.I.C. and shit
A hustler's rap artist, pardon, AZ stats regardless
Heartless, haunt niggaz like the anti Christ
My advice 'fore you lose your life, is think twice
Before you creep on it, put beef on it, sleep on it
The weak get left in the streets with no garments
Ice grillin' niggaz, to me it's the most harmless
Don't embarrass yourself, you way out of foreign grounds

At the ripe age 24, I done seen it all done it all
Some dreams stay fresh and some are spoiled
Dealin' with time went to spring, summer, fall
Its crazy changes, is this that made me famous?
I come a long way from Tims, minimum wages
Stockin caps summer jobs pockets flat
It's funny how my childhood idols now be copin cracks
Ain't knockin' at them, fortunately life is too short to see
It's only right we move accordingly at every second
I use to carry heavy weapons, previously cocked
Tucked in my shirt for every session, but hold up
The two-six beer made me grow up
Came home to the damn same dream with no luck
And half the clique strong, the other half moved on
Some with new lives and new wives niggaz live long
The foulest thing about time is still ticks when you gone
(Nas)
For those who lived the way I lived we came from a long way
From wipin coal from our eye lids from raps hottest
Smokin' lye to the track guidance, 'member back then
Before Mack 10's expensive bottles, had a sick mind
Niggaz taught me how to get mine
We often sit courts they get tossed that get spit line
To all niggaz that the Lord seemed to legit time
Why we plan to live for-ev he had a different design
Is it safe to say we all parish on the sacred day
With my luck soon as I reach the gate that made me pay... pray
Minutes go by indo-go-high the specialist decked out dark specks finessin
Used to play catch a kiss same girls back then now leave us messages
A whole lot, travel to my old spot where we sold rock although its trifle
Ain't nothin' changed as like time is all a cycle

Yo, wake up to the world stay in charge of your dream
Keep your vision focus get wise and large your cream
Marketin scheme so many in the dark it's un-seemed
Caught up between perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustlin to supportin them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a team
Rockin' bird stones my first get big nursed a dome
Its hurts to zone now I realize I'm on the surface alone
Time ticks devilish mind design quits leave you line quick
And cause you to die behind shit, mathematics
Master 120 I'm Aziatic, I'm amazed with magic
Cousins with loosen that made me savage

So regardless, male or female, love either one

Slung rocks, nearly got rich off of one block

Catch me in Haiti, ridin' horse back
Seek religion, study life, tryin' to see the vision
Weeks in prison'll help a wise man peep his livin'
Reach decisions, analyze, scope the game, wit hopes to change
Before the stress overdose the brain, most remain
Shockwaves, I rock stage through the Tropic Haze
Under Palm Trees, puffin' lye for days, liver ways

Empty out before the Po Po come bust the show
Sobered up, knew it was beef, but over what?
Been in the cut, escapin' these streets, they cold as fuck
Tuck my chain in, rose to my feet, no time for aimin'
Back arched, all you saw was sparks, niggas blazin'
One fell, callin' for help, heard him yell

But mentally, outcome wise I feel no sympathy

Rock you slow to sleep, play you for doe, now you know it's beef
Know it's deep, I live my life on the creep

Spreaded out, so much on my mind, gotta let it out
To live, and die for a 'cause I feel dead without
Check my rap sheet, no prior cases, just some Tech's beef
Charged with drunk drivin' once, but I was half 'sleep
Swervin', off of St. Mark's and Burgan, in a rented Suburban
I must've dozed when I was turnin'
But peep this, I'm on trial now, no sign of weakness
No secrets, just goin' to court, & I'm tryin' to beat this

Puffin exotic trees without seeds rolled up in leaf paper

So all my good fellas, heroin, coke and weed sellers
What the fuck cats can tell us if they ain't got bread to bail us?
Happy to survive, I haven't seen it all, Peter pay Paul
From the connivers to the livest, they crack fool
It's all war, the streets are filled up with guns galore
Plenty young for war, gettin' their minds flunked and sore

Peru, uncut baby, what?
Life is a struggle, that's why niggas I know stay on the juggle
Some hustle to double, others hug you to mug you
Poverty-stricken, they even turn a church kid into stickin
It seems sickenin, but what? Whatever makes the pockets thickin
Fuck police and no remorse for the beasts
That's lost on the streets, that pistol whip a priest for a crosspiece
Some lost sheep, runnin' through strips, thinkin' of top dealers
Fillin Tek clips, wit 'cop killers' that could stop gorillas
Shovin a stubnose in buttholes, I'm nutso
Skitzo, clepto, killin' shit up throughout the metro
My thug essence will always keep me plugged with drug investments
Sketch my reference, takin' papers considered preference
And violations will lead to kidnappin, decapitation
So what you're facin, is realism that's in activation
Livin' off land with five honeys playin' my hand
Me and fam, sippin off Guinness stout and eatin clams
It's all part of plans, a vet chillin' in Tamps, West and Stans
Outta state connect, slugs, sex, drugs and grands
What? For my Height niggas (Uncut)
Trife niggas (Raw), 25-to-life niggas
This is as, pure as opium, purified for street players to open em

Lay back in the? down gangster lean (I stay chilling daddy, you dig, ha ha)
This feeling is undeniable

Drama seas, sands so white
Bahamas beach, your plans go right
Out of reach, rambo flights
In some two seater, sitting up like cleavage
Plane conceded, the prayer was a parapalegic
Save the chatter, my swagga's needed, believe it
Button ups, tailor custom cuts,
Trees on the feet, physique fucks him up
That's what's up
Straight from the gutter side
Keep clean on everything my mother dries
Still I love allah, sucker for southern fries
Facing affiliation, embracing my butterflies
I, (I) been down for a minute now
There's none flyer, all the live wires in the ground
A young messaih, admired by entire town
Sun-fire, stay higher than Miriah's sound
So you know I'm on some other shit
Sneak peak, low creep, deep cover shit

If you ball at once, what's the most you saw?
If you fall, do you really got folks to call?
With that bell on hand, why they tell on fam? (sigh)
I feel his pain, how the unfortunate try to steal the fame
How it's more naucseousness than the killer in ray
Through so much anger, (clentching jaw) I know such danger
Thoro, I'm a decade in
From a borough way wicked than wes craven
Then again
Certain things I could never do
My whole life, get it right, get revenue
Get a wife, get a white BMW
2 doors style, take that roof off now
(Ha) that was dreams of a younger me
Now my hunger's humongous as a hummer 3
Ferarri drop, with that time in the summer T

But for now all I ask, is Lord help us all
Help me stay focused, I'm self absorbed

Ow from the coop, I'm like Owens in the booth
Big boy, had his know from the roof
Way before rap, I can more than fall back

(Intro: AZ)
Yeah, it's overdue right here
Y'all know what it is...
(Verse 1: AZ)
The dead is gone, the world welcomes new borns
A thousand-bookies is sworn in uniform
No application for - snitches, niggaz, but you can join
Just get your coins, and start droppin' dime
Superiority, I can stop time
And I am the minority, so who can knock mines?
Purposely placed here on purpose to shine
Home, purchased on furnace, my concerns is to grind
Get some M's, then gettin' to win
And transfer all U.S. currency for yen
A few friends, few next to kin
Yes it's true, I flew through in that Flurizan Benz
Show room shoppin', coppin' rims, I'm top-ten
Niggaz gon' respect my pen
Survived in two droughts, two separate games
So I shout, ""Who'll slouch, get outta my lane""
My homey's homey did ten in chain
So we set-up in Tony's rome, and I picked out his brain
I explained it's bigger game then just street nigga fame
Them same thoughts I fought like Sugar Shane
Reachin' the next chapter after of life after I mastered
Fuck it Fresh, address these little bastards
(Verse 2: Fresh)
Uh, yeah, yeah
I'm reachin' for the Range doors on the truck
The European stitched strong in the guts
My nigga M3's doors liftin' up
Uh, Fresh sick wit dough, got Danbury pictures goin' off the dust
And the Cranberry Six growin' off the guts
Light pink heavy wit strong of the cuts
Actin' like steady bitch, knowin' you a slut
And after we get finished ma knowin' you won't cut
And you know I'm in the truck, and deep dishin' it
Fire's are Six, the kid keep kickin' shit
Pies of the brick, the kid keep flippin' shit
I insist the stag' and seen different shit
Bubble face your par' wit see fish in it
Bubble great, ponair's wit clean kinesh shit
In Duffle bag by Guc'
The white double-stitch, on the hall, that's Emilio Puc'
Flow Rivers in the booth and I'm speakin' the truth
So listen up, young niggaz 'cause I'm speakin' for fuse
Uh, yeah
(Outro: Ralo)
The bigger it is nigga, the harder it falls
Niggaz scared of LL, nigga give us the ball...
Listen to this man
I want y'all to listen real close and real careful man
There ain't seldom is niggaz born wit all the five senses
The five senses are now, listen to this and listen to this shit close
'Cause this is when a nigga is a last level nigga
First of all, you had to been born wit automatic understanding of the game
You had to have been wit automatic understanding of the game from birth
Then you gotta be unadulterated R-rated
You gotta know how to spit that dialogue in some form of fashion
Whether it's just talking or it's rapping
Then you gotta be law of the nourishing
Once you getting motion, then you get focused
You get hot, that you cannot be motherfucking stopped
Then on top of that you gotta have lyrical sense on a massive level
Some niggaz got it on minus, some niggaz got it on maiden
Some niggaz got it on the massive, Massive is the last level
Then on top of that it gotta be written in your script
The script... the script... the script...
Yo real niggaz you can't break
And real nigga you can't make 'em man
We've been big niggaz all of our life man
Answered to nobody man, and wake and go wherever they take us man"

I see things that never was and say, why not?
Just wanna be there, you know? y'all realize, I hold this down
East New York, Eighty-two, First pumas navy blue
First wife Kiesha Wilson with love, she was my baby boo
Crazy crew, paying dues, few of us made it through
Front window, Ms. Glady's, that was my favorite view
Hated school, never went, hookie was better spend
Right around the time the god rocks smoking dead presidents
Devilish ever since, seeking for hope, needing some form of nourishment
It's eighty-eight skin starting to radiate
Hit on my baby-face mama bear could see that I'm there
She finally gave me space change of pace moving quicker
Consuming liquor, humping on some chicks pussy
Trying to undo her zipper
Gucci slippers who can diss us? 40 deuce movie pictures
What other way but poetically can I prove we scriptures?
Drugs sold 'em, cars rode 'em, guns near my scrotum,
Got locked, got right out, gave what I owed 'em
Five when they buried Will killed 'Po killed Phil
Murdered Donald Jones, shot clip hit Bill
Prince in prison, damn, Yam still living
I can see him up in heaven my nigga dance to the rhythm
God, show me a better way, give me another day
Open the lane up so I can make these fuckers pay
Fo sho, I just wanna be there, you know?
Realize what I'm worth, the work I put in
And I brought to the table through the years
I ain't the average, ya heard?
Respect my gangsta, it's all hustle
Steal it on 'em, you know?
Loving da game you gave me, loving my name is AZ
Never sold millions, but fuck it I'm here to save the babies
Look how a lady raised me, so would say he crazy
I'm just a nigga from Brooklyn repping the streets that made me
Rapping for quite a while, all around, tighter style
One of the flyest with the brightest smile, try me how?
Save all the aggra-zations, keep all the confrontations
I'm sitting contemplating trying to crack the combination
Move mystique mostly months that I keep cozy
At time I creeped only this is what the East showed me
More on to music making trying to renew relations
Ducking the dudes that's hatin', please don't make me lose my patience
I put it down for y'all my face surrounds Allah
My catalogue consists of a hundred thousand bars
The god, please respect me, ya heard?"
117,We Can't Win,1995,Doe or Die (1995),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,AZ,"Intro: (*guy talking*)
Yo God, through the knowledge, God, it's like this
This world is rude and controlled by society
That exists with the societies, that exists, with the societies, God
You understand? These secret societies is manouvering within society to
Control society
That's why society is outta control
33rd and one third, I heard the illuminated ones, huh
The last days we're facin, that's the case when the emanicpation
Proclamation decays, back to the plantation
The government plottin a nuclear detonation
Destroyin vegetation, water, the Newer Order means starvation
The I on the dollar symbolise illumination
Of society, secretly overseein population
Understand it, the government plans to enslave the planet
I'm trapped in a faze, thinkin' of ways, can it
Happen? 85 percent of the population nappin
Prayin' in churches, catchin the Holy Ghost clappin
Across the border travellin, I found the Nile across the water
Teachin my peoples the age of the Newer Order
Twenty five to click blood line, we toast off wine
Snap clips in 9's, wit minds more advanced than Einstein
And Murman, knock down walls like Berlin
Take it out, we can't get in
We can't win
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get outttttttttttt
See I, wrote up a composition, I made a decision
For competition, some invite lifestyles that I be livin'
Wit tribes I been in, wit the little brothers that's sinnin
So I started to vision, crack fiends formin
On collision, my mind is in that position for soul fishin
My only dream was to be a musician
Better yet a mortician, that's the life condition
'Cause everybody knows they gonna die, crackers they analyse
????? Plus I feels the vibe, mother cries
Plenty mothers that tries, now that she knows her son's gonna die
Take a trip, pass the lye, now ease
The mind escape from the crimes of New York times
'Cause I'm one of the brothers who made it throughout the others
The Rotten Apple's tryin' to break loose from these shackles
No doubt, I follow routes, guzzlin Hennessey, mixed wit style
In the ghetto, we can't get out
We can't win
Nothin' can stop the nation, elevation, daily operation
Since man creation, we increase the population
Proper education, got us tappin in information
Preventin from gettin' locked under top-secret investigation
Guiliani's part of Illuminati
A million minds in one body designed to decline society
They wanna lease 1.2 billion deceased
While the rest is left with the mark of the beast on their domepiece
Prepare, the signs of the times now are near
That I'll wake scare, findin Zaire, soon be here
So tune your ears, and be saved from a slave
'Cause in a matter of days I'ma E-Q your brainwaves
AZ the Visualiza is wise as Elijah
Here to advise ya, and bring out the realness that's up inside ya
Intoxication, my voicebox rocks the nation
Sweet affiliation, the Doe Or Die situation
We can't win
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get out and we can't get in
We can't get outttttttt

118,What Cha Day About,2001,9 Lives (2001),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,AZ,"Finally from every dimension with few restrictions
From up north to the youth detentions, I lay it down
Clear enough for who choose to listen, we all thorough
Infected by cruel intentions, but who the wise
The lies got two disguises, the surprise
Is to know when to utilize it, stay alert
The street talkers say the worst
So overall you gotta watch where you play in the dirt, it's just the rules
A killer could be just as cool, it's no image
Camouflaged right next to the fools, so who's who
It's the game that chooses you
A lot of shit is more easier to say than do, show and prove
Maintainers never blow they cool
Understand, every man should really know these jewels, I'm feeling live
Slim with a gorilla vibe
Away from haters 'cause I know what they feel inside, but never worry
Blowing cess in the dark (What your day about?)
Playing chess in the park (What your day about?)
Taking trips every week (What your day about?)
Spending chips on them freaks (What your day about?)
Getting money all night (What your day about?)
Betting houses on the dice (What your day about?)
Got your vest and your heat (What your day about?)
Get respect in the street (What your day about?)
Young in the mind with a old spirit
Hot blood with a heart that's so frigid, melodic music
Expressed through slow lyrics
I only spit it for the niggas that hold digits, and don't front
I know about the coke blunts and Remy nights
Got a cousin up in Elmira sending me kites
I'm felt, the ice in my ears don't melt
I could drink a whole bottle for delf and won't belch
Believe it's the same me ducking the D's
Eighty-six with the do-rag, cuff in the Lee's
Appraise this, biological' I'm ageless
Psychologically, I show amazement
Salute, been blessed with the time to re-coupe
Hoping the real just respect what I'm trying to produce
Quiet Money is the empire, bigger than rapping
Fuck niggas 'cause I been fired, that's what's that
From the streets to the track board
Bubble up, from the crack to the rap laws, visualize
We all uncivilized, the trained behavior
As kids taught to memorize, copy and mimic
I travel through the blocks that's dimmest
Fly nigga, use my teeth to pop the top off a Guinness, never hate
With the hunger of a heavyweight
I stay balanced in the mind when I meditate, and blow trees
Every verse is like a o-z
I know niggas in the 'hood like they know me, so no beefing
It's nothing that could stop me from eating, too in tune
Taught to heal through the doctrines and teaching, redeemed
For women I'm the man of their dreams, stand alone
When I zone nothing coming between, let's get money
The trick is to flip money, double up
Dirty or legit money, it's all the same"

Light the trees up, let this apervesence ease up
Don't freeze up, postition yourself wit your knees up
Believe what? It's all street talk, can we please fuck?
Gotta catch a flight tonight, count some G's up
Headed for the Windy City, Chi-town
Do a nigga right, you might get slide down
Show you new sights, give you a feel of what the crew's like
Blew tight, casts who take money move right
Pursue heights, playin' my part from off top
Young playa hit a big score called props
Call shots, we can party till the ball drop
But Boo it's on you, slide through before the door lock
Don't be afraid just the things some do
Unbelievable, but still the illest things come true
Felt ya city chest, did yo' best to be a C.O.
Summertime, Zodiac sign, bless the Leo
Just show love, leave all the rest to me
And we can do this professionally (professionally)
CHORUS: [Kenny Greene]
Come get your love tonight
Everything will be all right
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Once you feel the joy I bring
You'll be all right
AZ:
Everyday another work day, that's what you say
But today it's your birthday, Lady let's play
Leave behind all these crabs, and snakes, they dead weight
Got a cabin upstate, somewhere to getcha head straight
Take a break from the routine, a new vibe
Different way to try to do things, you're too live
Saw your ex-man, see he got a new Lex land
Tryin' to ?flan? wit some cats I knew who ran scams
He know 'bout how we get down goin' out
Designer Anclinin', shinin', showin' out
You led me on, thought he was real, but bet I'm wrong
Fed since you left him for dead, his head is gone
It's the same song, so many seem to relate
And search for a new life, dreams to be straight
Just show faith, and leave all the stress to me
And we can do this, most definitely (most definitely)
CHORUS [Kenny Green]
AZ:
So for now and every off day, there's foreplay
I'ma freak from the door way, love a short stay
Takin' trips on the hot sands, I got plans
Champagne all the top brands, let's lock hands
Let me teach you all the right moves, wit ice cubes
It's a nice view, sex'll make you skip night school
And though I like you, also like the things you do
The way you chew, how you move when I bring you through
At the cafe, sippin' on some Crist and Zae
Four course entre, wit the fish fillette
So what you feel when I'm close to ya, keep it real
Who the nigga mean the most to ya, what the deal?
Let's enjoy it while we still here, handle wit care
And we can do this like a Willie affair

Chorus: [az]
Yo major large niggas get they grind on cash, while the crab thinkin'
Niggas keep they mind on ass
I guess most motherfuckers ain't designed to last
Whatever happened to the realness from back in the past?
Whatever happened to the realness from back in the past?
Whatever happened to the realness from back in the past?
AZ: {Verse One}
You know the routine, fast cars, rings get a crew seen
We true fiends, old school style that's how we do things
Born and destined, hands on many investments
Strong, reflect this till I'm drawn back to the essence
Street wise, 36 waist, small feet size
The C.I.'s quick to slide off, once the heat rise
Detour, poverty zone, police war
Going through each dawn, searchin' new ways for me to eat more
Fast learner, quiet storm, play the back burner
Bureaucrats, I react like Nat Turner
Hold weight, used to rock kicks wit no lace
Fuck a soul mate, low heart pace, pulse at a slow rate
Runnin' rapid, while others play as if they captive
Brain's inactive, bein' subjected to this crab shit
To each his own, fuck the foulness, need a week alone
We can zone, all day long, on the speaker phone
600, nine five North, stay blunted, stress I came from it
Sex got drained from it
The new breed star gazin', raisin' two seeds
To be free, the franchise is all a whole crew need... indeed
Partial Chorus: [AZ] {starts after need}
Whatever happened to the realness from back in the past?
Whatever happened to the realness from back in the past?
RZA: {Verse Two}
Whips and full clips and pussy lips
Rubber grips attached to hips
Past the journey to the crib, the purest sickness cura
Holy Koran, sirah, leaves man to understand, I stand up as rough briva
Heart is bleedin', stress got my hair line receedin'
God look we feedin', leadin' my seeds, back to Eden
And stay suspicious of promiscuous bitches
Who don't wash and do dish and to big for your britches
Lustin' riches, fuckin' the next man mistress
You wonder why your pussy itches, fat ass sample wit out the glitches
Shatter your mental, split your bean up like a lentel
Disfigure your face, you recognizin' by the dental
Hot lead from raw heat, left in store meat
Lay it out on Broadstreet, before he
Left all he heard was the echo from the shot
Cops autopsy revealed, he was stopped by the Glock
Devils lettin' off SCUDS, thugs trapped up in HUD houses
New York, been infested by Bloods, lustin' for colors of red
More black lies done shed through
Yet the blood travelin' through veins remain blue
Boned out until we zone out, no doubt
Chickenheads beg for the 9 inch Applehead
Their legs open like fallopian, lubricated by petroleum
Nine months later comes the ovary explosion
Bitch you stupid? A hundred dollars you couldn't recoup it
When I reign the truth on your brain you muted
Rula Zig-Zag, Zig Allah, plus Allah Zig, Zag-Zig
We addin' more knowledge to your wig
AZ (RZA) {sometimes overlapping each other}
(Word up, word up) Yeah (Wu-Tang, Firm up in this piece know what I
Mean?) Holdin' it down stamp of approval, you know? (Get ya brain
Washed, you know what I'm sayin'? Get ya muscle tendered and straight)
No doubt, no doubt

The Firm baby, holdin' this, A to the Z, I know what time it is

For those that's locked in Comstock
My peoples sittin' in San Quentin and Clinton
Rikers Island
Rikers Island
Cracker's Island
(Verse 1: az)
I wake up to them rappin' tunes every afternoon
I be home soon, I see the board some time after June
Met a couple of convicts that's way beyond sick
It seem they dig my style 'cause I be on some don shit
Laid back, I ran into some brothers from way back
Those I dug we hugged, besides that, black, I don't say jack
I stay in tune with the sun, stars and moon
Cause behind bars you're doomed if your mind can't consume
Plus spiritual pain can bring forth physical reign
And without knowledge of self how else can a criminal change?
And bein locked up just ain't the life for me
Shit is way too trife for me
""You're comin' home soon"" sounds so nice to me
Plus you can bet I'm bouncin' out with mad props
And if I get chopped or not, baby pop
My world don't stop
(Your world don't stop
Your world don't stop
Your world don't stop
Your world don't stop, stop, stop...
Your world don't stop
Your world don't stop
Your world don't stop, stop..)
(Verse 2: az)
And in here it makes all end up the same from blowin' backs out
5 to 15, seein the bean until they max out
Misbehavin, actin' uncivlized like cavemen
I witnessed brave men that gave in
Sodomized and turned to gay men
Nobody's playin' drama, prisoners be posted preyin
On some low shit layin
Sleep, get your whole shit banged in
Hangin', plus who's to warn you
Out of the hell these inmates gone through
From three halves of a four group doubt if anyone is normal
And over all it's hard to call who would try to play you
My kid from my tomb's caught a carved spoon through his navel
Nothin' can save you, even C.O.'s'll try to grave you
It's painful to even know those who most faithful'll betray you
I lay low-key, 'cause I ain't Hercules
Tryin' to get out early on work release
Prayin' the system work with me
'Cause I ain't tryin' to see three hots and a cot till I rot
That ain't my plot, baby pop
My world don't stop
(Your world don't stop
Your world don't stop
Your world don't stop
Your world don't stop, stop, stop...
Your world don't stop
Your world don't stop
Your world don't stop, stop..)
(Verse 3: az)
So until that day I'm discharged and set free
Fuck who's gonna sex me
My mind's more based on makin' my next g
Now let's see, left alone me as a juvenile, no more movin foul
The penile possesed me with a smoother style
Blessin my mental with mathematics to map shit through graphics
Fuck it, I ain't with hustlin backwards
A wiser man with ideas and liver plans
More mature and for sure done saw all my eyes can stand
Sittin' tryin' to design these words of mine
To define what occurs when you're servin' time
Stress just blurs the mind
Behind bars scars are signs of hard times
I'm trappin myself in between these lines
But I ain't tryin' to see three hots and a cot till I rot
That ain't my plot, baby pop
My world don't stop
(*Repeated until end*)
(Your world don't stop...)
Yeah, representin
For all the fellas on lock-diggedy
From upstate to downstate
Don't stop, paw
Don't stop, paw
And on and on and on...
My man Sincere is in here
Yo Free, how it be, baby?
That's how we do it"
