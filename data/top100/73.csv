Can you dig it???
I wanna get right to the point
He's here
""He's unique, he's unconquerable.""
(Repeated)
MC Ren, MC Ren is a killa of the crafted men
Twas the night before the ball struck
And all the snakes was outta sight
And of all those cat hangs
And all the solutions
Now it's like do or die
So salute to the battle cry
And all the real niggaz
Step up to the frontline
You don't want two scoops of fruit loops
For the real troops
'Cause it's about a quarter to midnight
15 ticks to catch 15 licks in the fizzot
Who lettin' the heads get chopped and mack 10's pop pop
For all those too slow for the tempo of tizzongue
Because all those who can't hang get hung
And those who can't take charge get dault
So come and walk, coming strong
Coming long, 'cause we been down for too damn long
And not a soldier, a soldier
Nigga I thought somebody was older
'Cause the days of bein' a slave livin' in the grave is over
Ain't no more that shall overcome 'cause we been overcame
So I'm packin' 'quips full of golds for all you G's trapped in shame
Listen to the sound of the midnight poker chain
Livin' in an underground railroad
Takin' aim and set to cause much pain
So hitch a ride on the midnight trizzain
One million ways to die
So devil don't even try
I'm packed, ready and willin' to get a government killa
So welcome to the land of the drive by"
1,All Bullshit Aside,1993,Shock of the Hour (1993),,MC Ren,"Yeah, check this out, Ren is back in this mothafucka for 93'
For all y'all punk ass niggaz that thought I was'nt gonna do this shit,
Back there talkin' all that shit, won't believe me and my shoots,
Fuck all y'all niggaz 'cause I come back hard 93',
So all you punks mothafuckaz check yourself niggaz!
I killed that bitch that waited 40 ounces
Start hittin' my switches 'cause my 40 bounces
Lean to the side like a mack would do
Or I can come off like a G and mothafucka I'll jack you
'Cause niggaz be talkin' that shit 'cause I'm fuckin' the rest and I can't scrap
Who needs to scrap, my niggaz commin' from de back.
So bitches hold your panties up, tick your tits
'Cause mothafuckin' Ren is makin' mothafuckin' hits
Still sportin' cackies keep my dick in my dickies
Only wave 'em up when bitches wanna give 'em hickeis
Other than that, I'm lookin' up for #1
'Cause #2 I did'nt trust so my nigga had to bust
Burry him in the back another weedplants
My niggaz said it was the reason why the weed is so dope
Grab another bitch twist the panties off the top
Open up my mouth and let the old English drop
Buzz for a minute - could'nt walk a straight line
But that shit don't stop Ren from writin' a rhyme
And punk mothafuckaz can't hide, from a nigga
Homicide all bullshit aside ...
Kick it ...
Yeah, put de fuckin' bullshit aside [oh yeah, yeah]
Yeah, put de fuckin' bullshit aside [you wanna fuck with me?]
Yeah, put de mothafuckin' bullshit aside [nigga step off nigga!]
Yeah, put de mothafuckin' bullshit aside [mothafucka]
Take donations from my niggaz for de booth
I thinkin' of gettin' a case better yet I get two
Slap up de phone 6 3 2 15
Bitches ring the bell - it's a fuckin' tight jeans
A kiss on my chick but my dick is gettin' jealos
She whispers she want suck and when we're not around de fellows
Fuck that shit, bitch, do what you gotta do
'Cause when you're fuckin' with Ren ho' my niggaz peoplez too
Now I'm zippin' on my blue black car
Thinkin' of the times in the blvd
I saw people out there gettin' gangsta shit
Niggaz shootin' every night - niggaz lootin' and shit
Sendin' niggaz straight to the coffin
And this type of shit in the streets it's very often
The shit is like an everyday thang to me
A lot of niggaz on my block I have 'em slang for me
But that ain't shit, my true niggaz stay down
De plasma hard G'z don't be fuckin' around
And why would you even think to hide,
Nigga 'cause you got all bullshit aside, check it ...
Yeah, put de fuckin' bullshit aside [yeah nigga]
Yeah, put de fuckin' bullshit aside [nigga you think you can fuck with me?]
Yeah, put de fuckin' bullshit aside [that is not what I said]
Yeah, put de mothafuckin' bullshit aside mothafucka
Train came in in some cackey shorts
And he came up on the hand at the basketball court
Takin' niggaz money shootin' dice at the pawn
The mothafucka starts to leave when it starts to get dark
'Cause Ren has don't got no mothafuckin' name,
When he's shot by a nigga from my mothafuckin' game
The niggaz in de house just kickin' it
Bitches on they're knees straight lickin' it
Ren is in control, bitches call me the mesaiach
I zip on some old drink fool so I can stay higher
Cakeys is krist, fresh from the surplus
My little nigga ball starts to pull up a fass
So now they drunk his beer so he put out a tattoo
So we walk the tommy dog that's the will nigga anthem
So Juvi' pass the movie it's ""American Me""
The only movie that's allowed to be watched by a G
Now bitches just commin' out of blockz and flatz
So you can hear a smokin' ho's yo for rockz and blantz
Takin' these bitches for a ride, treat 'em all like
Ho's all bullshit aside ..."
2,Attack on Babylon,1993,Shock of the Hour (1993),,MC Ren,"""Is America like ancient Rome?""
""Is America like ancient Babylon?""
""Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
I wanna hear from you""
I told ya Ren'll be back with the niggaz in the Dodge and the camoflauge
But it after Tahj, a million niggaz no mirage
Creepin' and we're creepin' in your little white Hutz
20 million niggaz chantin' I don't give a fuck
It's on, the switch got flicked but who did it?
When that shit was committed, fuck that was my mack
Niggaz gettin' crazy 'cause Ren is in the front
With supreme wisdom, puffin' on a blunt
Train by my side tearin' up shit
With his bulletproof vest, still yellin' double S
The whole community is up in a rage
'Cause niggaz be movin' closer to white motherfuckers'll make 'em as slaves
And then they put these sell out niggaz on the TV
To try to calm down niggaz like you and me
But fuck that shit, 'cause my eyes are closed
'Cause Ren ain't got time to be fuckin' 'round with them hoes
So I see ya at the grave where we bury 'em
Even motherfuckers that went out and even married 'em
Now it's time to attack take this motherfucker back
Bring it on, and it's on
Attack, attack, attack on Babylon
Here comes the doom, so listen to the tick of the tock
Can't keep niggaz off your block, don't forget we got the glock
And the sawed-off, and the trey 8's
And the duce duce, and the niggaz in the pen breakin' loose
So Ren will conduct this, but I pull my dick and say suck this
For the niggaz that say fuck this
That ain't down, and step foot into the car
To commit the 187 with the nigga they call outlaw
But who gives a fuck who pulled the trigger
'Cause I know some bitches that shot up a gang a niggaz
Gettin' off the reservations, breakin' up the docks
Doin' this with 15 shots
Babylon, a great look at the bitch while she fall
Dyin' like a motherfucker with no one to call
Now it's time to attack, take this motherfucker back
You bring it on, and it be on
Where the fuck ya gonna run, when the fuckin' ground starts shakin'
Niggaz don't be waitin', niggaz be constantly makin'
Niggaz with no hesitation, a fuck up in this nation
To murder the caucasian, the Asian invasion
So here we come, come, come
My nigga Rhythm D is on the drum, drum, drum
The mayday, oh it's a dreadful day
When no motherfucker can come out to play
It goes (5 gunshots)
Niggaz lettin' off and the shit is all that
So stay inside the house if you ain't down
'Cause you might get caught up you sad faced clown
Then I'll bring ya to ya knees, fuckin' with these
Fuckin' with niggaz that's a hive a bees
We go stingin', but dumbass niggaz keep singin'
No time for singin', too busy swingin'
So it's time to attack, take this motherfucker back
Y'all brought it on, so now it's on"
3,Behind The Scenes,1992,Kizz My Black Azz (1992),,MC Ren,"Behind the Scenes
Now this is the bitch who made straight A's,
But never got a look out of the house back in de
Dayz
And when she was at school she gave people dirty
Looks,
She always carried books and thought me and my
Friends were crooks,
You always see the bitch in her classes,
She never wore pants she wore a dress and some
Glasses,
Teachers used to brag, she was the teacher's pet,
And the nigguz used to brag how much they wanna get
Her wet,
Usless to aproach her 'cause she didn't talk,
But you would say ""fuck it"" when you saw the bitch
Walk,
Ass hanging out by the pound,
And that's the reason why niggaz wanted to get her
Panties down,
She kept to herself in the hallways,
And never looked at niggaz like all day,
And when the last bell rung she was gone,
So one day I decided to follow the bitch home,
Her mother was at work she would'nt get home till
6,
So it was time for ren to put the bitch in the mix,
'Cause back in the school it was every nigguz dream,
So now it's time to get a closer look behind the
Scene!
""All the pimps, the hores, the pulldaggers, the
Cocksuckers,
Gave 100$ bill just to see""
Now I made it to her house but she would'nt let me
In yo,
So I said fuck it, snuck around to the window,
She get into the room and start to undress,
Now I'm biting on my lips saying ""damn this bitch
Is blessed!""
The doorbell rung, it was the nextdoor neighbor,
And he was asking her, could she do him a favour,
She grabbed de nigga's hand and took him in the
Room,
And laid on the back as he fucked her with a
Broom,
He said he wanted to go but then she said,
She wanted him to eat the pussy so she grabbed his
Head,
And he started eating it like a thanksgiving dinner,
He made the bitch come and then he put his dick up
In her,
She scratched up his back with her claws,
But she was screaming so loud he had to gag her
With his draws,
And after they finished fucking yo the bitch took a
Shower,
To wash off the sweat from the last half hour,
The bitch put out some bud and then she started to
Smoke,
Took a swig of Jack Daniels and made a few lines of
Coke,
The nigga said ""shit, gotta go"",
Bcuz this innocent little girl is a ho!
Yo behind the scenes!
""Nobody in ... my neighborhood"" MiX
Now I went back to school the very next day,
And I knew that my niggaz won't believe what I had
To say,
I told them what I saw and nigguz said ""yeah right"",
So I told the mothafuckaz to come over there
Tongiht,
Now there's 10 real niggaz at her window,
Waiting to see a ho like at a matinee show
They thought that I was lying 'cause we waited 1 hour,
And when we started to leave the bitch walked out
Da shower,
Ass hanging out as she laid on the bed,
Her bottomlips was hanging and she started
Fingerbanging,
Her daddy walked in and started beating her with a
Belt,
The bitch was so hot she made the leather start to
Melt,
But she was liking it,
Yelling ""daddy give it to me harder"",
Then he took off all his clothes and start fucking
His daughter,
My niggaz outside did'nt believe what they would
See-some,
And when her mama got home, they turned into a
Threesome,
Her mama ate the pussy while her daddy doggystyled
It,
The family prayed together and they also laid
Together,
I could'nt take no more 'cause I was too much of a man,
So I jumped right through the window with my dick in
My hand,
The family didn't mind and kept doing what they was
Doing,
'Cause now it was even it was 2 against 2,
And 'bout a couple minutes after I was in,
All my niggaz jumped in all 10 yo behind the scenes!
""This is a bitch who did the whole crew""
""Yes daddy I love you""
""She like suckin' on dicks ... and lickin' up
Nut... and she'll even take a broomstick up the butt!"""
4,Bitch Made Nigga Killa,1996,The Villain in Black (1996),,MC Ren,"1995 and Compton's still up in this motherfucker
Yeah, this album's dedicated to all you real niggaz
But most of all it's dedicated to you bitch ass niggaz
Who is it? The bitch made nigga killa
I'm swingin' on niggaz ever time I feel 'um
'Cause niggaz walkin' 'round with they're ass out
So I'll be droppin' funky shit till they pass out
These bitch made niggaz swingin' on the dick
Back the fuck up before I have a fit
I'm peelin' niggaz caps, makin' gang of snaps
Be true to this shit with hard motherfuckin' raps
187 bitch slappin' on the track
Makin' fools break theyself like as if it was a jack
Keep a big stick just incase I gotta swing
The heater is the mack, stashed at the shack
So while your rollin', date is in your force mobile
Just remember motherfuckers the shit caps I peel
Niggaz just a piece of cheese for a hood rat
Falsin' for a hooker and I never understood that
'Cause it's the same old shit everyday and every night
'Cause nigga Ren won't put it down if the shit ain't tight
So listen to the funk as I deal 'um
To a bitch made nigga, I'm the bitch made nigga killa
You know the color the villain's in black
Bitch made niggaz better watch they back
You know the color the villain's in black
Beatin' niggaz ass and it's like that
And I'm stalkin', walkin' in my khaki suit
Tryin' to see what niggaz I'm a have to shoot
This ain't a bang-bang boogie like the new booty flow
New niggaz tryin' to do the shit I did years ago
'Cause if it ain't rough it ain't E-motherfuckin' nuff
You bitch made niggaz, here to call you're bluff
Pull your ho card, like my nigga cab said
Crack my big stick up against your damn head
Yeah, radio suckas never play me
But you can hear bitch made niggaz on daily
Ren gonna have to put his foot down
Motherfuckers ain't gonna like how it's put down
So mic check one, whatever I don't give a damn
Me be ready to slam, when I hit the jam
So yell controversy when I bust a rhyme
No more irresitable bitch made niggaz in '99
Black reign is coming, niggaz it's bad weather
Whenever 187 and Ren get together
And listen to the funk as I deal a
Blow to these bitch made niggaz, I'm the bitch made nigga killa
Hypocrite niggaz always runnin' they mouth
>From the north, to the east, to the west, and south
'Cause the freaks come out at night
And all bitch made niggaz be comin' 'cause you have no friends
So don't come around playin' double-O 7
'Cause your ass might get caught in a two-eleven
Niggaz don't call me 'less the video is poppin'
Only come around when my new shit's droppin'
Niggaz ain't nothin' but some hound dogs I betcha
You bitch made niggaz didn't know I was the bitch catcher
I'll choke ya with a grip
Stranglin' motherfuckers not come correct, so don't slip
Real niggaz don't die, so I'm still alive
Fuckin' up shit in '94 and '95
'Cause I'm livin' like a hustler
Busta, heard you was talkin' that shit so ya musta
Thought it wouldn't get back to me
Niggaz ya shoulda thought a million times before you tried to do me
But listen to this funk as I deal a
Blow to you bitch made niggaz, I'm the bitch made nigga killa
You know the color, the villain's in black"

(Intro: Dr. Khalid Muhammad talking)
""Welcome to America""
Good evening, this is the truth hour
And don't you touch that dial
You stay tuned in, to the truth hour
I didn't come to lighten up, I came to tighten up [Crowd goin' nuts]
(Verse 1: MC Ren)
Niggaz, here I come, black nigga, the gorilla
Bustin' shit, who is it, it's the bitch made nigga killa
I control the streets, shit is all underground
Niggaz gotta step the fuck back when I come around
Nigga, fuck the police, the white one, the black one
The Mexican, the Japanese can all suck deez
Cause how in the fuck can you serve this government
That be plottin' to kill niggaz, they want to steel niggaz
Here we are today, 30, 40 million strong
Handkerchief-headed niggaz sayin' ain't shit wrong
Niggaz don't give a fuck about your three strikes
That's why I give you hell when I'm bustin' on the mic
I got niggaz in the cut of the ninety-one
Niggaz in the streets sellin' heaters, I'm a find me one
And off them devils off from the shack, Ugh ""yeah, ugh, yeah""
Fools goin' crazy cause that nigga 'Ren is back...
(Verse 2: Cold 187um)
What's up, dog, it's on once again, let them fools know
When we comin' through we straight givin' you the voo doo
Keep it real if you like it or you don't
Workin' hard like bugs, straight have know what the fuck we want
I bought a house in the suburbs
Next to the homie Wade, I made a killin' off them birds
White folks straight mad as fuck
Because I'm rollin' in a Benz and a 30, 000 Dollar truck
Yo, I takes mine, yo, when I shakes mine
On the real, the government labels me a flatline
And Uncle Sam gives a fuck about me
That's why I'm sittin' in this phase on a ratin' LP
Yo, he more wicked then a horror flick
Think you won't, high powered mandate to 5 Dollar bitch
Yo, they say America the land of the free
But the first thing I've seen was slavery, fool...
(Chorus: Cold 187um)
So is you scared of me
439 years of slavery (Slavery)
And we still ain't free
But we s'posed to act like we livin' in harmony ""Bring it on""
(Bring it on, you've got to bring it on)
(Verse 3: Triggerman)
I pledge allegi' to the flag when I'm rollin' down the block
In my ride, but it's... it's your rag ""never""
Yeah, I stick hand tight
I drop a kite to my nigga in the pen doin' ten
I put a nigga in a cage, but I'm never on his back
While Uncle Sam straight stack
I wish they let them die like a pigeon in the wind
But every nigga in the pen' alive
With one point to get every three sixty five
Say you gotta keep up, if you on the main line
You gotta hurt some. while you in the chow-line ""yeah""
So if you wanna survive don't let them eyes sleep
Even when you hustle on the streets...
(Bell rang)
(Verse 4: Km.G)
Yeah, break myself never
However, I'm in this so scrilla
The Clinic gang runnin' thangs up, so I smell trouble
Gatherin' up at the shack, cause Ren's got my back
187's got a sack and I got a sack
So bring it on, we get the whole country high
Above The Law the crooked letter, a year supply
Then they get upset, 'cause we set up shop, in they hoods
And start slangin' them no goods
We should go uptown, and poison the suburbs
Have all them white fellas straight going to the curb
Instead they slide down to our block
(Just to get a bit of that Peruvian rock)
Ain't no gun factories in Gardena
Ain't no poppy fields poppin' out in Pomona ""yeah, ugh""
I bought my steel from a white man, my works from a SA
And my interiors be lookin' hittin' corners, Huh...
(Chorus: Cold 187um w\variations)
So is you scared of me
439 years of slavery (Slavery)
And we still ain't free
But we s'posed to act like we livin' in harmony ""Bring it on""
(Bring it on, you've got to bring it on)
(Outro: Dr. Khalid Muhammad talking)
You with me? (Yeah)
'Cause I gotta drop this stuff tonight
Because I'm a truth terrorist [whistle]
I'm a knowledge gangster
I'm a black history hitman
I'm a lie killer, urban guerilla
I gotta be a roughneck [a great big round of applause]
Gotta be a roughneck
It's the only way I know to go [a great big round of applause]

Jesus was'nt white like the lion devil told you
He's the same devil that brought you from Africa and sold you!
Made you take the white men's name and now you're one with the same
Playin' all of his devilish games
Ho' runnin' 'round in 93' with your slavemaster name
Like a Fool happy as you can be
Believe it in a burnin' hot hell
But the only hell you got was in the white men's jail cell
The devil owns every fuckin' thing
I doubt you can't make it unless you can tap or fall or sing
Now niggaz will be trippin' 'bout the shit I'm 'bout to speak
How can you go from the streets turnin' to chicks and eatin' pig feet
Lookin' for dope face turnin' to a hog
Mothafuckaz happy you ain't died from the smog
Niggaz got these white devil bitches for the ho's
Don't bring 'em in the room 'cause the bitches are doomed
...
""And you have believed those ideas and concepts""
""And you have believed those ideas and concepts""
If you see a nigga with a white ho' beat his mothafuckin' ass
Remind a mothafucka of what happened in the past
Let me tell you somethin' that I think you oughta know
He's the same devil that came from ... 30 years ago
Then you got niggaz that's blacker than the night
Runnin' 'round town sayin' their best friends are white
Niggaz like that are gonna hang up from a tree
And burn 'em up aloud and let everybody see
'Cause in 93' we'll come and burn down your store
When niggaz sign up ... 54'
If you hate the devil you should fall right then
'Cause all we're lookin' for is a few good men
So niggaz here we go here we go it's a trip
The devil separates you by a blood and a crip
'Cause he knows if you're together yo we'll beat off in his ass
Go to white neighborhood and start to blast
Nigga you believed ...
""And you have believed those ideas and concepts""
""And you have believed those ideas and concepts""
""And you have believed those ideas and concepts""

9,Final Frontier,1992,Kizz My Black Azz (1992),,MC Ren,"Hey, hey Ren, hey check this out loc
Hey man I've been hearing a gang of niggas
Talking a whole lot of unnecessary bullshit man,
What if one of 'em trick ass niggas
Come at you the wrong way loc'?
(MC Ren)
I'll beat a niggaz ass on the trick just for the hell of it
There the motherfuckin piece of pussy there's no tell of it
I don't give a damn I'll beat a nigga like he's stole somethin'
And then I'll let the motherfucker know where Ren is comin' from
I'm from Compton everybody's on the wagon
I'm looking for niggaz that's thinkin'
That they're the shit, that's who I'm taggin'
Never asking questions I just go right in and do it
And if you're thinkin' that you can fuck with Ren
You bitch already blew it
Like I said before, fools want up in my shoes
But after fuckin' with me
They're givin' up rap, and they're singin' the blues
Me and DJ Train dropping bombs like a P2
So you should get the picture or if not, you get a preview
That we don't take no shit
Cause MC Ren ain't a nigga that you wanna try and fuck with
Kick a little ass in my spare time
To keep myself occupied when I'm not bustin' up a rhyme
Writin that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier
(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren
(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren
(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren
(MC Ren) Ya fuck with me ya gotta fuck with a Mack 10
(MC Ren)
Now throw your hands in the air and let me see ya slap a hoe
Start the violence goin' on through an MC Ren show
I don't give a fuck if niggaz is fightin in the crowd
I only got one concern, that's my vocals pumpin loud
I'm standing on the stage I got my niggaz to my right
I bust a couple of verses
Then jump in the crowd and get with the fight
I hit a nigga off in the head with a chair
The reason for that, the motherfucker he was standin there
Then DJ Train will grab the gauge - just in case a motherfucker
Talks shit; he'll be the victim on the front page
He's on his way to the morgue - to kick it with the rest
Of them motherfuckers that I gave free room and board
So when ya at my show
Let me see ya throw your hands up in the air and slap a hoe
Cause that's the only noise I wanna hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier
(MC Ren)
The final frontier makes an average nigga wonder
Why they do a couple of records and then they go up under
Try to copy Ren but Ren just can't be duplicated
Motherfuckers makin' pussy shit so I come in and fade it
Slap the niggaz like bitches if they have to talk back
Put my foot so deep in their ass they have a hole and not a crack
The shit just makes a nigga laugh, cause niggaz be comin' up to me
Askin me why did I leave size 10 Nike in that ass
I tell 'em I had to do it was part of the plan
To try to stop the fools jacking off by the hand
Putting wack records in the make
By usin' R&B fuckin' singers in the god damn breaks
Try to go commercial but they started out street
That's reason why they're still drivin' their two feet
Thinkin' they can diss Ren's flow, but singin' and dancin
Don't go with the format that I be usin' in my show
It's just hardcore niggaz actin' crazy on the stage
Wearing gangsta clothes yo and spittin' on the hoes
Doin' that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier"
10,Fuck What Ya Heard,1993,Shock of the Hour (1993),,MC Ren,"Always carryin' a Mack 10, know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
Always carryin' a Mack 10 know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
In '93 I'm wreckin' shit so you can fuck what ya heard
I'm droppin' plenty shit like a motherfuckin' bird
I steal gangsta boogie if I gets my boogie on
Put my finger in my chrome keeps 'em fuckin' wit' my dome
Tellin' me to shoot all these niggaz that I hear
Bitchin' gossip in my ear, I hear this shit every year
Nigga still talkin' like a bitch
Mad 'cause another nigga tryin' ta get rich
I see ya tellin' niggaz, yo Ren is gonna fall
But I think ya dumb ass had too much of the 8 ball
Your own motherfucker don't know
That Ren can play ya low, ya didn't know I'd fuck your ho
Now the kid that you're claimin', yo you're very quick to claim
But to me it's just my gear with another fuckin' name
And niggaz wanna know what's the word?
So peep it out, you can fuck what ya heard
Yeah fuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard, what ya heard
Yeah fuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard, what ya heard
Always carryin' a mack 10 know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
Always carryin' a mack 10 know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
Niggaz gimme looks like they wanna try and thump
Thinkin' Ren is just a chump, in the trunk I got the punk
Shoot it in the crowd, I shoot a niggaz in the back
All my niggaz in the shack started fuckin' in the lack
Some niggaz rolled up and said the truce was dead
Train said fuck it, shot the nigga in the head
And it's on, all y'all niggaz get to your post
Train just killed a nigga so we gotta do a ghost
Dip back to the hood, sip the 40 on the way
'Cause the niggaz from my motherfuckin' hood don't play
And ya still wanna know what's the word
Nigga fuck you and fuck what ya heard
Always carryin' a mack 10, know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
Always carryin' a mack 10, know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
He say, she say, who gives a fuck what they say?
Screamin' off at mayday the shit is goin' my way
Niggaz can't believe that I'm so much of a G
'Cause I don't let skanky bitches sit up under me
Now y'all niggaz out there y'all swear y'all can scrap
Get your ass kicked makes ya wanna try to rap
Sprung on a ho yo smokin' all your weed
Fuckin' with a bitch that ya really don't need
The click, my niggaz from the click pimps hoes
Rich, Train block my nigga, Bone and Jubee Lows
Them fools can't even say a word
'Cause a nigga don't give a fuck about what ya heard
Always carryin' a mack 10 know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'

(MC-Ren's footsteps shaking the ground like an Elephant)
(Elephant roars)
(Verse 1: MC Ren)
I'm the original, one that niggaz be bitin'
But fools wanna meet it, exactly what they did it
I been wreckin' shit 'fore thousand B.C.
Back in the days, nigga on your TV
Back when my nigga King-T was the coolest
When fifteen eighty still had that mack attack
It was just head fool bustin' on the west
I was just like the pinky, now the shit is stinky
The Great Elephant is what they call me around the way
'Cause I be stoppin' mothafuckers all day
Uh, king of the jungle, listen to my roar
I be wreckin' shit, keepin' hoochies on the floor
They be gettin' hot, but I don't give a damn
I be caressin' the Mic when I hit jams
Makin' in morning chrome till I'm throu
'Cause I'm gonna make it real funky for you
Uh, the walking black gaint, with the Desert Eagle
But how many niggaz can I fit in my Regal
Niggaz can't get me in my place to live
Because of all the funky-Ass-Shit that I give
I got hypocrite-Niggaz-Balls hangin' in the back
No more think I'm hick, go and make it kinda quick
'Cause I'm on a mission and they know I'm comin'
Every time they hear I'm comin' was all fools they start runnin'
Fifty thousand troops lookin' like the middle East
The shit I have to do, just to get a little peace
Cause busters, they wanna be chillin'
With that nigga that be callin' the villain
Can't be hate them, as I direct my boogie ain't water down
My boogie be thumpin' and hittin' fools way across town
Planners ridicuble, niggaz stay cool
Comin' up with fat shit sittin' on Fro-stool
As I think into my self by I never talk back
As I walk to the shack ""to the shack""
Everyday that I'm livin' niggaz be trippin'
Cause all the funky shit that I be givin'
It's like yeah I'm still here, still at the game
I'm makin' that funky shit cause ain't nothin' change
Niggaz they wanna know what's up, I'm still chillin'
Yeah I'm still the Villain, yeah I'm maybe killin'
I carry my big stick, walk down the block
Roll through Compton with my nigga Rocc
MC-Ren The Mad Scientist bustin' tight-Ass-Raps ""why""
Cause the nigga gotta make snaps
There's too many clowns up on the jew paps
Too many itty-bitties occupyin' the Rap City
So I'ma call Don Corleone with bad news
And make nigga enough of that they can't refuse
So hold your breath whenever I'll bust a verse
And hold on tight cause it get much worse
I set boogie traps where ever that I kick it
But you can't come and kick it cause niggaz might stick it
Ain't no warning down niggaz on these streets
And ain't no warning down rhymes with these beats
A Mad Scientist straight outta C.P.T
That don't give a fuck if he can't M.C...

12,Hounddogz,1992,Kizz My Black Azz (1992),,MC Ren,"The year is 87'
Back in the 12th grade G
When I used to hang with CH to the IP hangin' in the halls
Tryin' to get the young bitches ridin' my ballz
We got dissed 'cause we were jog' and kept to ourself shyo
Because it's all about self
We used to try to get the number and the name
But back then - they wanted mothafuckaz in the dope game
We used to try to fuck with ho's
In our graduatin' class there was no woman givin' up the ass
We go to a dance, we see ho's rollin' eyes on my crew,
But what the fuck can I do?
They would'nt even give a nigga like me a chance thou [why?]
Because my feet was my transport
You ax 'em to dance they start to riff
And on the way home niggaz never gave us a lift
But now the tables turned around
Every mothafucka and his mom would wanna be down
I see the bitches at the clubs, the same ones
They're thinkin' they're fine and also runnin' the same line:
""What's up Ren, we used to be in the same class""
I'm shakin' my head yeah, now listen to line ass
They ax me what have I been up to,
Knowin' damn well I made money for my record sales
I zip on my drink and say see ya
'Cause only a four leg and pregnant mud can be ya'
People that used to hate me
Now when they see me they speak first
But used to demon raps 'cause I cursed
They used to say I would'nt make it 'cause I use profanity
And call myself a Nigga With an Attitude
But once again the tables turned around
Niggaz tryin' to be down - walkin' up like a hound
Especially the ones that never had nothin' to say
Now they talk to me like enow and everyday
Axin' me what's up with Eazy
Or Dr. Dre, yo did he marry Miss She'ly?
Or did the D.O.C get his voice back,
And niggaz think I'm mean when I say I'm not a magazine
'Cause when I come around I wanna kick it
The ... is axin' me for concert tickets
The same fools, that used to go to my school
When you see my on the streets just chill and be cool
So if you really wanna be down -
Don't crowd around a nigga like a hound!
The hound-dogs, they come in all shapes 'n' sizes
Jackin' 'round Ren with a gang o' surprises
Nothin' but a groopy in sheep's clothin'
The shit makes me lough when the homies want an autograph
I feel like I'm on a talkshow
Because they ax all the questions then say they gotta go
Never wanna know how I'm makin' out
All they wanna know is when my alboum's commin' out
Or ax me - 'Yo Ren, when are you goin' on tour?'
I tell 'em 'the same time like I told you before'
Then there's always one beggin' for me to kick hm down
For pissin' on my leg I never knew you you fuckin' hound!
So go back to your home and fetch yo' bone
And quit retrievin' on mine 'cause nigga you got your own
And talk about me behind my back - nigga please!
So much of a hound, all you're missin' is your flees
Scratchin' all day because you're itchin'
You're tryin' to get news wishin' you was in my shoes
But trippin' like that you'd never be down
'Cause Ren don't likes a fuckin' hound -
You straight hound-dog!"
13,I Don't Give a Damn,1996,The Villain in Black (1996),,MC Ren,"Who wanna step into the room?
Where that nigga Ren be at, makin' shit that's phat
'Cause in '95 I gotta hustle for yo ass
Droppin' shit like in the past
Rated double X, you in trouble when I hex
Niggaz that be actin' like hoes of the opposite sex
'Cause fool I'm a soldier with a regiment
10,000 niggaz marchin' to your residence
Fuck the president and his red, white, and blue
I never leave a clue with the shit that I do
Sport the black 80, creepin' with the flashlight
Comin' with this phat shit just last night
The mad scientist from the center of the Earth
Droppin' crazy shit whenever I drop a verse
Niggaz in a rage, wanna see me in a cage
But um, I cocked the gauge when the ink hits the page
Fuck a grammy show and your mammy so now
What the fuck ya gonna do when I bust out the zoo
'Cause ya don't know really who you're fuckin' with
You're fuckin' with the nigga Ren with the phat shit
And I don't give a damn
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
And I don't give a damn
Three strikes for who? A nigga fallin' in the trap
What can I do to keep from fallin' off the map?
I ain't your everyday nigga just with a rhyme
I'll give ya that I don't give a fuck frame of mind
Make ya wanna shoot the police in the back
I'm crazy like Hady, 'cause devils be shady
The great elephant nigga hangin' on box
A buffalo soldier without the dreadlocks
I don't give a damn, I created this shit
With the real niggaz way back in '87
Niggaz walkin' on my footprints in nine five
Fools hit 'em foul, can't hit a line drive
So get the hell away from my throne or a zone
My b-boy stance and shit is kinda full grown
Fuck the police 'cause I still feel the same
And fuck a lotta niggaz bein' whack at the game
I don't give a damn
Who be talkin' shit about the great elephant?
Ren be bustin' raps, niggaz bustin' caps
The bitch made nigga killa, that's who I be
When bitch made niggaz come and try
Be a politician kidnapp, who gives a fuck about 'em
Nigga never gave a fuck, I can live without 'em
Niggaz wanna journey down the black brick road
They can see me changin' in an I don't give a fuck mode
Then I explode, better hide your neck
Ya new whack niggaz never get my respect
Then center of the Earth is where I dwell
Your shit never sell, I got 'cha trippin' in a livin' hell
So back the fuck out my way, that's what I'm sayin'
'Cause I'll be havin' hypocrite niggaz balls hangin'
And othe bitch niggaz, be go lickin' 'em
But Ren just keep on pickin' 'em and slam
'Cause I don't give a God damn"

That real shit nigga'
Living room packed, laid back on the flow
Niggaz can't see me on the madden with Frisco
I'm runnin' fools straight to the dirt
While my man Train talkin' on the phone, the evil curse
Niggaz waste gas drivin' down the same streets
And hood rats wishin' for the passenger seats
Flag 'em down, like they flaggin' down to get a taxi
Too good to ride a bus, drinkin' is a must
Another day kickin' back, the scientist is hard at work
Thinkin' how to get paid, kickin' back in the shade
Or call Will and Temple where my homie down by Zeenie
With the bald head it's too hot for the beanie
Sittin' on the porch niggaz run the stop sign
Hookers sell they bodies 'round the way ain't hard to find
Right in the corner of McDonald's parkin' lot
Peepin' out their hair 'cause that spot is hot
And that's real
Nigga gotta keep my shit real
Lettin' punk niggaz know how the fuck I feel
Pussy ass niggaz always wanna be around
A nigga like Ren when I put that real shit down
Randy up the street cuttin' up the fresh fade
And Compton P.D. around the corner 'bout to raid
The yellow helicopter hangin' 'round like a gnat
And hood rats yellin' out a car where the party at
My robbin' train go and get a duce
And niggaz 'round the way don't give a damn about a gang truce
But I gotta lotta love for my people
And like they ain't tryin', niggaz just keep dyin'
I won't be like most niggaz and just come
And shoot my video in Compton and disappear for a year
We make fools like that shake the spot
One for the treble jack yo ass in the parkin' lot
'Cause handkerchief headed niggaz come around fakin'
Braggin' 'bout that money they be makin'
Boot lickin' butt dancin' niggaz just better chill
Before I tell 'em how I feel and that's real
Yeah, uh, break it down
All y'all busta ass niggaz
Do it like this, 1995
Uh, yeah, come all y'all fake ass niggaz to this
Goin' to the pad hit the beach up on the pager
Here comes Korleone up the street in the mini-Blazer
While the dominoes start to get shakin'
The same time that the barbique start bakin'
I don't eat swine, but I take a turkey burger
I can't fade worms, that books' full of terms
Homies pass by, some stop and conversate
On a gang a topics we start to debate
On why in black neighborhoods is always towed down
And white neighborhoods ain't one piece a trash 'round
So we gotta do for self and quit bitchin'
Recycle black dollars so we can roll Impalas
Every street got their own rap artist
On every cover every brother got a gun tryin' to look the hardest
But some deserve a slap 'cause they laid down they strap
When they hear that's a rap and that's real"

Fools on the streets wish they was in my shoes
Cause every day they wake up, they see me on the news
I'm hittin number one the first week that I'm released
And my muthafuckin business and my bank account increase
Bitches ride the poke and niggas ride the sack
So I guess that you can say they're both caught in the impact
Niggas in my neighborhood ain't about nothin'
The po' broke muthafuckas think I owe 'em something
But I don't owe 'em shit but a 'what's up' for a hello
And ask for a job, the answer is, ""Hell no""
Go back to the corner with your brew and be angry
Cause lookin' at me crazy, that shit ain't gonna change me
But some of them are cool, and they know who they are
The ones that used to kick it with me when I couldn't afford a car
But the others talk shit behind my back
The main muthafuckas always sayin' they gotta rap
Wait to make a record like it happens overnight
But the rhymes are always sloppy and they're never ever tight
Then they get pissed when I tell them that it's wack
But Ren ain't a pussy, so step the fuck back
And kiss my black ass
I'm tired of rappers with live instruments on the stage
Save the shit for parades
And while you're at it, why don't you dress like a clown
And draw yourself a permanent frown
Cause the pioneers didn't draw bands in the blueprints
Because it wouldn't make sense
Rappers doin' this should retire
Niggas lookin' like Earth, Wind and Fire
People don't go to rap shows, so they can hear a band
It's like a man tryin' to fuck a man
It defeats the whole purpose
It's like a fish tryin' to swim on the surface
A big circus, all that's missin' is a tent
Because the shit ain't worth five cents
So a nigga like Ren'll take a stand
To say a real rap artist don't need a band
All you need on the stage is meat and bones
Save the band shit for Quincy Jones
And no more singin' on the breaks, please
The shit is spreadin fast like disease
And for them I'll be a cure, pure
You know that I know I'm sure
So I'ma trap on my lure
Every hypocritical muthafucka that's suckin with the rap
Give him a real nigga slap
Kiss my black ass
Now rappers in the business talk shit behind my back
Just because their shit ain't sellin and people call it wack
But when I go to clubs, I get the utmost respect
Them jealous muthafuckas know I clock crazy checks
Sayin' I wouldn't sell if I didn't cuss
But while they fuss, I'm goin', gone, they goin' dust
Barely standin the light of the lime
Life's a bitch with some pussy-ass rhymes
But they always on my dick when they see me
I think beneath that point, they wanna be me
I don't break my neck to be in other niggas' videos
Standin around like hoes
But them other niggas gotta do it for pub'
Because nobody recognize them in the club
And when they see me they wanna kick it, so people'll stare
Quit swinging on my dick hairs
And as soon as I leave, the muthafuckas start yappin
Run they mouth like a bitch, better than they do rappin'
And I don't need a crew
Because a crew can't do shit that a real nigga can't do
So to all y'all niggas that's down with a crew
How does it feel ot be number two?
Kissin' another nigga's ass so you can slick sign a autograph
And move people out his path
And that's the reason I'ma diss you
Stuff your mouth with tissue
And kiss my black ass"

(MC Ren
Come on and step on in, no turnin' back
While I drop shit that have your mind turnin' black
Nigga I break God damn necks, when I drop verses
And blind your sight, from the shit that I recite
Live from Compton it's Saturday night
But ain't no joke, 'cause I don't play that shit
Niggaz you know I ain't no motherfuckin comic
Droppin' street knowledge, plus a nigga Islamic
Hoodrats they do the hoochie boogie for a fuck,
But that shit don't be workin
When I'm rollin' in my truck, the farthest they get is a big wheel
For real, and bitch-made-niggaz get they caps peeled
When I walk, puts a hole in the floor, with the steel toe
As if you didn't know, now that you know nigga act like you knew
And if you continue trippin', motherfuck you
I'm walkin' with my niggaz,
With the help of 187 on this tight ass track
So step the hell back, and you can't afford to sleep
Because my shit gets deep
(Cold187um)
Ok, time for me to rustle more shit, represent to the fullest
Everytime that I'm spit, get cha lit
Get cha lifted, get cha high as you wanna go
Breakin fools off that wanna floss your gold
'Cause I hate flossers and I hate braggers
I hate short stoppers and I hate laggers
On the real, niggaz be wanna Free Kick It pass
So they can beat your shit, and jack your ass
I give 'em 187 times to try
But on the real, they better off committin suicide
Slide me the tech Ren, so I can show 'em
That I'm not to be trusted, and not to be fucked with
And definitely not that motherfucker they wanna press they luck with
I keep it goin' uncut, and if I get mad enough
I shoot they whole fuckin' set up
And don't say I didn't warn ya
It ain't funny, when you be a victim by the corner
187 be the gate keeper
'Cause where I'm from, the shit gets deeper
(MC Ren)
My shit gets backed up for days and days, it's hard to sleep
My shit is too deep,
Well how in the hell am I gonna deal with new niggaz
That be comin' hollerin wolf, and ain't put out shit yet
Rollin' down the street in my 4-5-0
Throwin' wack niggaz shit out my window
Cause rarely do I see niggaz that be comin' with that funky ass shit
That make you say fuck ay, go shoot a nigga down,
But here comes that black nigga that they call Ren
Makin' niggaz go and act crazy again
Niggaz be fuckin' fools for the hell of it
Some down old niggaz better not come this way
'Cause I just don't give a fuck, 'cause I get in a baby gangsta mode
Bitch slappin niggaz with my fist
'Cause I insist I'm a hell of a lyricist
But my roots in the street
Killin' playa haters over some wicked ass beats
Me and my niggaz come and get your ass
Then me and my niggaz beat up on that ass
Cause me and my niggaz, nigga love the creep
When the shit gets deep, it gets deep"

God of the univers I control your soul, shaking niggaz up
From the bottom of the north pole. In my double S four
Fifty four with my size ten still towe showe to the floor.
It's simple, don't wanna make it complicated, 'cause ya
Simple minded niggaz might get frustrated, with ya bang-
Bang boogie, 'cause Ren heard enough, 'cause niggaz don't come
With the funky stuff, that I used to hear in 83 and 84,
When shit had to be hardcore, ciminal minded,
You've bin blinded, I'm lookin' for some shit like that
But can't find it, 6'n the mornin', police at my door,
Niggaz don't make that kinda shit no more, sippin' az
Niggaz make way, 'cause Ren don't play that shit, I'm screamin'
Mayday, a fuckin' mad scientist...
Sneaky, sneaky is how I creap up on ya, I clear my throat
And then I drop bombz on ya, now be onest did ya think

Wut ya body longs for and fake az niggaz this is who the song's for,
A mad scientist, but I won't make a frankers dine, I just write

I'm wokin' up light and livin' civilized, the messager elaise yo,

But ain't no fools runnin' sprints in shorts
It's just niggaz shootin' dice on the basketball courts
Waitin' for the day to get revenge for the days
Of the slave ships, ya got the bloods and the crypts
Unitin' puttin' guns together
To give white people stormy weather
But they can't hide under no umbrella
'Cause we be breakin' niggaz out the motherfuckin' jail cella
Fella, so who gives a hell of a about the man
The KK Klan, so here we go again scarin' people to death
Knockin' niggaz out with the indo on the breath
On the old English because we use fuckin' English
So you can understand now who's the man?

Oh my God, he's been shot in the chest
Yo, he's a redneck, huh, throw him with the rest
Of the dead bodies we be buryin'
With 2 million niggaz got guns and carry 'em
Shoot people first and ask questions later
Just like a nigga was a terminator
So niggaz know what they oughta do
I won't bring up that Rodney King shit, 'cause that's through
Now back to the blue prints, behind the fence
A gang a niggaz strapped and it ain't no coincidence
Now it's time for the camouflage
And all the niggaz I can fit in back of the Dodge
Bound to go to war but this ain't the Middle East
We're killin' motherfuckers for revenge, fuck peace
So if ya see us, this is what ya do
Grab your shit and come along, we're killin' cops in blue
Even if the black cops are down wit' 'em
Those sell out motherfuckers, yo, we're still gonna get 'em
Because it's mayday on the frontline
Mayday on the frontline
Mayday, mayday, mayday
Mayday, mayday, mayday
Now I gotta play run away slave like a fiend
Because they got me on the TV screen
They said they wanted me dead or alive
'Cause I don't talk jive, I try to survive
Tellin' niggaz what's the deal on the streets
So they don't get caught up in a gang sweep
They gotta let 'em have it
Shoot 'em in the ass like a motherfuckin' rabbit
Because we're losin' altitude
Because they're getting shot down by a nigga with an attitude
Turbulence up ahead, yo, the storms getting thick
'Cause I'm a man with a big ass dick
Throw a grenade in their program
Let 'em know who I am, a nigga can jam
A little black nigga from the streets, over hip hop beats
With a glare and we're wearin' black sheets
Hope we don't burn shit in your front yard
We'll beat your ass down on the boulevard
So a band of shit, grab your parachute
'Cause niggaz comin' in khaki suits and steel toed boots
Stompin' motherfuckers in the way of the process
Or they might get a bullet to the chest
It gotta be me, I got the shit organized
So when you see me comin' don't be actin' surprised

'Cause Ren'll grab his nine and watch him smoke 'em from the door
And then we make a dash and put that ass in the air
True checkin' done by the true fuckin' player
I'm headed to the cut with straight chronic in my pock
Rainin' make 'em kill 'em 'cause I'm servin' 'em spot
And that's how it's done I keep it flowin' like a sailor
My beats are large my feats are star, some called me Chuck Taylor
Then I call the Juvy 'cause I know we gotta Coupe
Don't worry 'bout a damn we got the end, we gettin' loot
Then call me Mr. Dopeman when I'm chillin' in the spot
My niggaz call me Bishop when I'm rollin' with my glock
The crackers call me bandit when I'm runnin' from the cops
And the bitches call me daddy when I'm tearin' up the cock
Yo the title's Mr. Fuck up so I figure that I'm fucked
Got no luck, shit, gotta go and earn a quick buck
Boom boom, is the sound of my cannon
'Cause I'm a nigga with a motherfuckin' gun master plannin'
I'm a crazy ass nigga makin' motherfuckers fall
A nigga from the streets hangin' in the fuckin' hall
I place where we smoke bud and niggaz get bent

Took a trick to the room now she gots ta lick me
Lickin' out my ass hole like a fuckin' groupie
I'm through now I cleans up and call my nigga Juvy
Headin' downstairs my niggaz hand me a 4-O
Smokin' the extension you know it's the indo
Now I'm feelin' high like I'm sittin' on a cloud
The dust that we kick I guess we live our lives foul
Beware of the nigga that they call J-Rock
The party's goin' through but I still got my glock
I'm watchin' for the bad apples in every bunch
And if it's necessary motherfucker we can thump
Or get a fuckin' pump, put a hole in your chest
Slugs goin' straight through a bullet proof vest
Matters gettin' worse if I have to drop the dogs

23,Muhummad Speaks,1996,The Villain in Black (1996),,MC Ren,"(Feat. Khalid Muhammad)
When they took us from Africa they stripped us
Of our diamonds and our gold and our silver
Our material resource, our spiritual resource
And our human resource
And when we came here
Most of the time we didn't have shoes, we went barefoot
Huh
They stripped the black woman
Of whatever little tass-brad she had
Nine months pregnant, tied her up
Tie horses to one leg, horses to the other leg
Beat the horses, make them run in oppsite directions
Until they rip and pull the black woman apart
And the unborn black baby hauled off her
And a no good cracker
Would bring another black woman on
Her stomach fuuuull nine months with the fruit of her woooomb
Take a knife and stick it in her full stomach
With the roundness of her stomach and rip it open
And stick in AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea
Hand inside and snatched the unborn black baby from her
Threw it to the ground and crushed the baby's head
With his boot G's
Make other pregnant black women watch
So that the adrenaline of fear
Would cross it's way through her viens
And stain her brains and touch the unborn life in her
Hoping that the babies will be booooorn
Afraid of a wicked cruel slave master..."

Now back in your cage your wings are short
You tall, dirty motherfuckers dig the basketball courts
I can tear ya ass up in a rhyme
But I won't mention your name, 'cause that's a waste of my time
So I call my niggaz, Chip and Dollar Bill
Scoop up to the hill when we move in for the kill
Never retreat you dirty nigga take a seat
Big motherfuckin' feet, with your wack assed beats
So train ""What up?"" cut 'em with the shape
Make the nigga walk the plank, the dirty nigga always stank
Nigga better raise like the Titanic
Ain't from Atlantic, but I'll make your ass panic
And that's only one step, pride is kept
A glass of piss weigh as much as your rep
Nigga your through
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
>From one Nine millimeter shot to the head
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
>From one Nine millimeter shot to the head
(Da Konvicted Felon)
Quad is kept, I step
With the nine millimeter come
Complicated with the gat to the back of the devil's head
Then I pull the trigger till he dead
Red rum, all I can see when I close my eyes at night
Dreamin' of vision of murderers comin' with butt, while Satan's out to fight
I ain't rappin' to tight
You're fuckin' with a motherfuckin' madman
That don't take shit from a redneck chick
You can put your mouth up my steel dick
And suck until I pull my trigger come, ejaculate my gun
What'll be done, when I be makin' your blood run
Into the stretch
And motherfuck that white trigger that got his fuckin' ass beat
Many be pussy poppin' can't attail for that knee
But not so many as I gave so much a buck, buck from me
Buck, but it gets it up, I'm tryin' to defend my own skin
>From a nigga who loves crackers, so come and ya jack 'em
Sleep with the enemy and get treated as such
The convicted followed no bust, and lust for you
To make that one false move
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
>From one nine millimeter shot to the head
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
>From one nine millimeter shot to the head
But if every nigga grabbed a nine
And started shootin' motherfucker's it would put 'em in line (2x)
(Dollar Bill)
I was never the one to run with the pack
But was the mastermind for settin' up the jack
So if they every saw my beamin' it wasn't from crack
I musta been beamin' them grubs to hit the sack
And let me remember the days of way back
When everybody was homies and no one played that
Rockin' 'em, sockin' 'em, knockin' 'em out the box now tell me what's up
Look at me wrong fool, you get tossed up
I mean fucked up, you lucked up
I didn't come out a long time ago, with the fast or the slow flow
And callin' me wack, no that's a no no
The style just so wild, while your style just so-so
Nasty, they can't pass me, it's too fast see
Niggaz that blast fast I don't let 'em blast me
Usin' my mind like a nine millimeter to abuse
So don't make one false move
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
>From one nine millimeter shot to the head
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
>From one nine millimeter shot to the head
Many more will laugh and suffer, many more will laugh and die
One false move, and it's an eye for an eye
""Yeah, I'm ready to die today""(repeat out)"

You know what I'm sayin'...
We peel mothafuckin' cops around here...
You can't come around here talkin' that shit
You'll get a mothafuckin' bullet in your head and wind up dead
You know what I'm sayin', I'll send you home in a bodybag you fag
And I'm 'a tell you somethin' right now -
Don't come to the alley with that bullshit [bullshit]
Hey Ren, who's talkin' shit?
Hey nigga where that shit happenin' at lo'?
Right up my alley I see things and scenes
But you know it ain't over till the black nigga sings
And he's singin' the blues and holdin' shoes
While he's zippin' off booth
'Cause every week he see a nigga's killed in the news
In the alley all the hard hits kicking
Don't permit the suckerz 'cause they ride the mothafuckaz
Niggaz gettin' high and high till they grw-p (grow-up)
So fucked up - they start shootin' at the cops
So ladies complain but there ain't shit they can do
Or run dead in the house slap the bitches with a shoe
I sell my dope and I ain't ashamed to say it
'Cause I got Benz and mothafuckaz won't pay it
In the alley - Bitches sell pussy real cheap
Waitin' 'round the trick when the fucka fall asleep
Bitches 15-16 got the claps
And crabs in their pussy crawl around in the naps
Sometime ho's would tore jams in the toes
30 ass cloth, with boogers in their nose
Roamin', Roamin' lookin' for dick to suck
Walk around in the dayz like they don't give a fuck
In the alley ...
Hey man, look at these mothafuckin' basehead bases ...
Nigga you pop a gang of shit but ah nigga
Where you from?
Right up my alley niggaz trip cars that they stole
And niggaz outside look for wayz to get swole
Takin' turns, zippin' on the 40 oz
Poppin' some funky shit by the D.O.C
I'm with my nigga little nation or my homey named snoop
My nigga DJ train he hittin' corner in de coop
Pullin' up I give him gat - axin' if he pullin' work
Lookin' like a straight G - with some cockeis and a T-shirt
We sit at the table wrappin' bones
While the little BG'z fight with the sticks and the stones
Tryin' to get a name for the self yo but why
So all the little buckets gettin' the G into a driveby
Take down some rifles 'cross-town
They're back to the alley where they can't be found
Police come around and try to find 'em
But the whole fuckin' scene is standing right there behind them
Open up fire on the pigs now they cook
They did'nt know what hit 'em 'cause the niggaz had to get 'em
In the alley ...
Officers down, officers down, we need assistance in the alley ...
You're talkin' shit but where was you nigga?
Standin' in the alley with my nigga Juvinalle for a while
This nigga try to rush it but the fool was livin' fall
Tryin' to get a name pretended on the wrong wayz
My brother cock de fuck out to his ass in the dayz
People crowded 'round like a fly on shit
Everybody had to stand 'cause there ain't nowhere to sit
This little punk he was new to the alley
He grew up with some white mothafuckaz in the valley
Now he's on his back lookin' up in all these faces
I bet he won't open up his mouth in no more places
And he don't know, he won't go but now he has to go
My brother picked him up and started hittin' him some more
Then every nigga had to get a turn
To make sure that this mothafucka learn
Niggaz kickin' him - hittin' him with bricks
Check it, and my homey lit his big ball bite off his dick
And to top it off he pulled my brother at the scene
He emptied up his click with the whole 15
In the alley ..."

Nigga ten years passed and we still up in that ass

Niggaz in the hood be comin' up feel it
Can you set it off, for again, you know you should
Yo let's that this shit back
To 1989
Where this nigga shoot and bust and niggaz know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers
Egyptian fan base
Feelin' on the scene, all the fools got erased
Threw a mothafuckin' monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't ever been the same
Opened up doors for the niggaz that be thinkin'
That your flows be on tizight
Bitin' what I wrizite
Jokin' when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts
When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me
Yo mothafuckin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright
You can floss for your bitch, but you know this shit is tight
'Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin', who'd you try and be?
I'ma slap you cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin'
Shoot the government before you niggaz started rappin'
Now its ? city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou
Try to block it out, but you never knew how
And when I walk through the crowd
I'm seeing mothafucka's bread
I hear their bitches sayin' ask MC Ren
Makin' fools sway when I roll to King Tet's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
Y'all can kiss my black ass one more time
I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villian want that bomb so I get with L.T.
Ain't nothin' changed
We find 'em, fuck 'em, then flee
While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that bitch, she want me
Niggaz weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Invest in drug money, shit, still gettin' in
What it take for y'all quit
Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot
My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock
Full circle, all this shit gon' repeat
When this shit drop, niggaz clownin' in the streets
The saga continues right before your eyes

Hot pussies and hard dicks it's lappin' big six
At this bitch's house for the very first time
Some niggaz came in and try to take what's mine
Tried to jack and the bitch played it off
She was in it all along, bitch screamin' ""what's wrong""
I said what de fuck de mcten start to walk
Unloaded the click and then escaped to the park
I think I had one but I needed to shoot 'em all
Now I'm runnin' like shit - thinkin' 'bout gettin' hit
Now this bitch, that was hunged up with me
Was with these niggaz lettin' off slugs at me
Oh shit can't trust a bitch I should've known
Fuckin' with a ho' now a niggaz cupboard's blown
But I got away without gettin' hit

Rum diddity dum dum dum
The shock of the hour, Armageddon
Judgment day has come
(Laywiy)
Now it license lights with million knights the divides and canyon
The shock of the hour has come to devour the evil, deceivers, and Satan
Among shin, among men, you wicked, whisperin' devil
Get deep in the flames of hell for the lies you babble
6 6 6, the mark of the beast and the number of man
Is S, see yes you just confessed the antichrist is caucasian
'Cause you made from God and God is man, created on six
The art deceivers made believers outta my people and the crucifix
The symbol of death, the sign of Christ, and christa was weak
He came from Krishna, God of the Hindies, so get weak for your black feet
Now call on your false God, from Zeus to Borta
To Armen, Diana, I call on Ela
You wastin' for peace for a feast on the blood of Kings
You ancient Babylon, America, all form in griefs
As the apocalypse, spits your eclipse, engulfed darkness
The dragon is bound in a bottom less pit
Now fear the doom of death, from the tune of Ruffiah's trumpet
The return of Esop is the legion, the Messiah is coming
The angles over hell will chastise with pain
Those who worship deplicit darkness and kept his name
Blesses to the seven souls, 'round the throne from El Villione
And pieces how you take this to the prophets and the puzzled
So devils, run here we come, ready to fight
The shock of the hour is power when the clock strikes midnight
(MC Ren)
In the twinklin' of an eye, motherfuckers gonna die
Watchin' baby bomber planes rip across the sky
Fallin' on your Jesus, comin' for the pork chop
Wake ya out your sleep, shit is deep, about to wreck shop
Bombs goin' down a mile deep, pushin' up a mile high
Nigga ain't allowed to cry while they disbelieve his God
Fakin' with your Malcolm X picture on the wall
Motherfuckers shoulda listened when you got your final call
Think your doin' the brothers a favor by buyin' a paper
Shoulda read your paper, it tells ya the devil raped ya
Stripped ya of the scripture, blood ya then he crypt ya
Gave you a corner, some bitches, and called you that nigga
And then he pimped ya
You're mind is a waste, so now you got a taste
The chastise bitch ya shoulda took heed of what the wise said
Now you're bent outta shape with no power
Fuck up and waited for the shock of the hour
(KAM)
What's the whole comin' to for someone who was snakes?
Just a gang a rain, hail, snow, and earthquakes, makin' milk shakes
Vanilla killa, 'cause it's Judgment Day
The kinda shit that turn your baby's hair gray, so you pray
That it stop before you drop, for goodness sake
Damn I'm seein' shit that make pregnant women's water break
Oughta make a run for it but you can't move
You terrified of somethin' that a law had to prove
So there you lie motionless and gave up the ghost
You finally arrived at the day you dreaded most
It's the shock of the hour"

Same fuckin' shit every day at 8 o'clock
Nigga, start my day off raisin off the cock
I throw the khakis on, with the t-shirt
Never knowin' when a nigga might hit the dirt
I'm thinkin', how in the fuck can I get high quicker
Mix the blunt with some muthafuckin malt liquor
These niggas that I love, I don't trust em, but I stay close to em
In case I gotta do em
We from the same set, but that don't mean shit no mo'
I be premeditatin with the .44 (.44)
My hoe be tellin' a nigga to peel they caps back
'Cause I know where them niggas hide they shit at
Shit be on my mind, return a shot call
Broke as fuck, it's about to get hot, y'all

Niggas starvin while you're home with the mills
Niggas killin' while you're doin' dope deals
Out flossin, throwin' 100 $ bills
Time to set yo ass up for the kill
Death of a shot caller, who can you trust?
It might be your number 1 nigga that bust
A cap, he's the next one to take charge
Smoke him and his bitch in his backyard

Hear that nigga come bumpin with the suburb
Got my niggas on point, same niggas he be fuckin' hoes with
And rollin' up the blunts when he wanna get lit

That's the signal, little nigga, pump 3 in his heart
Don't feel shit, 'cause it's real shit, he a bitch
Niggas in the hood doin' bad while he gettin' rich
Off this shit we be killin' niggas fo'
Can't make a move less this muthafucka say so
Nigga, fuck that, I'm runnin' this shit
I'ma look him in his eyes when his punk-ass gettin' hit
But if you miss, nigga, I'ma kill you
'Cause if he get away, muthafucka, then we all through
Fuck 3 shots, nigga, add 2
And handle what the fuck you gotta do
Kill the shot caller
Man, you know we been smokin' niggas for this muthafucka

So I'm cockin up the can and ready to make them do some gas
And do some flippin, and all that

And that's the main fact, big payback for you punk muthafucks
Disrespectin the crew, it's mandatory that I buck
Ass down from Comptown, Mr. Shot Caller
Gonna be a fast faller if he ain't a fast talker
Fast walker, or better yet better be a fast runner

'Cause, I'm still the same nigga
Yeah minute you win it, a nigga ain't a loser
It's a black nigga hittin' corners on a beach cruiser
Or you might catch a nigga in a Chevy
'Cause my motherfuckin' shit is so heavy
Rap skits kicked to the curb, they gets no play
When I'm rollin' in the 4-54 in L.A.
Fuck the radio and they format

35,Who Got That Street Shit,1998,Ruthless for Life (1998),,MC Ren,"Nigga who the fuck got that street shit (Compton niggas)
Nigga who the fuck got that street shit (Park's niggas)
Nigga who the fuck got that street shit (LA niggas)
My nigga who the fuck got that street shit (Real niggas)
(MC Ren)
A motherfuckin fiend, before I became a teen
The villain was fuckin' with bitches instead of cones or ice cream
Niggas be killing the villain like aids with whack rhymes
These niggas don't be havin' no lyrics
All they talk about is nines and chronic
The villain be doing that but I can switch up
Kick some unreleased shit nigga pick your bitch up
The villain be killin' you niggas that's running with clicks
Ren be own em'
Niggas be running with clicks 'cause they can't do it on they own lonesome
From CPT to NYC, I keeps it hot
Bitches be worshiping a nigga with shrines and parking lots.
Ten years of damage motherfucking rap god
Traded in the Dayton's on the foe with 3 tripods
The villain be travelling at the speed of light, 'cause I might
Be uniden-tah-fied if I come whack, mothefuckers late at night
Niggas be waking up forgetting the whole thing
Nigga it ain't over till the hoe sing, bitch sing it
(MC Ren)
Ain't shit changed, still making bitches pussy's hot
Hanging with niggas from Compton carryin big glocks
Fucking em' car hops trippin' off some paint and gold D'z
Bitches be happy to hold these
Hanging with rap niggas like Lez and Joe Clair
Niggas from Compton multiply and seen everywhere
Making your spot hot attract the feds and protest
Kidnapping bitches and make the scene grotesque
Real niggas and bitches niggas hanging out
CPT dwelling shots reigning out
Selling coke, hoes taking dicks down they throat
Bitch niggas coming up pissin all you find is a ransom note
New release, promotin fucking police
Crooked motherfuckers hot 'cause I won't give em' a piece
MC motherfuckin REN back at cha'
Niggas bit my shit the villain ain't mad at cha'
(MC Ren)
A nigga sittin' on the curb rats catch whip lash
Same hoes when I was little, fucking niggas for cash
Now they baby mommas 'cause they wanted niggas with dope
Stuck with stretch marks and niggas names tattered by they throat
Some on they tittys, ankles and ass
Every neighborhood got these stankin tricks from the past
They be at the clubs, pussy's used up
They tiitys six feet, there stomachs lookin' bruised up
Real niggas turn the light out
Nigga till they child's through
These hoes today be havin' niggas rob you
Just to come up, so niggas can fuck em' with cheap weed
Makin' motherfuckers go and drop a week seed
Thinkin' they max Julie fake ass macks
All the hoes shake the spot once they smoke up your chronic sack
Who's getting played nigga you or the hoe
These bitches be fuckin' you and your doe
Niggas fuck it!"
36,Who in the Fuck,1998,Ruthless for Life (1998),,MC Ren,"(Feat. Eight Ball and Mjg)
(MJG)
A natural fact:
That I pimp tracks and freak around
The game got cracks in them pipes,
It's leakin' town
My lines blow yo' mind,
Yo' senses remain puzzled
Attacked by the weight of the bass
In yo' chest,
Eightball, MJG, MC Ren,
Nevertheless
'Cause we's the most
My real-ass lizards,
Let's make a toast,
And sing aloud to bustas,
And force 'em to get ghost
And coast to coast
We shows loves in Network,
While some try to impress people
And get hurt.
Deep thoughts cloud my conscience
As I curl,
Up in the corner on hand,
And then I hurl
Call my girl
Tell her I'm drunk
And can't make it
I tried to drink the whole damn bar
And couldn't take it
That's aiight!
'Cause come sunrise,
I'm still rollin'
My nuts the only title I'm claimin'
And still holdin'
(Chorus- MC Ren)
Now who in the fuck
Wanna come and represent?
You bitch ass niggaz,
Y'all be too hesitant
I, take my black ass
Down to the south
Bitches wanna fuck me
While I'm in the Suave House
Nigga, who in the fuck
Wanna come and represent?
Oh, I know you suck that dick,
Acting too hesitant
We, MJG, Eightball, Villain,
Make that straight nigga shit,
That's how these niggaz feelin', Uh.
(Eightball)
Guess wo popped up,
Straight up out the cuts
With lyrical buckshots
Spillin' all a nigga guts
Touch whoever witness,
Strays when I displays,
A thousand different ways to get paid
With a phrase
Days go by,
I be hibernatin' gettin' high
Dreamin' 'bout L.A.
Penetratin' somethin' fly
Down in H-Town,
Or somewhere in the Mound,
All eyes on me, baby,
'Cause I get around
We be like, connected
Weak-ass niggaz get ejected
Ooze like slime,
Dig this hines when we wreck shit
Uncut, coast to coast,
Slangin' audio dope
Manglin' MCs, leavin' 'em,
Danglin' from ropes
Boast, tryin' to be doper than most,
In my profession
Me and the villain, microphone killin'
No blood spillin'
Phat raps with much cheddar
In the tellers,
Eightball and MJG and MC Ren,
Foreva!
(MC Ren)
Fuck that, bitches, the villain be
Out in Houston, Tex.,
To fuck with them niggaz from Suave
Who wanna flex.
Bitch niggaz got kidnapped,
With dicks in they mouth,
Fo' fuckin' Compton niggaz, and
Niggaz from down South,
Eightball, MJG, where you at,
Space agent?
Y'all prob'ly got all the bitches pagin'
Suckin' 'casian.
Writin' left nuts,
Chapstick and lips,
While bitch-ass niggaz spendin' chips,
Just to see the hips
South-West connection,
Bitches bow tha fuck down
Fuck how them other niggaz sound
Villain be hated by niggaz because
They bitches pussies throb
Ready to slap that ho,
Every time a head bob, niggaz be killin' me,
Got that nigga T-Mixx,
Pull the fuckin' remix
If these words don't hurt you,
Nigga, got them stones and sticks,
And some Compton-ass niggaz
To make you fade to black
With some crazy Houston niggaz
In the cut in the back
Fade to end"
37,You Wanna Fuck Her,1993,Shock of the Hour (1993),,MC Ren,"You wanna fuck her, do you wanna fuck her,
The bitch is a ho, yo I thought I'd let you know
You wanna fuck her, nigga you can fuck her,
The bitch is a ho yo I thought I'd let you know
The bitch is a stripper but thinks she's a star
Still rides the bus, can't afford a fuckin' car
Try to be the shit, needs a foot up the ass
Ya stanky stanky bitch get a new bus pass
I see her all the time gettin' kicks from hard dicks
Your pussy really stinks, who the fuck bought you drinks
At the club, waitin' till two
So you can have a niggaz dick shoved in you
Yo, don't know the meanin' of cleanin' your cock
Ya burnt seven niggaz, yo, around the block
You always leave a trail, 'cause your pussy, it smell
Fuckin' ho, ya need to quit thinkin' that you're the shit
Your stomach fulla nut and just flushed a baby
Ya dumb fuckin' bitch yo ya must be crazy
So get back in your place ya little bitch I ain't no sucka
'Cause all my niggaz fucked her
Well here we go in this video bitch
Crabs on her pussy, got no choice but to itch
Yo, she suckin' niggaz dick for two seconds of airtime
Went so fast, didn't see your triflin' ass
Always at the functions fuckin'
Always into somethin', fuck it, you ain't worth nothin'
You're like a disease that's what you are
Fucked the Whole Click in the back of my car
Then had the nerve to leave a stain on my seat
I shoulda slapped yo ass for doin' the same to my sheets
Every week you're on Soul Train
Lookin' like a ho, doin' the same fuckin' thing
Stretch marks, lookin' all nasty and shit
Tryin' to keep down your shirt to prevent from gettin' hurt
But 'cha brought it on yourself ya ho
Ya lost a stupid bitch and don't know where the fuck to go
So quit tryin' to pretend
'Cause you'll get broke down by a nigga named Ren
So peep it out real slow
Next time you about to pimp a ho
If ya wanna fuck her think again
She might not be the type of bitch you wanna put your dick in
But she might suck a good dick, yo, and make ya nut quick so
Never let her go 'cause she's nothin' but a ho
But then again she might start to bitch 'cause she's nothin' but a bitch
Shoot the bitch, a dead bitch, then bury the bitch, a gone bitch
What else can I say to take the place of that?
I saw my nigga DJ Trane shoot a bitch in the back"
