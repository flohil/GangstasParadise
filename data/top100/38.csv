0,(Just Step Prelude),1995,The Infamous (1995),,Mobb Deep,"(Havoc)
Sometimes I wish I had three different faces
I'm going to court for three cases in three places
One in Queens Manhattan one in Brooklyn
The way things is looking I'm 'ma see central bookings
Facing 3, 3 to 9 is mad time
After reconcurrence for assault 2 9
I gotta maintain 'cause stress on the brain
Can lead to a mothefucka suicide thing
And plus my provation a ill violation
How the fuck did I get in this tight situation?
I'm going all out you know moves I never fake
And fuck the jake digger catch me at my way
And if I did burn a bag of blade
Put the light in the air sometimes I just don't care
(Prodigy)
Son I got plans, power movements, get on some real shit
I keep living like this I might loose it
My man is coming home from doing long ass bids
What up Kiko? I ain't seen your ass since we was kids
It's all strange my nigga's locked down thinking long range
And see their names in the Daily news third page
They sent a kite to my nigga Killa
It only took one sword to put seven holes in his squila
A 3 to 9 spending most of his time inside the bin
Reclined, and still came home with a shine"
1,(The Grave Prelude),1995,The Infamous (1995),,Mobb Deep,"Forever wild from the cradle to the grave
Kid watch your back one time it's comin' always
They lock me up for 12 days I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin' St. Ides down with some Seagrams Gin
Life is like a dice game and I'm into win
On the scene from the 41st side of Queens
We get the cream laid up love love for dame
'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim king
Doin' my thing, do wild stakes my namell reign
To all my peoples locked down comin' back to life
In the world once again though ya fear was trife
While you was gone, we was goin' to war and even more
Saw my man layin' dead on the floor, kid I swore
That our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (yeah)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (where)
Sweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' cross 12th Street
Just as I approach the block
I spot a jake on the creep down by Vicks weed spot (so what)
Made a you-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
I had to hurry back so I could warn my man
Ya had me stressin' little son, had my heart rapidly pumpin'
Niggas start a guttin' behind the bushes duckin'
My ears rung, I punch a clip into the guns
Got in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin' from the head I couldn't believe it
We was defeated if it was a case I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin' (the temperatures risin')
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'
So to P I passed the iron
Kid you ain't lyin'
I went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin'
On a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap
Police buckin' at me, they try to twist my tongue back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tried to break my jaw
So where's the gun we saw? (I don't know)
We know you was there at the homicide scene (I know nuttin')
And if it wasn't you, was somebody from ya team
(Chrous)
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
(Repeat: x2)
Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave
Yo, it's the real drama kills, nobody moves, stand still
Bottle you drop that ass off in a land fill
Son bless me with the iron, I got beef
With some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips
Flip 'em like the Gotti clip my crew shift the body shift
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin' sent up north, son I'm better
Doin' my dirt on a low
Fuckin' wit them mobbers like a crowd
No doubt you gonna blow you never know
He didn't even have to go there
Unprepared now he's six below
Why know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings
Get that money I wants, some brothers want to act funny
But it's all good I still die for the hood
For my peoples, yeah knock on wood
Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama what I gotta say is short not long
This nigga that I'm beginning to dislike he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit he might be dead
Know him well and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I screw him
He shitted on my man and we got plans to do him
Let's get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin'
Ain't no fair overhead there we just debatin' on when and how
Later on right now, spoke to Killa yesterday
He said to chill for a while
But it's hard acting like everything is all right
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my sight
A dead man walking not only that he's still talkin'(about what)
About how what he did buried off and you don't know
How much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day my man and the next he's not
Didn't know him long anyway so fuck it
It's funny how things change (word up)
Word up man
Why know what I'm sayin' we gonna die
It's for real, kid no games bein' played"
2,(The Infamous Prelude),1995,The Infamous (1995),,Mobb Deep,"Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah. Hold the fuck up

Niggas get the money, frontin' niggas get
Deceased. And oh yeah... to all them rap ass niggas

Yeah
It's that war shit
It's that war shit
And you know what dun
(Prodigy)
It makes you sick to hear the mobb bang like this
Infamous for the world to hate or play this
Don't give a fuck if you can't rock to this
My duns' heads bop to this
We stand out like a tourist
And make more noise than them other rap niggas
No gimmicks
Just pure adrenaline
Raw lyrics incredible beats
Don't mean to rub it in
But your small time beneath our feet
Straight ass cheeks niggas be askin
For ass whippings
Guns kick like pelle
My big shit be jumping like Jordan
Often lay a man down on the floor when it gets like that
I'm not blowing off rounds so you can hear sounds
So you can run back actin' like you a vet
And swearin' you dead
You survived some real shit
Now what's this it's not going down like this
Ground y'all niggas like punishment
Dumpin' out full clips when we dumb out
Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out
Dun you bugged out I'm trying to walk a peaceful route
But niggas always got mouth until that piece come out
Niggas always gonna think something sweet
Until they least expect you bringing action exactly
It be the Guns, money, pussy, cars, drugs, jewels, clothes
Brawls, killings, boroughs, buildings, disease, stress, in these, N.Y.C

(Havoc)
Feel the gat blow while your shit rips
My shit'll hit while you lettin' niggas go
So you can lower the wrist
That'll only put odds against any attempt
Any provoke uprise you ain't got it in you
First of all you too soft for fastball
Point game track y'all merk like a jaguar nascar
And be out buck 80 on the slow mar
Hennesy spillin' all over my radar
Stay charged niggas getting amped off the mobb shit
Have you wildin' out on some club shit
Fit to make you dance at the same time
Stop and glance
Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea
Young shit with young mind but that quite contraire
Young nigga smart nigga
Who started from the stairs
How dare
You try to come around the way
In fear like a nigga that been there for years
Shout words that we live but don't play with it
'Cause when the shit go down you be like they did it
(Prodigy)
Taste test this Military shit
Bitches love this
They man's wanna dub this
Thugness it ain't easy to find
Shit like mine I'm a rare species
You's a dime a gross
That's a dozen heast the least
Keep silence the most
Regulate with the rest of my establishment
Blast out the pockets of coke
Make the cops boat
I break down your whole background yo
Irons a permanent flesh your clothes soakin'
You feel the shots pain every heartbeat throbbin'
Don't get excited you'll only make it worse fighting
Spent most of my nights graveyard shifting
Make burial grounds be that man grim reaper
With all pleasure
Pick your feet up
Pick the heat up
Let's do it like the crematory
Make it hot make the temperature rise like mercury
(Havoc)
When I feel like getting' bent (Yo don't fuck with it dun)
Imma drink away the pain until the brain get numb
Can't take all my dogs getting lost in the fog
Never to return I guess they heard god's call
And nature don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds
My surroundings
Get suspect we start four-poundin' shit
Picture me up in the mix
With the next man broke and is on my dick
A good man of plenty but an enemy it was clear
I just be another problem that he feenin' to fix
But I can't have that
Pull out I try to grab that
Caught one nigga like Mahadat

Tonight we gon' get this party early

I don't know what convinced you to mention the mobb
Must of been bent straight of the alcohol

Gold Pee nigga with the cracks in his ass
Pretty Tone homey with the mack in the grass
They buck you then fuck your boo where she shit at
Then we profit from it, and spit it on the tridack (track)
Letting the world know you a bitch ass kidat (cat)
And how your own hood disrespect you where you live at
They be hey all day how you let him do that
Noyd and his clique I think you better get at

Peep the big six and you want to test me
Gon' make my gun spit, y'all niggas kill me
Gon' have my gun, sitting on your ear piece
Having your bitch screaming please don't kill me
I don't owe you shit and I ain't your daddy

Catch anybody flossin' I'm airing it out

The Mobb'll spit that shit, rip that bitch, leave it loose
Take shit back to trip who fat Goose
Queensbridge representative, ghetto entrepreneur, stay on tour
Dick-riders, wanna get 'em bullshit
The same law, same day contract, different clause
Don't run red lights, I never caught the blue balls
Gold medalist spit, doin' this ever since
Third time felon nigga, who you tellin'?
Chorus One: repeat 2X
'Cause we Allustrious, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust, if you fuck with us
It's a must we bust, and if you stand wit us
Nine times out of ten son you might get bucked

Yo, the lost page of a wild rhyme writin nigga
P holds the pen tightly, explode nightly
I count on one finger all y'all rap niggaz that excite me
Y'all niggaz is trash rap - wanna fight me?
You shook to death, take breaths and step lightly
Y'all Little League niggaz is so bald they might be
Spent too much time with wifey, come out to play
With the hard-headed, Infamous song torture
Crack your knuckles, buckle up your pants tight
Pull your hats down, let's get it on like papi bar fights
My spiral book, hold the world's most lethal
There's no cure, for what my pen do neither
Bring the fever, y'all niggaz is the rap Justin's
While we was gone for a moment, y'all kept the crowd goin' now
Move over bacon, time for som'in meatier
Your shit's weak, your best song was mediocre
Fuck a penis, how dare you entertain the thought
That you could come out to challenge me in blood talk?
Take a walk jerk this ain't Levert, Sweat and Johnny Gill
This is rap for real, somethin' you feel
You catch a chill when you hear the Mobb bang through your stereo
It's heavy metal for the black people, rock'n'roll
But it's hip-hop though, my drug music
It's thereapeutic to the user, you slam dance to it
Chorus Two: repeat 2X
Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes till death do us
And y'all weak to us
If you stand amongst us, prepare for the worst
It's a must we burst ours first

Yo... crack the Henny bottle while I drop this jewel on your dome
My shit'll touch home, straight to the core you ain't alone
Play the unknown type Dunn, mysterious stars
Concealin them slugs, if it go down, remember that mug
Cause ain't no love when a nigga shit is touchin his ribs
Hungrier than a hostage, shit, we blitz
In formation pack the led up in shit
The better you get, the better we get, and that's it
Yo this snake's in the grass when they bite Mobb anti-venom
Stop 'em in they tracks, goin' at 'em when you send em
Imperial dogs, creepin' through fog
Carved needle slip and you fold, the shit's lethal
We roll Mobb D-iezel, the whole Q.U. double-E, N-S
And when you spot us, play low-key
(Prodigy)
Dunn these niggaz is actresses, and they tryin' to play the man's role
Can't they see us wildin on the video?
Don't they see us in the club swingin' elbows?
Or on the street with our jewels on the cell phone?
Hoppin the sidewalk with Benzes and Jeeps
I ran through more cars than it's sand on the beach
I'm pleased to meet you, now here's a word to the smart
Don't ever let your peoples boost up your heart
'Cause you'll fuck around and get your ass torn apart
Challengin the Mobb in the arts
Our literature stands collossal, compared to y'alls
Way ahead of your time, you're strugglin to keep up
Your style's limited, your rap's primitive
Go 'head with that bullshit you kicked Dunn

Like sunlight through a magnifying glass I'll focus in and
Burn a hole straight through ya brain and leave ya open (Oh shit!)
And let the venom soak in
You start sweatin and goin' through convulsions from dope shit I write
Leavin' niggas stuck, I let spit
Trapped up in a web of a nigga that's sick

Contender number one I put you on top of the list
You're the best challenger so far I'll give you this
But peep this (what?) fatal shots that soloplex
Man down, now who dares to go next?
Like General Monkmonk orders to chop necks
I send a message to my whole clique to bomb shit
Atomic, no time for calm shit
We hyperactive and it's time for Vietnam bit
Ya whole alliance gets single handedly bomb-ded
Take heed to the apostle's warning

It's the B-I-G, T-W-I-N-S - and Queensbridge is where we rep
For holding techs, mack nine, four pounds and shotties
You don't wanna get bodied so fix your face
Before I air that ass out, go to court and beat the case
It's real like that, I have no feelings inside
Maybe cause my twin brother died in front of my eyes
And it hurt till this day like a pain in my chest
That's why I stay vexed, in the hood sippin on Vex
Wishin I could get a check instead of robbin somethin' all the time
It's about crime, but we gotta give it up
Before they put me behind bars with no parole
I love old gold too much, I gotta stay on
Plus the orgies and shorties be blessin me all day
Even at a buffet they do what I say
We gon' start from the ground till we rise to the top
If not dunn, we gon' run up in these thangs with the glock
And pop, anybody jump in my way
'Cause Gambino don't play when it come to the cake.

It seems like, ever since a nigga became multi
Every women on planet Earth got their eyes
On the kid; they all wanna touch
On a nigga skin, they love me so much
They all got P on they brain
And at the show they do anything to get backstage
Just so they can hug 50, and kiss on Banks
After we all get a turn, the broads said, ""Thanks.""
Shit, just last month a nigga wasn't shit
Now I finger pop dimes, with diamonds on my fists
Niggaz bringing me they girl like, ""You can have my bitch
Just help me get down with the G-unit!""
Man, little groupies - they make me sick
You ain't getting in the after party unless you're a chick
And bitch, you ain't getting in the hotel - unless we grip
And you're gonna look fine, plus suck a mean dick (whoa)

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl - I know I seen your face before
Turn around - yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass

Shorty what's up? You know you wanna roll with a nigga
I'm trying to fuck - if you decide to go with a nigga
I'll tear it up - in the tele you'll be loving a nigga
I'll work that, work that - yeah, I'll work that, work that

It's funny how a bitch'll make her way backstage
Harder than the politician on the campaigne
No games baby girl, gotta do the damn thing
Let me see you back it up till you pull a hamstring
Face fuck, girl go for broke
So hard, leave stretch marks up in her throat
Then Havoc on the floor
I don't need to get her number - she'll be at the next show
Half-ass dress, smelling like sex
Dried up nutt on her neck
They don't call us the master of the tour (?) for nothing
We destroy good girls; send them home with pussy soft from fucking
Catch 'em in the morning and somebody White-T'd
And that's the kind of bitch that you call wifey
She'll do it anywhere from the tele to the tour bus
Here's the hot line bitch, call us

Pull out the four-five, and kill him motherfuckin dead
Pump his ass with lead
Never fakin moves, motherfucker run the jewels
Buckwild, blowin' niggaz out the frame
Matter fact, don't call me shorty, kid you know my name
So next time, you see me, you better duck me
'Cause I don't give a fuck G
Catch wreck with the tec then I'm out like quick sex
Who's next, bitch ass nigga?
Bitch ass nigga - nah you don't want none (4X)
Kick it when I'm wicked and all smoked out
The little nigga that gets on your nerves so read about
You say yo shorty trauma, what's all the drama?
I shoot 'em up like their last name was Farmer
Shorty got the death wish, I wish to die
But when I try, it just goes by
You couldn't kill me because I can't kill myself
And if I got beef then I got it for self
And if I catch a body, I catch it for self
To me, murder is good for the health
Little man paranoid, Mr. Schizophrenic
Thirty-five niggaz wanna funk, don't panic
Just shoot a head up, or take your beatin' like a man
Or pull a burner if you want a longer lifespan
That's how I see it if I gotta die so be it
But maybe one day, my luck'll run out though
Until then, I couldn't give a FUCK yo
Little shorty one time, I'm goin' all out for mines
Cause there won't be a next time

Gimme some space, I'm hittin hearts, street sweeper
A little crazed nigga from the streets
Raised in the ghetto, I'm puttin' out heads yo
I'm open, time to catch wreck, put 'em in check
Snap his neck, grab his loot then jet
Who's next to be a victim - easily ripped up
Get ready to run when I ripped em
Drop to the floor, feel the wrath of the drug war

Maniac react with a tec 9
Hit me up now cause there won't be a next time
Nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga - nah you don't want none (6X)
Who's that nigga standin with the jewels?
Throw on my hood, cock back the tool
Just to get a rep, yeah you god damn right
Just lick lick shots 'cause I don't fuck with fights
Back on the ave, and five-oh arrive
Chalk on the ground where the motherfucker died
Niggaz know who did it but ain't nobody snitchin
No word of to myself, if they do, I'm flippin the script
Settin it off, yo, put 'em in a dopefiend
And cut 'em up like protein
The Lord of criminal juvenile crimes committed
Set it some bitch-ass nigga, I'm widdit

Bloodsport motherfucker
Ay yo the rockweiler
Chew in chew out ass niggas, pull 'em on your collar
And let the lights dimmin
And you'll be swimmin in a puddle of reality, juice
Fatality too
This rap is the bitch, you shouldn't marry the two
To the set of prenumtual
Got paid in too comfortable
It's all good, we don't want to humble
And while you shinin in the spotlight

Yeah burn something, I'm stressed ready to hurt something
Burn something, I wanna clear my mind
Look at niggas
Burn something, gotta get my lungs out the shop
Niggas need that, it's happenin' to take me to the top
(Prodigy)
They must be jokin' niggas get they face peeled open
Guns we unload em, Mobb fixtured omen
Plus, we hit mid-sections up
You wit your kids and your woman boy I'm tearing you up
You wit your moms, so what I'm airin' the block
When you see my hand reach for my waist you better hop
And do not fuck wit P, you goin' at me
You better off shuttin' the fuck up, trust me
You got a better chance stickin that Brinks truck
Than pickin' one of us for a hug
We properly serve
Reugers pop and whop ya head
Pens go off and drop you dead
Aiyyo Littles what the fuck is the deal my nigga
Fuck all this rappin' shit let's ride on these niggas
Cause this song ain't for entertainment
This is a street subpoena for y'all niggas bring it
(Havoc)
Niggas knows the deal we clap hammers and shit
Bitches love us but niggas can't stand the clique
And dyke women, these motherfuckers running off emotions
Burn something, I'm ves'd ready to hurt something
Niggas knows the deal we clap hammers and shit
Bitches love us but niggas can't stand the clique

Whatchu know about two hands three guns pop out
Them city boys that be movin' 'caine down south
I clap for dollars and scrap about it
I been around since Dappa Danns, rap vans
I'm a gorilla man, I know you feel me man
Queens I rep you flow let's do it
Unknown marksman, I see through the scope
Hit your frame and your souls apart and
Number one question A & R's wanna know
Where I stand in the dispute wit' Nas, Mobb and Jay-Z
Fuck you pay me
I slid in on you rap motherfuckers cause the block got lazy
I'm from a place cannons burst, police never come
Homie viewed my life, wrote, and got us out the slums
Came home, the Mobb came to scoop me up
Though I rhyme niggas still wanna shoot me up
I'm that gangster gangster read all about me
In your X-X-L's, Sources my crew is rowdy
When them hammers back out we leave the whole block cloudy
(Havoc)
Burn something, I'm stressed ready to hurt something
Burn something, I wanna zone while I'm merc'n niggas
Burn something, gotta get my lungs out the shop
Niggas need that, it's happenin' to take me to the top
Yeah burn something, I'm stressed ready to hurt something
Burn something, I wanna zone while I'm merc'n niggas
Burn something, gotta get my lungs out the shop
Niggas need that, it's happenin' to take me to the top
Relax my mizzy and smoke that dro
Hold her head motherfucker I'ma fuck that ho
Let the dutch burn niggas get split fuck ya turn
I ain't been givin' a fuck so why should I now
Watch your mouth, nigga I'm grown you just a child
In a man's world nigga ac'in like a little girl
It's foul, he don't wanna blow trial, why not?
Cause up north niggas like him get smacked around
I never turn my back, on you faceless cowards
Talkin' all that shit, don't know a thing about us
I educate 'em with the pretty four pounder
But each and every day we get flagrant and more fouler
Keep it thorough, don't want that bullshit around us
Moved away from drama but some how it found us
It's a small thing, let that dro burn
Nigga front he gettin' touched that's my word
Niggas knows the deal we clap hammers and shit
Bitches love us but niggas can't stand the clique
And dyke women, these motherfuckers running off emotions
Burn something, I'm ves'd ready to hurt something
Niggas knows the deal we clap hammers and shit
Bitches love us but niggas can't stand the clique
And dyke women, these motherfuckers running off emotions
Burn something, I'm stressed ready to hurt something"

Bang your head, squeeze the four to this
Get bent, bag a whore to this - good girl, metamorphise it
That's you? Oh my bad, little shorty a freak
Now nigga come up off of it
I don't fight over hoes but I kill for my dough
That's right nigga know where my morals is
We can take it to the street, homey I don't give a fuck
Corporate, nigga shoot up them offices
Either step your game up or forfeit
Nigga never had it, I don't know how he lost it
Keep, fuckin' with Hav', have them ladies on your block
Lookin' at you on the floor like, ""poor kid""
'Cause I bring it to the doorstep, 'ready know the layout

It's called backshot talk, you don't know nuttin 'bout it
Cause you can no longer hit it

Aiyyo yo
If songs is ammo, then we got endless bullets
Take you to war with rap and you definitely losin
Our chorus is like a 50 cal slug
One verse is like a +Cannonball+, +RUN+ - too late you threw it
These beats is like landmines, one step KABOOM
It's body parts all over the room 'n' shit
Albums is like time bombs, our shits blow up
It's chemical warfare, we spread through the hood son
And attack the nervous system
Make niggaz bop they head and turn that shit up
Make the ladies panties wet, you know we get 'em
Hot and bothered, girl I have that oyster drippin
On stage flippin, catch us on tour
Slowly but surely takin' over the world
And come back home with paper in colors you never seen
But at the money exchange, it all turn green
Woo! Oh man! Shit
Remember this? (No doubt, no doubt)

""The bad has been playin"" (been doin' this shit here man)

Y'all niggaz wanna pop shit? See me when ya get a record deal

Yo, if I sat at wrote a verse for all the niggaz I hated
Most definitely, if not you, kill somebody belated
Sound foul with a subject, dunn, no women or kids
Dump you up under a bridge in a cardboard box
I'm like nothin' to do wit it, believe it or not
I'm washin my hands to get bent with Henney or rock
Up in the rep bangin' my chest off, pealin my socks
Niggaz do it to death, I sleep with my 6 cocked
Like Henney rock, one sip, ya love it a lot
While you sleepin', I'm creapin wit the intricate plot
'Cause picture me up in the morgue, way before my time
Picture you tryin' to get my while I'm still tryin' to get mines
Asshole, have ya brain lookin' like Castro
Dunn, I heard you wanted me (be careful what you ask for)
Bitch, if I buck you, damn Short snitched
The nigga just mad 'cause he can't cop crisp
(Raekwon)
I observe the dread, winter time, big shot in my leg
Blood barrels, a big thick Benneton keg
Razor glass full, salute all teflon, shoot wit the left arm
We sleepin' wit nukes, the blood is shed warm
High-voltage guns, nuns wit jums in the gums
Razors, lazers, bulletproof blazers
Yo, remind what the team chanted
They bought the jewel from a don wit a king-sized hat on, slanted
Kangol wit Bentol, ya mental, mid-war
Spill Hen' in the store, that's for the own'
Blaze wit a bent 4, yo these laws is your's
When we pour gasoline all in ya pours and draws
So deceivin, flow speed change, lay him down, empty breathin
Instead of these leaks, we leave the weak weapin
Operation: apparatus, spray shots through ya grey Stratus
Straight up status for maggots

Soldier boys stay on ya toes, be on ya P's and Q's
Keep ya eyes bright comin' out ya buildin, duke
You might bump into a bullet or stumble on ya death
Niggaz slumber, I put 'em in a deep coma
I keep guns 'cause it's like that, you figure it out
I got an arson for niggaz tryin' to figure me out
You ain't a killa, you just talk more, runnin' ya mouth
The type of nigga, we'll stomp out and bloody down
Look, we a Mobb for real, don't let the LP's twist it
Cut me a cheque 'cause I don't talk business
Drop anthems worth millions and spend millions
Take trips with my niggaz to the Keys on the weekends
Serious jewels, pissy off the fruits
Dunn, we move like the marines, move when we come through
Seduce bitches dizzy, half they friends and they moms wanna hit me
Y'all know my stiggity

Homey that's what you get when you fuck with my niggaz
We dumpin your Roley pop loose and we ain't even want it
Niggaz hearts get took, and that's how we on it
Put that bullshit to rest, and never dwell on it
Got me sittin' on the toilet, takin' a shit
With my gun in my hand cause a nigga cautious
Got the hammer on me, gettin' searched by police
Takin' chances, I'd rather that than be a lawsuit
In the jungle they pick opportunities to touch you
Send you home horizontal in a box comfortable

Leave my mark in your town from that thing on my hip

And never fall in love with it (nah)

Turn that ass to Swiss cheese, leave permanent holes
And to them hoes, you know how it go, no dough
'Cause they subject to wakin' with cash and go crazy
Yeah they bangin' baby Havoc representin for them niggaz
That don't trick, ladyless, just associates
Appropriate, no doubt, but bust it
I love this rap shit got me fillin mad clips perhaps it's
Them fake rappers, but they damn good actors
From population, through the math I subtract them
You hear no laughter, QBC the thug factor

Pitbull attack ya, and half snap ya
Kodak moments I capture, like an escaped
Convict, Pearl Harbor, bomb shit

For every dollar gotta nigga's blood chiseled, the slug sizzle
Pistol-whip tight, night monopoly

Handle B-I, smoke a C-I, snuff a C-O

Barely soldierable reinformed the man from Nahwan (Nahwan!)

Hell is the name, two guns that look the same

Pirates, straight off the ship, and mad starvin
Anchored to land and now we runnin' wild poundin
On imbecile niggaz who ain't got they feet grounded
Precise, astonishin shots split ya skin's top
We sent pops, catch you from two blocks
Don't run up on you chargin, with hot shit, he felt it, alarmin
Shockin, surprisin shit, left you crawlin
Dangerous, umm, and ready to rock
This man's hot, your flesh start to boilin hot
Rhymes solid like a lead pipe, that bleeds your knot
Knot headed niggaz get knocked out a lot
Kick down your chain-locked door, we raise spot
My clique got a deadbolt lock, you rather not Duke
Stormin through the crowd, hard to see, comin' through

Spill my over-proof is drippin from my temple

The gun won't fail me, the money won't leave me
Stop schemin' on me baby, it ain't that easy
Niggaz leave prints cause their palms so greasy
Their mind read easy, I see right through 'em
The AK'll do em, like nobody ?? 'em
Stop, it's best that you keep it movin', you'll get shot
(Hook: Havoc - 2X)
We ain't lickin' niggaz, we ain't bustin' shots in the air
No warnin' shots, the fuck out of here
Oh man homey, hate to do you like this
Oh man homey, when the tooley go click, click, click
(Tony Yayo)
It's the young high-roller, the talk of New York
David got my neck lookin' like a lightning bolt
I'm in that two-door Range Stormer
My truck plush, and the wheels are the size of rims on a school bus
I need that Bill Gates money, that's fifty-one billion
Six hundred ki's, that's fifty-one million
Me and 50 in Hollywood, with Quincy Jones
Since the Feds bought Nextel, I trashed my phone
Listen homes, everything glisten homes
Yeah my gun and my rims both sit on chrome
You move your weight in the car, I move weight by the carload
I dropped in Marcy in a Murcielago
My connect is a Cuban named Flaco
With my aim, you a human taco
Meetin' shells, yo the feds tryin' to peep our sales
My daughter grow up, she in Harvard and Yale, yeah
(Hook: Havoc - 2X)
(Prodigy)
You see me rollin', Mack-10 showin' out the window
When you catchin' me shootin' out the coup, then switch your lane
You don't want me creepin' two miles an hour, with my seat low
'Cause I'll hop up out the roof with fully-autos and embed it in your brain
It's like fee, fie, foe, fum, I smell the blood of a jealous ass punk
One, two, three hundred shots
Fittin' to ring off them things off, and cook the block
Old people, the pets and the kids
Whoever in the way, them strays gon' hit
And we don't give a fuck about the police nigga
This ain't Manhattan, this Queens nigga
We're immune to the violence, it's nothin' to me
Fuck 'em - they don't give a fuck about P
If they could kill me, believe me, they would
That's why I set it off, and I get 'em real good
When them street, lights, come on nigga
You best, have, your gun on nigga
Cause tonight we ride (Growl) and you die (Growl)
As soon as I walk up, or drive-by

Guts spill, have you praying to the Holy Father
Dear Lord, I didn't mean to be an imbecile
Thought it was a game, now you know it's really real
When you feel steel pressed against your skin
Ain't no turning back nigga, now you all in
Get curious, I show you how the Reaper look
All ?, when you get there don't be a wuss
All shook, now he the crook son
I'm seeing tears and it's not a good look, son
Aw fuck it, let the little nigga live!
Yeah right, then have these other niggas up my wig
No mercy, shit left me about
Years ago, I let him in, I'll see him out
And now he on the floor just bleeding out
You know it's on when you see me and my team out
We conquer, overpower and crush
Come and get washed up
E's back, easy man, move before we seep that
Lame ass team that you got off of the mat
Weak cat, pull it back, please do repeat that
Queens rep: we got more than a little of that
We used to daydream on the bench how we could cease this
And conquer like the British in snapbacks and fitteds
Getting soaked up, no love, the boy's back, he showed up
Soldier up, you know it up, come and get folded up
Your bitch is attracted to all of this madness
She want a felon, she ain't fuckin' with no graduates
Bad hood, bitch magnet, I'm a savage
They just wanna fuck, niggas wanna talk marriage
Baby carriage, sittin' in a tree
While I be pipin' 'em down inside of hoopties
Like, longer, harder, this Mobb shit stronger
Than all of y'all weak music, we conquer"

(Prodigy)
Forever wild from the cradle to the grave
Kid, watch your back, one time, it's comin' always (Yeah!)
They lock me up for 12 days, I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin St.Ide's down with some Seagrams Gin
Life is like a dice game and I'm into win
(Havoc)
On the scene from the 41st side of Queens
We get the CREAM, laid up, love-love for dame
'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim King
Doin' my thing, do wild stakes my name'll reign
(Prodigy)
To all my peoples locked down comin' back to life
In the world once again though ya fear was trife
While you was gone, we was goin' to war and even more
Saw my man layin dead on the floor, kid I swore
That our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (Yeah!)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (Where?)
Sweatin dogs as I'm runnin' cross 12th Street
Just as I approach the block
I spot a jake on the creep down by Vick's weed spot (So what!)
Made a U-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
I had to hurry back so I could warn my man
(Havoc)
Ya had me stressin little sumthin, had my heart rapidly pumpin
Niggas start a guttin behind the bushes duckin
My ears rung, I punch a clip into the guns
Got (?Raydes?) in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin from the head, I couldn't believe it
We was defeated, if it was a case I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin (The temperature's risin')
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'
So to P I passed the iron
(Prodigy)
Kid you ain't lyin'!
I went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin
On a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap!
Police buckin at me, they try to twist my tongue back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tryed to break my jaw
""So where's the gun we saw?""(I don't know!)
""We know you was there at the homicide scene""(I don't know nuttin!)
""And if it wasn't you, it was somebody from ya team""
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
REPEAT x 2 1/2
(Straight from the motherfuckin cradle to the grave!)
(Havoc)
Yo, it's the real drama kills, nobody moves, stand still!
Bottle you!drop that ass off in a land-fill
Son bless me with the iron, I got beef
With some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow-tips
Flip 'em like the Gotti clip, my crew shift the body shift
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin' sent up North, son I'm bent up
Doin' my dirt on a low
Fuckin' wit them mobbers like a crowd
No doubt you gonna blow, you never know
He didn't even have to go there
Unprepared, now he's six below
Y'know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin feelings
Get that money I wants, some brothers wanna act funny
But it's all good I still die for the hood
For my peoples, yeah knock on wood
(Prodigy)
Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama what I gotta say is short not long
This nigga that I'm beginning to dislike he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit he might be dead
You know him well and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I screw him
He shitted on my man and we got plans to do him
Let's get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin
Ain't no fair overhead there, we just debatin on when and how
Later on right now, spoke to Killa yesterday
He said to chill for a while
But it's hard acting like everything is all right
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my sight
A dead man walking, not only that he's still talkin' (About what?)
About how what he did buried off and you don't know
How much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day my man and the next he's not
Didn't know him long anyway so fuck it!
It's funny how things change (Word up!)

Word up man!

Without a doubt, you gonna hear that thing clap
Dog I take shit to heart 'cause I was born like that

So niggas talk out the ass amongst those who live it
So niggas get money bounce from the hood and shit it
So bitches fuck niggas, they man best dog
Over that now you got some nigga leaking on the floor
You gotta watch those broads
To die over that is totally against the grain and against street laws
I respect paper and every minute that's spent gettin' that shit
So my little dunn could be set
And what I feal about a nigga that's trying to pose threats
Never write it out if you can't cash that check

Can't wait till it's my turn to get dough
So I don't gotta fuckin' day dream no more

Coming up we ain't have much, a lot of canned food
Cereal in the white box, with powdered milk too
My moms couldn't buy me the shoes I want
We put lay-away on shit that only cost a few bucks
Its cool to have shelto, I had the libeaz
With the weak ass velcro, looking ridiculous
I knew way back then we had to step it up
Cause waiting for the bus in the snow wasn't us
Me and hav' took the train from Manhattan to Coney
Everyday and night, just so we can got songs done
We had guns, weed, and a couple of forties
If we got lucky on the way, we could jook someone
We used to watch video music box
And pray maybe one day we could get a shot
Outside, my niggaz had all that shit you see on TV
From money that they made off the block

A vigi, bullet proof cars, supped up time shares
My friends did a turn 'cause it's not they turn
Or how the streets gonna be, when they release fur
When I get that million bucks, will I remain the same
Or will I have to get at niggaz 'cause they sayin' I changed
Will everybody wanna ball, be my friend and leech
When niggaz put me to the test, have me clapping the heat
I used to think bein' rich, ain't all that bad
A far cry from what a dream, was all I had
Do I got the right team, or they riding for cash
Would they jump in front of me, when them cameras flash
Is the 'pop police, gon' be up my ass
Can't leave the heat under the seat, gotta find a better stash
Gotta collect receipts cause that bitch uncle sam
Invades your space when you evade his tax

Verse One: Prodigy
I used to be in love with this bitch named E&J
Don't fuck with her anymore now I fuck with Tanqueray
Tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold
Last name was Ide's and the first name Old
But Gold couldn't take the dick and made me lazy
We split apart and now I met this new trick Dany
Now me and Dany, we been together ever since
Our love combines to form a science, what is this
I bust a cherry, took her virginity in ninety-one
Now that she's open everybody want to tap somethin'
Go get your own don't make me have to fuckin' clap somethin'
I love my shorty more than life now ain't that somethin'
So love you Dany more than livin' itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up they tell me put her back on the shelf
They say say yo P she only wants you for one thing that's your wealth
But I don't pay attention, she's my baby, the Dany
You know she drive me crazy she's my number one lady
Met her back in eighty-nine now she's twenty-two
Actin' like she forty, she said all I need is a man to support me
Besides, you from the 41st side of things
And Queensbridge niggaz be actin' like they kings
Pushin Lexus' wearin fat diamond rings
My cellular phone reigns supreme, international think rational
The 12th street crew move back when we come through
I think the whole world's goin' insane
I fill my brain up with Dany, and drink away the pain

Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
Said the Brinks is comin' through, at Fashion Avenue
At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew
Now we gotta forum a crew, of motherfuckers
Who ain't goin' out like suckers
Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers
I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker
Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers
Diesel drove the the beemer, the hatchback of course
Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
Polo's acting bolo trying to say he the Boss
I said shut the fuck up, the kid is out where the loot's at
Got a big trey pound, picture just to swoop back
Timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
Scope is on the top so you know he livin' Eiffel
Took the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the face
All them other kids they had they tools aimed at space
Levi had the snub so you know they gettin' laced
Donna Karan was cryin, cause mad shells was flyin
Damn all we want is a piece of the pie and
Nike scooped the sess 'cause he moves like Air
Threw them shits up in the trunk now we up out here
Got back to the mansion, to divvy up the paper
Helle Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice
Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
I guess not, and guess what's hot, so guess what
Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut
When you play with crime sometime's it's not too fly
Even though the goods look deceivin to the eye
The end situation could leave your ass dry
That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by...
Verse Three: Havoc
My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip I thought the bitch was a fuckin' warlock
The more she started givin' me the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew then she started gettin' jealous
Steamed 'cause I spent more CREAM with the fellaz
Fuck them niggaz spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy
Then I thought to myself yo this drink is right
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggaz started riffin why you trickin yo diz shit must stop
Moms like you need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day
But enough of that, I got the shake so I need dat
Son caught me stressed out I just be that
But when it comes to Hemp Rock dunn I need that
She's my shorty for life so fuck the weed bag
I think the whole world's goin' insane
I fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's lost it's brain
I sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain
For the brothers who ain't here
Pour a little on the floor son
Time to get a little bent do our thing
Word up, the 41st side of Queens
We gettin' bent, knowhatI'mean?
It's an everyday thing
Henny got my mind in a headlock
Dany got me goin' crazy
Dany take me away
Dany take me away
Dany take me away
Word up
Dany take me away"
36,Drop A Gem On 'Em,1996,Hell On Earth (1996),,Mobb Deep,"It's the infamous back in the house once again
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
And now gems pulls gats
Like a basehead pulls on stems
The Mobb got the bomb run out and tell a friend
Drop A Gem On Em...
Verse One: Havoc
Take a tire, all these fake crooks need to retire
They gotcha gassed, takin' back and snatch fire outcha
Maggot ass, Havoc represent for the Q-B-C
Smoke that ass like a lucie... tho I need to quit
Fuck it, I love it like a cloud
Over the projects your game I'm above it
Its combat, gats bangers and all that
You'se a small cat, whatever you on get off that
I mention, nothin' but the real shit presentin
The hollow tip crew 41st side convention
Try for? you half-steppin
Like a fresh tec out of the box
Yo niggas I'm testin
(There's no question)
Bitch ass have you confessin
Like a D-T left in state of depression
You under pressure, intact no doubt catcher
The snitch-snatcher tookin wit asthma
You casper, you yell my name
That's only givin' me props
Plus the fans that you got, wonderin what's got you hot
It's too not, knocked out the box and got rocked
Got raped on the Island, you officially got
Kick that thug shit, Vibe magazine on some love shit
(Keep it real kid, you don't know who you fuckin' wit)
Chorus: repeat 2X
It's the Infamous back in the house once again

Verse Two: Prodigy
Yeah likewise, I'm tired of rap guys whose faggots
Pure shuteye, and swole up your whole outside
I baptize, niggas get wet, put up your backside
Your claptized and set straight, put on your head straight
Watch out for,
These upstate cats be leary of you
Yeddy niggas wit gats plus the walls on they backs
Rikers Island flashback of the house you got scuffed it in
You would think you gettin' your head shot was enough but then
Now you wanna got at my team,
You must of been drunk when you wrote that shit
Too bad you had to did it to your own self
My rebellion, I retaliate, I had the whole New York state
Aimin at your face
At the gate, bottom line of top soon as you came through
Shot through, don't even know the half of my crew
I got a hundred strong arm niggas ready to rock the shit
Clocks tick, your days are numbered in low digits
You look suspicious, suspect niggas is bitches
Get chppoed up, Grade A meat, somethin' delicious
And laced back up, 2 G's, one for stitches
Then reconstruct your face and learn how to speak again
My Mobb's like a bunch of wild Puerto Ricans
Wit bangers the size of African spears
It's warfare in the arena, you turn arenas into house of horrors
Its terrodome, when you see my click you need to run behind shit
You gotta gat you betta find it
And use that shit think fast and get reminded
Of robberies in Manhattan you knew what happened
60 g's and one for gun clappin
Who Shot Ya? You'd probably scream louder than an opera
New York gotcha, now you wanna use my mob as a crutch
What makes you think you can't get bucked again
Once again, back in the house once again
Live the life that of diamonds and guns
And now gems pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb run out and tell a friend

That's why the coroner came
You never know, when the tec'll blow
Wet you and catch you off guard

You ain't never seen or heard no shit like this
Until you purchase our CD, it's very worth it
Don't confuse our album with that ""Mix Tape"" shit
Those our scratch, basically our throwaway shit
And nobody wrap the street like the Infamous clique
Slash Jive, now we got millions to work with
And we Violators too, so you know we overdoin it
What's stoppin' the crew, only death can ruin it (bring it)
Homey been there and done that, and still they wanna come back
And shoot us down (blaow blaow blaow)
Our advice, you want somethin' done right
Then you better come and do it yourself
We give shooters this shits, make O.G.'s get they gun off the shelf
And blow the dust off they old snub-nose three pound

Shoot 'em up now bang, bang
Don't fuck around with the wrong mayne

Especially me, H-A-V-O-C
Don't want your chick, 'cause she's burning third degree
Plus you snitchin, you ain't got no ties on me
I keep it strong, while you scream word is bond
Lying through your teeth swearing on your first born
Your word is weak, go hold a wake in this
Hit you up quick strictly shit that I'm livin' in
You walk a line that's thin, you religious well you sin
Fuckin' with the Mobb, Infamous to the end
I hold a nine Ruger, with an infa-spot disc
Red dot right at your face, so set sail or rock it
And kept drivin', pull off like the Indy 5 G
In a four time Ford truck with Speed
Like the motion picture, this nigga Gone With the Wind
My crime work, ninja style shit was did
And got away with, escaped it, the Jakes from tracing
Anything that lead to the source, you know the boss
Of the Mobb killing, is like an Unsolved Mystery
Puzzling, nobody knows, it's all history
Madness amongst me, I frequently have to get lovely
Never fails it's always something
No rest, daily gotta rock my vest
I shoot at your best man yeah your MVP
He played the front line got struck down immediately
I wave a Mobb Deep flag, you hear the sound as it slaps when
Heavy load my military hold ammunition
Far from animation, it's real live, you think not
My crew, changing New York, who taking your spot
I put the green light on, your whole click, Island shit
Running through the hoe-house wilding, extorting
(Extortion, hit that up, extortion, hit that up)
Verse Two: Havoc, Method
Extortion is the key I got the key for extortion
Spend your fortune, dead your shorty like abortion
Take precaution, Infamous laws enforced in
You married to the Mobb, kid take it then divorce it
'Cause I ain't got no time for them domestic disputes
If you scared get a dog don't got a click then recruit
You're weak troop, lost the tan in the mist
On your name my shit, take it like a man you little bitch
I blaze yo britches, P.L.O. extortion, you forcin
The hand that rocks the cradle, caution before you enter
This Shaolin representer, carry thirty-six deadly shits
You fuckin' with, top contenders
Official to the bone gristle
It don't matter if you bust rhymes or bust pistols
Remember me, burn a nigga to a third degree
Don't act familiar motherfuckers you ain't heard of me
Just peep the stee and the rap how it's supposed to be
Tap the pockets bag the goods like a grocery, we food-shoppin'
On top of that we hip-hoppin, and don't stoppin'
Out-of-state drawers-droppin', the panty-raiders
Slide on ya like gators, umped that stank bitch back out
And then played her, but that ain't nothin'
Crossin this dog walkin', native New York and
Shaolin slang talkin', rap nigga

What? Young, black, and don't give a fuck
If the next crew get the scissor...

Bottom line, what the fuck you wanna do
You eyin me, at the same time I'm eyin you, punk
Wanna pop the most junk

So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
KnowhatI'mean? Have a situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
For the cops to discover, while I be dippin in the Range Rover
All jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryin' to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sippin Asti Spumante
Niggaz try to creep on the side of my jeep
Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really yeah
But keep lettin them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps I get, all up in your area
Kidnap your children make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got G's in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
Push back, the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter soft leather upholestry
But mostly, keep the gat closely, 'cause niggaz wanna toast me
Yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the con-sequences
Count up my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
Sling do my thing organize fiend servants
Tryin' to make a mil is stress you know the deal
So we sling drills get your cap peeled, 'cause everything is real
'Cause I wanna chill, laid up in a jacuzzi
Sippin bubbly, with my fingers on the uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost never found again my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hittin snitches off with mad stitches
Your last restin place'll be a ditch kid
No one can stop me try your style's sloppy
Want to be me, you're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about making the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin phat whips and livin' comfortably
A drug dealer's dream
Stash CREAM keys on a triple beam
Five hundred SL green, ninety-five nickel gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend
Murderin, numbers on your head while I'm burglarin
Shank is servin' em, whassup to all my niggaz swervin in
New York metropolis, the Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds feels like, the holy beast is watchin us
Mad man my sanity is goin' like an hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced tryin' to bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you
Niggaz who could've killed you
Is down with my ill crew of psychoes
Nas Escobar movin on your weak production
Pumpin corruption in the third world we just bustin'
Hold up and analyze the wildcats slang cracks
They swing an axe, the new routines, be my eyes black's
Playin' corners glancin all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack right
It's only right, feelin' higher than an airplane right
Word yo, I want to get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front you go
Sip beers, the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin, and Queensbridge we robbin niggaz for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build

And when I kick MC's abandon ship
Cause my brain is the sun of a solar eclipse

Sweet like candy, the poetic vigilante
So explicit even porno flicks ban me
And girls gel me like jheri curl activate
The forty dog drinkin' money grip you're dead and stinkin
Brain cells overload when I'm thinkin'
This is a rap rape, and I leave a fat taste
Get off the microphone kid, stay in a child's place
I cook you up, like Uptown raw base
And leave you open like if you just saw Scarface
Like I said it before, shorty scores, I get raw

You broke and you wanna shine, you in a dollar van
I'm in a oh-five G-55
That girl you with's a friend of mine, I hope that's not yo' wife
You wouldn't do that if you seen the bitch other side
We ain't got time for peasants, the streets need our presence
They not gettin' fed from them other guys
We in the hood like drugs, if we ain't out on tour
With Mobb Deep written on the headline
While y'all poppin' all that lip
We does what y'all talk and more of that kid
Unfold one of my knots, it look like a brick
We'll never go broke, while you sit and bitch

Niggaz always drilling me, till they see my four pound
Bitches always feeling me, try to give me some head
While I'm in the studio, try to make that bread
Not a contriet dude, or of with ya head
Yo, 1st Infantry and fed
We gonna give you that gangsta music that hurts your ears
But the fear in ya heart, when you see the gift
We think big, A-L-C we get right
(Evidence)
Yo, every time I rest, I put it all on the line
Yo money never slept
That's why I barely get blessed
That's why I rarely go out, unless it's love at the club
Time is bread, that's what I'm about
And all my peoples got cloud
Check the resumé
One step closer to goal everyday
The game is to be sold not told
I tropping heavingly, world connected got the livest crew
We infinite, dropping gems but no clue
(Alchemist)
Every dollar I spend on wax, I turn it back into cash
Jetting back to the lab, I'm getting back on my job
I'm fully backed by the Mobb, I keep my back to the wall
Keep the blacks to my wall
I'm trying to stack till I ball
Until they cashing 'em all
I wanna stack till this tall
Ain't gonna rap for to long
Gonna have to move on
I'm gonna stash till I'm gone
Green grass on my longue
Fuck a bank account, I need extreme cash in my palm
Smoke blur in ya vision,
You don't know who ya dissin'
I don't learning no lesson
I just hold my position
I don't go with a pistol
They just know I'm official
Shit, all I gotta do is start blowing a whistle
My name is ringing
My chain is swinging
Right now I'm speaking, but these beats are what I'm famous for fleaking
(Twin Gambino)
It's like rolling dice, we taking the bank tonight
Cut your face with a knife, now your scared for life
All I want is ice, a car, a girl and a crib
Tired of doing biz, I just wanna live
Take care of my kids, fuck all that stress
Never wore a vest, only holding tecs
(Evidence)
We sold out every store in L.A.
It's loyalty where I stay, but ain't promised today
I keep my headlights on for 9-1-1
And on July 4th I might shoot one at the sun
Independent regardless of the fact I'm a signed artist
Fuck a deal it matters who comes hardest
When I entertain, It's like I took Sedrick for his name
Hunger is just a different form of pain
I'm ready to eat, ready to hear my name spread on the street
To the point where I don't talk, my trackrecord speaks
To the point where I do a joint, that night it leaks
To the point where Alchemist is a hundred grand a week
Bringing the heat, so clear you understand me
Raise the stakes, up the antique
The better place, yo we land on winds

Verse One: Prodigy
Awright now, pay attention to the crime rhyme Houdini P
Keepin' you niggaz in perspective
Mobb, representative, call me the specialist
Professional, professor at this rap science
Up in the laboratory, here's why your small rhyme bore me
Store bought rap ain't shit, my category
Is that of an insane who strike back (what?)
I draw first blood, it's over with, and that's that
You wanna square off, forsake and slice that cat
You get splashed, from back of your head, to ass crack
Surgical signs to the end, with iron map
Which bring, apocalypse to this game called rap
Not a game but quite serious and yo in fact
You'll be runnin' for dear life so far you might fall off the map
Fuckin' with P, you need a gat
At least to have the opportunity to bust back
First shot the motherfucker pack around world premier
Shook individual bound from blind fear
Scared to death niggaz fall to they worst fear
My retail's in braille, for vision impaired
You lookin' for P, well you can find him everywhere
In a project near you, I'll be right there
I was brought up and taught to have no fear (now)
Live wire niggaz stay behind me in the rear (now)
Cowardly hearts, step aside, stand clear (fear)

Physical damage, crowd control handle cannons
Hittin you ripped, leave your bloodstream contamin-ed
While you actin' out of character, we observin
Drillin 'em down so hard, I know we felt you comin' at em
Hennessee raps float like the Phantom
Runnin' you up out of the spot in which you standin
Never second-guess a cat who hold gat
Concealed, but easily revealed and fast
Body castin raps to get your back snapped in half
And severed, impossible pain beyond measure
Sheisty living brought him to his last bread (bread)
Life changed around quick to one stead (stead)
Face full of fear, conquerin your ice grill (grill)
Tragedies, put him to sleep like NyQuil (NyQuil)
Givin' a overdose of this rap potent
Potentially dangerous, fatally left open
For the roaches, scavengers, that's EMS
Funeral homes, anticipatin your death
That's the dead truth, check in the morgue, you'll find proof
Enough to make you think and stop before your ship sink
To the bottom, night owl leave the mark and spot him
You know the routine, face up before I shot him

Contain drama like Outbreak, you order drama
We outtake and then take you out
Keep it real and throw the fake out
Raise the stakes up, hit you off from the waste up
That's how it is and how it is is kinda fucked up
Butter beats bangin' got ya whole clique singin'
On a corner while it's rainin, 4 pound left cha ears ringin'
Delete those and keep my shit discrete, niggas is trash rhyme
Totally offbeat and outta sync with they light
E & J bent tight, niggas slow ya roll

Wanna be max and does get smacked, show no love
Crush ya team like the bear hug

I'm so seductive I make 'um fiend for the sex
I just wanna stroke your brain
For the first half hour then I smoke your thang
This is exclusive sex we a star couple
On the lee-low though we too much trouble
And your friend's is hot, and my friend's is the shit
We can have our own private party at the crib
The haze the licks, your legs can sit
On top of my shoulders while I'm goin' in
Yeah I talk dirty and we jus' met
But you feelin' the vibe you gotta admit..."
53,Give It Up Fast,1996,Hell On Earth (1996),,Mobb Deep,"Verse 1: Nas
Got out the airport, the Mobb pick me up in the truck
Jury junkie like fuck, I ain't scared to get stuck
So what's the deal poppy?
You heard the feds almost got me
I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiatin like an Illuminati network
Don't catch a body experts and retrospect till the foul connect
When I lost but back then was my fault
Now it's time to floss
Eye For An Eye what's mine is yours
I need a suite with the flowers
Complentary at Trump Towers
Sit at the table we can build for hours
On gettin' riches, a cinch, take a glimpse
The World Is Yours written all over the blimps
Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning
From ??? and prima, loads of women rockin' linen
I got a plan to blow the Hiroshima, Japan
Movin niggas out tha hood and just divide 'em with fam
Ay yo, the bitches like G Money said to us, man
About the dick like the horse with the cowboy brand
Give it up fast, quick and not slow
Not goin' to the tables if it's not about dough
Son you know Mobb Deep is runnin' this shit
QBC, nigga grab your click
Verse 2: Havoc, Big Noyd, Prodigy
Yeah son, I'm feelin' it
Opposition want me dead, concealin shit
Four gats got me livin', kid
Rushin through my pyramid
You secondary, go against the grain then you adversary
Had to bury niggas on my side, that snitch
Ran his mouth like a bitch
Now he's layin in a ditch
Daily dug for himself
On his grave I had to piss
Scud missile never miss you
Hit you, scratch you off, we left Jim Star rip through
You metal deeper, you ain't havin' it me either
It's drama, ain't got time for no breathers
Rapper Noyd make these niggas into believers
Huh, huh
Hey Noyd, what up this cat right here, man
Word up!
The tough guy strong me
I guess he got plans to ruin me
He want ta do me slowly but surely
I beat his fast ass a bit early
Grabbed the biased raid, the shit was curly
Put the drome to his dome
Let him know it's never early
You can slide before I snatch the heat from his side
Saw the devil in disguise by the look in his eyes
He was surprised I snatched him up
Regulated his gat and backed him up
Stepped to the side, P blast 'em up
Hey yo, cannons are rough
You got strucked up, ya strokes slit
So rapper nigga playin' thug try to pro shit
(Yo, kill that nigga, man!)
All I remember was I shot for his throat G
You see big guns and 3-D is haunting
It gets deep, fuckin' with these Chi-nese
Thai weed burnin my hip from hot gats
Burnin my lips from roach clips
Catch me on 40th and Bootlegger in the a.m.
These *?R-tape meridiam?* cats, insomniacs
Four in the mornin we throwin' back some Cognac juice
Lettin gats loose in the blue van blitz-through
These kids too couldn't find the pistol
Ay yo, I got the Lexus, holdin' my necklace
I'm bent off some next shit
Gasoline wick, a kerosene twist
Stumblin, place of my gun right, it's slipped down its calibre
Lookin' for chicks that he can stab now
Numbed up for my fiery cup
I held juice of sin's nectar
Saints found they youth
Mega-action, bitches all around ready to fuck
Big asses, you bought all the shit, pressin ya luck
My pipe games like a night train
Top speed through ya warm piece
??? To say the least
Give up the pussy fast, quick and not slow
Not goin' to the cell if it ain't a freak show
Said you know Mobb Deep is plannin this shit
QBC, niggas grab their click
Outro: Prodigy
(And that's how it go)
And that's it nigga
(If it ain't a freak show) It ain't a freak show

54,Give Up The Goods (Just Step),1995,The Infamous (1995),,Mobb Deep,"Hey yo Queen's get the Money long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast
The fool retaliated so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now who the fuck you think is livin' to this day?
I'm tryin' to tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said ""Queen's niggas don't play. Do your thing
I'll do mine kid stay outta my way""
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
Can't stop till I'm eatin' off a platinum plate
Po po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up for ever but they can't deflate me 'cause
Havin' cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to havin' money to live with
I thought step back look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helpin' ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, and plus a cellular
Yo Big Noyd! (What up cuzin'?) I can't cope
With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope
Yo it's the r - a double p
E - r, n - o - y - d
Niggas can't fuck with me
Comin' straight outta QB
Pushin' an Infiniti
You ask can I rip it constantly? Mentally?
Definitely, to the death of me
Come and test me
Trust me, nigga couldn't touch me if he snuff me
So bust me, you're gonna have to, 'cause I'ma blast you
My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
I'm born wit' it
I'm gettin' on wit' it
An' I'ma have it till I'm fuckin' dead and gone wit' it
'Cause I'm a what? Composer of hardcore
A lyrical destructor
Don't make me buck ya, 'cause I'm a wild muthafucka
You know my flow, you know my stilo
Even pack my gat when I go to see my PO
Jump out my hooptie
Pass my gat and my lucci to my shorty
In case my PO try to troop me to the island
And if I start wildin'
Flippin' on niggas walkin' around wit' da nice gold medallions
But she didn't violate me, so I escaped see
Back to Queen's pumpin' the fiends makin' more Cream
Know what I mean? I'm a natural born hustler
Won't try to cut ya, pull out my 4 4 and bust ya
Yo babe no time for fakin' jacks
'Cause niggas who fake jacks get laid on their backs
The streets is real can't roll without steel
I feel how I feel 'cause I was born to kill
Do what I gotta, to eat a decent meal
Brothers is starvin', don't try to find a job son
It's all about robbin'
So don't be alarmed
When we come through, 'cause we supposed to
If you opposed to
Get your face blown dude, off the map
'Cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth so I act like that
Drug dealin'
I'm frontin on the world once I start 4-wheelin'
Cause back on the 41st side we do a ride
Sippin E & J, gettin' bent all night
Yo, who dat? I never seen him in my whole life
Step to his business 'cause it's only right
Po po ain't around so I grab my pound
Money retaliated so I hit the ground
My life is on the line gotta hold my projects down
Can't see myself gettin' bodied by a clown-ass nigga
That ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest and now he's layin' me down dead
And up from under the benches I started hearin' sirens
I stop firin'
He cut ass like a diamond
Jetted to the cribpiece, what a relief
Stashed the heat then proceeded to peep out the window
Call my son, ""yo son we got beef
But no question
Money had a problem so I solved him""
I got my mind on the stick-up now it's time to get paid
Thinkin' of ways to take loot already made
There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
Gimme yours and get laid
Give up the goods and get sprayed
I got lots of love, for my crew that is
No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them out-a-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't they need to buy a watch
Word up
Caught up in the cross-fire get theyself hurt
While I be sippin' gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th st., my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real but you nameless
First of all slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nuttin' to play with
No jokes no games kid
For years I been doin' the same shit
Just drinkin' liquor, doin' bids
Extortin' crack heads
And stickin' up the stick-up kids"

Quick to put the pistol in your mouth, and uh
Got pounds like got seventy-five to cop twenty
But I'm only spendin sixty, the rest is new glock money

Come through that bitch just force, and lay shit down
We don't gotta send people, we bang for real

A blood stained Gucci suit will be the proof
Laid back cat but I love to chill
Love a freak in a thong with a ? full of?
Said you went to catholic school and that's cool
Let me see you throw the suit on
With no interruptions, ma turn the cell off
Start for the touchin'
And I'm sick with the candle
A fatty, ain't nothin' that a nigga can't handle
I been through it
It's a first time for everything, settin you free
And I feel you your man ain't lettin' you breathe
You a dime from your face to your navel
Your man better wake the fuck up and let you out of that stable
Used to think like that until I thought
? Shoe on the other foot and I got?
Stay home, cook and clean like she the boss
Hell no nigga, not while I'm up in New York
She gonna do what she want, flirt when she want, fuck who she want
Then nigga It's a wrap

Wanna be free throw your hands up (wanna be free)

Bitch front, she gettin' out on the shoulder lane
It's 3 in the mornin', why you think you came
Should've stayed where you was, I don't play those games
Ring on the finger, fatty off the meter
There's only one thing that this shit could lead to
The reaction, your mind'll crack
And put my man's on if it's poppin'
Bitch you laughin'?
Everything that I spit is real
And everything on your inside you scared to tell
The word creep, ""no"" ring a bell
Girl I know the situation all too well
I'ma keep it gangsta, rep the 'bout
Lady caught on, so I had to bounce
With bleach in the crib, all my clothes got doused
That's when a nigga knew I had to get out
Know what you're goin' through, been there before
Relationships now, it's like they got these laws
Girl all you wanna do is just be free
And that's why a nigga like me got these keys"

Got the hunger to go get it, 'cause I wan' go spend it
You know how a boss play a play, nigga I'm ballin'
If there's money to be made, I'm all in
Catch me in the cherry-red porsche, bay seats, red pipe, and
You want me to teach ya how to stunt, aite then
Tattoo's on the arm, 30 carrots on the charm

First night if I don't hit, second night I'm on some shit

We takin' what's yours we do jerks rush the doors
Here come the deez tryin' to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
We're not tourists, hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts for niggaz pop shit
Yo nigga Noyd what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in
Ninety-six strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate my team'll glow like, radiation
With no time for patient, or complication
Let's get it done right, my click airtight
Trapped in a never ending gunfight so niggaz lose stripes
Or lose life, jail niggaz sendin kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off
Well done meat, that said twenty-two slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

We wreck the QBC, nigga rep yours it's all love
Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug
Then crack down, on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound
And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin body parts to start shiftin shit
Never hesitant, it's the crack game unlimited
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me
Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me
'Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin you out in pictures
'Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin' me
All that bullshit, is just makin' me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin' chedda
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, Sun you, then I hold you
Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you
It'll be I, like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal
International to local, Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit, that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, Son I solved em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos

And Ty Nitty, Scarface rest in peace

Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips
You seein clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, cause deep in the abyss
Is street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
Youse the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness
POW niggaz is found MIA
We move like the special forces, green beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way
The God P walk with a limp see, but simply
To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it full for so long, 'cause I don't waste shit
You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take this message
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound
Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground
I could truly care less the God will get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point never diss
Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the burbs
Live up to my word, if I got beef, niggaz comin' in herds

Niggaz shoot, too fast, to pull out your gun last
That's why I like to spark first, and shoot your
Bitch-ass down your next ride'll be a fuckin' hearse
Cause little niggaz don't die son
Half-step and get that ass lit up like a flare gun
Cops they want static, whatever they can have it
My name is Prodigy and I'm known to cause havoc
And when I flip I be on some ill shit
I walk the street, like a real super trooper
The block shit proper, who once got had
Mad beef with the dread who sold me that dirt bag
Mad props to the bad little niggaz in the neighborhood
Long live the short, gotta hold down the fort

Dead you on your coat, then cut your motherfuckin throat
Takin' life like a thief in the motherfuckin night
While I write write, you bite bite bite
Niggaz wanna step to my business
But I just parlay and sip on my Guinness
'Cause I'm the ripper, Mr. Flip the Scripture
Niggaz can't fuck with the flow of a real lil nigga

To all the niggaz that's live or real
You gotta hold down your block, cock back the glock
Fuck the cops, cause your neighborhood chores
If they beef, make 'em bleed on the project floors
I get my kicks from loadin up gun clips
Don't fuck with suburb chicks, I need a gangsta bitch
Don't need a crew, I can bust you down solo fast
And after that, dip into the weed stash
I'm quick to blast, enemies won't last the fate
I kill 'em fast so they can't retaliate
'Cause when I'm not alive who'd takes my place
To hold down the fort, we move on
My man got my back

63,Hurt Niggas,2001,Infamy (2001),,Mobb Deep,"(Verse 1: (Prodigy))
I'll noose y'all, and push y'all off the edge
I'm like Ray Benzino 'cause how I hang men
I got a big caliber gun inside of my Timb
So I can explode on any mothafucka that grin
Trust me, it's not like that, it's not what you thought
You'll be like ""P shot me and bounced in the Porsche""
On some real live Mobb shit, Columbo, the Cappo
I pop niggas, leave the gun right there, I got gloves
Stop niggas from frontin', leave 'em real fucked up
I drop niggas that's runnin', shoot 'em in they back dun
Coward ass nigga poppin' all that shit
And when them things popped out you on some Michael Johnson shit
Fuck that, hammer that nigga to the earth
Wanna cross me? you niggas gotta pay that toll first
And I got change for all that million dollar shit
And these slugs'll be the only reason niggas be hollarin'.
(Chorus (Havoc, P, and Noyd))
Turn this shit up, pump this shit up, DJ mothafuckas burn this shit up,
We hurt niggas
Twirl that shit up, burn that shit up, don't make me have the Nine spit
Up, I gives a fid-uck, I hurt niggas
(Verse 2: (Havoc))
I'm tired of tellin' niggas how the fuck I feel
You know the steel'll put them niggas to sleep like Benedryl
These trash ass rappers and they faggot ass friends
Talkin' like the bitches, walk around like they Men
Niggas like y'all don't get no respect
This is Hav', I die once, y'all niggas die a Thousand deaths
Cowards, you tryin' too hard to be 'bout it
You know them niggas that be fake be the ones to shout it (Holla!)
Talkin' this and that, but check
Turn around and get robbed in they own projects
Might as well be rappin' on stage for them
Bitches be baggin' you, 'cause you the one feminine
The sound of these guns got 'em shook, it's a rap
You could see the yellow stripe runnin' clear down they back
And let a nigga find out where you live at
And then blow that mothafuckin' piece of shit off the map.
(Verse 3 (Prodigy))
Whattup son, dun, surprise nigga, that's how we pop up on 'em
You off point you die in your sleep, that's the moral
Nigga, you know we get our contraban in
Smokin' that dangerous, you know we got bangers
You know I'm dead real, I don't know what you was thinkin'
I'm all over the street, you better stay creepin'
I shoot niggas fair ones, I'll box you dun
You'll be six feet in that dirt, I'll stop your run."
64,I Won't Fall,2001,Infamy (2001),,Mobb Deep,"(Havoc)
Yo, you got these niggas running around like they head cut off
Like they gully when switch when I'm spittin' those dummies
I creep in the cold till my nose get runny
Then I'm laying for a nigga like I'm waiting on money
I ask these hoes what the fuck they want from me
From the gate I keep it real that's why the god love me
I got a shorty if she get down for me, when I'm out of town
You know she holdin' down the crown for me
Dog, god forbid if I die, don't worry kid
Take you with me shit pussy don't want me
My life's story was the henny, had to stop that
And now I'm focusing clear when I copp that
Fuck getting clapped, it be more like applause
Since they tellin' like broads, might as well be the Mobb
The H da A da V da O da C I'm the man
The myth pushing shit to the white league
You can two face me, backstabb me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
(I won't fall)
(Prodigy)
Don't make me be after you niggas like the Ku Klux Man
Throwin' my hoody, you know I'm burnin' that grass
Plottin' on how I'm'a murda that ass
We poppin' up, guns choppin up, yo whole staff
What's toppin the cassette, ain't nothin' gettin' passed
'Cause we gettin' fat, on top of that we gettin' cash
I hear you niggas wanna get me may god be with you
Plus you better keep that mothafuckin' thing right wit you
And if I feel you a threat to my well-being
Niggas is bleeding you niggas better back up off the P kid
I blam you, and pass you to Jesus Christ
You be a ghostdog like forest whitaker white
Be a dumb mothafucka thinkin' P not squeezin'
Like palm springs the only thing beefin'
Is that gumball 'cause I ain't got talk for y'all
I got big four-pound towners do yo new bounce
(Havoc N Prodigy)
The two-face niggas
The backstabb niggas
I felt that shit coming
Like that in the bud gunnin'
No tolerance for them niggas
Fuck the dumb shit, I hope you niggas die broke
While we in the plushes
Hotel Suites
Expensive car seats
Windows half-down bumpin' out mobb beatz
With a bad bitch beside me
Raisin' up the volume
Know they hate to see that
And that's why we come through"
65,I'm Going Out,1999,Murda Muzik (1999),,Mobb Deep,"Going out nigga
Big guns and sharp knives
Revolvers 'cause automatics jam at the wrong time (I'm going out)
Like fights with the brass knuckles
Swinging belts catching niggas with the buckle now fuck it (I'm going out)
Like I ain't got nothing to live
Like as if you had guns to my kids fuck it (going all out)
Yo you know the type that style and shit that rise my dick
Pop me a nigga quicker than police
Leave more wounds than a whole room full of chicks
You running while I'm gunning 'cause you a bitch
I heard niggas talking like they goinng to dead mines
I got enough guns we can make the headlines
I'm from a place where the realeast niggas get murdered
And the illest niggas try to avoid it
But can't call it
It's a cold world bundle up
Keep your heat on at all times
And never freeze up
And your eyes blink you could catch a hole in your tank
Have you leaking all over the place
Watch how you speak
And watch how you move through the streets
I got a mob with niggas with heat
We live but ah squeeze 'fore we think
Breath 'fore is too late
Uph you fucked up and got laid to sleep
I'm going out
With big guns and sharp knives
Revolvers 'cause automatics jam at the wrong time (I'm going out)
Like fights with the brass knuckles
Swinging belts catching niggas with the buckle now fuck it (I'm going out)

Like as if you had guns at my kids fuck it (going all out)
For the big checks and large faces mantions
And my duns would do the same for me
I'm going out like a nigga that he never have nothing
Fuck it I ain't frontive
If I want to know I got to go out like a navy seal
Label me ill
You sling thrills
Meet you on top of the hills
Screaming dollar bill
Going out like a nigga you just smacked
His moms in the cut plotting patient and calm
Putting on everything that I love and stand for
Getting ben up in the pub till five in the morn
Going out like a nigga with six days to live
And like a single parents raising a kid now that's a big
Going out like a nigga with shit touching his rib
You got more than nesessary dun a nigga went dead
Going out for my niggas see this gat in my hand
You better back the fuck up what part didn't you understand
Head nah aim straight at your thighro glands
Must've not been really your men those niggas that ran (I'm going out)

We do it well click niggas like nails
Catch cases skip bells

Die in the sitel
Pop gun with the shitel
Fuck a bitch just to getsel
Rap style smoother than cl
In the k on the dl
Line for line you can detail
Choked more niggas than Sprewell
Rap style pelo
Watch me blow like tornados
Clear the block out with just an echo
Trust me niggas don't want me see let go
Niggas don't want to see the tech blow
Watch me blow the crowd like techno music nigga
When it come to murder you know we do it for the chorus
Fuck lying on the lord ain't worth dying for
I rather die fucking raw
Or walking on a mine in the cold war
My dogs got my shoulders with t up machine guns
All my niggas soldiers
With big grenades throw them in your rober
Send prodigy to check the scence when it's over
Niggas animals coming back for leftovers (all out nigga)
I'm going out With Big guns and sharp knives

I ain't letting' you go this time, nah you gonna stay right here
I'ma call you money baby, money
(Verse - Havoc)
It started bout 7 when I realized ya worth
Sold drugs to put you all alone with this purse
Took a backseat, cause family came first
Holes in my sneakers and shirt
I turned 13, now lil' niggaz sellin' coke
50 4 1l's yeah I copped 'em for them hoes
But you left without warning, I guess it was a lesson
I had you but you showed me no affection
Got withdrawals, took you to the malls
The more I got of you, the more I got spoiled
Now my toes curl, lets have a baby boy or girl
Had you in Switzerland, half across the world
Grew up an investment and you can't be doubled
Came back around when I bubbled
Now I'm in trouble, took the wrong turn
Let my homie borrow you, now he won't pick up his phone
Where you goin' baby where you goin'
Talk about money this is money baby where you goin'
I can hold you baby I can hold you let me hold you
(Chorus - Prodigy - 2X)
The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down, you give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours
(Verse - Prodigy)
You give me sex, you give me gifts
You give me head from every baddest bitch
You make me happy you make me sick
Cause baby you my drug and I need my fix
If I ain't have you how would I live
To get you I'd risk that time in prison
To get you I'd take risks that'd mean death
I'ma love you until the end
It's all about you my precious,
I'd never ignore you for a bitch again
I'd put that on my honest,
Got these other nigga jealous cause you all over me
In public, you be all inside my jeans
Took me all over the planet, places like Europe
Taught me new tricks at them banks out in ??
These niggaz, back in the hood
Could never have you like how I do
(Chorus - Prodigy - 2X)
The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down, you give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours
I need you, I need you in my life

Ain't nothin' over there for you
Stay right here with us you in good hands right here"

Get that loot up, no doubt I bail mines
Easy access
Shorty straight up hit the mattress
Have you role playin' just like a actress
My tactics leavin' niggas stuck doin' back flips
I black out
Take it to the gats
Fuck this rap shit
Let my niggas shine
Rate my rhymes like a dime
Swollen bullet wounds, head ass niggas

Yo,
Who's the one to be made into example
Nigga you pop shit wit the wrong guys this time
What! (gunshots)
My mobb'll get on top ya, topple ya

Ten years later still hold a firm ground
Nigga P thugly
Enter the ring wit something for anyone who wanna play gun
What up G?
I'll clap you stop in your tracks, how about that?
Now analyze these cats wit live nigga rap
You seen strapped, came outside all hype wit gats
Got juiced up, now bishop think he thuggin' it black pimp
Let's rap a taste
You get your little head pinched off
Brooklyn touched you, then left you for Queens to finish off
Fuck a ----- Keith Murray and his whole clique
Yeah, you snuffed me in front of the cops, that bullshit
Told you come around the corner, no police and no witnesses
Little to your knowledge
You almost got shot but that's aiight though
I'm a catch ya ass again

You with me lil' mama, let's breeze lil' mama
We start with a lil' bit and take it to a lotta that
Love gettin' hotter you can if you wanna
Have it all it's yours just ask and you got it
The trillion cuts, the Audi and Porsche trucks
I do these things for you 'cause you my dunn
Girl, feel special 'cause I don't spend
Nuttin but time with certain other broads I rip
You belong in minks, bracelets and rings
Not handcuffs forget about that locket chain
And just leave lil' mama, this P lil' mama
I ain't them, I'm me lil' mama
My baby, you crazy and I'm hooked
Your body right, your smile light up the room
That man you got, that nigga's a fool
Guess one man's trash is a next man's jewel

This is my way to live (It's all right)

Yo, yo...
When we first middle sex fif, knew that you was that chick
Wooly sayin' holla at her, whip sayin' girl get in
Remind me of a women that, I can have without the stress
Asked if she had a man, couldn't tell if no or yes
Hell, I jus dipped her number and talked more
When I hit you one conversation, I knew that she had trust issues
Who the hell would do that, man cheated on her twice
Last one before that, found out homie had a wife
Looked so secure, but yet so delicate
Can't come back in the crib without a search for evidence
Baby girl, I ain't here to hurt you, here to protect and serve you
Ain't your fool model them other dudes don't deserve you
What you tryin' to do, scare me off and leave you low
Funny how you let it ring and never answer your phone
The accuser got me curious, I asked who it was
He like the ""sold-a-soul"" man, who the fuck you 'cause? I'm out...
(Mary J. Blige)
Everytime I hurt you it's because of what someone else has done to me
And I know it's not really fair
Though I just can't trust you 'cause I just got outta something I'm not running
Boy you know that I'm running scared
You treat me so good that its just too good to be true
And I don't think that I really deserve
To be treated like a woman should
'Cause I been so hurtin' the past I'm still carryin' bags

We can ball to the fullest baby... it's all right... it's all right...

Yo... straight thugs on this side - it's do or die to the death
Like the terminal ill takin' they last breath
Read your last rites - God, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit - takin' a life
Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin my will - you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids
Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggaz love to see when
Niggaz slippin off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin your ice, appraisin it like the Diamond District Jeweler
With they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, wanna get caught lifted; or sober, so you can react quick?
Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you fuckin' my wife
On my thousand dollar mattress
It's the world that I live in, Q.B. made me
A moms that loved me and a pops that raised me
Chorus: Nas {singing to the chorus of Brandy's ""The Boy is Mine""}
Y'all need to give it up... we don't give a fuck...
What y'all niggaz want... thug, life, is, mine

I got the style of a still-born child, I'm ill
If it's beef, poke him with the fork, make sure he's done well
(Very very) The sreets raised me crazy, now I'm immune to it
So when they start shootin, we'll stop the music
Keep it moving that's how we do it (c'mon, c'mon Dunn)
Been through more drama than the Baldwins, you still crawlin
(Still crawlin) Apply street rules to the office, high performance
Rap author, made millions off of - melodic, hypnotic productions
That'll fuck with your conscience and touch your emotions
(You feel me? You feel me?)
You feel me? I'll write a graphic page
Escort niggaz to they grave, relate to the projects
We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music
(Don't get no realer than this!)
It's more real than any words I can muster
Pull the black Cadillac trucks up (What?)
Hop out them shits like what? Y'all niggaz can't touch us
(Nas Escobar)
Silk shirts on my chest show what a flirt
Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert
Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing
And I'll front like my doo doo don't stink
Instinct like Cuba Gooding steppin out the latest toy
Hazard lights blinkin, gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
Cause today goes either way - we came a long way
From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, NexTel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters
Wake up, guns under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
NAStradamus, last one to blast one when the NARC's come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat, comin' and flee with the murder weapon
I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson
Your flesh turn to maggots, bastards, you past it
Cremate your flesh to ashes
You don't need a suit, no wake, no funeral, and no casket

You could catch P laid back, in triple black trucks
Or catch him swingin' pain (?) bottles in the club
Won't catch me with the police without cuffs
Can't press me into no threatenin position
Probably spot me, steppin out the tree spot tough
Catch P fixin his pants, it's cause of his gun
You see the God, big ol' chains, but can't stick him
'Cause they know I shoot niggaz like Slick Rick and them
Source at the thug events, y'know we hittin them
Caught him spendin fake hundreds at the bar, we was gettin' them
Drugs in my system, all types of shit
Keeps me where I wanna be, don't get me started on that
Just peep how aggressive my niggaz is with this
And check how we set up shop to get our chips
Niggaz study our verse like college kids (word)
We know you love our style, get off our dick

Believe me my hammer don't give a damn what you been through
It's a cold cold world, my whole life was a winter
Never gave a fuck about the cold (nah) draped in thermal
Don't put your nose in things don't concern you
This grown man business, y'all niggaz so childish
I'm in the cut, analyzin while you fools is wildin
Pickin' my mark, and I'ma clap my heat off the grip
Murder so clean you can eat off the shit

Guess you don't know a nigga till you catch a case with 'em
It ain't all gravy just because you make cake with 'em
It's real, niggaz scared to death of state prison
To the end when a nigga get caught start snitchin'
Imagine the eyes of a nigga that you knew
For about 20 joints with the nerve to point
Hurt worser than that physical pain
You fed this nigga rolled with the sorry fuck now he switchin' to lame
Niggaz in the box could relate to my pain
All I got is my word and I'ma get you that's my word
Through family friends or even fuckin' your bird
Fuck it anything long as your death occur
Whatever happened to death before dishonor

While you frontin in that rental, cuddling
With that weak ass bitch, damn right she snitch
And if I had in my misdt, she'd be biting shit
Cause a ho gonna be a ho
A nigga gonna be a nigga
No matter what the fuck you think
Got cash in my escrow, never gonna let it go

Chillin' at the crib layin in my boxers
While shorty got bent spittin' tha latest gossip
Didn't want to hear it in the middle cut her off
Lit a stog, smacked her ass, grabbed her by the draws
Bugged in the head but her looks turned me on
She tried to turn me on with edible thongs
Plus I like the way she sounded when repeatin my songs
From Queens to get to her crib didn't take long.
Said she had a man but was lcoked up in Attica
Freak off with the VCR to my camera
Afterw that shit that happened to Tupac.
Yell rape? Show 'em the tape jus playin' my part.
Opposed to being on tape but the G that I ran
Had her tongue in my ear and my dick in her hand
When I thought I knew I shoulda brought my fam
Bring her to the lowest level and shared it with my man's"

Quick to jump it off, on the beaches, the bleachers
And premiere features, moanin' sounds like creatures
Get up in your guts, have me screwin' up your features

Take it to the game, so we can fuck in the nose bleeders

Show you a whole new world, as I guide you in

Give it up? Huh, you don't believe that
So I threw on my hood, pulled out the banger
Swung it at the kids, that put me in danger
They put away them blades and said,
""Why it gotta be like that?""
Cause you get a little ox, and don't know how to act
Yeah, now I got props, and I'm runnin' shit
And when it comes to phone time, you don't get none of it
So sit back and just chill
Before you make a lil nigga have to get, ill
Only got a month left, so I gotta be on my best
But yet and still herb niggaz wanna put me to the test
So I wild, with a blade and a Kool-Aid smile
Let the juvenile catch wreck for a sec
Damn, I wish I could put my hands on a
Nice-ass tec, and blow a nigga to Babylon
But if you don't, got a knuckle game that's a damn shame
Nigga ? for, they got you washin drawers
But I refuse, 'cause I got nuttin to lose
Props I gotta earn, plus I gotta pay my dues
So in the meantime, I got a ox in my pocket
They got me locked in Spofford
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
To Spofford, and JV's worse than Rikers
Adolescents that ball hardcore
With the criminal minded juveniles
The real lil niggaz step out of the piles
And I'm not takin' no shorts while I'm up here
Spit 'em up, gem stars, but ain't no scars here
Protective custody's got mines
No type of help, I'm in here for self
And so I got locked up on a one to two
On the bus, catchin beef with mad crews
Run my shoes, fuck that, I'm goin' out kid
But not too buckwild, 'cause I gotta finish my bid
Four times, for my peoples up from the 'Bridge
Here, it takes a lot of heart to live
Behind bars, child correction
Trapped in the buckwild ? East section
They got me smokin' the death sticks
Niggaz got me fightin for my life, cause shit is real
Shorty kill a man got locked down
You want a buck sixty, you betta betta back down
On the streets a hood, but in here
You're up to no damn good, nigga I wish you would
Try to take mines, and try to shank mines
Shorty corrupt, there's no stoppin' me
Even in jail, I tear shit up
And when I get out, it's gonna get worse
The devil in the flesh
I'm puttin' hammers on a hearse
So while I'm in here, don't forget my name
Ain't shit changed, I'm still the motherfuckin same
I couldn't bitch up when I got here
Cell wreck, I got shit locked here
One more month I'm goin' Uptown
To the big pen, and I'ma still win
Cause jail is my life, and I like it here
Ain't no rules, you can do what you like in here
Jailhouse blues, I miss the ghetto
C.O.'s think they're five-oh's with no heat
So what am I to do when they step
Put 'em in check, and throw hands with a redneck
And now I got a little crew to watch my back
Lunchtime comes huh, you ain't gettin' none of that
'Cause I got shit sewn up real tight
Not one bit of fright, while I'm locked in Spofford
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down

You fuckin' comic, who you kidding?
My nigga's laughing, blood bathin, the world's greatest
In-famous crime-zanous
To interfere would be dangerous
Plane descent, stand clear, save your strength
You couldn't do the limp if you was coked up
By my z'd up, whatever the fuck, who gives a fuck? You get fucked
My coalition specialises in collision
The clash of the cliques, the duel o' the iron mac, spit
And leave ya half-split
You'll be missin' much more than a fraction
When it's time for action
Hit 'em while a man down, make that nigga backspin
Trapped up, a ???? madman

Get imprisoned with dem raps they have you relapsin
You get castin the Mobb, deaf and assin

Outta place, niggas get placed back indecent
Live at the main event may I present
Screamin out loud for any squad that's deaf

Single out ya army till there's no man left

Verse 2: Havoc

Never hesitant, opposition get settled here with
Sharp shit that'll rip through
One hundred layers of Kevlar, sharp like the jim star
Exiled, son, he get sent far
He's the foulest, QBC gat bust the loudest
Below profile, peep style, thirsty prowlest
Catchin court cases, pay for your legal aid
Son, that's money wasted, I ain't got time for that
Invest third place on my best sold rap
On the scrap from the ignorant cats
It'll be dead in a few... just like that
Couldn't bust his gat right (Yo, y'know what?)
But now you bucked your own man, amateur ass
Homeboy take that ass to class
But you cut in, duckin a reality blast
You catch a D minus fuckin' with New York's finest

We take you down first round, give ya man pound
Verse 3: Big Noyd
Check it out, dun, them niggas ain't ones
To be blowin' off the top and shit, I'm tired of shit
Dun, I'm about to dot the bitch and leave him stiff
Toss me the fifth so I can bless the GOD with gift
Yo nigga Noyd, what's the topic? Yo, the topic is this
Let me start from the beginning at the top of the list
First of all them tight niggas with that space-down shit
I stick a rocket up in they ass and give 'em a lift
My marvellous Mobb is tonic, intoxicant, bee-swee
Morphine raps, you get dope from inner mind-see
Shit fienin, now get your fix 'cause you need it
Fuckin' up your intravenous, the Infamous Mobb top secret
The only way you weakin is if you beakin this
Sneak devy niggas mischievous
'Knowledgin the GOD behind the scene on some snake shit
The vultures, water from their mouth but we can taste it
We just waitin with patience
Yo, dun, check the cross-examination these niggas fakin
So you can scream, you can fiend, you can dream for the bacon
Or you can snatch the Mac for the faggot, ai!

My man Hav' got my back with the tec 20
To shoot 'em up if the niggaz get funny
My shit is real, I had to pioneer in this
Around the way, all the fake niggaz fear this
Paragraphs bust your membrane
On and on I bust through like teflon
The Little P, is not to be stepped upon
And if you think so kid then you're dead wrong
Little, far from big, yo a type small kid
P, I represent the brothers from Queensbridge
To make a long rhyme short I smoke weed
Sip a forty, yo fuck the court
So bad they tried to lock me in a group home
Prodigy's hard but fuck it I can rip a ??
I catch wreck with the Einstein's intellect
And get stupid like a Stimulated Dummies mix
Feel the wrath, feel the aftermath
Even if you tooken notes, kid you couldn't pass the class
I keep a loosey in the chamber, cause beef got me shook down
Paranoid, ain't got no time to fuck around
So bypass the clock when it's time to go at it
So we can pop 'em off if the chumps want static
...
Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed

When I rap I kill mics like a nuke blast
Little Hav's the man, the man gettin' Van Damme
Buckwild, rockin' with much style
Check it as I wreck it, strip ya buttnaked
Pause and stand still while I just split a Phil'
And double up on ki's and make somethin' like a half-mil
Shorty's in it to get paid
No doubt, I got clout with the females
Put it in detail and write it
And if you ain't givin' pussy, then bitch you ain't invited
I'm on some other shit that you couldn't fuck with
Destructive, and couldn't give a fuck kid
Little niggaz don't die if they said so they lied
Immediate death to those who tried
The dark-skinned brother, unlike the others
When niggaz see my crew, they know to burn rubber"

A rainy day laid up thinkin'
Sitting gettin' bent
Watchin old seventy flicks
Minds on the slouch
Back on the couch
Heard the phone ring
It was a shorty from uptown I met back day.
Long time no hear from
No doubt long time no see
I heard you had a seed a baby girl and now she 3.
What's up wit that cat
You know who your baby pops
Slung rocks up top then heard he got knocked
He home
Fuck dat nigga I'm on my own
Matter fact got my own crib
Plus I'm all alone
Word?
The bitch is bad
Chill son she got me tempted
Reminiscing the fatty
Jumped in the ride I rented
Rest Tims
Mecca dice well presented
Sippin E & J straight
Was bent when I entered
Gave her a hug
Stared her straight into her mug
She ain't she's a bithch back then and now its bugged
Turned the VCR on
Friday, my favorite flick
Its hard for me to drink Alize I take a sip
Got into convo, How you been over the years?
Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear
Whatchu mean, I thought you left that cat which was true
I'm not talkin' about him
Another dude
Been wit him for a year and had a baby by him -- Word?
Matter fact you saw him, downstairs you walked by him
Now thinks it's a setup
Could it be or maybe not.
She said don't sweat it he don't got the top lock
Tried to play it cool. But in my head shorties wildin
Using me to get the next nigga jealous called up the fellas.
Ty Nitty line was busy so I beeped Gotti, Gotti was
With Trip and two other grimees, The Twinz
Let me begin then explain
I'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed
Stuck without a gat
Now prepare for combat,
Gave the address, told my son there's more cats be here in a second
Big gats no half steppin
They flippin on me talkin' bout I never learn my lesson
I laughed an additional hit them with the math
Hung up the jack, While shorty soaked in the bath.
Played the living room.
Dozed off for a second.
When I woke up shorty was standing ass naked.
Make moves stepped to the room.
All this bullshit pussy better be good
Through off my champion hood
Slow motion
All arm bent off the potion
Shorty went down and had a nigga wide open
It was over Laid up in the cut
I heard a thump
Jumped up threw on my boxers
Yo, What the fuck?
All of a sudden
I saw this black motherfucker with this big ass gat and two other
Motherfuckers
Black masks, Clutching duct tape no escape
Tied me up, smacked me all in my face
Shorty wasn't even screamin
Looked up saw 'em schemin
""Yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this""
All bloodied up, shook the fuck up
Held for ransom, they yelled, smiled and started dancin
Let them know they had me hostage
Threw me on the phone said son
Don't worry son we got this
Regardless of the outcome
All this bullshit
Take a nigga word
Don't never go see a bitch, word"

To say what the fuck we got to say, y'know?

It's like this Dunn

Infamous till the name wear out
Time and again without doubt
I take the murder one route
Why clowns pulled out and copped out
Poppin' they, little heads out they hole
Stickin they chest out, actin' like they in control
But hold up, I've been doin' this since we was kids
And all you other niggaz gotta ask if you could live
Your projects is on our dicks, you need to quit
And let us rep that for them, your raps ain't shit
Your background's incorrect, your song push no effect
On the people, don't try to play my part
Don't try to say my words that I lived and survived
Y'all niggaz got some nerve, be careful at night
You might bump into a tru to life nigga like Pee
Get beat over your head wit gun handles
Check the manual you went about it all wrong
We put you on the life, taught you how to drink right
And how to speak like anigga livin' street life
How to chasee down liquor wit more liquor
As a youth I was over proof, now I'm sober than your hoa
But still pound on a nigga till he throw up
Straighten up there's too much to lose
Get your head on right, we got the world to gain
And I'ma take mines while you sit around and complain
And I innovate raps while your song is playin'
Looks tastes and feels to me like no frills
Take that bullshit back to the two inch reel
Hit the studio hard, crash the track board like a smashed car
Then maybe next rhyme you could fuck wit the God
Pee wit a capital ""P""
And don't ever in your life try to rock wit me
On no days there's no rap page I can't top
I, splash the half ass trash you dropped
You get chopped in half, your little raff ain't last long
My shit came out and you got escorted to the door
You just a fuckin' clown here to entertain us all

Anytime y'all niggaz wanna mic brawl
Don't forget to me it's bloodsport bring your dogs

My Brother passed away, 24/7 I was bent
Drunk in my pain, alot of friends went and then came
And those that stayed understood a nigga pain
And for a niggas problems had no one to point the blame
I was my own worst enemy goin' against the grain
Somewhere along the line them pieces had to get grabbed
All this money plus family, shit wasn't that bad
All you little shorties runnin' 'round like shits sweet
Just remember these words from the M-O-double-B.
(Verse 3: (Littles))
I kiss my finger, cross my heart, I'ma make it out these dark days
Whether together or we part ways
I got a promise to that boy tatted on my arm
Three strong, man, the heat's still lukewarm
Who can you trust when your friends wanna pop your safe?
You let him stash in your place, now you watch his waist
Vision the days, hear the ghost whisper
Dogs we left in the past, brought back now here with us
Cross my heart, let the haze linger
Pour out a little liquor, knowin' God took a good nigga
Thousand dollar slippers skirt from the scene he was just a worker, dog,
You were his every dream
I kissed his face like I never knew 'em
It was me, once upon a time when life was ruined
Now the mink rope chain sparklin'
Jumpin' out of bed, Thousand dollar slippers slidin' huggin' the
Carpets."

Dig in my pocket, it's nuttin but change
I dig deeper, but still comin' up wit change
So we, called our lawyers to fix this shit
He said it's aight, we bout to be Free Agents
Have patience, we can't though, we need paper
Like thirty-five million'll straighten us up
It's nuttin for us to make these songs that bump
Shit that out, then tour for like six months but...
This can't be life, this can't be all there is for us
We need more cream to splurge
Thinkin' back, how we used to pick herbs
Me and Hav' in Manhattan, stickin up cowards
For they wallets and Starter hats
For anything worth somethin', we beat 'em out of that
But fuck all that, we grown men, we need Porsches
We need Porsche endorsements and more shit
Yeah Dunn, that sound righteous
I feel stressed though -- so I just
Hop in my truck for a drive
Bring my nine, cause that's how I stay alive
As I peel in my Jeep, turnin' up this
Goin' through withdrawal cause man do I miss
A pint of E&J, some haze, a twist
Me and Hav' on a flight to Rome witcho' bitch
Yes, that's my favorite shit
But without the dollars it don't make sense
So I, write that shit that grab you
Hit up the studio, that's how we get paid in full

Stomach touchin, niggaz over here type hungry
Waitin on my turn just got me hyper
And impatient, maybe I might just
Lurk with my forty-five, if you outside
I advise yo' ass to hide
We talk with the heat, lettin it spit
Move out the way and you can STILL get hit
They wonder why I'm riskin all this cash I made
Put your feet in my shoes you gon' see it my way...

On the street makin' non-stop CREAM galore
Packin heat, stickin up weed stores and more
Collectin interest off of extortions to settle my score
It gets deeper when things get real
I'm down to stickin out West Bank for my mill
And I'm from Hampstead, it's close to the shacks of Park South
Well I'll be outside slingin, you're always high
And don't come around to the crossroads of life
We're to the death, you and me, this beef for eternity
I'm goin' out to the fullest extent
So far into my troubles it's hard for me to get back
To my everyday self and composure
Catch you when you open then I bring you to a closure
Put ice on a razor and freeze ya when ya shelter
I went for ya grill but you dent from my *?rolder?*
I know this kid who says he knows ya because of that
Now I know where ya lay ya hat at and that's that
Say no more, I put it on you while you was yawning
Murder without warning the very next morning
Once we step through the door, party over, that's the endin
You and your crew'll leave out, a bunch of dead men
Bump me and I'll bump you back
You ain't tough black, niggas like you just get their life jacked
But I'ma cool nigga till you push me through the limit
But try ta play me and ya ass I get up all in it
Don't try to cop please now son, it's dead and done
(I gave you fair warning) So run and get your guns
It's on, time to show 'em how I perform
My attitude'll transform, leave you dead plus wrong
Gettin' the flow within, representin for Queens

But you can't wake up, wettin a chest you bless
Chokin off your own blood, don't blame me you brought your own death

I jumped up in the bubble, yo kid where are you?

And hide yourself down with them other fuckin' sixteen
Glock and get off they block
Then I hung up the cellular, ready to rock
And it's on
Yo, you get deaded in the streets, kid set it
You gots no credit, fool you get wetted
Up with the semi-auto Mac double, love it
'Did he shoot eleven or twelve?' is what he wondered
Nigga I got one more shot, you must be drinkin'
Put the heater to his head, watch him start blinkin
'Am I goin' to heaven or hell?' is what he's thinkin'
Switch to a bitch as his life start sinkin
Down to a level of no return
Pull out the heat 'cause when the slugs hit it definitely burns
Now chill and think about your life for real
Every member of my crew is livin' life for real
Got your self fucked into somethin' that you couldn't finish
Up against the fulliest squad and get diminished

And Uncle Tom niggaz wanna see me locked up to
Around the same time KRS was writin Black Cop
I was busy tryin' to pump cracks in the black blocks
Poppin' shit to my homeys about how my gat pop
Got rid of that chrome thing and got back a black glock
P ninety hold ten but I had six shots
I used to walk around with it and risk gettin' knocked
I bought a fresh box of bullets from Old Man Sam
Wanted to shoot a nigga so bad it was itchin my hand
Some shot it out with me, and some of them ran
And some of them dashed were good and some of them jammed

Moms pray for me with her right hand on the good book
Saw shots fly by me no I shouldn't been trippin'
The Pulp Fiction must have been God's divine intervention
Wouldn't thought then from that, I learned my lesson
And clean my act up and go straight to perfection
Uncle La got knocked the feds hit it with seven
And left me with the fifty cal and a mac eleven
Start everything from everything from heads to the worries

Found myself askin God what the fuck is my purpose

(You gotta find a way to deal with) dealin' with the peer pressure
Verse One: Havoc
As a young black teen, everyday I, deal
With the pressure and mixed up is how I feel
I walk the streets with a fuck you attitude
And when it comes to my peoples you ain't half as rude
Follow the crowd or be a leader, take your pick
Now I'm smokin' buddha philly blunt style
A frustrated and confused young juvenile
King of the project blues so I choose
To take a piece of the action
But my sober state of mind won't let it happen
So twenty-four-seven it's the number one stresser
Dealin' with the peer pressure
Verse Two: Prodigy
Most don't understand how it is
In the world of today growin' up as a young black teen
I used to dream, of bein a architect
Easier said than done, believe me it's hard to get
Out of the projects, without forgettin where you came from
My parents told me from day one
Finish school and avoid all obstacles
But my environment, makes it so impossible
For instance, build a strong social life
Without messing up still trying to live right
Like in junior high, I used to wonder why
Certain females went out with certain guys
Then one day, it all dawned on me yo
You gotta be down, and have it goin' on see
I wasn't down with the mainstream or
Should I say their team, now I'm gettin' steamed
Gotta find a way, to get accepted by my peers
So now I'm sippin on beers
Buyin new gear, nothin' but the best
Forget Levi's strictly Polo and Guess
But how would I make the cash
It gotta be easy and it gotta be fast
Thinkin' to myself does that make me lesser
Just, dealin' with the peer pressure
Verse Three: Havoc
Around my way there's a kid that most don't understand
How he lives is it negative or positive
He has a grade A average
But when he's on the streets, with his friends, he's a savage
A freshman of high school, daily attendant
He never got in trouble never did he get suspended
Good little Kenny who would believe
He dropped out of school to start to smoke weed
I saw the signs but I didn't pay attention
Because he got offended every time that I would mention
The drinkin', the smokin', the low school grades
And sleepin' in class laid back with his black shades
Nowadays you catch Kenny hangin' in the hallways
With his crew findin more ways
To break out of school, and hit the block and get buckwild
Stay out of the way of a mad child
'Cause he's a product of, hell
Kenny never fell but he's gonna fall overall
So let's take a trip to the ghetto
Where Kenny got drunk and bought a burner off his man so
He pulled the trigger and the suicide note right
""I'm glad it's finally over and I'm finally dead
And no more, do I have to feel, lesser, or
Deal with the peer pressure"""

Thinkin' to myself does that make me lesser
Just, dealin' with the peer pressure
Verse Three: Havoc
Around my way there's a kid that most don't understand
How he lives is it negative or positive
He has a grade A average
But when he's on the streets, with his friends, he's a savage
A freshman of high school, daily attendant
He never got in trouble never did he get suspended
Good little Kenny who would believe
He dropped out of school to start to smoke weed
I saw the signs but I didn't pay attention
Because he got offended every time that I would mention
The drinkin', the smokin', the low school grades
And sleepin' in class laid back with his black shades
Nowadays you catch Kenny hangin' in the hallways
With his crew findin more ways
To break out of school, and hit the block and get buckwild
Stay out of the way of a mad child
'Cause he's a product of, hell
Kenny never fell but he's gonna fall overall
So let's take a trip to the ghetto
Where Kenny got drunk and bought a burner off his man so
He pulled the trigger and the suicide note right
""I'm glad it's finally over and I'm finally dead
And no more, do I have to feel, lesser, or
Deal with the peer pressure"""

99,Project Hallways,1993,Juvenile Hell (1993),,Mobb Deep,"Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways...
Project hallways, the project hallways...
Step in to my highrise hell
You gots to be on the up and up
Watch your back, pump your crack
But don't forget to re-up
A burner's your God and you pray to it all day
Then at night, you catch a body
But it's just the shit you got to do
'Cause if you wasn't watchin, they'd catch your ass too
You gotta go all out if you want props
Or you can just kill a man, and it's the same for cops
Now you want a little fame from the drug game
Whether you shoot 'em up, or pump cracks, it's all the same
But fuck it you're in it to win it
Fat uptown, cookies in the rocks, your spot's hot
Now you're livin' the life of a project sad song
Makin' your loot from all the right wrongs
But that's the way it goes when you choose your path
And you might just, feel the pain of a tec 22 blast
All out war, with niggaz from the next block
You're pullin out the glock, to shut 'em down
Now you're Mr. Big Shot in your tribe
Niggaz know your name from Mt. Vernon, to Southside
Comin' from the streets of Fright
Where the only thing you'll know is how to roll it up right
And load it up, tight, you're startin a block war
Nigga pull the trigga if you want a little more
Frank Nitty style, buckwild
Thirty-eight slugs from uptown thugs
No question, you're true to the game
Since the age of a little Brand Nubian
From skelly tops to props ? and all that
Now you're puttin' your block on the map
A role model to the petty drug dealers
Banana clip style, my neighborhood's buckwild
You can't forget who you came from
See you later maybe sooner in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies
A little hellbound nigga, shoot 'em up, light 'em up
Pull the trigger, pass the 40 in the project hallways
Runnin' through the doorways, back in the days
Just a little snot nosed bastard
Always causin havoc, with a blade
But now it's a burner, used, for murder
Step a little closer and your ass is grass
You better move fast 'fore I kick that ass
'Cause I'm sharp like glass, but I won't break
Walk into the project hallways is your big mistake
You little bitch ass nigga, you shoulda known better
You'll get done, did, a kid from the 'Bridge
Who gets buck, and couldn't give a fuck about your daze
I'm talkin' 'bout the project hallways
Catchin bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, chillin' in the project hallways
To survive around my way
You gotta play a knuckle game every day
Lost in the shuffle of hardrocks
And knocks on the streets of the uptown blocks
Load the glocks, who got the mox'
A little gun bangin' bad-ass project thug
You're in the wrong part of town kid
Mr. Buddha on the 13th floor, gimme some more
Sess bag it up real quick kid
Tap the ? shit, the brew, pass the Phil'
What's my name? Niggaz call me little shorty gets ill
And bag 'em up on the street corner
And bust 'em open in the project hallways
Check it out, yo
Around the way kid the sun don't shine
Phillie blunts kid I got what you want and it's time
My dialogue with the project cause motivate
Move, what? I never lose
Freestyle project hallway style
But the shit ain't real unless you got that buddha filled
Chalm, keep me goin' on when I perform
Charge the brain, lick 'em up, that's the name of the game
So it's the move when I move little smooth
On the motherfuckin mission and I just improve
Upstairs, niggaz dyin' on the 6th floor
Cause in the projects, shit is mad rough
So take a puff and relax your mind
J.V. crimes, most of the time
You might catch my crew, with a sixty-four brew
Watch your back, 'cause we're comin' through
With a fat sack of 1-2-1 son
And the shit ain't fun, unless I get some
Of the action, little shorty execute
I'm killin' niggaz in the hallways
Till there ain't no more left to shoot
So if you can't take the heat, stay out of the ways
Before you 'come a victim of the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz shoot 'em up in the project hallways"

Trained by the pain, adopted by guerillas

Skyscraper ladies, they fuck me when they man gone
Kings of New York, I'm one of the few of those
Difficulties to come, it's gon' be funerals
You get a quiet spot in the shade, for a grave
I get paid, 'cause I got murder 'fore sixteen
And I'm so much rich, I got a condo for a piggy bank
So much stash, I just laugh at yo' face

Hustled by the bus stop, aged to the front stop

Heavy bones on the deuce, flickin' it up in the mix
Fast forward to '06, gettin' head in the '06
Have a chick, feelin' like she workin' out on that Bow-Flex
I'm focused, looked through my lens, see my vision
Surprise myself and came through without one spool missin'
From that hallway kissin', there was room in the Carlton
I can smell it in the air, P in that next room sparkin'
Me, I let that heady flow, meet me at the tele' hoe
You don't do the tele', oh, fuck it bitch you gotta go

(Prodigy)
I open my eyes to the streets where I was raised as a man
And learned to use my hands for protection
In scuffles, throw all my blows in doubles
I'm coming from Queens motherfucker carrying guns in couples
And wilding, a Q-U soldier
From Lefrak to Rockaway back to Queensbridge
Black it's only crack sales makin' niggaz act like that
Back in the days we could scrap, now you lay on your back
As things changed with time I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10
And rather live the life of crime
With my Bed-Stuy connection connected in two
It's live Boo start shit too wild for you
Peace to, Baesley, Forty-P get down
And when you outta town represent your ground
Them niggaz bleed just like us so show 'em where we come from
Queens; leavin' niggaz done Son

Shit is for real up in Queens we get hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic (3X)

As we sling on the corners like we always do
Son get that loot quick, spending dough like I never had shit
I'm living large pushin luxury cars
Though that shit is outta reach, anybody in my wake gets scarred
Permanently bed-ridden
And if you're pussy, then motherfucker get in where you fit in
As I walk around the streets
Son I got mad beef, I'ma blast you before you blast me
That's my philosophy cause nowadays you gotta be relentless
Grab my Mac and slap a nigga senseless
Don't try to play me if you do you better D.O.A. me
Son I got 'em shook grab a little baby for shields
You got drama run for shelter for real
Pour some beer for the ill ain't no time to chill
Hit 'em up 'cause I'm quick to erupt like this
Wet 'em up with the Mac scratch 'em off my list
Show em, the real meaning of drama you never had it
Till you bumped heads with the Havoc
Ain't nuttin soft or sweat, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat

Ain't nothing soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat whole crews retreat
We gets hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic (2X)

Everything is real inside my mind; these days
You can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime
A lifetime of street living
Throughout the beef I've accumulated many slugs have been given
But wilding ain't the way to be living
You're only gonna end up bloody on a floor shivering
Or locked up, caught inside the beast
Meanwhile on the street saying no more peace
My man, Sto-Bo, kid hold your own
In a cell locked down not far from home
And at the same time on the outside I'm representing
Still packin heat make you cowards keep stepping
Getting high, it's cause of the lye, I can't lie
I could move the crowd poppin' slugs in the sky
Why come around if you afraid of what's over here
My man Havoc put the bug in my ear
On the real, for real, but wait it gets realer
Real like an innocent child that turn killer
It's thing like that that only makes things iller
And makin' cream doin' sticks if you ain't a drug dealer
(It's) only facts coming out of my mouth feeds
As far as I can see these streets is getting sour
Q, U, too much drama to get into
And niggaz regret when they begin to
Regardless of your name or what you been through
Pause for a second, open your eyes and think dude
Life ain't the game that it seems to be
Fuck a fantasy I'm leaving in reality
Caught up in this untouchable mentality
Hit you up bad, make you loose a few calories
I need to slow down, movin through life at a high speed
Watchin all the slow runners pass by me
I can see through you, due to, my Queens education
Speaking in behalf of this drug-game nation
The Foundation, the Queens nation
Up in Queens, shit is for real we abouts to get hectic
Word up
Shaolin, shit is for real we abouts to get hectic
Word up kid

Infamous has just entered the building
Yeah, yeah mama
Keep doing that just like that I like that
But you got one problem
You hanging with some real clowns over there
They some real clown killers
Shooting off in the air like that
Aye yo son where my real thugs 'n' them at
If you live nigga then you bussing your hammer
All my real niggaz not having to stand up
Niggaz better run or you'll be picking your man up
Clapping at whoever I ain't even in handcuffs
(Havoc)
One hammer two hammer three hammers four
H got drama with you I'm bringing it to your door
We get money on tours cuffin them broads
While we slutting them all then passing them off
Peeling off in that Bentley coupe
Got ma wetting them draws
You know I keeps them in that birthday suit
She know once that she up in that ride
And we get pulled
The hammers going in between her thighs
Need a chick got to explain a thing
She hip to it the games in her blood
And down for the grind
Till the death rep M.O.B.B
You a problem with it then you know where to reach me
I give them the business
No mirrors or smoke screens
Either you live it you live it
Or you just fronting
This rap shit for life
P that's my Co-D
We go back like staircases and O.E.
Stop playing
(Prodigy)
Nigga you thought wrong
Now look at you now
Look like sandwich meat with the ketchup sauce
But you was just hollering about
Infamous this infamous that
Your mouth was going off
Meanwhile we counts money piles
Till our fingertips green and them shits is sore
But we prefer plastic now
Its nothing like when it's your tour stacking cash on the floor
Saran wrap to the top jumpoffs wont fall down
It's not my cash your bitch love
Its how I kill it on the song
And she get a taste of the dick
She open now
Its shiny like a door and I don't pay the bitch no thought
I got alot of gall
That's what the bitch haal
While I'm leaving her sight my heart is real cold
Real hard on a hoe
But much much harder for the dough
It be a bloody slaughter when we through
(Havoc)
So don't get mad because your hoe probably sucking the kid
Attracted to the lifestyle of how us gangsters live
Teach her all about life
And the bees and birds
And how I shut that shit down when the beef occurs
And how I stick, and move all you see is a blur
Yo I'm a cool ass dude until you push me sir
And can't nobody squash this beef
YOu get it on with us then you up shits creek

Don't have me putting these bullets all in your ass

Now run for your life or you wanna get your heat, whatever
We can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the esscense
I don't give a fuk about my prescence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24-7. Mac 11 is my people
So why you wanna end your little life like this
'Cause now you bump head wit kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive the last night
Damn, right, I ain't trying to fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat and
Ain't no turning back when I start blasting
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion
No signs of anger or fear 'cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans wit a stranger, word is born
I put the glock on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You bucking me, I'm bucking right back at you

Fuk where you're at kid, it's where you're from
'Cause where I'm from, niggaz pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggaz don't got no remorse for out of towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed wit the 3 pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger on all you wannabe gun slingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'm a test your gun skills
'Cause real niggaz don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwhyle
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a muthafuking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
Wit macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way, you big stupid fuk
What the hell you smoking, what the fuk possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my tims, black mask and black ?serpent?
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30
(Rae and Ghostface)
Who's the richest nigga in the project, who got it live
Rocking Convertibles, frop tops and mad high
Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
Who's organize, all eyeballs is on CREAM
And yyour whole clique got nothin' but raw shit
Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks
Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable
In the jungle, banging Nas, Mobb Deep and Wu
There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons
Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns
You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in siran
Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand
Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender
Get ninjaed on the island, plus the Bridge, boy remember

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggaz getting wet up in the projects
But wit no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye
From smoking that 118 ?chiny tye?
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was growing, he's a thug in the street
But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild wit the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed
Wit a firepack, don't even go there 'cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me
Thug's selling drug, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy"

If these QueensBridge kids don't like you
We bring drama of the worst kind of enemies
Your first time would be your last earth memories
It's only your own fault
I gave you fair warning... beware...
Of killa kids who don't care
Unaware fools who be dealt with in time
It ain't a mystery
Hop on the words and rhyme
In nineteeth hundred and ninety square
All shook niggaz is supposed to have fear
Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share
Prepare for the worst 'cause I been there
Try tah, keep a positive mind and walk a straight line don't work
So niggaz is forced to do dirt
And God made ...
So this jerk wouldn't hurt
If I listen to the lessons and the rules I learnt
On the streets for nineteenth years
And not leaving
My first priority is to reach twenty one breathing
Forever beef
Nobody would ever be even
So I grab the heat before breathing
Lost in this foul mind state
I can't keep straight thinking
But I keep my eyes on the earth without blinking
It's hard to be a man in this land of the venom
Any man try to front
He get slugs in him
Because...

But you scared to get locked
Once you get upon the Island
Change your ways and stop
Thirteen years in the projects, my hard times of living
Wake up in the morning
Thank God I'm still living
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or I am going to hell for all the shit I did
No time to dwell on that

So they can bann us, cause our shit is so strong niggaz jaws be stuck

Why the fuck did your your ass have to go and get knocked
Now you got me on the phone, straight talkin' to the cops
Tryin' to verify your government
They got you now, they lovin' it,
They wanna hang that ass, couldn't get you in the past
Though I can't see your problem
You was still young at the time
Did a lot of older things, you was ahead of your time
Never told you to slow down
Resee your crown heights, you wild
All I could say was be careful
Give you a dap to bounce
Shit that you went through
Watched the drama amount
Gave a fuck long, you wasn't part of the body count
Now I feel guilty, half the blame of your incarceration
Till the interveine, when you first started catching cases
Fuck to this, dunn, now you in there
Gotta hold it down, you mother's only son
And I'ma ride for you, baby, 'cause a lot of it is still love
I'm still there, when you get home, I'ma be there

You gotta (hold on)
No matter (how long)
And it seems (so long)

I can't believe they got my dunn, it feel like my fault
'Cause I fronted you that money to get that dough
Any man's ain't accountable for they action
Still and all I feel responsible for you being gone
I hit the mall till it happened, k.a. now and then
Just so, you can live and keep your little cosmetics
In that five years, it was a little dough we made
Out of sight, out of mind, naw dog
It's not me, I miss you
You on my mind daily
Even though I scribe to a nigga, really, you feel me
Trying to get my shit together
So you could be proud, when you touch down
We got businesses to run now
Peep it back how we used to run up in a nigga's house
On some pety crime shit, boy we was not playin'
On occasion, I still check ya, brotha 'tll the end
Black, and bone crazy ass
Reading ya letters, I see you ain't losin' ya sense of humour
Talkin' to you on the phone made my day cooler
Tellin' me, how you'll deaf, to see your nose out
You need to bring your black ass home
And cut that bullshit out
I could remember me and killa would test our new guns in the projects
'Cause that's where police won't come, iller g

You almost home, until then

You niggaz always startin somethin'
And beefin with rappers, why our music so violent
And so dramatic, where's the love?
Why y'all go so much static
Is it real for real or all for sales?
I'm like, ""Shorty you must be sick""
We been gettin' burned like the Waco kids
I don't need to diss rappers for recognition
You better check the files: Infamous, Hell on Earth, Murda Muzik
You can't be SE-RIOUS
We created this drama shit, we set the trend
We taught you niggaz bout diamonds and guns
And numerous ways we choose to earn funds
We veterans, we got a decade of albums
Niggaz done came and went, and we still poppin'
Our name is carved in stone
Even the new blood know, we ain't no joke so
Let us solidify this - what's that?
We been solidified this - but of course!
Lot of new rappers and young kids - uh-huh
They all love +The Infamous+ - but of course!
We been for this music Dunn - c'mon man!

And I'm a nigga who can roll the dice, put up the crib
Won't sweat if I lose, bet your ass won't live
To collect this splurge of mines, never that
I'm a sore loser the (?), reverse with hammers
Hit your man's up if they press the issue
Some dead, the other half crippled, and I'm a monster with led
Lodge a slug in your abdomen, puts in the 7
Knowin' in the stash box a rapper's best friend
Get it twisted and you WILL get twisted with chrome biscuits
Make no difference my nigga, we handle business
So please with the questions they right in, front of your face
Homey stunt he gettin' to' from the gate, so

My stick man be my stick man till the tombstone (mmm, mmm)
You got rhymes? You got stomach for the Mobb?
You got stomach for P? I get my rocks off

Niggaz butches on they records but they never handle beef

He had distorted vision, thought I ain't deserve this
How he the streets, and I ain't put no work in
Nigga I ain't lock you and take all your years
You the nigga that was careless, get the fuck out of here
Yeah, blood, sweat, and tears, every buck I made
I ain't complain when you was hustlin' and I leave paid
Yeah I'm up, boilin' blood to see me bust
Even worse they ask for help, like I'm the Red Cross
I don't knock niggaz when they down, I try to lift 'em
But they tried to get all in my shoes, like they could fit 'em
Can't happen overnight, when it comes to winnin' (Naw)
It's a ten year road, but niggaz ain't tryin' to hear it

Niggaz better watch they mouth, or stop speakin' so freely

This is different than what you used to

We come through militant, niggaz be grillin' it
Screwin' up they face, but my adrenaline
Is at a maximum, I can't be touched
Just as soon niggaz move, niggaz get tore up
We so confidant in ourselves, it's not fair
While you still tryin' to overcome your childhood fears
We settin' up shop, takin' over the blocks
In e'ry hood, e'ry boy, and e'ry girl gon' cop
Now we chillin' in, new airplanes and Rolls Royces
My watch is my president - and guess who's the first lady?

She a little overweight, but I love her so much

Mix the coke rhymes in greases like baking soda
Albums of G-packs sellin cross far waters
My Mobb pits is like dime bricks
Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit

And once we all on top, ain't no stoppin' it

Past time for me to grab the clapper and take mine
You follow what I'm sayin' it's like leadin the blind

And then this OG, scold me, and told me, coldly
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homey
But I gotta redeem, get this cream by any means
I never been clean
Nigga, my whole click got dirty
From the vials, to the trials, to the bloody absurdity 
Nigga you heard me
Its Gangsta
Prodigy
Vision the canvas I paint a picture
Similar to Ernies Barnes nigga
But mines is more ghetto more guns
More drugs, mostly thugs
All my duns, their baby moms daughters and sons
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out
Park benches broke, a nigga stretched out
Jumped off the roof to his death its real
Hand Ball walls displayed with R-I-P murials
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building
Devils spring, keep 'em going while the snows blowing
Grams get dipped, 50's are moked, cookies are broke
And Spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects

Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off don't get clipped off

And to the drama I built, and all unfinished beef
You will soon be killed, put us together

And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me

I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough y'know
When the dough get low the jewels go, but never that

I'll be on the block hustlin countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin, no time to get lost in -- the system
Niggaz usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I-llegal world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged, that fucked me up God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're upstate bleedin
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid witchu
Hit wit a 2 to 4 it's difficult
Wild on the streets I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, cause hoes like to run game
Some niggaz like to trick but I ain't wit that trickin shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get I'm stayin in the projects, forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worse and my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot
Fuck lookin' cute, I'm strictly Timb boots and army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin the smell

Y'all callin in reinforcements
The Mobb come through, stop up the shit
P'll come through and shot up your vest
Shoot at your head, not-a-leg eh?
Nigga I will kill your bitch
Then fuck her and make you watch
We do thangs, like raid spots
Probably catch you on the Hummer, just give you my glock
(Here) Or most likely in the club, we gon' give you them knots
This is what gangsters dance to, or turn to a thug party
Once we step foot in the bitch, it's on again
Outside we got them boxy trucks
Hoes wanna jump, cause of that Benz emblem
The hoe say she wanna ride in the shit with the horse logo
I got her out of her panties and boom boom
And I done left bitches out in the boonies
Frontin on that pussy, leave bodies wherever

Talkin' all that bullshit but it's the hammer that roast
If your shit ain't clappin off then you sure to lose
Aiyyo the streets don't give a fuck about you
For you ain't bendin the rules
Come around lookin' icey then you runnin' the jewels
Nigga you ain't gotta like me, homey get your food ate
The whole plate, rip a fella ear to ear I'm talkin' his whole face
And scream my name, cause it hold weight
You cowards are jealous
Glass slipper wearin niggaz we call 'em Cinderellas
Gonna be a slug shower and there ain't a umbrella
That can help you protect that ass from gettin' wet
I can see it in your eyes, your bitch ass is pet
Home team I'ma promise and you cowards ain't a threat
Introduce a fella to death, in the form of chrome

From these, streets, that we done took
You walkin' witcha head down scared to look
You shook, cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cop's control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the mac one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home wit
My skin is thick, 'cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin lye relaxin
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul, before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
And to the drama I built, and all unfinished beef
You will soon be killed, put us together
It's like mixin vodka and milk
I'm goin' out blastin, takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord forgive me the Hennesey got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back

The drama's over can't you feel the euphoria?
A warrior, you cowards getting cornier and cornier
We don't play games never will we ever toy with ya
Camp with you niggas, so my answer to niggas
Take you for a swim throw his ass in the river
My lord, y'all bitches all fraud to me though
Never banged out, we launch torpedo
Nigga still on paper he report to P.O
Damn!
Jump in the Lamb and we off to the show
Play my cards right, never go see a ho
Or catch me in the crib, compromise like Oh shit
Bitch what you got me into
My Goons will be here with the metal utensils like
Pop pop pop pop pop pop
Noodle heads scream all you hear is them shots

Takin' you off here
Said you gotta get God

Vaccinate me you get bodied that shot
Handle that shit off top (x2)

Don't play scared business around me
Nigga bleed just like us, I flood the cold street with ya'
Hot Blood, was mad now he steaming
Your soul in Limbo, right there on the cement
The ghost of a bitch ass nigga, Casper
Nigga I'm the worst demon you could ever ask for
Don't conjure me up
Burn in hell like I put a bomb to your truck
It's serious when I creep on a nigga 'nough
Machine dot green grief dot gun powder lungs
Power Ball Money off rap, baskin'
In a lime green light come and get your ass whipped

Gimme a half second and I'ma put you on
It's all messed up, somebody's snitchin on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Axin on your whereabouts, so where d'you sleep?
They said they just wanna question you bet me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced but now you're stayin low
Once in a blue I check ta see how ya doin'
I know you need loot so I send it through Western Union
They probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin to find who they're lookin' for but they want ta see
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But worse, son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers to get their thug on but oh well
Son, they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
Oh, you heard who did what and why I don't this shit
So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin' crazy
From windows I see lights flashin and maybe
Somebody's takin' pictures
You know who that be, police lovers and neighbourhood snitches
They put up *?pertice?* so everybody's pointin fingers

Tried to hussle, where along the lines your plan slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back

Years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin who snitched and got me losin lots of sleep
At night, you know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops 'cause that shit ain't right
Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn, why the situation go down like dat?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
In a couple of years, fool we'll see you around
But till then maintain and keep ya story the same
The cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin' for someone to blame
They harrassin, strugglin to find the truth
Is it a chance ya case'll get thrown out 'cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver me the gun, I'll tie two, quickly throw it in the river

'Cause every fuckin' day it's just gettin' worse
What's worse? Might go out, die hard and end up in a hearse
But no time to think about the consequences
The years in jail, fuck the death sentence
All I know is that I need mad cash in a flash
Befo' I gotta kill somebody ass
Might as well be in jail or dead
'Cause if you ain't gettin' paid then you ain't gettin' ahead (that's word nigga)
Sittin' in my room with the lights out thinkin'
I'm alive, but I ain't livin', I'm leakin'
I made my bed and I'ma lay in it
But I ain't gonna stay in it
I might start sprayin shit
I should've stayed in school, but that's a dead issue
Fuck a G.E.D., that's like toilet tissue
All my friends are hoodlums and hustlers
Runnin' with a bunch of stupid crazy motherfuckers
Niggaz fuckin' their money up, niggaz gettin' knocked
And jealous motherfuckers, they want the whole block
Though I could start flippin gettin' on a mission
But I need much more, no time for bullshittin'

Interstate 95 North to the Jackie Robinson
Watch out for D's in caprices in tauruses
Empire mistakes for cops, mad nervous
Back at home sell a few burners
Keep a miz and a seven mil for my personal
Walk with benevolence, holdin' twin fifths
380's in the whip, a mini-eagle for my chick
That nigga P is sick, I need a silencer connect, see me

Went from, ridin' these trains to coppin expensive cars

It only means that I work harder than the average nigga

Then quickly rubbed my eyes, if my vision got blurred
I coulda sold drugs (yeah yeah) till I got bagged and jailed

Keep them checks comin', thoughts flowin
Words blowin', hoes goin', Havoc always holdin'

That's why you see, mixed emotion when my name's brought up
'Cause I'm the illest

Yo, you know you ill when you can kill two birds (yeah)

From the deep depths of jealousy and envy's domain
Make chips then stash for the days it rain

P got the most now; our guns are the most loud
With enough bullets to down mostly the whole crowd
We drink the most Henny, yeah me and Jake
We smoke the most weed, that's mostly the haze
Get the most (?) kicked on a nigga's face

Right now, I change guns with the season
When I was young I bought Ninja Stars on Jamaica Ave
Hitting trees then; started hitting trees then
We ran the train on the girls and on my family dance schools
We was beasting, little young heaven
I had the rainbow knife, and when I got my first gun I was cheesing
I couldn't believe it; I had the power of life or death
In the palm of my hands, fiending
But quickly to be scheming; if you choose to front on me
That leaves me with no choice but to start squeezing
And I hope they stop breathing
Because if they do pull through, in the hospital beds
They'll be squealing - talking to these D's man
They don't waste no time, they want answers
Even if you're still bleeding

Your chance of runnin'
Is infinte
Slugs that leave niggas drugged
Like a chick slip the Mickey
I'm so on the low
It'd take a Navy SEAL
To get me
When I surface
If not chips to Benz
Is the purpose
On your team
I'll pull the curtain
A beautiful hurtin'
Till my eyes see the blood
That mean the creep start workin'
Niggas never learnin' that
They eyes keep lurkin'
Have ya janitor
Pumpin' your (X5) merkin
Skid marks the street
Your heart skips a beat
Beef? Nigga overcook that meat
Get no sleep, only rest is
In between the blink
My life story was
Written in blood, permanent ink
Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em
Gotta think like that 'cause
Forever I be needin' 'em
Plan flawless, mistakes
Never repeatin' 'em
Some love, some hate me
B****es in the head beatin' 'em
(So)
Niggas wanna ride
By the crib all slow
(Oh)

Want a real rap show?
Fiends are rushin'

Dead in my castle
And in the blink watch

Lettin' the top down
But wait, you don't think

That's hate, you could
Get popped right now
Me don't play, I keep
A gun around my way
'Cause I'm a f***in' drama king

And codes, we obey

But when it's on, ain't a thing that can stop the pound
Tear a fella a ass, a new ass at that
Glad to clap, never that, we had to clap
Nigga do it to they self, when they force the hand
Make me blast, how you trynna play me man
Like niggaz over here, don't get down for theirs
I need some man time, who got the fuckin' jack in here
Where, ever I leave, my head's my home
And if possible, always take my gat where I roam
These slugs'll take the bass outta niggaz voice quick
But, once we gangsta, now moist the shit
Scramble, he hit, how you like the scenery bitch
Keep ya eyes on my hands, fuck who you seeing me with

Yo, I don't know you, you don't know me

And that chains over here, I'm just still bustin' my gun
Still rippin' on your shorties, wildin' out with my dunns
On the grind, don't do nothing dumb, just hold ya head
'Cause the rest of my soldiers, stressed out in jail
With on bail, facing the rest of they life
We got to get it right and keep it tight, and stay on the low
For them assholes, clockin' our dough, love when I flow
Keep doing that shit, they gots to go
Infamous Mobb gots to blow, pounds of dro'
Makin' all the shorties, gettin' down on the floor
From that Murda Muzik shit, that'll make ya flip
And dump a clip, in a nigga that be talkin' shit
We think sick, check the credits, we get busy
And grimey, and gritty, when we livin' in the city
It's haters, traders, fake ass playas
Come to QBC, and nobody could save ya
(Havoc)
Of course we keep it gangsta, straight gangsta
Niggaz know it, I don't have to prove it, or show it
The gun bark, and the bite is a mutha, a killa
A playa, lay it down, a four pounder

Nothing but cannons get conspicuous
Like a man a little branded with the serial scratched
Wild out a part of the pack 'cause they made me like that
If I could push back the clock probably leave it like that
Draw blood for my nigga G.O.D, Ty Nitty and Twin
And Twin is not here plus my kin

I spent more nights illin' less nights chillin'
The more shots they hold the better they feel it
What be the dealizz
Some killas like to hide behind specs
Others got blatant disrespectin' the rest
Or so young that you wouldn't even expect
To be burstin' off guns like a vietnam vet
On the steps
Sittin' in the staircase bent
Thinkin' on ways to take another man's head
Go to war with niggas that's against what I rep
I settle things with a heavy metal fifth

Under the arm is where the pistol be
Top of your forehead the kiss will be
Plant it ever so soft and gentle but die viciously
Hours of torture before the torture apply misery
Days before I feel pity to give a guy liberty
Seat of his pants shitty and eyes all glittery
I'll die a rich man before the F.B.I. figure me
40 storeys up inside a high-rise in Italy
No hittin' forces only natural courses could 'liver me
Gray hairs from the great years the fears never shiver me
Reminiscing how we car bombed ignitions
And Politicians, Judges strong-armed to listen
Men turning up dead or hurt, harmed and missing (forever)
Bulletproof cars are driven Teflon edition
Bodies cut up in large chunks thrown in car trunks
Music inside the bar stunk ...
Gettin' surrounded by bitches blowin' some cigars drunk
One of my stone face goons will make your heart pump
Electrocution with cables that make your car jump
The yard punks, the sin with the life sentence for sellin hard junk
The family, the whole commission
Has been around since the days before prohibition
Mathematics was good then, no slow addition
Some overdose down the coke slope and dope addiction
Lookin' back on them days I ran a whole division
Some of the jake in the State was tryna throw the mission
They caught a ticket ride to hell with no admission

Treat a snitch nigga like Sam when he squeel

There's plans to re-build ...
Curtains and drapes got the jakes tryna can me for real
Until then, be in the backyard with clam on the grill
Or catch me laid up in the canopy ill
With two mami's handing me thrills
Vivica Fox body vanity grills
Rubberbanding these bills
Tryna duck the fame of the glamor
Tryna stay from out the range of the scanners
Not tryna get my frame in a camera
Avoid tabloids and front pages
Bums get knocked off and bumped for favors
Collect Trump papers with pumps and gauges
Royale suites when I bunk in Vegas
Got homicide searching the city dumped for neighbors
Pinky ring with a chunk of glacier
Copped a spot with a bunch of acres
Some them got their bodies slumped from capers
Barcaleno hat, tux and gators
Got a crib full of house maids, butlers and waiters
My clique from the minor league, jump the majors
We gon' rock it till we jackpot fuck them haters
If we have to run up in City Hall abduct the Mayor
Any man against the master plan get bucked wit craters

Character ass, amateur ass, damage your ass
With a touch of class handle that ass
Two aluminum bats, ruin them cats, to explosive gas
Doing them cats, my crew's in the back
Losing it black, I be that bold cat, shine him with the black gat
Hitting it close to my back, my whole click stay strapped
On some Queens bridge survival shit, we strike like that
Full force, we blast at your main source
As I sit back don, I think about my past
When my moms had no cash, and my first time catching crabs
Or at the time when my brother got splashed
It hurt my ass, to see him pass
But now I gotta keep on moving to get this cash
You better kill his ass, if you wanna pass
The premicise for the minister's kid
Called the infamous
Forgive but we never forget
All that fake snake shit, could I never regret
'Cause I learn from mistakes that be guiding my steps
But we pull out and cock twice nigga

It's Murda Muzik, real life situations, placed on the paper
For all you cats rapping acting like it can't happen

Glows in the dark and clicks the dullest
Overconfident niggas get punished
Take a number and get in and get on line for drama
You whiling like you was one of my own
That shit don't mix, we clashing
Make moves, handle your biz
Gun po's, take action, reach for those
Long chrome noses -up- my gun blows
Your legs turn noodles, you shot a few going down
I give you that much, you ain't out
Close but no ci-gar, you must be a fucking retard
Extending your arm in my direction
You better squeeze hard, my rank is that of up most respect
You niggas only know what you heard on cassette
Manifest words in a flash, niggas only see the light
After they bleed a few pints
Take your most VP don, leave them like the letter T
You won't see me run, unless its police

Now it's time to face your opponent
Infamous cling to this real shit, stuck where we started at
Fuck that, not because we have to, I want to
I love this shit, the raw is what I live for
To hear the sound of the crowd roar for more
To see the niggas that can't pay rush the door
Whylin' on the dancefloor
When they song come on, swingin' they fists, ready for war
But it's a different type of effect, it's not violence
They're just tranced by the advance
Tranked by the sound bank
Put under the drum, numbed off of our shit
Now who you rockin' wit'? them or us
Deep love or cheap lust?, QB'll bust
Infamous till we pass on
You laughin' at the wrong shit, I take ac-tion
Defend my confedons
Nigga I write bombs that'll shatter your ambitions of bein' top dog
As we move through the stage fog
I need to bass more
So I can taste it and make y'all go AWOL
And lose it, say no more, brace your delf, nigga it's on...
Verse 2: (Cormega)
(Yo, back up yo..)
Who's tale you tellin' are you frail or felon?
Were you makin' sales or watchin' niggas sellin'?
You exploit niggas lives in your rhymes and then avoid 'em
You never felt the moisture in the air of coke boilin'
You never felt the razor scrapin' your plate
Your hands achin' yet you keep choppin' 'cause there's paper to make
You never felt the power of invincibility
Clutchin' a gun like fuck it dun, it's him or me
At your best you was a hand to hand
No more than Three grams
What the fuck you know about a Ki, man?
You never hustled
Let's get it right, my nigga Y would've stuck you
Stop dry snitchin' in your rhymes, listen
What you tryin' to do? help the guys in Blue?
Indight niggas so that can be another rhyme for you?
You a parasite, you never had a life
So you throw other niggas lives in your pad at night
It's clever when you write it
Spoken well for a dude who never been indighted
You know the deal mothafucka, the real make the fake niggas kneel
And lose appetites when you taste niggas steel
My rhymes are what it takes to get a deal and make it real
I'm like Big, you can't replace the skill
I laced it ill like Cocaine in Scarface's grill
Your mothafuckin' flow is basic, chill
I'm Cormega, raw forever
Y'all niggas know my steez, I'm reppin' for Queens
You minor league
I'm big time like Mark McGwire's team
Your whole team is pussy, when I squeeze vaginas bleed
My lyrics stay official
I bagged up coke on dishes made of crystal
Your niggas, they won't miss you
My Nickel-plated pistol - got Sixteen shots, you can take 'em wit' you
To the coffin or DA's office
Surgeory, nurses screamin' ""We lost him!""
Life suddenly divorced him, fuck it, it cost him
If you want beef say no more
Brace your delf, nigga it's on, we spray Four-Fours, bitch!"

Call me a old school cat wit aiyyoung mentality
I live by the day and I go out for family
I don't understand language if it ain't talkin' money
From the era walkin' 'round with knots lookin' bummy
Certain bitches knew the code so they went with the flow
And let you know they wanted fifty-four elevens from the door
We cut school, cooked caine, took traum' to the brain
And though a nigga had it, still hopped the fuckin' train
Look back and laugh but ain't shit funny still
My little brother took his life, forever I'm stuck with a ice grill
Got friends with chemical imbalances

Don't have another day right?
It's only right
Let me put you on to what happens Son, never believe this shit
Kick that shit
(Prodigy)
It's just another day, drownin my troubles with a forty
That's when I got the call from this brownskin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at? Said we could do whatever
She got her crew too, and said that we should get together
I said, ""Aight -- just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower""
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the hoe lonely in tears
Ain't no tellin' what her friends puttin' up in her ears
Ideas of settin me up, I'm not tryin' ta hear
(Check it out, Son) So we take the gats for precautions
Plus this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole batallion of Bucktowners
Waitin for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe, I'm blowin' this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen, to niggaz very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, fuck the world is my mental
We put together five soldiers, the bitch called
My blood curdled, told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waitin for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with fire piece, nuttin sweet
First nigga frontin gettin' lifted off his fuckin' feet
It took eternity, we reached our destination
My heartbeat is racin like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs then froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, ""Eyes open cause it might go down""
Said he don't like the way the shit is startin to sound
Evey angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It mighta been TNT, I wasn't tryin' to wait and see, we
Jetted through Marcy cause Dee's ain't baggin me
Word Son, they got us on the run, Dunn, see yo
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
Trife life got me thinkin' like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt yo
What can kill you is what you don't know
(Havoc)
OK check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib
But the bitch live in the 'Bridge
You ain't really sweatin it, cause little do you know
The niggaz in the 'Bridge be settin it
You thought you was safe and tried to walk the backstreets without heat
On the 41st Side (settin it) of 12th Street
The cyber-niggaz don't give a fuck
Decide well if you come through frontin, kid you gettin' bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide, no days
Son get the heat, 'cause I'm about to stick em
(Fuck that shit, yo if that nigga front, yo hit him!)
Aight bet, so just hold it down
While I cock back the long three pound
You're upstairs bonin, not knowin' that I'm scheamin
Just the right time kid, it's twelve in the evenin
You're leavin' out the buildin as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprised
""What's goin' on?"", as I reply
""Shut the fuck up and don't make this 'to another homicide""
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was the chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that we're juxin, if you got what we like you gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good lookin'
Now be catchin the cap that holes in ya Lewis in Brooklyn
Gettin' to' up from the flo' up, hit the dress sto' up
Got the 80-0 in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get'cha motherfuckin shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Makin' G's by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sippin Hennessey, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searchin me but never ever find shit
It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's
But all this bullshit holdin' me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slingin on the corner with my niggaz
Pullin the trigger when the drama appears
Cause that nigga worse enemy is FEAR
So yo...
No doubt, so what can kill you is what you don't know...

148,Up North Trip,1995,The Infamous (1995),,Mobb Deep,"Verse One: Prodigy
It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookends, the way things is looking
It's Friday, you in for a long stay, gettin' shackled on the bus
First thing come Monday, hoping in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowing, home is a place you're not going for a long while
Now you're up on the isle, in a position that you ain't got to, refusing
To smile
But keep in mind there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requesting Pee, see you fragile
It ain't hard to see, niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
Cause the war populations are
If this was the street, my razor would be a mack demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screaming, what you in for kid
Busting nuts, taps heard of million street stories caught inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that
Wising up young blood, before you make things escalate, and I would hate
To set your crooked ass straight
Make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one false move
And it's a up north trip
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone
Niggas is trife, runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one
False move And it's a up north trip
Verse Two: Havoc
You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked, you talk too much shit
You should have kept your mouth shut, all that gossip
Motherfucker don't you know my glock kicks, hollow tips
To your body, mad toxic, I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I grazed you
Pop goes the glock when there's beef on the block, chill for a while
Make them think the beef stop, then I creep like a thief in the night
It's only right, ain't no turnin' back, it's on tonight, and if I get caught
Then my ass is up north, straight on the course for upstate New York
Stress, smokin' back to back cigaretttes, it popped off, gon' point in
The mess hall
But to avoid that, from head to toe, dipped in all black, hit them niggas
Where they pump they cracks at, Havoc, with the murder masterplan
Keep my nine up to par, so my shit won't jam, God forbid if my shit do
Run behind a tree, fix my shit then hit you, slugs in your body
Mainly in your brain tissue, witness from the scene, get ghost, stash
The pistol
So simple then, watch my back, lay up and relax, roll a sack, ?K-A black?
Find a shorty intact
Verse Three: Prodigy
I got the powder, combine wit the powder, and water, it oughtta
Drop in a half and hour, in the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil, then I pause
And ask God why, did he put me on the serve, just so I could die
I sit back and build on, all the things I did wrong, why I'm still breathing
And all my friends gone, I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
'Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle, but my
Heart pumps foul blood through my arteries, and I can't turn it back
It's a part of me, too late for cryin, I'm a grown man struggling
To reach the next level of life, without fumbling, down to folding
I got no shoulder to lean on but my own, all alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse, fuck the whole world kid
My money comes first, 'cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me, cause niggas will have you
Locked up
The snitch, be a man, givin' police the run down on your plans
We're never goin' down like that, so I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
The legal business, forever mine, fuck payin' taxes, the last kid that shitted
And gave police access, to my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out, a lesson that you can't
Live without
Repeat Chorus once
*Livin' the high life"

Occasional beef, no doubt, I'ma squeeze that trigga
Now P', that's my doggy, got drama I'm co-signin'
The new times, shovin' a fork in your nose linin'
In no time, when you catch the guard nappin'
That's a dog standin' next to him
Get shot and cut your frag in
I'm a bastard, from the cradle to the casket
Leave a bitch stuck like traffic
When I come through, king me and this mine's

Or my internet junkies downloadin' Mobb Deep
If you broke, yeah get the bootleg, that's on me

Got enough fans that'll hit the HMV, or the FYE
The Wiz and Sam Goodie plus the Warehouse got our sounds
Let's not forget the Mom's and the Pop's, they like our biggest accounts
It's a prime demand, we got enough to go around
We provide that gangsta in exchange for that amount

I was bruised in this game that's why I stay with them tools
Got nothing to lose, cause shit ain't workin' out for the kid
I had a deal over at Virgin, but they dropped the kid
How come, I don't know, they wasn't feelin' the kids
Or the music to hot for their ears to list'
Back to square one it's all good, it ain't gon' stop a nigga
Like have me do something stupid like go and pop a nigga
It's a movie and I'mma be the star of this shit
With ten bitches at one time, suckin' my dick
We gon' get rich and kill them two cats, that snitch
IM3, bustin' they way, through this hip hop shit
So watch your lip, don't say nothin' about my click
Or catch a clip, while you walkin' wit ya lady and shit
We crazy and shit, like chickens with their head cut off
We little niggaz with big guns that'll take your head off
And we rippin' your lady in the bathroom of the Green Acres Mall
Where gonna stand tall, we fall if a slug hit our chest
It's all gravy, Queensbridge roll like the Navy
Little girls runnin' around havin' mad babies

Yo, y'all don't a give a yeah, we don't give a yeah
At the, end of the day, a slug'll, ruin your liver

So fast, you won't have time to build

Ayo, we here foot in the door, time for take off
Yo, we take over, move over, IM3
And y'all niggaz don't really mean shit to me
Spread love through the five boroughs, tri-state mid-state
Violate, get your face carved in
Fuckin' with these Queensbridge marksmen
Never go against our grain, twenty tats, ball head cat, rep QB
See me on the stage iced out, laced up
Hazed up, jumping in them big ass trucks
When we shoot you better duck, you out of luck young'n
Catch you runnin' while we gunnin', chasin' you down like blood hounds
Beatin' you down, to the very last compound
With fo'four pounds, two aluminum bats, we ruin' you cats

Jump real quick, we them Queens motherfuckers, that stay in that bullshit

Looking back at time, a lot of niggaz died
Right before my eyes, suicide, homicide, do or die
My crew and I, pledge Infamous, don't leave no witnesses
We handled all our differences, these menaces we livin' it

Yeah... Get it poppin'...No doubt

Four for the guns blowin' getting shit straight
For them bitch ass niggas that hate
And I can tell right now that you really not knowing
When the guns start blowing and your blood stop flowing
You can take it to the heart bitch nigga play your part
All you saw was the spark now you laying in the dark
From the hood that I rep every nigga in my set
Generals to Cadets two-five till the death
Inadvertently I know niggas wanna murder me
But can't even analyze G, The Mahdi
Flow so precise, thug paradise, five karot ice
Black Christ living the life
Niggas see the light when they start losing pints
You can die by the gun or the knife
(Chorus: Havoc)
Hey yo
Eh yo a nigga ain't stoppin' know I got to get it poppin'
Yo you know a nigga plottin' I rep the dirty rottin', (What's Good?)

And you know a nigga poppin' that shit when it's poppin'
Had a whole world watching and the whole game boxed in (I'm Good)
Okay with it, talk 'cause I live it
You appreciate the God like an up north visit

Thun I analyze these niggas, 'cause they simple like bitches
And to damn feminine to fuck with this veteran
Stop the rhetoric, you know the led will get hot
You know this metal shit ain't nothing to fuck with
Know I work that steel with a workman's will
Staring so hard don't make me hurt that grill
Apologize nigga dog you ain't that real
Your man got bagged did time you squeeled
Glass slipper wearin' ass niggas get killed
You ain't a grown man till you pay some bills
Keep it gully been pimpin' before I had 4 wheels
The pipe game cool, but my talk game ill
Wanna fuck with a nigga 'cause I know my shit
You owe that bank, I own my shit
Out the gate don't ask, can't floss my whip
It ain't who you know, bitch it's who you with

Yo I settle with, heavy metal shit for my thugs in Connecticut
Murderville nigga how you feel?
Flow so sick, them niggas can blow dick
Better analyze what lies before you trick
In the mix of some Queens niggas tryin' to get rich
Any nigga in my way can feel the gun spit
Get your Du-Rag split with long four-fifth
Hand glide through your hood in the six
Road call for my niggas who you wit? (Thug Shit)
Road call for my niggas who you wit? (Thug Shit)
Let it bang make it pop till your heartbeat stop
Know the game don't stop till the casket drops
The God run out of shots then they tape the block
Rep to the death for my carnivores on lock
And my dogs in the box meet you back on the block
You know how the team rocks, till we reach the top
(Chorus: Havoc)
Eh yo a nigga ain't stoppin' know I got to get it poppin'
Yo you know a nigga plottin' I rep the dirty rottin', (What's Good?)

Yo my rap taste good in my mouth like Deer Park
For your ears to list-this
You don't wanna miss this dun
Don't be a statistic
Keep your rhymes to yourself, we make fools out of niggas
And write shit that would certainly move y'all niggas
PEACE to my summer villains with pink houses
>From Red Hook to QB you know the routine
We need a movie to show how our life is so ill
Every Summer in the projects we partied on the benches
Few gallons of gin and pepsi
Remember Party wars, that was back in like 90
We use to roll o-wees now we stuff dutches
Kids rushing, what's your discussion
Y'all niggas talk alot of shit heard you on your tape fronting
I fake nothing, Fuck around and push the wrong button
I dedicate my days to seeing your drip blood
I will always love Gambino and ScarFace
Killa Black no man can fill your shoes, Now what's bad news
It couldn't get no worse, So what y'all niggas know about the turmoil
What ya know about your blood soil, Clothes and little Ho's
And the legs of pant slugs that crack the shin bone
The Other shot blasts through your left clavical
Melt swizz suits and paint the avenue's
Havoc
How you want it? Bent Scheme or straight blunted
Many are rare, rore, Havoc has just over done it
While you sitting there whispering like a little girl
Fuck, waiting around till the dutchy gets twirled
We going at you, not 'cause we want to but 'cause we have to
To avoid the situation that you couldn't last through
If I can't have it at all I don't want it at all
Off top serious dogg, I'm out for the raw
Back to the world, the shit that I kick will dazzle your girl
Handle your bitch, can't then take her for pearl
Get him with the pink slip, get him bent to he hurl
Hennessy got my mind locked, tight in a curl
Hold it down like Saddam you can't search my click
Even with dirty worms I'm gonna still appear
How you want it, bent scheme or straight blunted (2x)
Cormega
Yo, my pen is sick like a heroin add-dict, Whenever Mega spits
Exhale preciseness, Drug Dealer Ghetto shit
Sweat in my hand, plus the finger numb from mesasuring grams
Gun on my waist, In case I see son
Who wetted my man
I be Gortexing to death, rocking ice with special fx's
Obvious I was destined to rep
Yo my persona is the drama, my Infamous Congrommalits
Considered mad real, niggas feel the Montana shit
Born official, my niggas that are gone I miss you
I shed a tear, see y'all niggas when I get there
Yo my dun did six years and still didn't hit the strip
I'm waiting on the day, when Rikers Island ciphers are incomplete
When I can sleep with no heat, hidden beneath the sheet
And I can relax with my air max, appearing on my feet
When I rhyme you enter my mind, Seeing nigga's lead to excellence
I represented then manifested in the beat... Respect this
Like a lexus jeep
My technique
Leaves my enimies stretched for weeks, vexed from me
Especially they know my destiny, man they scared to death of me
Can't even question me, I serve them like stretching ki's... please

P yeah you heard of him, big ignorant chains and sports cars
Gallons of Bacardi, been at the awards
I need a bitch like Christina Aguiler-y for a broad
I know I can splack that, she dyin' for a thug
And she heard of me, she know about my Infamous life
Shootouts in New York with various types
Fast money, faster guns, we party e'ry night
'Cause we perform, e'ry day of the week for that price
(Mobb Deep) Who you know got a similar catalogue
And still sound brand new, like we just started?
The Carhatt Mobb, Guess jean team
Forty inch chain gang, volume please
So these people can hear the sounds of Queens
I make your arm hairs stand up, it had to be me
Mixed with the A-L-C and H-A-V
N.Y.C. to L.A., we do our swing
E'rybody have a ball, e'rybody party
E'rywhere you turn it ain't nuttin but phatties and hotties
E'rything is all love till you try to try me
That's when I make e'rybody (shhhh)

When you hear the... it's on
When you hear that... it's on

Yo I'ma glow, like a dirty bomb, jux, with the certy arm
Rippin anything, that you motherfuckin hear me on
Add it to the catalogue, heavy hitters had the song
Niggaz showin no feelings and me, got 'em camoflauged
(F'real baby) You little babies so emotional
And tip-toe around the beef until that toast to you
Ain't got no problem in smokin' you
Enemies I could deal with, be the ones that's close to you
And do, what I'm 'posed to do, approach Duke
Why you faggots only squeezin from out, the vocal booth?
Know my style be that overproof, open the Coupe
Open your face was talkin', wasn't talkin' to you
And now the medics gotta mind to your face, tyin the lace
You tellin' that a D.A. got 'em tryin' the case, yeah
Bottom line you cowards is ass
Know Mobb good, in numbers y'all music is trash

Yeah
Infamous in ya area
Eightball in ya area
About to cause mass hysteria
Yo, ashes to ashes big gats to little
I put it to you clear while you cats talkin' riddles
Snake and buck at me
If you did I'd say you got lucky
Trained to tread through land to get muddy
Ayo, blood rap
Survival of the fifth style cat
I puts it down blow a round at your baseball cap
Pee, Niggas saying damn why I be like that
Listen close you can learn from it
It's real black
Gangsta shit makes the world rotate
If eight was all make a nigga wanna gain some weight
Fat belly black motherfuckin D-O-G
And I'm a thug for them young niggas thuggin' for me
Ayo
Fuck where you at kid
Its where you from
'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my Queens Duns, Niggas who pump drugs
To all the housing projects who rep for they hood
Live and direct from the south to your stereo
Prepare for bustin' and dumpin okay player here we go
Strapped with infa-red raps when I hit the traps
Crack the wack into pieces when I hit the track
Like stone to glass I shatter they raggedy ass
South style waiving my motherfuckin soldier rag
A hard illustration of my brutal lifestyle
Memphis Ten made a lot of niggas buck wild
The root to all evil daily I chase it
Blow it on weed and drink then hustle to replace it
It's hard from the start where I lay my head
We get rowdy and bust shots till we raise the dead
Yo fuck where you at kid
Its where you from
'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my gold grill niggas and my trail niggas
South to east we keep it hard for them real niggas
Feel my though, You don't want to get filled up with holes
Moms filling out surgery cards blowing her nose
Wiping her tears cause something on your top got shot
Should have brought alone wit you what you loaned on the block
Fuck, leaving without it dunn I'd rather get knocked
Charged with a ten body for a nigga get shot
For a weak ass bitch, fuck that little whore
Even though she get my dick harder than the parol board
Stick and move, slide in, slide out big guns
Mack milly prepare to mob you steel phillies
Connected with Eightball dunn so what's the drilly
Out to take it all if you wit me then feel me
Don't get yourself shot
Bleedin to death hops
I pop canners off leave a nigga head whopped
A maverick my H-K will work magic
You'll find yourself in the O-R for talkin' that shit
Street justice I tip the scale over cousin
I hold more weight you just a no name nigga frontin
Get your hardware lets treat it like a contest
And we can dance till one of us drop from being hit
Murda Muzik my street life influenced it
It's so real bredren I wouldn't test it I rep it
A renegade crack your top like devil spring
Vigilante niggas know the song I sing
It go
Fuck where you at kid
Its where you from
'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
No mistakes for the fake no escape
Chop them boys up and puttin' it in their face
Fuck where you at kid

'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my ice pick niggas one
To all my dunns trying to get the fuck up out of the sprungs
Fuck where you at kid

'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my Queens Duns, Niggas who pump drugs
To all the housing projects who rep for they hood
Fuck where you at kid

To all my gold grill niggas and my trail niggas

Let's do it dunn... My man... That's why I keep my mouth tight.
Ain't got no worries for y'all niggaz man... y'all niggaz is crazy
(Prodigy)
Hey yo, its hell on earth down here the pavement scorching
Its more on roc when the Mobb walks in
Shit gets hot like a ill pot of grits spilled on you
Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you
I understood you should try to take my life
If I was you I would too damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until...
I made things right
Pull out guns exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes...
And never let the daylight deceive
During the suns' hours niggaz do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggaz can't shoot never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop
Fresh out of box shit filled to the top
Smell the barrell when its bolt-locked nigga
Hook1 (PRODIGY)
Have you ever lost a loved one?
Or never understood love till you lost one?
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at? Strength missing
To take losses is the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest
Strive regardless. Where your heart at? Brave-hearted.
Now lets find out where niggaz hearts' at
(Havoc)
This is to my physical you gone... to me you still here
I be buggin thinking how you doin' up there
Probably watching over me calling out my fouls
Fuck with mad chicks but I take care of my child
I miss that ass tell God I said pardon me
If Your real; He'll forgive me (no doubt)
But I ain't crying no more about how you're gone
Used to hold me down niggaz front its on
Ain't wetting going to jail you better shoot me
Just lost my heart-If I die you comin' wit' me
Quickly while I'm pissy they're just bitches that's a little to frisky
Risky on point hope these cats is getting the point whisper out my name
Stand but please don't point call me paranoid
But I'm on point close by the stash joint Got you in my mind
I guess that's why the say love is blind
Hook 2 (PRODIGY)
Strength missing we take losses. be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest. Strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave-hearted.
You better finish what you started (dunn)
If you ever lost a loved one?
You'll never understand love till you lost one.
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at? Strength missing
To take losses be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest
Strive regardless. Where your heart at? Brave-hearted.
Now lets find out where niggaz hearts' at
Have you ever lost a loved one?
You'll never understand love till you lost one.
Where your heart at?
I left mines' behind wit' my dearly departed
Now where your heart at?
(Prodigy)
I find myself dozing off with it (guns)
Waking up every forty minutes (dun)
Soaking wet dripped to death in it
On top of rules big barells and tools get tested
And hittin off makes my dick get erected
We all strive for a better tomorrow
But as far as today your ass gotsa' pay
And ain't no time better than the present one at hand
And never keep your shit too far from your hand
(Havoc)
Think about this are you with your hands on who you running with
Some timers, Playa' hata's and dick riders
Bent niggaz' that be crashin into dividers
Gettin' you into shit got that ass tied up
Got them la'd up got you comin' out of your vault
With no plans of giving back live in serious debt.
Your lady fucking other niggaz you a fool for her
Talking 'bout you got money you just using her

Shit, thug listen (What up baby?)
Ain't nothin' 'round here but drug addiction
Niggas is anti-love-livin'
The slug-givin' little shortie on the snub itchin
For beef, he might get left in the street with his blood drippin
The poor niggas sling crack, real raw niggas that bang gats
Crazy lady jumped on the train tracks
Know if you owe somebody dough you better bring that
Them kids is live, put five where your brain at
You walk the streets of the slums
Know to spot beef when it come
Reach for the guns or feel the heat from the ones
Never know who your killer be (Yeah, speak to no one)
Just put a Desert Eagle beak in his lung
Leak 'em and run, some guys light the blunts up
(And then what?) And then go ride with the pumps up
Chopped up bitch inside of a dumpster
Paramedics tryin' to speed a nigga pulse up
(Yo, he's a cold blue) victim of the vultures
Block sizzlin hot, flooded in the middle with cops
Innocent nigga topped, riddled with shots
Kids up in rock spots clock knots, fiddle with glocks
Ready to die for what little they got
Tricks, hoes and thugs (That's right)
The ones that put holes in mugs
Waitin outside for them ones that pose in clubs
To that strange nigga knockin' on your do' with gloves
Let the .44 blow for grub, it's no love
(VERSE 2: Prodigy)
You got uniformed cops, the D's when it's hot
TNT knockin' down the door of your spot
The feds come get you once you think you on top
They just been buildin they case, they got you on tape
The CIA clip you if the shit is that deep
Your money's that long, you ain't that strong
Informants'll bury you under the jail
They got wires and statements for juries to hear
Then they got rivals that got it clickin just like you
That's your competition, them niggas tryin' to eat too
They'll set you up for dead if you don't show strength
Extort all your workers cause you ain't built for this
Plus stick-up kids and jealous-ass niggas
You gotta watch your front, sides and your back (Damn)
You gotta keep your eyes on your bitch and your mens
You gotta keep your mind sharp livin' so fed"
