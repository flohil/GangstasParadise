I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate?)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter
I know it, I know it, I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home
Ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate?)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning under water
And it's the light that's in the air
When you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on though the roads long
Seeing light in the dark, yeah, these things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finding hope in who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
I know where you been, where you are, where you going
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate?)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore"
1,"30,000",2011,Young Sinatra (2011),Hip Hop,Logic,"Wake up, you bitch-ass
Cracker-ass motherfucker
See all I ever wanted was a window to sit close to
And you don't understand but in the end you ain't supposed to
I'm talking first class, 30,000 feet under my ass
Living life on the dash, constant pursuit of cash
Now I'm living a life that you and yours could only dream about
And just a couple years ago this shit I used to scheme about
Rehearsing for hours in front of my mirror
Until my voice was hoarse but my vision was clearer
See this that new school style but the flow remind you of them old days
Fast forward to the present, rappers have no class like snow days
Good God, let me bring it back to hip-hops first renaissance
96' Kool-Aid and Sega Genesis
""Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
I love the way your lyrics make me feel\""
Roll it and get high, Light it up and fly
Feeling like I'm 30,000 feet up in the sky
I got em' saying
""Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
I love the way your lyrics make me feel\""
Roll it and get high, Light it up and fly
Feeling like I'm 30,000 feet up in the sky
So many people think that they know my whole situation
Conversations with people that handle public relations
Nothing but hundred dollar bills and standing ovations
Slowly pacing until I kill like that boy Jason
It ain't nothing, never folding or bluffin'
Get money, fuck bitches but respect women 'cause we love em'
Kiss em', touch em' and rub em'
Fuck em' but never grub em'
Hit it fast but then I slow it down like Robitussin
Shorty giving me brain until concussion
The club run out of vodka the second we rush in
Never under estimate the power in which I'm bustin'
My lyricism got yo girl blushin'
Ain't even touch her and yet she gushin' (ha)
Award shows, chilling with all my bros
Three-piece Ralph Lauren and some Jordans, I suppose"
2,44 Bars,2016,Bobby Tarantino (2016),Hip Hop,Logic,"If you're dealing war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
You no hear me yet?
Hear me live and direct
Walk with your tap
Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
Cause shit is different now
It's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets
Y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare - I just don't go outside
Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, ""'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride""
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, ""Talk that shit""
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album
I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now
Just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday
With a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
Cause people don't buy music in this day and age
They buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong
But back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt
We call that champagne"
3,5AM,2013,Welcome to Forever (2013),Hip Hop,Logic,"I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corners selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door
While gripping a.44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker put the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace, and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit, but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't in a fairy tale, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you've got a fucking problem bitch I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a peace
I just kill'em with kindness, yeah we leave 'em deceased
And tell it like it is and now you got it capish shorty waddup!
Let me bring it back down
You think it's a game right now (yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)
Back where I came from now
We're gon' live it up
Till we bring it back down
I hope you live a long life hatin'
And watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they'll probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out they so repetitive
Shout out my Homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
Rattpack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make a shooting from the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a cold world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, whoa
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it Rattpack, till the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seek though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mind stays celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz
My flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor
Murder all rappers in front of they momma's
I rip Artanis
Decipher the word because it's eubonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra
Yes, I got you bitch it's Logic
Let me bring it back down
You think it's a game right now (yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)
Back where I came from now
We're gon' live it up
Till we bring it back down"

Y'know, it's crazy 'cause it's two types of motherfuckers
It's one motherfucker talking 'bout:
Oh Logic's so slept on, he's so lowkey...
Knowing damn well this motherfucker did 135K first week
First fucking week!
Then it's other motherfuckers talking 'bout:
Oh, Logic's blowing up, he's getting so big now. I don't want him to blow up on me. Oh, Logic's changing...
'Cause he made a turnt ass mixtape!
We're going to be bumping this shit the whole summer!
The fuck?!
And do y'all not listen to lyrics?
He's making a whole other concept album
That's fucking insane!
This man dropped a project every year for six years
I mean, I'm not complaining though but-
This motherfucker made a number one album!
Made a mixtape after...
And then he's making another concept album...
Like his first shit didn't already go Number 1?!
This motherfucker's on a roll!
This motherfucker's like butter, he's on a roll motherfucker!
And it's peace, love and positivity
Logic is the only rap concert you can go to
And not get shot in the face
Like this motherfucker actually loves his fans
You name it: YouTube videos, Periscope, Vlogs, Q&A's
This motherfucker does it all!
You name it, he does it! The fuck?
What fucking rapper does that?!
And this motherfucker
Can solve up to seven Rubix Cubes in a minute...
Who the fuck do you know can do that?!
(Spoken: Logic (Marty Randolph))
Oh, hey-hi, Logic...
Hey, how's it going?
My name's Mar-Rick-
My name's Randy Mardoff
Definitely never spoken before...
I was calling just to say, uh
Just wanted to wish you, ugh, lots of uh, suc-success...
And uh, maybe we can have some lunch
I don't know if this is a direct line to you
But yeah, once again this is, uh, uhm-Randy Mardoff
Never spoken before...
You can call me back at any time, m'kay?
All right, bye

Oh shit... fuck! I didn't leave my number! I gotta fucking call back and deal with this shit again?!"

I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
Knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
I'ma, I'mma come through and show my wood pine
Boy I know my shit was on another level
When people would joke around and say I signed with the devil
'Cause it's gotta be a sin to be this good
Hating on my music shit I wish you would (I wish you would)
Yeah I been offered four of five deals
Bust like banana clips boy that's four or five kills
Doing the most accumulating so much bread
I think it's time for toast and I ain't talking fine wine
I'm talking semi-automatic shit that blow your mind
Then when I blow like mine the whole world gon' see me shine
This is the life that I should live homie
I'm never going back, I'm addicted to the game
Y'all can tell by the tracks
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around

I'm addicted and I just can't get enough
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough
I'm addicted to the game, addicted to the pain
Of sacrificing matters of the heart just to obtain
Living a life that most won't attain
And I know it is essential
But when it comes to love, man, that shit is subsequential
For now I just be chillin' with ballers
Poppin' collars, pushing Impalas, cutting records and counting dollars
I'm addicted, my lines is cocaine
And when they disperse blow minds like propane
And you know these haters that never made it this mad
'Cause they never had what we had
Addicted to the game and I'm glad
On my Amy Whinehouse I'm saying fuck Rehab
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
Knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around

Been looking for holy water, now I'm praying for a flood

While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you'll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people I'm black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik

Want to act like I'm adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it

Black man screaming, trying to convince me I'm not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but life's not
And I'd be lying if I said I didn't care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe it's in my head

Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her

How could her momma mislead her

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don't waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you're not your salary. You're not your house. You're not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else's. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not 'bout the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, we've been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we'll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I'm cueing up the fourth album now, his final one
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap
When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, accept Him"

All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Ever since I was a youngin I knew I'd break in the game
While you worshipped other rappers that leave you less entertained
I was strategizing before the people knew my name
Fame what I shall attain on the road to success
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain
I know we fight, but that's 
Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we 
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?

Chillin' in a-gadda-da-vida, rockin' Adidas
With a senorita and she sippin' liquor by the liter
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino
He know we be in the casino lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito whenever I step on the beat, ho
Like a killer on the creep slow
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with the sawed off
Blowin' up like a molotov
This is war everybody ain't no reason I'ma call it off

They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday
And I'm blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got champagne problems, and I order more my wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up
Hype nigga back-back-back it up
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop
That's the type of shit I boycott
Yellin' fuck the 5.0, state troops
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts
I got these good girls hoin' out
Tell me what the fuck you know about
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know about
Then they throw you in the game then you mothafuckin' blow it out
Now everything is all right
Whippin' through Gotham, hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off 'em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain but I be killin' 'cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela
Hit you with a Beretta get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me
Probably wanna fight me, but I just keep the peace
No need to keep a piece
I keep my enemies on a leash capiche?
And keep it real for the people I reach!"

(Speech)
It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of one's body
I'm not here
I'm not me
I'm not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It can't be anxiety
It can't
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah, of course
I'm so in control of my mind and my body
But I'm subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
I am scared, I am human, I am a man
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don't really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Cause now I'm just a grown up who doesn't know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No, no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you, the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
And live with anxiety"

With a pocket full of change, every day a different dime
Only fuck with golden girls and I ain't talking Lifetime
When I rhyme they up on me 'cause they seen how I'mma shine
Now you may be wondering how my raps rock
'Cause I'm so fifth key to the right of Caps Lock
And when my tracks drop I'mma be sipping Ciroc
With a whole skyline chilling in the backdrop
Shit, nigga I was born ready
And I swear I'm what these rappers can't bear, warn teddy
My Pro Tools bouncing like a '64 Chevy
I'm trying to win fast y'all on that Eddie

Been in it for miles, don't believe ask Darius
Running this beach like Chariots of Fire
I aspire to be higher than these superficial liars

I'm a ball out and die in Maryland, Len Bias
Apply a sire to my name, yeah you ain't know I'm royal

No clouds but I can feel the rain
Pointin' fingers lookin' for someone to blame (lookin' for someone to blame)
Till I came across my own name
I wasn't in control of my destiny
Feelin' empty thinkin' where's the rest of me
I gotta make it but I need the recipe
Only then will I find the best of me
I didn't wanna listen, didn't give a fuck
I was so selfish, I was so stuck
Cleanin up food, for a little buck
Then I quit that, livin' on luck
I was so lost, at what cost
Why be the worker, when you could be the boss
Still doin' wrong, trynna live right
Get my mind righteous, man I what a fight
Shit gettin' tight, man that ain't right
And my girl left, so I just might
So I just might

""We do have fields on the Babel station and also...""
""Yeah yeah but that's all synthetic, I mean were heading to this planet right? That we call ""Paradise"" because we hope it can sustain life. Why?""
""Because we'll eventually run out of resources.""
""Exactly I mean what if we got there and it's exactly as the data predicted: beautiful, lush. Then we destroy it just like we did Earth. There's only 5 million human beings left in the universe. I mean it's weird to think about the fact that in 2065 the last footprint was left on Earth before ascending to Babel.""

16,Bounce,2014,Under Pressure (2014),Hip Hop,Logic,"Living good, I've been living good
Rolling through my hood, understood
Just a younging in this bitch up to no good
In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me
Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though, they know
We've been at it way before the fame, ho (Way before the fame)
We've been at it way before the fame, ho (Way before the)
We've been at it way before the fame, psyche
Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit
No ain't just tryna hit, get, get with this
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do
Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue
I'm coming through
If I see your bitch I bet she coming too, what it do
We ain't never switch it up, we keep it true
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho

At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)

Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
We've been at it way before the fame
Back again, like I never left
Had to take a breath
Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore
God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam
They know who I am
Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce
Fuck it, make it count
With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa
Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla
It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross
Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl
RattPack, know the deal
What's the motto? Keep it real!
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it
We live in an era where they get deleted
I'm wondering if Imma make it
Man fuck it I'll take it, that record I'll break it
These bitches they love it, but I never covet
I just keep it going that's why I be flowing
I'm already knowing this life that I'm living
Don't know what I'm given
It's so hard not to give in
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)

17,Buried Alive,2014,Under Pressure (2014),Hip Hop,Logic,"Tell me how you feel
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that's just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna to be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I've been buried alive
Everything happens for a reason
People only in your life for seasons
Word to Aunt Viv
Death and taxes that's all we give
You can make a life but can't make a livin'
You can make it work but that still ain't driven
Give a lot but that still ain't givin'
Livin' life like this ain't real though
Every night like this I feel so
Dead wrong, collision is head on
My vision is dead and gone
Perception of right and wrong
I been here so very long
Right here in this very song
Look around everything changes
Seem like everybody just strangers
Don't go outside 'cause it's dangerous
Why everybody wanna be famous
I'm so OCD if they notice me
I might jump out the grave so they know it's me
Man everybody want this shit for free
Hand out palm up when they get to me
In my mind know I never let it get to me
Everybody got a time will it get to me
V's up motherfucka that's victory
Tell me why what I'm doing ain't shit to me, damn
Buried alive, buried alive
Will I survive?
Buried alive
I gotta know
I gotta know
It feels like I've been buried alive
Buried alive
Let it breathe
I'm feelin' this villainous villain inside of my mind
Every time that I'm willing I feel like I'm killin' my dreams
When that voice goes nah, nah, nah
Listen up now
Love it or hate it, never debate it, you can never degrade it
While these other motherfuckers probably thinking
I made it
My mind jaded no we never evade it
To elevate it just to keep it innovative, innovated
God damn, bring it back now
Blowin' up like Iraq now
RattPack put me on the map now
No we never back down
Just take my time, I just take my time
I know, Imma get it like this
So everyone know that I did it like this
Yeah, I know
Imma take my time
Battle the image inside of my mind
I know, Imma keep going
Tell me I can't but I'm already knowing
I know, I'm gonna rise
Even though I've been buried alive
Buried alive, will I survive?
I gotta know
I gotta know
It feels like I've been buried alive
Buried alive
Let it breathe
Outkast
A Tribe Called Quest
The Red Hot Chili Peppers
And films by Quentin Tarantino
Were in rotation constantly
Throughout the duration of this album's creation"
18,Champagne Thoughts (Interlude),2011,Young Sinatra (2011),Hip Hop,Logic,"I would like to make an announcement
To everybody that said I wouldn't amount to anything
In the minds of music
I told you, what did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you
'Cause I told you
Mmhmm
And when did I tell you
A long time ago
And what did I say
What happen when I told you
Exactly what just happened
I love to jump up on the track
So poetic with the champagne
I'm sipping got me spitting moetic
The second I aim I dead it
Now give me the credit
'Cause I envision myself living in wealth
Breakfast at Tiffany's
Lunch at Louis V's
Now excuse me please
I got dinner plans overseas
Killin' with ease
Young Sinatra got your girl
And now she a Bobby Soxer
Girl with nice clothes
And thick curls"

My life was just fine way back before you
Now when you reach out I just ignore you
Cause this ain't a love song (Whoa)
This is ""So long""
You did me so wrong for so long, for so long
No I never thought I could live my life without you
All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you
And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said I doubt you
I doubt you even know why I left you behind

I know that I've been living

I said I doubt you
I doubt you even know how I let you...
Much love to Def Jam, even though they under shipped me
Did me like Bobby did Whitney, but the fans was with me
Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album
But black vs white bullshit was the still the outcome
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow
Who gives a fuck who made it, I penetrated and innovated
While they emulated, give a fuck if I'm hated
I'mma do it till I get it, fuck a nominated
Bitch I dominate it
Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Not many get to what I do, and now enemies
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me
But let's get back to the music, I'm gone
Outside of this solar system I'm searching for paradise
Livin' the life, bitch I've been a vet
Fuck all these cats on the internet
I love Hip Hop and I hate Hip Hop
Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot
'Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sake
Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break
Now I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game
We all people, all equal
Now let me let off, yeah
Now let me let off
Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone
Switch flows, fuck 'em up
Play the game, run 'em up
Yeah I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck
All the people want is real
Guess that's why Logic appeal
All the power in the world, hold that, tell me how it feel
Racism on television and in magazines
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn
Country don't give a fuck who I am
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand
And I am, here's to the Roc
The .45 Glock that my older brother pop, shot
And I am finally on top
Too high up, not a drop
Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap
I am livin' like I ain't got it
Spit the flow so robotic, man who gives a fuck about it
Maryland till I die but I had to get the fuck up out it
I love it and hate it, you probably don't know man, I doubt it"
20,Confess,2017,Everybody (2017),Hip Hop,Logic,"I want what I want how I want when I want it
I'ma keep it a hunnid, I'm blunted
I don't give a damn, I don't give a fuck about another man
Fuck a brother man
I'ma make it make it rain like no other man
Old girl shoulda shoulda got a better man
Ass fat, lookin good in my letterman
In the hood I'm a better man
Wish a mothafucka would, would
Whole life I been up to no good
Change it all if I could
Rearrange my heart to beat good but I can't
I'm a sinner not a saint
Layers to my life, no I can't
Cover it up with paint
Keep on livin, livin
Livin on money and women
As soon as I'm in em I'm out
Now the truth never come out my mouth
Speak life when I come in her mouth, like
I'm a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life
A waste of skin
Wanna repent, don't know where to begin
Next of kin don't give a damn bout me
I know God don't give a damn bout me
People try but don't know bout me
But the devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Somebody save me, I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high
I'd rather be a different man in another world
Than work for the man in my universe
Wonder what it feel like, to take flight
Momma told me everything gon be alright
I mean my life can't be off right
But come to think about it everybody runnin the world seem to be all white
Can you mothafuckas see alright?
I mean I need it, I want it, I gotta have it
Every day tragic
If you're from where I'm from everyday ain't magic
On this I know
I been telling everybody I'ma give it a go, I know
I been there before, feel it in my soul, oh I know!
Love it or hate it, I made it
I did it, I lived it
While the whole world lookin at the boy like whoa!
Baptized in a ocean of Hennessey
Really wonder what the remedy
Tell me, how the world gon remember me?
Got me feelin like the enemy
Like I ain't got no energy
I been lookin for an entity
Feelin like I need to chill, like I need a new amenity
Fuck all that
I'm a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life
A waste of skin
Wanna repent, don't know where to begin
Next of kin don't give a damn bout me
I know God don't give a damn bout me
People try but don't know bout me
But the devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Somebody save me, I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high
I know my life was lived the wrong way
I know I did you wrong in my own way
But it was the flashing lights that mesmerized
That hypnotized the only
Part of me you loved
Part of me that had the strength to rise above Part of me you know
Part of me you love more than to let it go"

Logic this logic that, Logic sick, Logic wack
Logic just don't give a fuck, Rattpack
So many people think that rap is they calling, stop it just cease
Got-a-ca-peashe this is my house you fuckers just lease
Waitin' on a record deal that's never cumming like a priest
Black and white like a nun
These up-and-comers our sun
Like the break of dawn
So follow your father like an apostle paint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil
Never knowin' what's gon' follow
However we never wallow in our sorrow
Just pray for tomorrow
At times my heart could be hallow
Emotions forced to be swallowed
While neighborhood cats blast star gas like the apollo
This is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder
Life's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you so I'm trying to find her
One moment she'll love you then swallow you whole like an anaconda
The bitch is kinky, kind of
So with the lift of a pinky I'mma
Dominate the world like my name was brain
Spit flame like propane
Bitches I overcame you know the name
Ink in my veins, inflames, and spew on the page, to numb the pain like Novocain, muthafucker
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Allow me to kill it off the brink like no traffic
Murderin' every demographic
Paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic
Rip the mic to set the example
While all these muthafuckers testin my patience like blood samples
Constant thoughts of suicide,
Where living in an era that's do or die
Society expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I
But we persevere force fear enemies saying ""we want nothing but peace and if not we leave 'em deceased""
In your central nervous system like heroine reppin' Maryland to the fullest
Bustin' like bullets that travel through chambers that are ignited by triggers don't pull it
I go from point A to point B by keeping it G
Ain't no killer but don't push me
If you grab the heat you a pussy
Buckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steal
I have not a single enemy
Only evil entities that have some how befriended me, In they mind
'Cause I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme
And when it comes to dame's I catch plane's
They catch feelins
Haters keep my name in they mouth like villains
High as the ceiling
Y'all really don't know who your dealing with now
Visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen
I'm thankful for every breath I'm given
Fuck social division
On the road to success and there ain't no time for collision
People ask ""how you get your flow so amazing""
To which I reply ""I have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions""
Haters taken shots but I never graze 'em
Now if pro is the opposite of con
What's the opposite of pro-gress
I love my country but that shit a mess
Grew up on sex and they that I can attest
And how they wonder why I claim that I'm the fucking best
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Now if I don't believe it y'all won't perceive it
Now run it back and retrieve it
Till you receive it in your motherfuckin mind
Only 22 but I feel like I'm 99
Back in 1999 that's when I began to rhyme
Surrounded by narcotics and crime but you know I shine
Daddy was smokin' crack I was raised by a single mom
Fastin' every night I ain't talking 'bout no Ramadan
I was poor as fuck me and my momma, we didn't have a dime
At 16 the school system dismissed him and wished him well
But my momma never fought it, how the fuck could I prevail?
So I focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own
I left home at 17
Shortly after my momma got stabbed by fucking around in the streets
But she still breathin' which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving
So many rappers biting me you would think they was teethin'
And now you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my story"
23,Deeper Than Money,2016,Bobby Tarantino (2016),Hip Hop,Logic,"People want to talk about what makes them happy

Know I'd never fade away
But my life is not okay, I...
I take the bus to my job and one night I got robbed
Life is fucking up my vibe, I...
I wish had a lot of money
Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper, you already know
My life would be so much better with cheddar
Only work as hard as I do for vendetta
Cause my ninth grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit
Wouldn't be nothing, working that minimum wage
And cooking McMuffins, so I'm puffing on this green
Wishing I had more money than I do
Imagine if I had more money than Erykah Badu, 
And so I'm all about my business
Is there anyone who wit this?
Can a brother get a witness like: 
Wassup with it, come and get it
Tell me now what's on your mind
I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline
Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine
Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line
Somebody tell me now what done happen to society
My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety
They say that money cannot make you happy
Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke
And wouldn't try to be, who is you to try with me?
Why you trying me, like 
Jump up on that MPC, like a boss MVP
Cook up shit that make other producers wanna envy me
Master it then set it free, turn it into MP3s
Spin that shit up in Serato, I can feel the energy

I do, I do-this the shit that I love
This the shit that I love
Comes straight from above
Off the top off the dome
Gotta get it, go home
Hella late, feeling good, got a lot on my plate
What the fuck is on my mind?
I just, I just want to rhyme
This the type of shit I got to do
Oh my God, what's the time?
Can you feel it right now?
Can you feel the whole style?
It's the type of shit, I gotta get it, gotta get it
I've been vibing out here in Malibu
Would you come through?
Tell me motherfucker truly what it do?
L-O-G-I-C, this is who I be
L.A. where I'm at, M.D. what I be
All that, all that

Bust like raw sex, rappers suck like vortex
The life of a Don- We living like kings, and killing our pawns
Boy, the seconds it's on - don't know where we going
I'm flowing and killing this shit from dusk till dawn
Just had sex with a Middle Eastern girl- The pussy was bomb
That last line made no sense like these rappers' careers
But I make dollars, 'cause I'm all about the fiscal year
Yeah; you don't like me? I'll conjure up and summon all your fears
You wanna fight me? I'll woop my own ass before you get here
Wanna write me? And tell me that my rhymes suck?
Bitch I don't give a fuck, I'll stab you in the gut, call it a tummy tuck
You can ask my ex, I bust quicker than two techs
Caressed by a kid with category 5 tourettes
In other words I squeeze with ease, dot my I's and cross my T's
I'm a perfectionist; the lesson is fuck everyone assessing this
It's hip-hop, not to be taken literally
However on the light of note I stayed with bills like Hilary
My flow convects, murder subjects with little respect
Best protect your neck, before you play my tape better inspect the deck
Fuck every other rapper forever ever forever since the dawn of time
Sike- I'm not that much of a dick when I rhyme
On another level like duplex, bust heads like suplex
Slaughter MC's then ask who's next...
Ey yo my crew next, but you say you next, so I guess we now
Priceless flow so even If I write it's still a freestyle
Never busting gats I ain't no gangster put that heat down
Then go and grab a mic and see if you can fuck with me now
I got that A plus flow I'm on a roll bitch I can't fail
Making money with my mind, call that shit a brain sell
Raise hell, like I'm Satan's daddy while you in here
Catch me in a tenant caddy with a bitch from Cincinnati
With the thickest fatty while I hit the gas, you lick it gladly
With the window down see other bitches blowing kisses at me
It's a fact that me and Logic rip with vicious rap to list a wrap
We spittin' crack to keep the fiends, coming back to show world
Reppin Maryland but I make music for the whole world
Seduce a chick with lyrics whenever she hear it, it make her toes curl
So sick I hope I don't hurl, if you love me let me go girl
Cause no pussy come before my flow, just had to let you know girl
Spit it so thorough and in depth, I bet I leave in you impressed
Rattpack be my family, I fuck with y'all no incest
Only interest is to blow up, and watch they hands go up
'Cause I used to throw shows back then but no one would show up
I ain't all about the money but I want it homie sho' nuff
Cause krispie crazy bout' the cream, you could say I'm doughnuts
I murdered my manager Chris last night
We exchanged a couple words, he said some things I didn't like
I said okay... then punched him in the face with a butcher knife
I want more like Ashton Kutcher's wife
Now can you feel it? They won't {Sinatra}
Gimme what I want, so fuck it I'm a steal it
I'll dilapidate you, grab the butter knife and decapitate you
Yeah that's what I said - huh, and bitch I did it
We all have thoughts like this; I'm just willing to admit it
I would never act upon these thoughts now, don't you get it?
It's like when a gentleman sees the baddest bitch and thinks, ""I'd hit it!""
But he never says it; I'll dump your body in a dessert
It's the wrath of a psychopath clutching a razor blade in a bath
Having his last laugh, anticipating a gash- the other night I murdered captain crunch
Right in front of Toucan Sam and a whole damn bunch
That's life, what can I say? I'm a cereal killer, venereal dealer
And yes you know they ain't none other iller

From the very beginning from the second I'm in
I'm trying to tease you let me please you
Baby girl you know I need you
Do you like it, never had it
Putting work with this one right here
Yeah you know it's just for fun
Give it to you like I was trying to conceive a son
I gets it done then I'm ready for more
Ain't no telling where we'll go
But one thing that I know fo sho
This angel has no halo
I don't play no games
You can ask my ex I never eat the box
But if I control her I may select some freaky shit to start
Then bring it back
We can go for hours girl I never slept
Tell me how you want it
Face to face or rough and from the deck
Just like that she gon' overwork me if I let her
But I don't give a damn I just wanna feel better (ay)"
26,Driving Ms. Daisy,2014,Under Pressure (2014),Hip Hop,Logic,"Somewhere this shit done got crazy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
With my hands on the steering wheel
And my eyes on the pavement
I give a fuck 'bout where they went
I owe my lawyer a payment
They talking 'bout no arraignment
Now I wonder where the rain went
I just been all in my mind, homies tell me I'm stressing
I been counting what's on my bucket list and not on my blessing's
I think it's time for a lesson, hold up, you better pay attention
I can't end up like my momma popping anti-depressants
My therapist think I'm crazy, well shit, she probably does
All that stress I'm under, I wonder why I don't do drugs
Raised in a household full of killers and thugs
Shit I've been in doubt so long, don't know who I was
But I know who I am, yes, I know who I is
Please pardon my grammar, Daisy vibing with this
I've just been driving

I've just been driving Miss Daisy
That Bino the realest, uh, this beat made me kill it, uh
Her feet to the ceiling, she said that she love me
She never said that in college, 3005 is our mileage
I'm in my lane like a Prius, because I'm moving in silence
You still ain't broke down yet?
All the flashing lights and a couple Crown Vic's
Wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left
Tell your nigga speed up, she don't wanna get left
Relationships look closer in that rearview
Finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you
So now you gotta stop, park, put that shit in neutral
Yeah, you really love her, but is she worth your future?
Your 
, your 
, they'll be saying he got money
Think that 
 be with 
 if he left drive in the driveway?
Yeah, I know who you are, yeah, I know who you is
We were driving together, when we met we were kids
You ain't know 'bout the biz, I ain't know 'bout it either
I see you in that new ride, I flash my lights when I see you
I just be driving

This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

If it was, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn't take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
Wish I could erase that, face facts

Going HAM, full of all of them
In a spaceship, I'm in another system
So futuristic, on another mission
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my life - no inhibition, life to death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when inside the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'mma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'mma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just cause
Type of shit I see and probably wonder what it was
I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug
Basedheads coming through looking for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night its hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Living life to the fullest, I got to blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
God damn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Waking up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat (GunShots) like that
Guarantee you it's a wrap, finna put you on your back
Like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Got to leave from the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh
Just stop, stop, stop
'Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even got to drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related
Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting.
T's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355.
Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight
Living life like this, hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it Imma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about
What I pray about, check it uh yeah
Got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I want to run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the- (Gunshots) -in the dead of night
Selling crack to my own pops
Pushing this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck
Take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck
Get down and lay down
Hit you with the Beretta and you better stay down
Straight shots on the playground
Living how I'm living with the life that I'm given
Anybody that's riding with me, I'm riding with them
Show me the enemy and Imma hit em
The second I bit 'em I get 'em and hit 'em with the venom
Ain't no need to pretend Imma never do it
I knew it, all ready been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang related"

I'm on the come up
Anything that y'all do I'm one up
Y'all grind till like 3 in the morning
I grind till the sun up
Homie that's dedication
This world is what I'm facing
I only hope in the end that they all love and embrace me
(I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song)
Momma I'm sorry that I left at 17
(I apologize a trillion times)
Everything ain't what it seem when you try and follow your dreams
First you saw the bigger picture
Now you see behind the scenes
You thought everything was sweet
Now you see that shit is mean
Got a taste now you a fiend
Been into it since a teen
Yeah he nice so all his friends say he gon' blow like Hiroshim
Eyes on the prize like the baddest bitch you ever seen
At home late night, chillin', envisioning
Himself on the cover of Vibe magazine
But everything ain't what it seems
Though it seem like he gon' blow
Will he make it?
Maybe so
Too be honest I don't know
He got lyrics, he got flow
But it takes so much mo'
So much love
So much pain
With such little time to grow
Yeah we love it when he smile
But hate it when he frown
Remember when that girl turned his world upside down
But it made his music better
Brought emotion made it clever
Now we growing everyday
But he hungry try to eat
Brain like an EKG the way that he study the beat
Now we know that he gon' make it and he won't accept defeat
Now I ain't tryin' to be mean
Now I ain't tryin' to be mean
But everything ain't what it seem
So many times did I design a rhyme to blow your mind?
'Cause I know that I wasn't destined to live a life of crime
I remember Christmas's with no presents
I use to fear my future now I dread my adolescence
Living a life of logic
But it ain't what it's cut out to be
'Cause if I couldn't rap y'all wouldn't give a fuck about me
Hip hop is politics
Filled with nothing but strife and stress
Time is money and it's hard to invest
Step on the stage I get the honeys so wet
Rockin' thousand dollar tuxes sippin on nothing but Moet
Thinking I'm so set but really I ain't done shit yet
This game is war and in my mind I'm like a Vietnam vet
Now I'm on the come up
Anything that y'all do I'll one up
Y'all grind till 3 in the morning; I grind till the sun up
Homie that's dedication
This world is what I'm facing
I only hope in the end that they all love and embrace em
For the motherfuckers that hated I made it
Slowly elevated, escalated onto another level ha
My flow is crack the game is Whitney yeah
Fame is Bobby on their first date it ain't hit me yet
Visualizing driving down the horizon
While you despising the fact that I'm rising
So much hate within this world this shit is so traumatizing
Steppin to me yeah you better be alphabetically ready
Aim steady
Lyricism sharp as machete
I got it already
See I was born to sell records
You was destined to sell tunes
All up your headphones
Killing booths like cellphones
(I got it)
'Cause everything ain't what is seems
It ain't just him it takes a team
At the ten headed to the zone in his mug mean
Yeah the quarterback shines but not without a sense of safety
So truly he is me and motherfucker you can't face me
Now I've had a lot of doubt
But I had to throw that out
'Cause I find that they listen when I rhyme not when I shout
And right now shit is rocky
With me and my girl
See music is my moon but this shawty is my world
Think about you all the time
Turn that shit into a rhyme
'Cause sometimes you can ignore me
But the beat listens just fine
Tell me do you even know
If you truly want to grow
Hate letters when I'm writing Love Jones all I know
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
 (acapella):
Living a life you only dream about
Flow angelic but now it's time to bring the demon out
Can you feel me?
I said it's hard being a saint inside a sinner's body
You know its hard living as Logic after living as Bobby
This is the life I depicted
As a child I picked it
Feeling conflicted
To music I am addicted
Not one of y'all can predict it
So many bars I'm feeling convicted
Now writing like a felon I'm selling homie who you telling
While y'all do everything by the book fuck that I'm rebelling
Bitch I'm on another level
A level you ain't seen
A level that is truly only deemed for a king, 'cause
The second you listen it's my mission to murder any rendition
Busting with precision
If you in my vision I'm never missing
Logic administer sinister verses like a minister for the listener
Can you motherfuckers feel me?"
32,Growing Pains III,2014,Under Pressure (2014),Hip Hop,Logic,"Outside I can hear 'em bussin' bussin'
And the police they rushin'
Go to my head like concussion
I'd rather not have this discussion
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood
Where my mind, don't know now
But I know where it was
I need Nikki, where is Nikki
Baby girl please come and get me now
I'm old and shit is trippy, but I know that god is with me
This that baby mama drama
Give a fuck about a man I know Imma
Be there for my son, talking with my sister it begun
End of the month, that's the worst of the month
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
That welfare check, won't ever bounce like my daddy did
But I'm glad he did cause it made me strong
Made me help somebody with this song
Paint the picture of my life
Growing up what it was like
Section 8, grab a plate
Food for thought, gravitate
Food stamps, social services tryna take me away
My mama locked up, I pray to god that I see her today
Maybe not, maybe so, West Deer Park that's all I know
Just me and my homies, people that know me
Only ones that know
Around my way, living day by day
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs
5 O with them canines
Manhunt when it's game time
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
Now I'm running from the police, don't know how but I got away
Selling weed to my homies, and a girl in the building that know me
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I'm breaking into school
Cause my homie told me to
What to do, what would you
When will I lose my anonymity and become one with the enemy?
Tell me would I be the enemy, feel like nobody in front of me
I can feel the vibe
Bobby what are you thinking?
What are you dreaming about?
Bobby, what's inside?
What are you thinking right now?
What are you thinking?
Go to sleep
I guess that I was just thinking things would be different now
'Cause when I wake up my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes
I wish that I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen, maybe never
Maybe so, I got to know
But tell me why
I picture myself at the top but I know that I'm dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons
Maybe not
All I know is this life I live I can't live it no longer
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive
Turn on the TV let it wash my brain
Pretend that family's my family to avoid the pain
Hello children, how was school?
It was good, how 'bout you?
I love you (I love you son)
I love mama too
Are you ready for dinner? I'm able to set the table
Till I snap out the fable when that TV turn off and I realize I'm back in hell

How do you know my name?!
You were walking home from work when you died
Died? Dead? I'm dead? I'm dead?!
It wasn't an act of courage or bravery, but it was your time
What do you mean it's my time? What? I got...
What about Vanessa? What about the baby?
Your wife? And son? You see, that's what I like to hear
You find out you're dead and the first thing you worry about is others
Man, answer me, what about my family? What's going on with Vanessa?
They're doing just fine. You see, your wife was cheating on you
Wait, wait, the bitch did what?!
And even though she loved you dearly
She was a bit relieved you would never find out
Wait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?
How you gon tell me I'm dead then gon tell me my wife cheated on me?!
Atom. None of that matters now
Walk with me
Wait, what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?
No
Well, I don't see no pitchforks, little red people runnin around, it ain't too hot up in here so I guess this ain't hell either
I think the easiest way to describe it, this white void, is to look upon it as a waiting room So...are you God?
Yes, I'm God"

I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive
I'm gonna take this moment right now here and school them people
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people
Truly wish that I could, check it
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world
I see like different light, this music shit just ain't the world
Brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters
All different colors and creed all come together for me
Boy, I'm blessed to be free
This is our time
Still I'm looking back
Let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith
Let me rewind

On the front of this bus, I'm busting my mind open
Hoping these lyrics will keep me coping
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit
It's been like 3 months since I've been home
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it
Let me bring 'em back
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever

Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?
I'm in it, my limit the chillest
Let me bring 'em back, yo
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing
But I'm testing, reminiscing when I would listen to my intuition
And now I made it, resurrecting, Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated
It seem like everyone's somehow related
Letters back and forth from my homie that's locked up in prison
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in
What if the tables was turned and I was the one that been in, damn
He said he's seen me in the magazine
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel
That's been my dog from the kennel
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
Skipping class with all of my homies, on a constant search for who I was
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
I never graduated but I made it to the summit
Don't get me wrong, so many times I thought that I would plummet
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem to stomach
All of the beef around my way
I mean, I never wanted to live a life where all you're truly living is a lie
I knew I always wanted more and so they wonder why
I said they wonder why

Still I'm looking back

Do you know planets? What are- can you name some planets off?

Drop the politics and bring us together again
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then
Yeah, yeah
But I'm, not defined by the sales of my first week
Cause in my mind the only way I fail, if my verse weak
As I, look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
Compiled of different races gathering from different places
I just contemplate
Shoutout to those who can relate
And even though it gets hard I know my fate
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates
It's like, I'mma get up today
I don't know how but I'mma find a way
Looking for the sun in a world of grey

With expenses till sixteen
Quite the microphone fiend
Now the rap is not mean
When I step up on the scene
All the girls see my scheme
Till I open up my mouth and they find out my lyrics mean
Had I meet up with Raheem
Drinkin' a whole team
But before I execute a perfect plan I gotta scheme
Cause right now I'm on the dolo
Everything about this tape I did it on the solo
Yeah, I said it's hurricane Logic
Remember they can't dodge it
They gon' be bumpin' me from the birds to the projects
I get on the mic and excite anybody around me
You're probably wondering why the boy has not found me
It's not that easy, I gotta work from the ground
Be the center of attention, look at the people around me
Black on the inside, my outside Ritz
What's a cracker without a cheese
I gotta stack chips

From the records to the shows
I gotta make it, and if they don't give me what I deserve
Then Imma take it, I've been underrated, underestimated and hated

I was sacrificing adolescent years
Blood, sweat, and tears to find out what music really is
And now I'm feeling, I'm feeling like the moment has arrived
With Bobby is no longer living and Logic has revived
From his ashes, music, money, liquor, I'm fucking passed this
Lyricism that's driven from a master you bastards

Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)
All I ever wanted was some financial security
And now I fuck with bitches just to mask my insecurities
Cause pussy ain't nothing, but my heart is sure full of something
Now I'm, colder than ever, pushing through any weather
High score flow, ain't none of y'all close to my level
Mental state of a winner in the shoes of a beginner
Visualizing my horizon through the eyes of a sinner
Noticing how the line between me and fame is getting thinner

That wanna undress in the back of my car
Or is it just 'cause I'm a star? Or is it just 'cause I'm a star?
5 foot 7, looked like she fell from heaven
With an ass hotter than the devil, please call a reverend
She was black and asian, part Hispanic and part amazing
Women they feen' us, merely because we are the keenest
My heart only has one love like Serena and Venus
You know I am the meanest genius with the biggest-HEY!
See baby girl I know you got some problems
Just know I'm here to solve 'em, revolve 'em, cock 'em back and dissolve 'em
I swear I take care of all em' but you gotta trust it

Baby you were my everything, but you playing games
Fucking around got me feeling like blowing my brains
But you ain't worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action
I used to count the days with you but now I just subtract them
Watch my back, so I make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday, the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me...
You were my best friend but then you out me
I never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me
So in the end it only shows that you don't give a fuck about me
I know you hearing the emotion that's deep in this letter but I don't give a shit about what you think
I write it so that the people can feel better
That have gone through what I've gone through
Memories of a perfect love that's broken and haunt you
And if you think I write this song to taunt you
I don't want you, I want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday
And have an endless love with an angel from up above
But now it would seem my baby girl has fallen
And another path within my life is calling
'Cause I put everything below you, (everything below you)
Even my music, and when you left me I didn't lose it
I channeled deep within emotions and used it
My heart you broke it and bruised it
So now I address this microphone and just ooze it
Watch my back, so I make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday, the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me...
Watch my back, so I make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday, the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me..."

Get it like, like, like whoa
Let's go
Uh, I'ma get it like whoa
Back up in this mothafucka livin' like a goddamn king
Tell me money ain't a thing now
30 thousand feet above the world right next to the wing
Too high to hear the birds sing now
All around the world and back again it's finally happenin'
I'm lappin' in this luxury by nappin' in a big ass house
Chillin' with my homies on the West side, West side
Bringin' out my best side
I was on the road for like a quarter I was in and out the border
From London to Paris, yes it's very extraordinary
Fuck around and took the bus and a ferry
Should've seen the itinerary, then we made it back home like whoa
Tell me how you're feelin', higher than the ceilin'
I know I've been illin'
Probably wonder where I'm at, bitch I've been chillin'
Why they grillin'? Yeah I'm still in like I never left

I gotta hold my own, know that's the only way
I've been vibin', let me guide em, I said I gotta know
I've been ridin' for so long I think that it's time to go
Feeling like an addict that ain't had it, up and at it in a minute
If it hadn't been invented, my limit wouldn't be infinite
I'm feeling like an infant in a womb
I'ma be here till the tomb
Lately I've been in my room
Lookin' and lookin' at records on the wall
Hold up

Ain't about that hybrid shit but I'm all about the green
Making so many moves I need a dose of Dramamine
For rap I'm a fiend, come and test my team
I school MC's 'cause I'm the motherfucking dean
My cerebral cortex force, my trigger finger reflex
To bust Tecs like raw sex, ain't no tellin' what's next
I sling mixtapes like crack rocks
Watch snow bunnies chillin' in the backdrop, discussin' how the track rocks
Goddamn, I'm a miraculous man
And if I wasn't Logic, I'd be his number one fan
Beware I'm spittin' fire cause the world is in dire need of an MC to admire
And set the bar higher
So I conspire, within my mind just had a friar
The rap Messiah, fresh to death so peep the attire
Feelin' like B Rabbit when he slaughtered the Lotto
Get money, fuck bitches, and respect women is the motto
You say potato, I say potato
You call 'em rappers but all I see is comedians
My future's lookin' XXL, they shit is medium
Call me Bobby Kennedy the way I fuck with Marilyn
MCs approach, take notes, and then I bury them
I'm out of this world, my studio's the planetarium
The way I flow, this shit is slicker than butter
The second I utter lyricism that leave all the rest in the gutter
I thought I told y'all I'm the best, d-d-did I stutter?
I'll hit your mom in the head with a car bomb just to blow her mind like Vietnam
Had a myspace account but my only friend was Tom
When I eat pussy I pretend that I'm speaking in Islam
Psych, It's a joke I swear that I'm not racist
To be honest I'll murder you no matter what color your face is
Punch you in the face if I catch you slippin' in braces
You want beef? I'll choke you to death with your own shoelaces
Psych, I swear I'm not a violent guy
Once upon time I brought a Super Soaker to a drive-by
Full of Kool-Aid and warm piss
My buzz is growing every day and when the swarm hits
Million dollar trips, sex at the Ritz
So rich I'll make bitches show Charlie Murphy their tits
Blow the competition to bits, leavin' the enemy lit
But I'm out cause there's women to please and money to get
It's Logic"

Cause while they on that other shit I been posted, out here chillin'
Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5
You know this that shit that you bumpin' in your whip while you drive
I've been living life, and I hope that you do the same
'Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame
Come on I've been through the game, bout time that they know my name
Numb it down for the pain, this music my Novocaine

If I was underground before then this is me in my attic
For this rap shit I'm an addict, but can't fuck with that dramatic
I've been busting my ass, they probably think it's automatic
Yes sir I've done this shit before like your baby momma momma
I'ma tell 'em like it is, I'ma tell 'em like it is
Life ain't picture perfect, we use the negatives to develop
I'm well up I'm way up, nothing but net, fuck the layup, I'm way up
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions
Can't fuck with they delusions, I'm on that 101 cruisin'
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way, but no not quite like this
Living like that in a way, guess you could say made me wanna write like this
Not quite like this on my level, I'm unique and I'm a rebel
Like you listening, I hope that you're listening
This feel like it's summertime, waiting for the bus number nine
Through the city all alone, not a worry, not your phone
We just vibing maybe flying 'round the world
Man, I hope you see the world
And all your dreams will unfurl, just don't never cash your pearl
Go out there and make a livin', take this advice that I'm givin'
Make a difference make a killin', make a killin'
Lord willin'
Lord willin'
Make a difference, lord willin'
Uh, lord willin'

KAI: What?
THOMAS: Back then people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness. Shit we took for granted was obvious: water, food supply. It's insane to think everyday life for everyone in Babel is the quest for Paradise. I dunno, I guess that's what I'm looking for

From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto

Feels like I'm running through mazes, everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it, but right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it I'm gone
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it I'm gone

Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again

Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam, oh my God this is my jam

It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive

Ugh, I don't like him because, like, when it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie
You mean like Inglourious Basterds?

What?!
I didn't, I don't know
Oh my God, have you seen Pulp Fiction

Papa was a black man, mama was a racist
Growing up she called me nigga, kids called me cracker
While the whites got whiter, and the blacks got blacker
I was hurting, doing everything I can
Perceived as a white boy with the soul of a black man

I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will

Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe
And this I know 'cause I been high, low, right, wrong

Didn't have to sell my soul
Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal
Where you stay, every day
Just got my crib in LA
Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ
Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh
Bitches on my dick, don't give a fuck
Y'all must not know what's up
In the cut, we don't give a fuck
We just tryna cut
Line 'em up, if they say they bout then we'll sign 'em up
Rattpack, that's a fact
Basic bitch can't fuck with that
Where you at
That's what they be asking, I say on the map
We are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
Drop that new shit just 'cause they demand it
Living like we got it 'cause we get it
Do it just to say we fucking did it
We are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
Drop that new shit just 'cause they demand it
Living like we got it 'cause we get it
Do it just to say we fucking did it
When that liquor get po' up
And that green get roll up
When them sets get throwed up

Better hope they don't call my bluff
Cause my mind is going crazy
This shit is never enough
When that liquor get po' up

Never enough, never enough, never enough
This shit is never enough
Never enough, never enough, never enough
This shit is never enough
This album was created over the span of one year. However, the majority of the album was recorded in only two weeks"
55,Nikki,2014,Under Pressure (2014),Hip Hop,Logic,"I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go
Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black
Tell me where you've been jack
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name Mary
I used to fuck here way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first
Me and you together swear to god I saw that work
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years, goddamn took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go I always know you there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you
Nothing can replace you
I wish I could erase you, you're everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask what's wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in a grave
I'm a king, you're my Coretta
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine
Slave for the
Said I'm a slave for the nicotine
Been a slave for ya
I'm a mothafuckin slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine
Nikki, Nikki slave for ya
I'm a slave for ya Nikki
I'm a mothafuckin slave for ya

I got all kinds of names like HR Paper Stacks
Uh, also known as AKA Horse Choker, uh
(Verse 1: Logic)
Hey, yo, I'll chop you up in sixteen pieces
In front of your nieces, while I'm eating Reese's
And won't even offer them any, yes I spit plenty
This is East Coast flow at its finest
In the studio, where you find us, put a bullet where your spine is
At sixteen I was skipping school and smoking chronic
While you was learning about English, Big L was teaching Ebonics
I spit fire so demonic, writing code like I'm Masonite
A Jedi master breaking it down like old plaster
No medication for this track cause this is how a psycho rips
My bank account is like a cino bolt, your pocket's microchips, uh
Motherfucker, I dare you to test it, hope you're well rested
Whoop your ass and get arrested, in a double breasted
Louis Vuitton diamond encrested tailor made suit
Now that's All Sinatra Everything
I explode like hollow tips on contact
Chronologically murder schmoe there's no bringing Joe back
Puffing cubans and sipping Cognac
Mafietic mentality, introduce me to this beat and it's fatality
I kill mics like Conrad Murray
Sharp like Hanzo steel, the rest is obtuse
I get loose when sipping Goose and rhyme like Doc Seuss
Flow tight like noose, whoop ass like Bruce, no time for a truce
Alphabetical mathematic addict
I spit sixteens so erratic you think it was a semi-automatic
I know by now you thinking ""Oh my God, he let them have it""
But that was just a loan, time to collect like I'm Capone
Reep what I've sewn, in other words that is the throne
Chilling while homies smoking marijuan'
If you thinking that this shit is wack well then you're dead wrong
Cause for every emotion and every mood I have a song
For the club, for the streets, for the whip and for the sheets
Cause this is where intellect and versatility meets

Fuck with us, yeah!?"

When I was 21
It was a very good year
It was a very good year
For city girls
Who lived up the stairs
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was 21
It was all a dream just a year ago
Bussin' tables and servin' food but y'all don't hear it though
Now I'm on another level but y'all aren't near it though
My soul bleedin' on the track, so spiritual
It's a blessing cause now rappin' is my profession yo
Set to detonate, I'm just waitin' for my time to blow
White boy at first glance but when I rhyme they know
Race don't mean a fucking thing the second that I flow
It's been a year and everything I said would happened has
While everybody that I know is out havin' a blast
I was right here in the studio bustin' my ass
It's been a year, I'm 21 but I feel (35)
And now I got this
I taste the blood, no one can stop this
Second I drop this, die hard fans is finna cop this
While the rest of the world follows through fiber optics
I took my time, see I studied the game, learned how to rhyme
I was around drugs and gats, but never delved in crime
Had other things in mind, so I began to grind
First tape was a success
Locally, I got press
But I knew this one right here would run the world a mess, but I digress
A year ago, I was a youngin in his room
Staring out the window, lookin' at the moon, knowing it's coming soon
But today I board this rocket ship and sonic boom
'Cause I am no longer a seed, homie, it's time to bloom"
59,Paradise,2015,The Incredible True Story (2015),Hip Hop,Logic,"Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious
I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born out of wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock
Got my sites on deadlock
Visions of my enemy in a headlock
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble
Just a youngin' in trouble
Took a shot and then made it a double
Took a shot and then made it a double
This that food for thought, my school ain't taught me good
No ingredients in my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda gon' make it good, like it should
That's ignant isn't it
Hold up wait, now take a look at my pigment
Tell me again, we can never be kin based on the color of my skin
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin
That's a club I don't wanna be in
My DNA get done integrated
My God it's innovative
That's a million miles away from administrative
I fuckin' hate it, anyway
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive
Police would knock on the door, I would hide
Then they would talk to me and I would lie
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
Over down on the driveway
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that ""My Way""
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now I'm a grown man, oh man
What the fuck done happened to the plan
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep
'Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker wide awake on the creep
Tryna kill you and he will too
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel
My son, my seed
Watch 'em grown and then watch 'em lead
Let me proceed, bumpin' that that Californication, by the Red Hot
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC
Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise
Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise
I remember my life long ago in my adolescence
I could feel the presence in my residence
Hesitant even thought it was evident
I should get the fuck
I know something is wrong
Yeah, I know something is wrong
Feel like my mind gone
I know I play along, I might drown in this song
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed
Shit maybe then I'm noticed, huh, but maybe not
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious
So outrageous my age is on my mind
Walking to work and I go blind
Sippin' on that Koolaid, gettin' big wig money, that's toupée
Look around and see people with no class, like snow on a school day
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu
Livin' life how I do is crazy
This shit never amaze me
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why
All I know is my mind racing
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it yeah I be pacing
Bitch I'm back again
Been here since way back when, now let that shit begin
This album 2 but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise
This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming ""I knew it!""
This is real, so real
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill
Most of these people will never hit fruition
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle
All alone with no one to dial
I'm just a man, I got problems, understand
This is all I ever wanted, yes I do it for the fans
And I ain't perfect
I've questioned if this life was even worth it
Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now
This album 2 but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise"

Spit divine, thought from the mind
Poetic rhetoric that rhyme
We punch lines that leave you conflicted, and hit rewind
Every time I spit an ill line the worlds mine
Fuck a Matana
Quit it the second I'm out the vagina
Won't even call her mañana, Sike
Lyrical Unibomber
Ima allergic to drama
Mentality of a felon
Rebelling elevate
While you repellin'
Only hate because I'm sellin'
Who you tellin'?
See I was on that raw shit
While you was on that naw shit
The people \""they gonna toss it\""
When that all they endorse it
I just waited for my time to shine, I never forced it
Strategically planned it like Peyton Mannin' way before shit was even real
I remember nights as a child with my momma, hungry
But my hunger for this music is on another level
This shit will truly have you contemplatin' deals with the devil
But homie I'm a king not a pawn I never settle
Cause the strength within my mind
Is so fine I can bend metal

But my hunger for this music is on another level
This shit will truly have you contemplatin' deals with the devil
But homie I'm a king not a pawn I never settle
Cause the strength within my mind
Is so fine I can bend metal
Yeah, In high school I wasn't worried about them A's and B's
I was trying to make the flow unkillable to obtain these Gs
Murder syllables, yes I aim to please, so much ice they call me Mr. Freeze, Sike
All up under your girls skirt as if I was the breeze
Flow celsius I surpass degrees
Homie, please
And now I'm feelin' like I'm number 1
Cause nobody made it in the game out of where I'm coming from
Can you feel me?
Me and my team devised a scheme to get the cream
Followin' dreams, livin' our lives like movie scenes
Started as a teen, sippin' liquor, smoking' green
For music I was a fiend, my homies know what I mean
Ha, Lethal projectiles aimed at reptiles
Best get your money in order fore' you get checked now
I remember nights as a child with my momma, hungry

This shit will truly have you contemplatin' deals with the devil
But homie I'm a king not a pawn I never settle

Is so fine I can bend metal

Fiance flowin' I engage, don't miss this now
Hop on the track, you know I kill it to death
Fuckin' with Logic, it's inevitable that I will result in your imminent death
Now hit rewind and take a breath, homie ain't nothin' left
I'm Gregory House and this game is testin' my patients
Been on the low like freemasons
Livin' amazing, if your shit is hot my shit is cajun
Divine white wine flowin', yes you know its aging
You got sixteens? Ha, I got mathematical equations

A couple days ago
I met the illest latina
Her demeanor was unexplainable
You shoulda seen her
Thick thighs, nice ass
Body like an hourglass
Didn't hesitate to break a brother
Next second she passed
I was like, ""What's up?""
To which she replied
""How you doin'?""
I said de nada momma
But your beauty I'm persuin'
And I said I'm about to win the lottery
She asks ""How?""
I said, ""Your seven digits right now""
And made her smile
Now we conversing
And she feelin' my style
I can tell by the way she talkin'
That she down to go the mile
Had a couple drinks
Now we headed back to her place
The shade of red from her lipstick all over my face
I'm tryin' to hit, split it
Baby girl you gonna let me get it?
She said, ""Hold up ok, I don't get down like that""
I said I know beautiful girl
But I get down like that
So let me heat it up, heat it up
Go crazy and beat it up
""Damn papi, how you even know I like it rough?""
The way you was feelin' on me
When kissing revealed enough
I wanna scratch you, provoke you
Bite you, choke you
But just a little, bite your legs
Dick up in the middle
""Hold up, wait a second
Nigga, you gotta condom?""
Come on beautiful girl of course I've got protection
I stay with Magnums and I ain't talkin' Smith and Wesson
I keep undressin'
Girl I'm about to teach you a lesson
After I hit it she says
""Bobby I have a confession
I think I love you!""
I said "" What the fuck?""
Thinkin' to myself
Damn, I shoulda never cut
Kissed her on the cheek
Hit the lights, then she fell asleep
So I snuck out the bathroom window on the creep, like
(The next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, yo
The next day, the next day, the next)
Yeah, yeah, yo
Now I'm out the door
Downtown is where I'm about to go
Got a meeting with my boy Chris
About a dope show
So I hail a cab, jump in
But so does some girl
Beautiful, pretty eyes
With luxurious curls
I said ""No fair""
She smiled and said
"" Why don't we share?""
What a success
Lookin' at her chest
Thinkin' if her breasts was a test
She would fail
Fresh tip nails
Type of ass make a brother
Train of thought derail
As we converse
I could tell that she feelin' my style
Get the pussy wet
That's the mission
As long as she listen to my words
Feelin' on the curves
Only lips I'm thinkin' bout kissin' is hers
I can barely fight the urge
Only thing that matter right now
Is these two verbs
I'm talkin' me and you
So fine, I'd think I'd start seeing you
Her body was a work of art
Like Hieroglyphics
Too much detail to go into specifics
Now
I'm diggin' shorty
Like an archeologist
Tryin' a bone
Searchin' for a queen to take the throne
The type of girl to love
And call her my own
I'm just a bachelor (bachelor)
Looking for a bachelorette
Baby, maybe you can persuade me
To give you love
You couldn't imagine yet
Kiss you on the neck
Then I sedate the pussy like a vet
Got the shorty rollin' like a movie set
Take her to the Rio
I'm not talking about G-burg
I'm talking De Janeiro
Spend deñero like its reverb
Expansion
Couple kids running round the mansion
Day dreamin'
Getting ahead of my self
Advancin'
But, come on. girl
Now come on give me love
I know we just met but
Romance is like a drug
You know we go together
Like sympathy and hugs
So I write this girl
A symphony
And tell her that I love
Her everything
Girl I love your everything
You know I love your everything
I said I love your everything
Yeah, love your everything
Girl, I love your everything"

We live in a world where everybody want everything
Everybody want a better thing
Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing
Man, the game been waiting for a better king
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming ""Money ain't a thing"", cause it ain't
Man, I never knew that living out a dream meant living out a suitcase
I've been working at a new pace
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
Drop hits, get money
Run it
What the fuck is there left to talk about
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen
Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen
Boy this been my house
This is merely an addition, fuck 'em and their permission
They was killin' the game, who the one that gave 'em remission?
You know the name
Who else you know on the come up, do it like I does it
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I was workin' on a budget
Second time around shit is different cuh they know that boy good, know he does it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating, they can suck my dick
Run it
I'ma do somethin' different for the last one
I'ma go in
Feelin' like Matthew McConaughey on a Interstellar mission
In Chicago at the bottom of the Riviera
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era
I gotta beware of the people but I take care of the people when I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done, had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
No we ain't never acquainted
On the rise like a defendant
That was charged with possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision
God damn can you feel it? Uh
I had a dream I would run the game and kill it
Had a dream, can you feel it?
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
Get up in it, make the shit infinite
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant
No never when I slide up in the spot
Just a youngin' in the game
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back
That was the mentality, never truly reality
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation
'Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation
Till I wised up, got 'em sized up
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em, I'm too tied up
This a ransom
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding
Couple years back you ain't give a damn
Autographs, off the plane whenever I land
All part of the plan
Anything you wanna do you can
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em
Be above it unless you're thinking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact you should take a step back
'Cause I run it"

All right man, what is this regarding exactly?
Basically, what we want to do is we want to take Logic, we want to take everything about you, and we want to take it and put it on a bigger level. How's that sound?
I mean that sounds great, man! What do you have in mind?
Basically, okay, you know that whole thing that compiles you? The whole Young Sinatra, smooth, intellectual lyrics, the realism of who you are and how you project that, everything that you do with your music?
Yeah, man, thanks. I'm glad you spotted that out.
Basically, what we're going to do is get rid of that, okay? We want to put you in the limelight with a bunch of bitches and popping bottles... 'cause nobody cares about that stuff.
...What?
Yeah, I know, right?! It sounds amazing! Maybe you might be aware of some previous work that we've done. Basically what we want to do is: have nobody remember you in five years.
I don't know man... I really don't know...
Have you ever heard of Young Lollipop? Or Little Chedda?
Naw. Naw, man I haven't.
 That's the point!

64,Set the Tone,2012,Undeniable (2012),Hip Hop,Logic,"I don't want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white
We all want to help one another, human beings are like that
We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery
We don't want to hate and despise one another
In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone
The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way
Greed has poisoned men's souls
Sinatra
'Sinatra shot ya', god damn you'
'Is this what you want?'
Logic
'You are watching a master at work'
'You have interfered with our affairs for the last time'
Many men wish to acquire fame for the wrong reasons
Fans telling me never change, but it's harder fighting seasons
They hear me on the radio and now they yelling 'Treason!'
Cause Logic giving them mainstreams like Ephesians
But, I never sacrificed my lyrics or my flow
There's a time and place for everything so what the fuck you yelling for?
The fame hit me quicker than previously determined
Rat Pack, real all the time, fuck a vermin
Motivated by money, sex, drugs and violence
Cause the era that we living, it was built up on defiance
What we need is alliance, but y'all don't really hear me though
So, hip-hop's a chariot and Logic's finna carry it
Stallion, coming for their necks like a medallion
Straight out of Sierra Leone
Motherfuckers it's on, I'm under your skin like cortisone
99% of these motherfuckers is bullshit
But I'm on that Bull shit, Michael Jordan
Cutting records after the show at my hotel while I'm touring
Yeah, and I ain't even 23
But my bank account can vouch, I'm balling like an MVP
Yes it's me, L-O-G-I-C,
I'm repping MD
Now what the fuck is a vacation? I see no satisfaction
I work 12 hours a day, every day with no distraction
7 days a week and 12 hours, that's a lazy day
Going 74 hours with no sleep, call that a crazy day
This is Manhunt, and I ain't stopping till y'all apprehended
Many years I have attended and finally been commended
For keeping it real so finger fuck whoever I've offended
Now, pull out the Mac and watch them freeze like PCs
I'm Celsius, never graduated so fuck degrees
I educate 'em with ease, however listener please
Don't knock that last line, school it just wasn't for me
We all different,
And I'm here to make a killing
So say hello to the villain cause in this day that we living
And the nice guys finish last
I'm blowing up
Guess you could say I'm having a blast
'Sinatra shot ya', god damn you'
'You are watching a master at work'
'Is this what you want?'"

And the book I write on, write on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on, it was right on
They lost it I found it, we leave 'em astounded
Asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?
I replied, I died inside, resurrected a beast
Leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease
Got it, 
?, hungry as hell trying to eat now
Success is the only thing that can complete us
Grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus
Close your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this
Now I've accepted I'm not from the hood
Cause selling crack and busting gats don't make my raps good
See this is me, L.O.G.I.C. repping MD to the fullest
Push us to the limit but never pull us now
I can't wait 'til I see my name in neon
That fly shit I be on flowing for eons
Every day I take chances, Celine Dion
Said every day I take chances, Celine Dion (let's get it)
I'm a diamond in a rough, but I shine like discos
Surrounded by greasy people like I doused them in Crisco
I haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go?
Up a million percent until they finally hear this though
Bumping up in they city like, Oh my God this go
My business getting better every year like fiscal
Fuck a pad and a pen, a mic my only utensil
I'm original see but they trace like stencil
I stain in the game, but you fade like pencil
Biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult
Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end that shit's your fault
It takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine
I did it in 21, see I'm ahead of my time
'Cause when I flow the crowd never roll 'cause I rock
On the road to success, haters in my blind spot
'Cause I got no time to bullshit
We should shine a light on, a light on

Angrier than Kanye when he talkin' about clothes

Money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe and think down and leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack, cooking where my sister be frying soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass, I kill him, I kill him, I motherfucking kill him
I said I really want to kill him, but I can't
'Cause if I do po po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it, I grip the mic and then kill it
Okay, I'm gone, as memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin', sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little bobby, just a youngin', skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Can't take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day I pay homage to the Gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I'm from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking out your colon
Catch me rollin' with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I'm De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, another illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like Thriller
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We don't do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does
Hip Hop
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him
See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be
Bitch, I said I bet I be
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me how is they gonna remember me
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just because I was different, just because I was doing what I love
And the fans they say they love you, but they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hundred
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry about bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun
So when people that never knew me they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?
I just stop, and do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Our people that separated, but all equal

They riding round with the baddest (bitch)
One day, I woke up, and said I'm bout to do for the rest of my life
No question it's right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light looking at the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies
Where the truth dies and hatred multiplies, mu-mu-mu-multiplies
I said I can't take it
I remember wondering if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around until the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate and when the situation's delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no
I can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen
Stop spending money on things that glisten
I know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, its sober
I Know my mind is sober

I know I'm gonna be famous cause my friends and family insisted

Across the world, spit lyrics, let them unfurl
Poetic rhetoric my girl
Got my mind playin' tricks on me
My eyes is closed, the ice is froze, I got it
Hip-hop was never dead, but it was fallin'
And I caught it
The way I process chips, you think my brain's robotic
Fuckin' with bitches overseas 'cause the pussy's exotic

Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36am. Where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn't there, addicted to crack cocaine, Alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
Way, way back
So I'm gonna tell you about that, I'm gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was Happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist
Which is crazy
Because how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men But you racist
Like bitch, that don't make no sense
But it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin him a nigga
The kids at school callin him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can't be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
He saw violence, murderers, drug dealers
He was kidnapped, there was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn't be shit!
You ain't gon be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I'ma persevere
And that's why the message is always peace, love and positivity
And see, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody, was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
Because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters
That were uneducated and that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant, that cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight, and kill, and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message
Of equality, for every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and
All this, because he didn't know, he didn't know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn't right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home to about 8 or 9 hours of sleep
But spend 4, 5, 6 hours of that working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said No!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no no, no no, no no, no no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No no!
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Yeah
Now I also want you to imagine people telling him that he did not live this life

""You from Gaithersburg, Maryland. Nothing happens there.""

And this young man persevered in spite of what people told him he was, wasn't, and would
Never be
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Yeah, yeah
And he's here to say:
Even though we're all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There's extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they're not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they're going to hell
You can believe it's not right
You can believe you're superior, fine
Just stop killing each other"

Yes you know I want it but first I'ma get to know you
'Cause this ain't about your body, take my hand and let me show you

Lay you in the bed, kiss slow let me heat it up

Never do it on the regular but I'mma eat it up
Kiss you, touch you, tease you
Doing anything and everything I need to please you
What it is, momma let me know right now
Ain't no need to talk I just want to bite down
On your bottom lip, let your bra rip open
Never had a feeling like this and I'm hoping
We could do it again, never thought I could find heaven within
A heart of a woman and now I begin
To understand more than I did from the start
Gimme your heart, trust me with love
Baby girl I swear you fell from above
Lend me your hand, I'll be your man
I promise to do everything that I can
I'll be your Sinatra, be my Monroe
Give me your heart and I'll know it will grow

We'd like to be painters, we'd like to be poets. We'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows we can't earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that... and uhm, forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time
You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don't like doing, which is stupid
It is absolutely stupid
Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you're doing, it doesn't matter what it is - somebody is interested in everything, anything you can be interested in, you will find others will
But it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like, and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See what we are doing, is we're bringing up children and educating to live the same sort of lives we are living. In order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing, so it's all retch, and no vomit it never gets there. Therefore, it's so important to consider this question: What do I desire?

 You know in... in Pulp Fiction I mean, the way Tarantino constructed his shots, it's the same feel for me with his raps you know there's thought behind it
 No I could see that, I could see that but. Nah man, fuck that man... Kill Bill was the shit, especially like knives throwing and dodging and shit, and then fucking hot chicks fucking fighting each other and cutting each other's heads off, what the fuck is that?

If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without

From the Roxy to Palladium
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that

He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
And Paris, what a beautiful destination
And perish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful
Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way I say ""hey, I'm your dad""
It gets me thinking of incredible moments we've had
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of your family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand with me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feeling under pressure
Hey, what's up, bro? I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. All right, nigga
Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors
I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now
I heard that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vile
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I called you wouldn't even answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the ones you don't know, my sister, some of your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati. Then I gotta jail you out. I love you, son. So"

Now I'm in another world when the flow emerge
Feel like I'm in a 5th element
I'm in my element lost in paradise
It's me, you and Leeloo Korben Dallas
In Fhloston paradise
Never by chance like a pair of dice
I don't give a fuck about their advice
I'm under the planet, no I'm not manic, bitch I'm decompressed
Know they can't stand it 'cause I pilot it and manned it the best
All they demanded was I gave up and laid dream to rest
God damn!

With a rattpack smoking on zimbabwe
Crankin' Sinatra that my way

Carbon copies they dub it

This is for my independent women that is runnin' shit in high heels
Educated in business but majored in sex appeal
My shorty she gotta
Sportin' gucci louie and Prada
Looking beautiful in it all but I prefer nada
Yeah, low maintenance and high scale
Type of shorty that when you get locked up she pay the bail
I used to follow my dreams until I caught up to em'
People talking shit but pay attention to what we doin'
It's never been done
Watch me go platinum just for fun
Far from materialistic but let me stunt son
You know what I be on, you know where I be at
The proof is within the numbers they slumber but now they react
I got 3 tapes, 0 tolerance one of the greats
Put that shit together and what you get that's where I'm from

Spanish hunny we met in rio, future lookin' cleo
Bitches be braggin
So much money my pants saggin
VMG is up-to-date but these businessmen be lackin'
Eve bit the apple, steve changed the world
Getting money like zuckerburg, my bank account is sterol
I am not defined by that in which I do possess
Cause all it takes is riches to get bitches to undress
I need drive in a lady, not a girl that drive me crazy
Need a girl that don't care if a drive a honda or mercedes
Spit fire like hades, I infect it like rabies
It's all that, shout out to them 90's babies
Never hesitate to supply the heat
What 6ix produces from his chest, we call that shit a heartbeat
I'm a king, you fuckas my pawns
Shortcut to the desktop, I am your newest icon
These bitches they love it, I truly can't stress it enough
Girl got them daddy problems that's why she be actin' tough
Innocent in person, but in the bed she love it rough
Running away from reality to sniff coke and puff
So, let me get it the second I spit it you know that I did it all the people wanna come around
They used to hate it, but now they love the sound
You used to hate it

Excuse me?
So you sittin' here telling me, this place is a waiting room, right? What are we waiting for?
Rebirth
Rebirth?... like reincarnation?
If that's what you wanna call it
What the fuck you mean ""if that's what I wanna call it?""
Either this is what it is, or this is
What it ain't
Sure
Chu mean? Ughhh, this muhfucka (Atom sighs in frustration)
Aight, lemme get this straight, every time I die, I come here, we talk, and you send me back to earth to be reborn?
Ou know the last time we had this conversation it was in mandarin and you were 13 Atom: Mandarin?
And a girl!
What? Nah, bruh, you fuckin' wit me. You're... Like, Jesus Christ
He was here too!
What? Wait, wait, so the Christians got it right?
Well I'm about to reincarnate you Atom. I'd say everyone kinda got it right
This is a whole lot to take in!
I know trust me, I've been there
So, how many times have I been reincarnated?
Many, many many many, many times
If it's so many times, why don't I remember?
F we stayed here long enough, the lives you have lived, and the knowledge from each of them would return
What?
'M actually about to send you back to 1736 as Bryan Fairfax, the 8th lord Fairfax of Cameron
Word, ay, that sounds important
Oh yes you own 40,000 acres
God damn!...oh, I'm sorry
Ha, it's quite all right
Well at least I'm not poor no more
Well sure! with all that land and the hundreds of slaves you'll own
Slaves? Aw hell nah, nononono, look look look: how you gonna take a black man, send him back in time, and now I gotta own slaves?
Well if it's any consolation, your son Tom, the 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron sets them free!
No! That does not make me feel better at all
Wait hold up, I just realized... you said you're gonna send me back in time?
Well, I'm not really sending you back in time. that doesn't exist where I come from, only in your universe
Well, where are you from?
Honestly Atom, even if I explained where I came from, or told you about the others like me, you just wouldn't understand
But if there's others like you, how can you be god?
Atom, I said you wouldn't understand!
Atom: So what's the point of doing all this?
Really?
What?
A little cliche don't you think?
Essentially asking Me the meaning of life
Well I figured I would ask before you send me back and I can't remember none of this.
Atom come here. the meaning of life... the reason I created this place... is so that you can grow, and mature
Like the human race? Like this is how the human race is supposed to grow and mature? mature into what? We can't even get along
No Atom, you! It's for you, you to mature
I don't understand
I created this place for you, Atom.
This entire place was made for you.
Every time I send you back, every life you live, you grow, and mature and understand the grand meaning behind all of this just a little more each time
Just me? Wait, what about everybody else?
Atom, there is no one else
I don't understand
Atom, you are every human being who has ever existed since the dawn of your kind on earth
Wait I'm everyone?
Ah yes, now you are beginning to see it
So I'm like, everyone that ever existed on earth, ever?
Earth? Ha, that's cute. Earth was just your birthplace.
Let us not forget all the stars humanity will colonize over the millennia
Atom: Wait, that is so much. Too much to take in!
I'm every human being that ever lived?
Or ever will live, yes!
I'm Jesus?
And all of his disciples
I'm Hitler?
And the millions he murdered
Atom: That's deep
You see Atom, every act of hatred and violence you committed against another, you were committing against yourself and every act of love and hand of kindness, you also extended unto yourself
God, why do all this?
Someday, long from now, you will become like me.
You will mature to become what I am.
I'm a god?
No, not yet. you see, I was once where you stand right now...
It is not until you have lived every human life inside of your universe that I may take you from this place.
Once you have walked in the shoes of every race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, loving and hateful person, it is only then that you will understand how precious life truly is"
