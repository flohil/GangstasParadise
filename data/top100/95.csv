0,A King And Queen Creation,1989,All Hail The Queen (1989),,Queen Latifah,"(45 King)
Let's start the show off sisters ago look alive
The Queen Latifah the King of 45
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor
I make beats she rock rhymes so I gave a
A sample sound the she added a compound
Word this is for those who haven't heard
A King and Queen combine minds and trample
Thos who oppose us here's an example
(Queen Latifah)
It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set
The competition is petty and ready to step
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken
Queen Latifah's outspoken
Use your imagination, picture this
Any male or female rapper trying to diss
Here for excitement and enticement
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment
Teach the youth, feed the needy
Confident descendant of Queen Nefertiti
The mother of civilization will rise
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation
Secondary but necessary to reproduce
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation
(45 King)
Technician, musical musician
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most
Creativity, you get a double dose
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet)
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em
I rock, never hyperventilate
Others get tired, could use a commercial break
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias
It takes a ton of MC's to prevail against me
Just listen, I'm unstoppable
You want a mission? This one's impossible
Beats rock all night with no curfew
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it
If the style fits, I wear it
Many attempts were made, none was recognized
45 King said sample soundified
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet
Studio mixer, I got the formula
And said the man from self, I'm warning you
It's my domain, just ask my chauffeur
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa
On top, it's a usual act
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing
I'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of Swing"
1,Baby Get Lost,2004,The Dana Owens Album (2004),,Queen Latifah,"Well good morning baby welcome back to town
How'd, fine papa, welcome back to town
You're doing so much travelling never know
When you'll be around
You're a fine and mellow fellow
But you're stubborn as a mule
You love me like an angel
But you treat me like a fool
Two-faced daddy don't hand me no doublecross
You'll see any time I'm ready
I can tell you baby get lost
Doing anything you choose
You're cheating on the outside
You better come back on the inside
Don't want no trouble I've got to be the boss
'Cause you got too much to lose
And if you can't play it my way
Well now baby get lost
I try to stop your cheating
But I just don't have the time
'Cause I got so many men that
Keep cool papa, you got to corne across
They're standing right in line
'Cause any time I'm ready, yes any time I'm ready
You know when I'm ready
I can tell you baby get lost
Why don't you get lost"
2,Bananas (Who You Gonna Call),1998,Order In The Court (1998),,Queen Latifah,"Who you gonna call when it's time to brawl
Standin' 'round waitin' for my queendom to fall
Well I think not, styles are pipin' hot
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got
I'm tellin' you straight up, all sleepin' beauties better wake up
I'll tear your state up, so set the date up
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it
Who did it, who does it
From private to public
Anywhere I'm in there and been there
So recognize this, who the nicest
Sit down and settle for your constellation prizes
Whatever you want I got
Whether you ready or not
It's about to get hot when I drop
So notes, pause another spot
To do you, don't get me in a corner make me do you
Don't try to be me, do you
Be coo' to you and do you
I'm on a higher level with different class, another plane
I am the Queen, that's my name, time to explain
That I spit game with dames
Leave 'em all with shit stains
Split frames, hopin' you hopin' that I'm jokin'
Don't know but still blink off like fo'-fo's
But so-so, slow mo's comin' in like the po-po's
Don't want rocks comin' at me the wrong way
Packin' much rocks, it's gonna be a long day
And for real, spittin' on imbessiles and spinnin' wheels
On my 600 you want it, you must be blunted
I'll take it to your stomach, run it, give me all
Mic for mic, steppin' to me you gonna fall, we brawl
Throwin' a two-piece so loose leafs
It's the Q-U-double-E-N
You know how I'm MCin'
See physically you not ready
Lyrically you not ready
Mentally maybe
Who talks tough, time to get the baby
No threats or small bets on my bond we can get it on
From dusk till dawn from night till mourn
Some bubble hard squads are gone, no gimmicks, no tricks
Till one of us admits it's a battle a whisk
So look I'm off the hook, while you off the rocker
Thinkin' I'm shook, get the phone book, call the doctor
Are you out of your mind, doubtin' mines, out of line
Talkin' out your behind, shoutin' rhymes out of time
It's all over, what's up, yeah, what, what now, you tough now
Now you hush, hush now, ain't sayin' too much now
Thought so, haunt yo' sleepin' ass, creepin' fast
Like you was doin' somethin', now I gotta ruin somethin'
You image, your career, lookie here you whole life is hangin' in the air
Like a chandilier, poppin' off like a can of beer, understand is it clear
If not let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty
Even though I'm low-key, you know me
You be singin' over my tracks like it's kareoke
If you don't know the half you gon' feel the wrath
Represent the rugged path, the Flavor Unit staff
Droppin' math'matics, layin' you out like craftmatic
I'll let you have it, so you don't want the static"
3,Black Hand Side,1993,Black Reign (1993),,Queen Latifah,"(Why y'all ain't say. yooo

It's only me and mommy you the man of the house
Always flip the scipt back to the old days

But you can't come out to play
Right now you got to much shit to do

But they shame, they scared to face me
Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me
They must be freaking crazy

Bread with the queen with a prefix

And that's a promise 'cause I don't make threats

5,California Dreamin',2004,The Dana Owens Album (2004),,Queen Latifah,"All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey
I went for a walk on a winter day.
I'd feel so safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreaming on such a winters day.
I stopped into a church (yes I did)
I passed along the way.
I got down on my knees (down on my knees)
And I pretended to pray.
You know the preachers he likes it cold,
So he knows I'm gonna stay (he knows I'm gonna stay).
California dreaming on such a winters day.(oh oh yeah)
All the leaves are brown and the sky is so grey. I went for a walk on a cold winter's day (yeah). I'd feel so safe and warm if I was in L.A.(in L.A.). But I'm California dreaming on such a winter's day.

6,Champion,2009,Persona (2009),,Queen Latifah,"I don't even care no more
That's my word, that's for sure
I don't even cry no more
That's absurd, I'm so cured
I'm so secure with who I is,
Oops who I am
And I'm a champion for sure boy
I'm a champ
Oh yes I am
But what I thought about
When those people put me down
They can laugh for now
But watch it when I turn this thing around
I know, I believe
Ain't nobody gonna do it but me
I'm fly, no lie
I'm the truth baby ask me why
I'm a champion [repeat]
What you say don't stick
I'm the best and I know it
I know you tried to bring me down
Look at me now, watch my smile
I'm so secure with who I am
And I'm a champion for sure
I'm a champ oh yes I am
But what I thought about

Keep your head up
They hatin' cause you majored in minor
Gonna celebrate like you won the finals
Hold your trophy up in your parade in your honor
And pour some champagne and put your glass to the sky
'Cause you a champion
You're a champion
I'm a champion [repeat]"

Something dreamy for dancing
While we're here romancing
It's love's holiday
And Love will be our guide
Close your eyes
When you open them dear
I'll be right hear by your side
So...
Close your eyes
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep
Close your eyes
And I will close mine

Close your eyes

And Love will be our guide

When you open them dear
I'll be near by your side
So won't you close your eyes..."
8,Come Into My House,1989,All Hail The Queen (1989),,Queen Latifah,"Welcome into my Queendom (My Queendom), come one come all
When it comes to lyrics I bring them (I bring them)
In spring I sing, in fall I call out to
All the ones who had a hard day
I prepared a place on my dance floor
The time is now for you to par-tay
I thought it would be a good chance for you to move
(One nation under a groove) House music always soothes
So get with the flow, let's go, yo
Can you rock to a house groove tempo?
If so, then shall we let the games begin?
What better off position can you be in?
I'm on fire, the flame's too hot to douse
The pool is over, come into my house"

10,Cue The Rain,2009,Persona (2009),,Queen Latifah,"You know it's over but you don't wanna say
You see the writin' on the wall but you don't wanna read
And now you're hopin' that there'll be somethin' different
Somethin' to change the circumstances of the way you're livin'
But that's that fantasy, that's that reality
The one you love that keeps on changin' personalities
It's always jealousy, too much intensity
I don't remember signin' over my I, identity
'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light
On this site, somebody cue the rain
Cue the rain, cue the rain
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain
Didn't know you'd be so greedy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Now you met me on the fly, I was flyin' so high
You said I can fly too, that's the start of me and you
Chemistry, what a blast, had us movin' so fast
Ooh baby, what a ride when your love is the map
Let's go
Love the way I move in, the crowd still a jewel
I rule it all with these 'cause I got that joie de vive
But like Tinker bell in the story of Pan
I got caught up and Captain Hook is my man
But I want free love
'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light
On this site, somebody cue the rain
Cue the rain, cue the rain
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain
Didn't know you'd be so greedy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
If you don't love me now, you will never love me again
I can still hear you say you will never, never break
Never break the chains
'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light
On this site, somebody cue the rain
Cue the rain, cue the rain
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain
Didn't know you'd be so greedy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
When it comes close your eyes, I'm takin' over your body
Close your eyes, close your eyes
When it comes I know 'cause I, I release myself
[Incomprehensible] inside, close your eyes
'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light
On this site, somebody cue the rain
Cue the rain, cue the rain
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain
Didn't know you'd be so greedy
Baby, you got my heart in chains"

When I command that you take a hand
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now
Chill, and watch me rap 'cause I'm flowing (Flowing)
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)
A battle, put me in it, I win it

System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in
Heart into the music, music I take part in
One try, one God, and one destiny

14,Evil That Men Do,1989,All Hail The Queen (1989),,Queen Latifah,"(Queen Latifah)
You asked, I came, so behold the Queen
Let's add a little sense to the scene
I'm living positive, not out here knocked up
But the lines are so dangerous, I ought to be locked up
This rhyme doesn't require prime time
I'm just sharing thoughts of mine
Back again 'cause I knew you wanted it
>From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it
Dropping bombs, you're up in arms, you're puzzled
The lines will flow like fluid while you're guzzling
The sip I drop you on a BDP-produced track
>From KRS to be exact
It's a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking
'Cause it's knowledge I'm seeking
Enough about myself, I think it's time that I tell you
About the evil that men do
Situations, reality, what a concept!
Nothing ever seems to stay in step
So today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers
Here are some things I want to cover
A woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares?
Because she's living on welfare
I government can't come up with a decent housing plan
So she's in no man's land
It's a sucker who tells you you're equal
(KRS-One)
You don't need him, Johannasburg's crying for freedom!
(Queen Latifah)
We the people hold these truths to be self-evident
(KRS-One)
But there's no response from the president
(Queen Latifah)
Someone's living the good life, tax-free
Except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free
And that's just part of the message
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do
Tell me, don't you think it's a shame?
When someone can put a quarter in a video game
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street
You can't treat him the same
It's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind
That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds
You to a doom, a fate worse than death
But there's still time left
Stop putting your conscience on cease
And bring about some type of peace
Not only in your heart, but also in your mind
It will benefit all mandkind
Then there will be one thing that will never stop
And it's the evil that men do"
15,Fast Car,2009,Persona (2009),,Queen Latifah,"Know, know what I mean?
Fast car, fast car
I wanna meet your fast car
Take me on a comet ride
Shoot me past the fast car
I wish I owned that last car
You could be the end to
Everything my heart's asking for
Take me away
(So, so, far away)
I don't wanna feel no sorrow
Take me away
(So, so, far away)
I might not see tomorrow
Hey, hey
You tell me you can cure my addiction
(Addiction)
And you tear my feet off the ground
Everytime I would forget my affliction
(Affliction)
But I don't want to come down
It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million tears and frowns
It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million years on the ground
Take me up in your rocket ship
Take me so, so far away
(Away)
Let me forget all the good shit
Take me so, so far away
(Away)
I need a face that's not mine that fits me
Just get me to forget misery
Yes indeed, we just be
In misery, yes indeed
We just be up high
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
You tell me you can cure my addiction
(Addiction)
And you tear my feet off the ground
Everytime I would forget my affliction
(Affliction)
But I don't want to come down
It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million tears and frowns
It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million years on the ground
You remind me of my Mercedez Benz
For you I spend all my years
You might wanna meet my friends
And I might wanna have your kids
I name 'em Shaniqua, Bonita, Rashawn
And baby, you can take me far away
See the moon and the stars
Now can't nobody do it like you do
(What?)
I admit you got to go
(What?)
Me and you, just us two
Spread my love like a swine flu
Ay, you got me high
Wanna touch the sky
You know you love me right?
Let's sing this lullaby
Yeah, you could be my fast car
Maybe be my Jaguar
Baby, what you isn't are
Make me see the moon and stars
I wanna touch the moon
Get some of this poom, poom
Ride it like zoom, zoom
Make him drop this fruit of the loom
He want my peach fair Victoria underwear
I love 'em, oh so swell
And yep, he love my fruit cocktail
I keep it real, baby
I love 'em crazy, baby
I'm a name brand bitch
She just don't need it, baby
You better stay with me
Sexy is what I need
I'm a F-A-S-T C-A-R M- ISS -E
You tell me you can cure my addiction
(Addiction)
And you tear my feet off the ground
Everytime I would forget my affliction
(Affliction)
But I don't want to come down
It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million tears and frowns
It's just the high that your givin' me
(Givin' me)
Is worth a million years on the ground
High that you're givin' me
High that you're givin' me
High that you're givin' me
High that you're givin' me
High that you're givin' me"
16,Fly Girl,1991,Nature of a Sista (1991),,Queen Latifah,"Well, it's almost nightfall
And there's no forecast of rainfall
And I'm in the mood for a party
So I'm gonna go out to a club
And give the dancefloor body
So I jump in the car and go to the venue
Walk in the door and now I'm on the menu
Guys in the house, they're wacthing me
They're clocking me, there's no stopping me
(Desire) I know you want me
(You're fine) thank you
But I'm not the type of girl that you think I am
I don't jump into the arms of every man
(But I'm paid) I don't need your money
(I love you) you must be mad
Easy lover is something that I ain't
Besides, I don't know you from a can of paint
Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys
I always hear, yo, baby?
I mean like what's the big idea?
I'm a queen, nuff respect
Treat me like a lady
And, no, my name ain't yo and I ain't got your baby
I'm looking for a guy who's sincere
One with class and savoir faire
I'm looking for someone who has to be
Perfect for the queen latifah me
(Fly girl, fly girl)
(Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine)
(And I want you to be mine)
(Fly girl, fly girl)
(Have no fear, your heart is in good hands)
(Won't you let me be your man?)
All my friends are in relationships
Some of then good ones and some of them bad ones
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get
I want a friend not just a lover
Someone who is dedicated only to me
Not to me and two or three others
One who will not lie to me or think
He can get my love by buying me
I know I'll find him some day
And when I find him
He sure won't say
(Fly girl, fly girl
(Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine)
(And I want you to be mine)
(Fly girl, fly girl, have no fear)
(Have no fear, your heart is in good hands)
(Won't you let me be your man?)
Lounging, sitting in the house
And I'm cooling, first day of the week
So there's nothing to do
And I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss
Momma never said there'll be days like this
So I called her and we talked for a while
Hang up the phone feeling better
With a smile
It's cool, 'cause 91 is my year
And this time I know I'm gonna hear
(Fly girl, fly girl, come here)
(Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine)
(And I want you to be mine)
(Fly girl, fly girl)
(Have no fear, your heart is in good hands)
(Won't you let me be your man?)

Doesn't matter if the world can't understand
I know if you stay right here by my side
I'll have no fear; I'll never run and hide just
Captivate my soul, hold me
When I'm down I need your love to console me
Some weakness tells me when the morning comes
It's hard for me to try to see you're not the one
For the love of you I just might just do most anything
It's the sensation the slightest touch can bring
Baby I adore you this is not a fling
With every breath I sing for you to
When I was a very small child
My mother told me
Hold on to the things that you love
And never let them go
Love is too precious to be wasted
And that is why I want you to know
What's this madness in my mind I really new love before this time
Boy you'll take me where I've never been before.
Now I want to explore more and more and more"

As we dance by the light of the moon
Your passion so often consumes me
Like the lick of a native tongue tune
Reality is ours to create
Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream
With my body and my soul
Question out my faith
I'm pledged to be your lover
And after I started loving you
I knew I'd never love another
I'm like a child within your arms
Would you come inside and play with me
Spend the day with me
Have your way with me.
Remember this always
My sweet one
No lie is true
And dude it's not a lie
When I say that
I would die for you
You're so deep within thee
That sometimes your just a touch away
But I can't reach you
I seek you
Come to me
But then you""re all around me
You just surround me
And you astound me
And I receive you
'Fore I complete you
It pleases me
To have you touch me there
I think you know it gets to me
Stop
Don't stop
Ecstacy
So sweet
I adore you
Come to me
That's right
Come to me
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
Reality is ours to create
Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream

Happiness is nothing without you
Stay.

Hold me
Come to me

(Originally by The Pointer Sisters)
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you want us both and I know the reason why.
I can give you so much lovin',
But presents, she can buy you.
Last night you're in my arms,
Tonight I'm all alone
How long will this game go on? How long?
Oh, oh how long?
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick.
I know you got a chick on the side.
And its plain, plain enough to see that
You're not the man for me.
I can't keep playin' games that keep my heart in pain.
I want to turn and walk away but its harder to do
Than it is to say.
It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure.
I'll get over you, yes Ill find someone new.
Each time I open up my heart,
It seems to just get torn apart.
I saw you, don't you try to hide.
Don't hide it from me, no, no. no.
You thought you would hide it, hide it,
Hide it from me.

25,I Can't Understand,1993,Black Reign (1993),,Queen Latifah,"I can't understand...
(I'm going crazy, you're going crazy) in the background
For give me father for I have sinned
I've just destroyed another phony ass rapper again
She wasn't causing it
She must have been stupid as a fiend
He should have told her child you don't step to the queen
Perplexed and I'm vexed cause everywhere I go
People be flexin and expecting me to wanna flow
I don't play that the only way that I will be playin'
As if I pay back you wanna play back so what you sayin'
You don't wanna be a sister in the name of rap
Yet you wanna talk shit and your style is whack
I would have squashed it before and made the whole issue dead
Now I'm fed so it's off with you head
Now the moral of the verse is that your career is through
And don't be fuckin' with nobody who ain't fuckin' with you
If I were in your shoes, I let there be a start walkin'
Next time there will be no talkin'
I can't understand...
(I'm going crazy, You're going crazy) in the background
A brother pushed up on me at the movies one weekend
He was on a quest and I wasn't ?even seekin'
I know though I'm black and he was a Puerto Rican
It made no good to me cause so we continued to speakin'
We hit it right off and everything was on a roll
Before I knew it I fell in love with his soul
""Aye poppy aye"" was the cry as he made love to me
I was freaked by the way he just to do me
And then one day when I was washing our clothes
A number fell out of his pocket and her name was Rose
A girl's number, hmm, that struck me kinda funny
I lost my grip, I had to call up the honey
There was a chick on the side, oh no it couldn't be
There was a chick on the side, he's down with the OPP
I gave you the whole shebang just to find out
There's another woman hitting my thang
I can't understand...
(I'm going crazy, you're going crazy) in the background
Why the negative vibes and why people take bribes I don't understand it yo,
I don't know
Why the bad people and why the good people die somebody gotta tell me why,
I don't know
Why the people smoke crack and why the whites fight blacks what's the scenario,
I don't know
Why the hearts get broke and why the chumps get choke they know I ain't no joke,
I don't know
Now with the drums, to the bass, to the piano and to the horn
It's a crazy ass life and that's my word is born
I'm trying to be as logical as I possibly can
Before the life of me
You know I just can't understand
What's going on sometimes
Some situations like this come out in my rhymes
But Queen Latifah ain't gone just yet
'Cause when it's come to mastering confusion I'm a vet
I can't understand...

I know you love it when I call you big poppa my thoughts are pure
I heard you left your last 'cause she was insecure
I'm not trying to compare myself but I got health and wealth
And now you dealing with the top shelf
My orgasmic thoughts need support
Thinking of positions you taught while I stare at the gifts you bought
The things you do for me make you my number one
When you're around I have a lot of fun check me now
Like the time we went to six flags boosting, tearing off tags
And sticking souvenirs into our bags
Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again
You're more than a lover you're my best friend
Do you remember the first time I letcha get it
I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it
You were the best I had that's why I want all of you

Is there a place to ease my mind
(Place to ease my mind)
Think about you all the time, yeah
Show me a sign and wish that you would
Offer me a sign, relax my mind
Let me close by saying stop delaying our fate
Let go your fear I'm here come hold your soul make
I want more but I don't want push
It's never to late so be straight don't beat around the bush
I'm all woman if you don't feel like I feel that's fine
Let's stay friends but I want you to be mine now check it
But I'll take what I can take it can't get no plainer
With love sincerely yours your boo Dana
Oh P.S. guess who's back around

There's a cry asking why, I pray the answer's up ahead, yeah
'Cause I know where I've been

Use that pride in our hearts to lift us up to tomorrow

And candle light, I like the scene
But baby, if you know what I mean
'Cause I love being here with you

I like a dance by Fred Astaire
And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair
But I think to tell you's only fair
That I love being here with you
And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day
His utter charm takes me away
But don't get me wrong, how do you say
I love being here with you
Oh, Basie's band's a-swingin', I like Ella singin'
'Cause there's something else, you know
They know how to say it, they know how to play it
They wind it up and let it go

Ain't gonna miss a thing, I'm gonna have my fling,
I'm gonna live, live, live until I die.
The blues I lay low, I'll make them stay low,
They'll never trail over my head.
I'll be a devil, till I'm an angel, but until then.
Hallelujah, gonna dance, gonna fly, I'll take a chance riding high,
Before my number's up, I'm gonna fill my cup,
I'm gonna live, live, live, until I die!
The blues I lay low, I'll make them stay low,
They'll never trail over my head.

Don't go and tell your friends
About the two of us
I'm not in love
Oh no no
It's because
Oh oh oh
You wait a long time for me
Ooh ooh you wait a long time yeah
I keep your picture
Right there on the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's been lying there
So don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it don't mean on thing to me
I ain't in love
No no no no
It's because
Oh oh oh
You wait a long time for me
Ooh ooh you wait a long time yeah
I'm not in love

No no no

No no no no
It's because
Ooh
You wait a long time for me
Darlin' ooh
You wait a long time for me
I ain't in love, I ain't in love no no no
I ain't in love, I ain't in love, I ain't in love
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you baby
I don't miss you like crazy
I ain't in love I ain't in love I ain't in love
Keep waiting, keep waiting."
33,If I Had You,2004,The Dana Owens Album (2004),,Queen Latifah,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the gray skies to blue
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life anew
If I had you
I could climb a snow-capped mountain
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a queen, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothin' I couldn't do
If I had you
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the gray skies to blue
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life anew
If I had you
I could climb a snow-capped mountain
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burnin' desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothin' I couldn't do
If I had you
Baby, if I had you"
34,If You Don't Know,1991,Nature of a Sista (1991),,Queen Latifah,"Oh I don't know
And it makes me scared
Because I'm falling in love
And I don't know if you feel the same
I'm taking this time to write you this letter
'Cause what we got is good but want to make it better
Yo boo, I'm digging you, you got all of the equipment
Now I'm ready for a commitment
I'm not trying to rush things
Not looking for an engagement ring
But the queen needs a king
And I choose you, 'cause what we got is in tune
Since you promised me the moon I hope to see it soon
(See it soon)
I want make this official man, I miss you
I feign for your touch and your kiss too
Listen I hope I'm not being to blunt
Don't wanna scare you away, it's a game I want to play but
Oh I don't know
And it makes me scared
Because I'm falling in love
And I don't know if you feel the same
(Hey)
Oh I don't know
(I don't know)
And it makes me scared
(So scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(Falling in love)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(Falling in love, hey)
I know you love it when I call you big poppa
My thoughts are pure
I heard you left your last 'cause she was insecure
I'm not tryin' to compare myself but
I got health and wealth
And now you dealing w/ the top shelf
My orgasmic thoughts need support
Thinking of positions you taught
While I stare at the gifts you bought
The things you do for me make you my number one
When you're around I have a lot of fun
Check me now
Like the time we went to six flags
Boostin', tearin' off tags
And sticking souvenirs into our bags
Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again
You're more than a lover you my best friend
Do you remember the first time I let cha get it
I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it
You were the best I had that's why I want all of you
Now tell them hookers to stop calling you
I'm dead up I want to wear your name
So I pray and ask god to make you feel the same
(Hey)
Oh I don't know
(Don't know)
And it makes me scared
(It makes me so scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(I'm falling in love again again)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(Baby baby baby baby)
(Hey)
Oh I don't know
(I don't know)
And it makes me scared
(Makes me scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(Falling in love again)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(Baby baby, oh oh oh yeah)
Is there a place to ease my mind
(Place to ease my mind)
(Think about you all the time, yeah)
Show me a sign and wish that you would offer me a sign
Relax my mind
Let me close by saying stop delaying our fate
Let go your fear I'm here come hold your soul make
I want more but I don't want push
It's never to late so be straight
Don't beat around the bush
I'm all woman if you don't feel like I feel that's fine
Let's stay friends but I want you to be mine now check it
But I'll take what I can take it can't get no plainer
With love sincerely yours your boo dana
Oh p.s. guess who's back around
My ex he called me said he bought a house up town
But I told him that my love for you was too strong
Write back and don't make me wait to long
Oh I don't know
Oh I don't know
(I don't know)
And it makes me scared
(Makes me so scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(Falling in love)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(I want to know, wanna know)
(Just me and my queen
Do you know what I mean
Hey hey hey
Falling in love
Tell me if it's good enough for you)"
35,Inside Out,1989,All Hail The Queen (1989),,Queen Latifah,"Uh huh, well the name is Latifah, you hear me coming through
The spreaker. Hit it Mark, 45 king
I am a bill, yes I'm only a bill when
It's time to ill I get ill and time to chill
I chill, my homeboy said this was the D.A.I.S.Y. age
I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it
You think I'm sleeping on you? Please, don't even try it
The name is Latifah, the scene, it is mine
The 45 King keeps the beat and the time while I
Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out
So don't try to turn me inside out"

Well, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day in the neighbor hood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong, and the flavor's good
I'm with whatever comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain old Dana today
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, Tech, jimmy hats in case I need protection
So I Land Cruise, pump sounds, play out wannabe's
A kid in the M3's getting jack right in front of me
So I pull the Tech close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they step cause mines is slightly bigger
But better yet, I'm a threat, so you better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk 'cause I don't wanna talk
I stay true blue, I'm hoping it's you too
I got the fever for the flava of a Woo Woo

Shoot some pool, act a fool, 'cause it's on tonight
I'm doing the knowledge, it's not easy (easy)
Watching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a D.T.
But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next
Stomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie
Get a Final Call from the brother in the bowtie
I'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter, moms, no pops playing with her son
I passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven
Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
You know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain

40,Ladies First,1989,All Hail The Queen (1989),,Queen Latifah,"(Queen Latifah)
The ladies will kick it, the rhyme that is wicked
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted
A woman can bear you, break you, take you
Now it's time to rhyme, can you relate to
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream
(Monie Love)
Ayo, let me take it from here, Queen...
Excuse me but I think I'm about do
To get into precisely what I am about to do
I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes)
(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here)
(Monie Love)
Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me
Not for being one but for being with one
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting
We are the ones that give birth
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First
(Queen Latifah)
I break into a lyrical freestyle
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles
'Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow)
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse
(With what?) With a little touch of ""Ladies First""
Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe
A female rapper with the message to send the
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen
(Monie Love)
My sister, can I get some?
(Queen Latifah)
Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb
(Monie Lovie)
Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American
You dig exactly where I'm coming from
You want righteous rhyming, Imma give you some
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay
Pay me every bit of your attention
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm
Of which is now systematically given
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another
Plus one more; all four
Have a job to do, we doing it
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E
And I'm first 'cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E
(Queen Latifah)
Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder
Cooling on the scene with my European partner
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax
When I get there, that's when I tax
The next man, or the next woman
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming
And I'll recite the chapter in verse
The title of this recital is ""Ladies First"""

But a wise
Civilized

You must learn step and respect the sire
Face the fire

Queen L.A.T.I.F.A.H in command
Some of these commercial entertainers
Are commercially a pain to mind and my behind
Try to dis Dana
Bumping me off
Because the Queen has reached a certain plateau
All I do is boo and say ""is that so?""
Talk is cheap
And if talk got any cheaper (huh)
They'll be selling Nike tongues instead of sneakers
Kay sa rah sa rah
Blazay blah
Etcetera
This is a scene from the Queen La La
Lovely and lyrically loose
But lady like
I'm too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type
Chomps y'all talk and still wonder how loose I got
When I'm in town I give the boosters booster shots
Breaks

Waste
Waste
Your mind on a rhyme
That will get thrown in your fronting face
I'll cut your throat

Hey
Silence I say
Lay low and have a cold one
Cause the whipping I'm dishing is an old one
I through some soul into my morning bowl
Then I rolled
I took your gold and stopped your singled
Cause it ever never sold
Matter of fact it never even got the time to sprout
So you could never give me body or come in my house

Put in a bid on who will fall

Some make me wanna go out with the bat and a magnum
But a wise
Civilized
Growing higher
Judgements from the queen
Punish is the fire
I here to make these fools out of liars
You must learn step and respect the sire
Face the fire
Latifah had it up to here the frauds felling fear (fear)
The sound is playing like a Q-tip digging your ear (ear)
Mama Zula stands for positivity, knowledge, and grace
I never run my piece damn I'll take it to your face
Open why you hoping

Bumping me off

They'll be selling Nike tongues instead of sneakers
Kay sa rah sa rah
Blazay blah
Etcetera
This is a scene from the Queen La La
Lovely and lyrically loose
But lady like
I'm too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type
Chomps y'all talk and still wonder how loose I got
When I'm in town I give the boosters booster shots

44,Latifah's Law,1989,All Hail The Queen (1989),,Queen Latifah,"All right listen, I'm back again cause that's what you required of
Me steady rhyming, and I'm so sick and tired of
Being forced to put suckers in their place
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face
But I'm not trying, so never sound like I don't bone to pick with you
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two
I speak the poetry, dissing those who keep on quoting me
Try to play me, cease it, you don't know me
So smile in my face, behind my back take a line or two
I'm not an idiot, so who you think you lying to?
Queen Latifah's here to lay the law down
So speed it up or shake it around because it's a showdown
The 45 King is arising, surprising, hypnotising star, he's up to par
So I hope you've prepared yourself for what you're in for
This is Latifah's Law
BMW's and gold rope chains don't impress me
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me
Get skeezed, you nose will bleed, that's how they live life
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life
Fire and desire make you go a little higher
When I grab the wire of the mic
And get hype, I'm sorry you sound dot
'Cause I roll like the homicide squad
You must be broke and, hoping that I'm soft but I'm dope and
Left you in the litter to consider coping with
Life, it's trife yeah, but these things happen
You need to make it better, stop trying to be the mack again
Get a grip on the African way
Cause there's a sucker born every day
Crime's the way for you to see what the Queen saw
And this is Latifah's law
Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to
The Flavor Unit keeps all, and keeps a way to band
And slides keep the hardcore fall, 'cause I'm heavy-handed
Whip out a .45 caliber pen and begin
A funky message from beginning to end
Peace be to Africa, can't forget my other land
Won't fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland
You say you're living right, but we know it's nonsense
In case you forgot, just check your conscience
At showtime, I blow lines, you don't get yours, I get mine
Your showtimes, you behind, the Queen Latifah divine
Rule number one: don't step across the line that I drew
Number two: don't take credit for something that you didn't do
Number three: check your heart, every man has a call
It's time for me to go, but I'll be back, y'all"
45,Life,1998,Order In The Court (1998),,Queen Latifah,"Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past life is real
Life is real, life is real, so real
Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream is just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel - life is real
Life is real, life is real, oh yeah
Success is my breathing space
I brought it to myself
I will price it
I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breastfeeding myself
What more can I say
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it
Life is real, life is real, life is real
Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in every pore
Life is real, life is real, life is real, so real
Life is cruel
Life is a bitch
Life is real - so real"
46,Lush Life,2004,The Dana Owens Album (2004),,Queen Latifah,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve o'clock tales.
Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.
Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.
Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.
I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive...
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..."

Possy, Dovey! (Yes mama?) Time to get up!
Hello, I'm Queen Latifah, how ya doing?
I hope that you're with this, I hope that you're willing
I want to introduce you to a cut called
""Mama Gave Birth to the Soul Children""
(Dove)
Well here comes the goy (Goy?)
The truth to the goy
You know the one, that ate up like boy
Stepping with a step, keeping with a kept
Making an appearance with a notty-head set
Lunatics you lose cause the Plug 2's singing
Peace to the negative, nah, you make the weigh-in
Weigh-in, weigh-in, way out of order
If you know you're better, you'd better that you caught a
Waving mine a peace sign higher than a kite
If you're feeling sick, it's all right it's fever night
Don't do ""Do see do"" and dig in no potholes
'Cause if you do we calling in March Patrol
It's no different from the verbal last heard
Cayumbo is the ruler that's bond to the word
He's moving more than three feet, jocking with the knee deep
Dove is going to leave you with a tweet tweet tweet
(Posdnuos)
Next on the menu, we continue with the pasta
Dipped in chocolate, served with lotsa
Twizzlers and honey, yum yum yummy
Lyrics I'm flaunting is good for the tummy
Tiptoing in I proceed to the floors
Selling much records like a pimp mover
Excuse me mommy, Pos wins
'Cause I'm the A to the Plug W-O-N
Brother freak it live for this tribe
Now let's ride down the highway of vibes
Pushing that we start cause the soul says please
Cutting back with the raps and we don't get cheese
Ducks and we sit need to get ????
Cause preacher is the key to the casualty
Polaroid flicks are back and you know
That the soul is moving on up like the Jeffersons"
48,"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy",2004,The Dana Owens Album (2004),,Queen Latifah,"My baby, she may not look
Like one of those bunnies out of the Playboy book
Well, I'm sorry bout that, Mr. Williams
But she's got something,
Johnny, much greater than gold
Well, now what's that?
I'm crazy 'bout that girl,
She's got so much soul
She's got the kind of loving, kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me!
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
Can you dig it?
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do - ow!
Tell 'em 'bout it, Watson
My baby now, when she walks by
All the fellows go, and I know why
Have mercy, just look at her walk
It's simply because that girl, she walks so fine
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind
Because she's got the kind of lovin',
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me!
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
I'd better tell 'em one more thing
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
Ow, tell 'em 'bout it, Mr. Williams
Now everybody in my neighborhood
An' that's what's grooving me
Will testify that my girl, she looks so good
Well, let me tell you something else right here
She looks so fine, she give eyesight to the blind
Help 'em to make 'em see
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind
Because she's got the kind of lovin',
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet

There I go... 
Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control 
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me 
I never can behave 
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic 
There's music all around me, crazy music 
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you 
Turns me your slave 
Come and do with me any little thing you want to 
Anything baby, just let me get next to you 
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes? 
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies 
How I worry about you 
Just can't live my life without you 
Baby come here, don't have no fear 
Oh, is there a wonder why 
I'm really feeling in the mood for love? 
So tell me why stop to think 
About this weather, my dear? 
This little dream might fade away 
There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby 
Won't you come and put our two hearts together? 
That would make me strong and brave 
Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid 
If there's a cloud up above us 
Go on and let it rain 
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane 
Oh my baby 
Won't you please let me love you 
And give a relief from this awful misery? 
(Girl/ Backup Singer) What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet? 
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before 
Can't you understand me? 
Now baby, please pull yourself together, do it soon 
My soul's on fire, come on and take me 
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet 
(Guy) Oh baby, you make me feel so good 
Let me take you by the hand 
Come let us visit out there 
In that new promised land 
Maybe there we can find 
A good place to use a loving state of mind 
I'm so tired of being without 
And never knowing what love's about... 
James Moody, you can come on in man 
And you can blow now if you want to

Truth the reality is real

51,Nuff' Of The Ruff' Stuff',1991,Nature of a Sista (1991),,Queen Latifah,"Get funky with it
I told you before: you burn when you play with fire
So take off your hats, matter of fact hail the new Sire
You're hungry as hell, so I'm cookin up the chowder
It's laced with ingredients, gon' come on like gunpowder
Pom-pom! lick a shot, then I got to order
I'm runnin' for the border for causin disorder
Pom-pom! lick a shot, got on my defenses
I'm runnin' for the fences, of course I'm relentless
The particular name of this queen is Latifah
I've often been classified as a feminine teacher
Collectively capture the heart of a nation
Love my culture and show appreciation
You're lookin' for the black influ'?
I do want too give it to you
What are you mad?
Give me some of what you had!
You can huff-huff, puff-puff and bluff-bluff
But I got nuff of the ruff stuff
(Ruff and tuff)
(And all that stuff)
Now nuff of the ruff stuff, that's what I do, and I do it well
The proof is in the puddin', I show and prove, not show and tell
Talk tales, you get caught up in a crossfire
Buckshot must be what you want and desire
I write concepts, I don't be frontin or be buggin
I solely write the rhymes for the beats that you be lovin'
It's a love thang, the Queen doin' her thang
If I was a liquid, you would drink me like Tanq'
You think I'm kickin things that I myself don't even heed?
I rap not for the love of music, but for greed?
""Latifah's booty, yo, she could never succeed""
Shiiit...
You watch me do it and boom it, the Flavor Unit will snap necks
You a-fi listen a likkle, you fi go buy the cassette
You're starvin, cause you ain't had enough
That's right, nuff of the ruff stuff
(Ruff and tuff)
(And all that stuff)
You talk about flavor...
I got enough flavor to make a grapefruit sweet
Get old ladies jumpin' out of their seats
Change a peach to a pear to a plum with a little sun 'n' rays
I got flavor for days
Now I'm the type that the fellas call a honey, and
>From me you know you get a worth for your money, and
This is no meaningless attack, I gave you a chance
Matter of fact, yo, I ordered them to 'dance
For me', they tried to turn me 'inside out'
They felt the 'wrath of my madness', I let them 'come into my house'
It's called 'latifah's law', for the criminal to curse
And all the gentlemen know its rule: 'ladies first'
Not the typical female that tends to
Fall vitim to the 'evil that men do'
Small puff, I call your bluff
I'm not mad, I just had enuff of the ruff stuff
(Ruff and tuff)
(And all that stuff)
Everybody know Latifah love positivity
Now positivity erase negativity
Mi comin' inna di dance ???
Me rollin' with the Flavor Unit posse
As a black woman mi want equality
Equality, and di freedom to be me
Mi have a mother Rita, only call her Mommy
Likkle brother and sister, Angelo and Kelly
A brother in them laws, but mi call him Winki
Lost mi daddy and ??? family
??? Black ??? black country
Believe in one God, one tribe, one destiny

Forgive the crowds, O Lord, they know not why they sweat me
Biting's against the law in the place that I live
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib
The call me the high priestess of this hasta
Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta
There's never been a word I can't master
I've always been, a piddly pastor
I reign, the lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side
And I'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light"

59,Queen Of Royal Badness,1989,All Hail The Queen (1989),,Queen Latifah,"Let me remind you on how to unwind your body
So dance and shake and just keep in step
Understand, draw a clear picture
What I'm gonna hit you with is truly def
These are the words of a Queen of a Queendom
All competitors, I simply cream them
One by one, I dust a rush them all
If you have any more, bring them
To the front so they can sho me what they got
What they got, it better be hot
'Cause if it's not, I'll simply knock them out the box
And they'll be put in a spot
The style I use will surely amuse
The party people to a state of gladness
What I mean is I'm on the scene
I'm the Queen of Royal Badness
Well it's the Lah, T-I-F-A-H
While I say my rhyme, Mark creates
The direct hi-tech sound of the dope noise
The bass will pound, I hope girls, I hope boys
Understand what I'm quoting, I'm not joking
Or freaking, this is a Queen speaking
Wis words, when I'm done I leave your eyes blurred
When you address me, address me as ""Your Highness""
One of hip-hop's finest
You see, I can flow on tempo, off tempo
It makes me no difference
So play that beat, play it, kick it, watch me
Flip it, with dope lyrics, you want to hear it?
Observe my ways and actions, I grab the mic
And draw attractions
To the table, I'm a hit you at all angles
Those who think I caught a fit, I strangled them
The result with a pen and a pad
Gets mean, see I'm the Queen of Royal Badness
I can't wait until the party is jam-packed
When I start to drop it, the people say ""Damn, black""
The queen is hyped up, awesome and deadly
If you don't dance, grab a chair and plex, B
Composure's kept, blows are thrown in death, hard as hell
Guard as well as you can or step
Off the premisis, in one minute it's
Going to explode in a style that's limitless
Make your first move, don't let it be your worst move
'Cause if you do, you'll be a hurt fool
Keep your mouth shut to those that shout and cuss
It's no doubt that I got clout and I'll bust
Literature that flows like liquid
Some can't comprehend the way I kicked it
So don't say nothing
Just listen up, follow instructions
Rhyme, shake, slide, and dance like Lat said
When I'm on stage I sold rage and drop heads
Ambidextrous, skilled with both hands
Teaching a lesson, ready to throw jams
Latifah loves to rip up the scenery
It's nothing special, just a Queen to me
So do the knowledge, see if you can catch this
You know what I mean, it's the Queen of Royal Badness"

Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n' quiet dreams,
Quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie
Away ... from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie

I was (something) to move a job
So we took it to a club
Nigga we would make out a little
And plus at the time I was single, a little
So I said ""Fine, we could meet up about nine""
So anyway we crossing the place where bub is flowing
We walking around, giving up peace to everyone we knowin'
Some people in the joint is yellin' ""Hurt me, Hurt me""
I'm working my way over to the bar 'cause I'm thirsty
And then I see this guy
Oh no, I think he sikes me
I smile 'cause he's fly
He smiles back, I think he likes me
Well then it takes a twist
He sends his homeboy to talk to me 'cause he's scared to get dissed

You coulda asked me yourself for my number to my beeper
The worst thing I'da said was ""No""

Was he fly?
Yes he was
Word up, the type you have on a plate
'Cause I only met him last night
So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right
So he pulls up at my door in a twenty-four foot limo
What is on his (something), are we expecting more?
He showered me with gifts and then he kissed me on my hand
Now what was in your plan?
I really didn't understand
We're only going to the movies
Either you're trying to impress me or watch you're trying to get the poony
Listen baby, I don't want a condo
You can make me smile a little and give me convo
All I might require from my man is intelligence
And all them other material things is irrelevant
(Chorus twice)
Now if you ready to deal with a girl who consider herself a queen
And you know how to treat a queen
Then step to the scene
We can sit alone in a room and deal
We can take a ride listening to music and chill
And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you
'Cause you ain't gotta be no superstar honey
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are
Money ain't gone make me love ya
And even with your car
So cease with that attitude
With that attitude you won't be getting far
And I love all of my brothers with a passion
Can't a sister get the same type of reaction

I stepped into a basement party in Brooklyn
The brothers was looking as soon as I put a foot in
A female walked up to me and said ""Latifah bust a line""
I don't think you're on the strength, show me the time
I said ""If you really want to do this, we can do this, fine
Take six paces and begin to rhyme""
As soon as attempted to make a sound
I ate her up with the verb, broke her down with the noun
'Cause I hate it when someone challenges with me but cannot balance with me
I get annoyed when they can't go blow for blow
I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings
(Daddy-O)
Ha ha, I was thinking the same thing
Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them
Rhyme fiends, biters, and bums
Took me kind of light, said they wanted to fight
I kinda got uptight (You didn't do what I think you did?) Yeah, right!
Bash! went the first, Smash! went the next one
He started, he started to run
But to his surprise, his feet must have slipped
'Cause I snapped that neck before the second step"

Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone and it hurts so much
Well then why...
Must the same love that made me laugh, make me cry?
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think about it being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop
I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me, baby
I don't want to live
Well then why...

Now don't be getting mad when we playing, it's cool
But don't you be calling out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on, right, cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Then the little one said (yeah me, bitch) and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye and said

Bad days at work give you an attitude, then you were rough
And take it out on me, but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again, I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love, I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad
But I don't wanna see my kids see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around

You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it

73,What Love Has Joined Together,2007,Trav'lin' Light (2007),,Queen Latifah,"It would be easier to take the wet from water
Or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us
Or stop us from holding hands
'Cause I love you
(I love you)
Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart
And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart
It would be easier to take the cold from snow
Or the heat from fire
Than for anyone to take my love from you, baby
'Cause you're my heart's desire
I really love you
(I love you)
I love you from the bottom of my heart
And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart
Even if they separate us
A thousand miles apart
We will still be together
In each other's hearts
It would be easier to change
All the seasons of the year
Than for anyone to change
The way I feel about you, oh, I love you dear
I really love you
(I love vou)
Oh, baby, I love you from the bottom of my heart
Love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart, baby
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together

74,Winki's Theme,1993,Black Reign (1993),,Queen Latifah,"(Talk) This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki who is looking down on me from
Heaven Watching my every move as usual...
There but for the grace of god do I go do I go
There but for the grace of God do I go do I go-go
I'm trying to take my time on this rhyme
But it's bustin' from the seems
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams
I'm moving all around
Oh yes, I'm making leaps an bounds
There's so much shit to say, no time to write it down
I'm skippin' to this and skippin' to that
I've overflowed my cup.
I'm flowin' kind of quick I hope you can keep up
Every ain't cool just cause you slap me on my hand
There're things about all of y'all have got to understand
Latifah- never was a teacher
Never was a preacher
Never was a saint
Never was conceited
Never was defeated
Sometimes I get tired sometimes I want to faint.
But I never shut up when things piss me off
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across
That's what I got to do that's how it's got to be
I've got an angel watching over me
(Chorus) 2 times
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world
Yes he did, yes he did
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world
You don't hear me
Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world, world, world, world
The light of my world, my world- Ah yes he did..."

76,Wrath Of My Madness,1989,All Hail The Queen (1989),,Queen Latifah,"My mellow Latee was kicking flavor
The R.E. posse said ""Yo Latifah we can do this""
So I paused in the thought and in my brillance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this
Now you should want to flex, 'cause I'm in full effect
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set
You've been begging and dying for somebody's rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave to me
I'm coolin teaching those needing schoolin
The mic, this mic in my hand, I'm rulin
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness
(Latifah: rasta chorus)
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way
Some MC's have gold and African vein
And using each other to compete with
Their subjects I pity because their rhymes are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting
There's penalties for those who don't do writing, just be reciting
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
It's not my fault your thoughts are shrinking
While mine are growing, yes you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say, and even in spite of me
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness, call me ""Your highness""
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness
(Latifah: rasta chorus)
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way
Word of mouth is always everlasting
And everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey
And music is made by Mark the 45 King
You tremble for my treble, you're begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious, the same as the pace
The crowds, they love me, the brothers give only hugs
The shrunk-to-fit buttonflies fit quite snug
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging
Ofj the beats that DJ Mark is loving
So plex on the sounds that I'm pumping
I'm jumping with the energy to turn your mind to gladness
Come on, just get into it, don't lie and say I been through it
Feel the wrath of my madness
(More rasta singing)
I scene is mine 'cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Don't step up in my face, you don't want to feel the taste
Don't try to play me out, 'cause I am not the one
Brothers on my brastrap, sisters clocking my sound, why?
Because they wanna be down with the
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this
Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme
And get up on the wrath of my madness
