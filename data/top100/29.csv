It's a party y'all, tear the roof right off
Bounce with the double O-G

Get off the wall, all of y'all
Wake up all the people who sleep
Alllllllll night looooong
Let's grooooooove lady
I don't wanna sleep with you, but maybe later on I do
Too smoooooooth baby
C'mon let me dance with you, girl I like the way you move
Home after a hard day's work
I wanna see the mini skirt
Tonight I wanna take you out
I wanna know what you about
I need to grab some juice and gin
I need to call a couple friends
I want to see you shake it and
I hope this party never ends
Where else would I go? What else would I do baby?
It's a party with you lady, ah
I know you want to, it's all up to you baby
We can party all night baby, ah
This party won't stop (all night long)
Let's take it to the top, all night long (all night long, all night long)
This is where I wanna be, my loved ones and me
All night long (all night long, all niiiiight)
Go ahead get off the wall, tear the roof right off
All night long (all night long, allllll, all night)
Welcome one, and welcome all, to the city by the deep blue sea
Where they party all night long, all night long
All night [5X]"
1,Almost in Love,1998,G-Funk Classics (1998),,Nate Dogg,"I was almost head over heels
I was almeost the man of your dreams
And you almost had me sprung
You were almost my only one
Just about had me hooked, till I had to take a second look
Almost in love
Just about had me hooked, till I had to take a second look
Almost in love
Girl you almost made me change my code
And you almost made my pockets grow hoes
Not only did you almost
Make me buy you gold
Downtown you almost make me go
Just about had me hooked, till I had to take a second look
Almost in love
Just about had me hooked, till I had to take a second look
Almost in love
The roses we picked just yesterday
Seemed to have wiltered away
And we've been on the ground
Looking for a four-leaf clover but there's been no luck
Baby I guess it's over
But we almost make it to the finished line called love
Almost and there's no need to raise our voices
Unless we're singing in harmony
But we're not 'cause there's no harmony
But we almost make it almost
Almost in love
Almost in love
Almost in love
Almost in love"
2,Another Short Story,2001,Music & Me (2001),,Nate Dogg,"(Nate Dogg)
Another short story
When he be acting bad, don't he make you mad
Wanna kick his ass, when he already showed ya
He ain't no good and that's a fact
Another sad story
She constatly says she adores me
Girl I'm all dog in love don't leave here anymore
Another short story
Her love was beginning to bore me
It does't take long for my love to fade
Another sad story
I only call when I'm horny
But she acts like we kick all day
It's a quarter pass midnight
Don't he make you mad, you can't find his ass
Seven hours past, since he called you last
Only to you he can do no wrong
Funny how time flies
Especially when you live a whole life
Looking for love is already gone
Another short story
Already gave you a warning
A one night stand homie look what I done
Another sad story
This girl was so soft that's so lovely
I cannot stay 'cause she's to strong
I keep my mind on my monay
And everything else is just find someone else to play her game
I like new skirts yeah like bees like honey (honey)
You can have some if you want, hey no kissing
Ooh no, another short story
Her love was beginning to bore me
It doesn't take long for my love to fade
Another sad story
I only call when I'm horny
But she acts like we kick all day
Another short story
Already gave you a warning
A one night stand homie look what I've done"

When your man ain't home (Man ain't home)
You can call me baby (Call me baby)
You can let me know (Let me know)
You ain't had none lately (Had none lately)
Let me in the backdoor (Let me in your backdoor)
When he walks out the door
When he acts like he don't want you no more
You can do the same thang
You can play at this game
With this love in forehold
He got you doing his chores
Might as well be with me
You ain't nobody's slave
He ain't never gone change
He still be palying his game
You can do the same thang
Girl I won't say a thang
If you won't tell I won't tell
We living life, what the hell
We both want the same thang
Ain't no raison to complain"
4,Bad Girls,2003,Nate Dogg (2003),,Nate Dogg,"I react like a dog when ya move his food
I'll turn your blocks upside down like Rubik's Cube
I need a bad girl to make a nigga lose his cool
But in the heat of the battle she'll pull his tool
I take 'em - skinny, dumb, blind, crippled and crazy
Or even five-hundred pounds sweatin' gravy
You know, she cooks cover, not with Maybelline
So ""Next Friday"" she hunt you like Baby D
I told her I'm not big, I'm tight with money
Tight nigga, stay shittin' with a diaper on me
Niggaz throw on your gators, I'm the type that's bummy
Stayin' around the hood keep me nice and hungry
She said ""I like your style"", I complimented
Her ass like a garden, I gotta dig it
Niggaz better duck when baby squeeze
Bad girl, bad girl from L.A.P.D. nigga
(Nate Dogg)
I, I know that I shouldn't, I
Shouldn't buy into this lie
I know that she got 2 or 3/4 guys
I, I know that these girls all fly
And they know that I'm that guy
Who can make all these girls come alive
Why? Because I got my eye
Got my eyes on them thighs
And she got her eyes on this bad guy
(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)

I, I got a nasty mind
And she got a big behind
I gotta make that bad girl mine
Why? She likes to play all night
Knows how to move just right
I better slow down before she pass me by
Tonight, I'ma show her tonight
Won't let her go tonight
Look at her shake it, my-my-my
(Redman)
Ey yo Nate, that bad girl ain't Platinum, she a Diamond to me
She got a car door that open, ninety degrees
Or how 'bout them women, that's outdoor till the mail come
First of the month, they toes and nails done
Workin' three jobs just to feed her children
And to fuck me on the beach at Hedonism
She smoke like I do, ride like I ride
She's that bad girl that'll ride till I die
Fool, nigga, say ya seen what?
Bad girls all gettin' stuck in here
Yo, bad girls, they gettin' stuck in here
Yo, these bad girls gettin' stuck in here

You can bring the bottle of wine
Call me whenever, we can get together
And have us a real good time
(Nate Dogg)
Its still morning
I'm still yawning
Outside my window
Someone's calling
Her name was Micky
Habits freaky
She liked to do me
Her and her homeys
Did I mention
That I'm balling
Rollin' on gold ones
That's right, crawling
That's why she's jocking
Early this morning
I'm feeling under the weather
I'll soon be feeling better
Don't forget the paper this time
(Somebody's calling)
I'll bring the bag of weed

You can bring the bottle of wine
(Somebody's calling)
Call me whenever, we can get together
(Outside my window)
And have us a real good time
(Tray Dee)
Call me whenever, but never ever after 10
'Cause I got to be at home with my bitch and my kids
I hit the skin flip the twin lips of love apart
Get to diggin in ya ligaments then bust ya heart
'Cause from the start, soon as we sparked the bag I brought
I seen you chokin through the smoke noticed your titties was taut
You caught, up in the game that I came to spit
I cracked the hennessey and entered DP gangsta shit
You wanna get with this, or is you in to twist
The game up and make me cum just to say you came up
And gained what another strike on your rap
When you coulda kept your mouth shut and right on the step
With the program knowin' damn well you wrong girl
'Cause I shook you and took two of your homegirls
You played yourselves so I had to leave
Baby shoulda just chilled off this bag of weed
(Somebody's calling)
I'll bring the bag of weed
(Outside my window)
You can bring the bottle of wine
(Somebody's calling)
Call me whenever, we can get together
(Outside my window)
And have us a real good time
I can bring the fat ass bag of weed
I just now left the spot
You can bring the cold ass bottle of wine
And make that your first spot
(Somebody's calling)
I'll bring the bag of weed
(Outside my window)
You can bring the bottle of wine
(Somebody's calling)
Call me whenever, we can get together
(Outside my window)
And have us a real good time"

'Cause I play everyday
You do it too don't lie

Back in the days I used to like bitches
But I tell you nowadays bitches ain't shit
And if you wonder why I say this
I've had a few bitches and bitches think they slick
Runnin' around, playin' all my niggaz
Trying to split a brother from his grip
Got all these bustaz watchin me
But I tell you right now hoe, I don't slip
I'd like to give a shout out to my favorite girl
But I won't you know why, because she's a trick
And if I give a shout out to a sneaky bitch
I got to give a shout to the nigga she's sneakin with
(And all my homeys say)
Because I got a girl, don't mean we can't talk
(Come on girl let me heed it)
Because I got a girl, don't mean I won't break you off

A dirty ho's drawls
That was the cause of it all
Pimpin' hustlin playin' hoes is all I know
With my homeys on the mash and a pocket full of cash
What more can a nigga ask for
With my strap in my lap and my niggaz back to back
A muthafucka didn't wanna see me
Then along came his girl, finest woman in the world
That broad been to my knees
A dirty ho's drawls
That was the cause of it all
(Now I, don't trust no hoe
And do you, know that's how it goes)
I never thought you were the one
That would try to get a nigga like Ms Spunk
A dirty ho's drawls

But you still have the good looks, DPG blood
You're the only one that, I love

Silly Niggaz who be rappin' but they really be actin'
I'm smackin' niggaz in they face
For the 9-8
My DJ Warren G and my homeboy Nate
The game won't wait
So we paper chase
And watch out for them suckas who paper-hate
Try to drop some shit to keep you straight
Keep my niggaz on a mission
But my success, oh yes it's fresh
Here's a toast to my LB for life
You can call me when you wanna
Or can catch me in the Navigator bendin' in the corner

There lived a man who claimed to be foldin' aces in hand

Very best I have to be and I hope you understand

And shake your hips with hollow tips
It's the modern day me

Mutherfuckin' modern day G
No good for for sho good
Put this nigga on the hood
And let me put him back the fuck off
Like that, you fuckin' with the Kobe Bryant of rap
With a Mack 11 cocked back ready for sure, ready for war

Black people don't have no, no where to go
You know, all we got to do is kick it
We gonna kick it in our hood, you know
What we gonna do, we might
We might go kill a couple of niggaz mane
You know, go in they hood and do a drive-by
Then come back in the hood and laugh about that stuff
You know, its just a thing
Only how you really gonna get deep into it
Is when one of your homeys die
Just like when my partnaz died
(We got some problems)
First we pray, then we ride
First we pray, then we ride
He was my brother
Loved him like no other
To top it off
I introduced him to this game
I knew his mother
Loved her like my mother
Part of me is gone
Bout take my brother home
(What're ya gonna do)
When the trials come
(Are ya gonna run?)
Are you gonna run?
(What're ya gonna do)
First I'm gonna pray
(Are ya gonna run?)
You muthafuckin right
First we pray, then we ride
First we pray, then we ride
(Kurupt)
I ain't got nothin' but love for you loccs and hogs
And I ain't got nothin' but love for my muthafuckin dogs
In the mist of the war zone, its on on site
Daylight tonight the heat held close and tight
Beware here I come with the DPG on my chest
Heat gonna spit like Elliot Ness
In the darkest zone you feel alone and on your own
And after I bust, niggaz call me Kurupt Coleone
All I'm about is money, loot and cash
Homeys in the DPG Nate, Snoop and Daz
Now with these emotions how you approach yourself
Knowin' you all about your wealth and as it is to health
First I pray, get my thoughts intact
Ask for forgiveness 'cause I'm bout to lay this nigga flat
Can you adapt, can you feel me, I doubt it
'Cause the closest you see it, is when niggaz write about it
I can't live without it and it ain't shit I could do
But stay down with the homeys in grey and blue
So just keep the heat close in hand
'Cause I done see niggaz get shit while they homeboys ran
(Nate Dogg)
Heavenly father shine your light on me
I know I promise to slow down on this weed
Seems I remember someone used to say
One life gets taken, if you take one life away
(What're ya gonna do)
When the trials come
(Are ya gonna run?)
Are you gonna run?
(What're ya gonna do?)
First I'm gonna pray

Friends, how many of us have them
Friends, how many of us have them
Friends, how many of us have them
Friends, how many of us have them
(Snoop Doggy Dogg)
Every since I could remember
I had friends I could depend on
Clothes to lend 'em
But as time went by
My life got a little strange
And the rules of the game seem to change
Trust, honesty and devotion
And money, money, money is the poison potion
There's no way that I can even say
That this game has been good to me
Or even bad to me it had to be
Cause tragically the way this shit
Cracked off for Doggy Dogg was magically
And now I'm gettin' everything I'm supposed to get
But my friendship with niggaz always ends up as bulshit
I listen to my momma though
She always tried to prepare me
Byt how could she do what I
I mean I'm do or die
But my life on the streets
That shit is suicide
So to cope I got a dogg and a locc
And keep my heat close in case these jokes go for broke
I'm mashin' with the click 2-1-3 that is
They my homeboys ever since kids-
Real friends to the end
Chorus (Nate Dogg):
Hangin' out with my homies and I'm feelin' just fine
I've been ponderin' lately, lately
A lot of different things on my mind
It seems lately my friends list
Done took a slight decline
And if you wanna know the truth man, man
Them wasn't no friends of mine
(Warren G)
You jackin' me up, you takin' my cash
All my life L-B-C, for my city I mash
All those OGs and BGs and wannabies and L-O-Cs
The only friends I got is my 2-1-3s
That's my nigga Snoop D Woop and my nigga N-A-T-E
I can't forget about my nigga H to the Deezy
Pressure and strikes
Don't wann take no lives
But these jaws, cracks and hood cracks
Will make you break bizacks
""Whussup homie, can I borrow some cash?""
Last week I gave you 500, so kiss my ass
I got a baby to feed
A familly to see through
And shake busta snitches tweekin' like you

16,G-Funk,1998,G-Funk Classics (1998),,Nate Dogg,"G is for the gang of money I make
F is for the gang of fools I break
U is for the undisputed champ
N is 'cause you never gonna get the mic back
K is for the niggaz that I knock on they back
Damn is feels good to see Long Beach on the map
Till the day I'm dead I'm gonna keep that shit real
Now you niggaz know G-Funk's for real
To those people who don't believe in G-funk
Tried to take my style and make a quik buck
Here's a message to one and all
Your pass is revoked
Now I'm havin' a ball
Any questions come and see me
The king of G-Funk the one and only
Congratulations you sound like Nate
You took my old hook
And got me paid
Some people are nothin' but clones
Some people have styles of their owm
Some people are copycats
These people can't get the mic back
Can you feel me one-hitter quitters
You can't copy me - I'm one in a million
Call any expert and you can ask him
Copy machines can't copy platinum
When you feel like some cavy G-Funk
You need some music to bumb in your trunk
I got a baseline, a gangsta tune
Put on the classics and your head will be movin' soon"
17,Get Up,2003,Nate Dogg (2003),,Nate Dogg,"(Eve)
Can never claim to be a gangsta nigga
Just gangsta
Now take a sip of something
Let me entertain you
The smoke is for them rowdy niggas
Like they want to shank ya
I cock back and blast with no questions asked
So just hold tight
Don't let the liquor run your whole night
Don't let a second of courage fuck up your whole life
I play the color analyze the view
Push up my glass to acknowledge just a chosen few
'Cause I don't fuck with many
Especially the tough ones off a glass of henny
Specialy the ones always frontin that don't have a penny
I run with niggas that demand respect
And I'm a boss bitch most y'all can't handle that
All you can do is watch and glide
And take a special type nigga to stop a stride
'Cause I can't respect a nigga that soft
And I bet y'all never seen it commin
Me and my nigga Nate dogg
(Nate)
All the girls get up
Take it too the floor
Nate just bout to flow
Turn it up some more
All my dogs get down
Let me see ya move
All the girls get up
Get up and get down
I'm on my way to the liquor store
With E-V-E and my nigga rose
Got too much game to be slippin though
I let you know if you didn't know
Never will you be able to fuck with me
Never will I ever stop bustin' I'm makin' G's
Whenever I retire I'm gonna still be beats
Shit that keep ya head bobbin
People move your feet
Shake that baby
Driving me crazy
I want that thing
No ifs, ands, or maybes
I might just keep it
If you can keep a secret
Best believe I know how to please it
Twist and turn and got my body burning
She ain't broke yet but homie she learnin
Get up and get down
Its for a glock but its letting out
Met in the club now we playin' house
I'm drunk as hell so I'm showin out
Put on my glove and I knocked it out
I'm so cold
Way too smooth
Girls they know
What to do
Shake that baby
Driving me crazy
I want that thing
No ifs, ands, or maybes
I might just keep it
If you can keep a secret
Best believe I know how to please it
Twist and turn and got my body burning
She ain't broke yet but homie she learnin
I know, you came to have a fuckin' party
I know it about time to get shit started
You know, that I'm a b-aaaaa-d man
Nobody can do this like I can
Ain't no makin' it up"

Saggin pants, gat in hand, the nigga was a nut
Looney low key, O.G., been bangin' from the jump
Dressed in all black, ready to jack, and he still don't give a fuck
A friend of of mine, he used to be, before I got caught up
He used to roll with me, way back in '93, when I was broke as fuck
Be prepared to blast, that's all that he ask, if he's to ride wit you
We gonna make some cash, and dash, you can toss him when ya through
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man around
Little big man, don't you see me lyin' here; pick me up, if you dare
I'll make you're life easier, 'cause I'll be pumpin fear
Disrespect, you don't have to take
If you see him comin', just wave me in his face
But you ain't the only one that got a friend like me
So hurry up, let's go, I'm kind of tired of being broke
I know you gotta get paid, I can show you the way
So take me home, polish the chrome
Load me up, and put me to his dome
I got a lot work to do, so toss me and be gone
You're a big man now
You're a big man now
You're a big man now
You're a big man now

Mr. Nate Dogg, may I call you Nate? I just wanna ask you a few questions, do you mind if I
Record this converstaion?
No, I don't mind at all.
I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but I'm a pretty big fan of yours and I've been
Following your carrer since you were sentenced to Death Row.
Right
And I've noticed a lot of people trying to jump on the G-Funk bandwagon, um...
Haha, that's right
...Proclaiming to be from the G-Funk generation. How would you like to address that?
Well, you gotta do what you gotta do to eat.
Hehe, Nate, I hope no offense is takin' by this next statement, but it doesn't look like you'll
Be around much longer and in my opinion when you're gone, it's going to be very difficult to
Ever get the true meaning of G-Funk. So as a last request for the millions of people who love
And respect your music, could you please give us the true definition of G-Funk."

And you don't have to move a muscle
Just lay back and relax, chill

With blocks, that look like police officer Conn
Islip's a author of mine, once these slugs is in your head
Doctors won't be able, to get 'em off of your mind

Tell 'em I said they don't get a hundred grand then go!

And if my funds get low again one thing I can guarantee
You catch me by the corner store sellin badass bags of weed

Bouncin' like a baller over tight-ass beats
Remind yourself that can't nobody can bust like me

Raised from the gutter taught to make money
Why do niggaz talk about what they can't see

Set it at the top right next to fortune and fame

Never Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (Never leave me aloooone)
Leave me alone (Never leave me alone)
Never leave Me alone
Verse 1 (Nate Dogg):
They tell me that temptation... ooh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me... I tried to hide my feelings, D-O-G's
Ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to... But I don't even know what it is
You've got me singin' in the morning... you bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts you rub my head
I'll ask you one time only... baby, won't you be there when it's hectic
When I don't have a hit record (Never leave me alone)
Verse 2 (Nate Dogg):
I've traveled so many places... I've seen so many faces
There were times I didn't think I'd make it through (alone)
I went through so many phases... that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gonna' then what you gonna do
I guess I'll call my lady... and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Tell him his daddy's sorry... let him know all about me
There's one more thing I'd really like for you to do
Verse 3 (Snoop Dogg)
Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin' through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine
Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to Chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga Spanky too
It's true that the dirt I did from an O.G. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
And real G's gon cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fuckin' niggas on the outside
But what's the chance it ain't crackin'
If I was out and she was in I'd probably be mackin
I can't lie
So I say I would now my girl in a world of playahood
A playa should show a nigga love and look our
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, OK
But if I don't I guess this is home
My girl is trippin' she got a block on the phone"

42,No Matter Where I Go,1998,G-Funk Classics (1998),,Nate Dogg,"No matter where I go
I'm lettin' people know
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say
You gotta' release the chains
I think it's time I set my spirit free
No matter where I go
I'm lettin' people know
That the pace is never stalling
Even if the sky is falling
I'll never be afraid
As long as I keep my faith
Even if I am still crawling
Won't be mad 'cause some are balling
But man without the trust, without the loyalty
When you watch your dog just starving
Don't get mad when they start barkin'
Here's a suggestion man
Why don't we just wash our hands
'Cause I'm peepin' other pastures
I think it's time I'm my own master.
No matter where I go
I'm lettin' people know
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say
You gotta' release the chains
I think it's time I set my spirit free
Long ago I told my homie
Some people are so damn phony
Sure as the wind blows
They'll try to take your dough
On and on man they just keep comin'
Till I'm dead man I'm never runnin'
Fear I just don't know
If it's your time you gotta' go
But what about the trust what about the loyalty
When the have no respect for you
It's fuck 'em or call your lawyer
Here's a suggestion man
Why don't' we just wash our hands
'Cause I'm peepin' other pastures
I think it's time I'm my own master.
No matter where I go
I'm lettin' people know
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say
You gotta' release the chains
I think it's time I set my spirit free
Here's to my family
Here's to the ones I really love
Here's to the inmates
And that's who made Death Row #1
Here's to the foundation
And that's where, where it started from
Here's to real freedom
They tell me makin' music's fun
When you got no shackles on your feet
No matter where I go
I'm lettin' people know
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say
You gotta' release the chains

I gotta clock my dough clownin'
Hittin' switches in a green 6-4
With the drink in a on deck and the bombest indo
A car full of gas and nowhere to go
I gets a call on the phone - ""what's happenin'?""
Pimpin', chillin' with bitches drinking Silver Satin
Is them bitches on deck, on deck to the fullest
Gots that type of game and I'm know just to pull 'em
Now as I stroll and as I pass by
Maxin' with my doggs feelin' dandy and high
Is that looney muthafucka that they call Kurupt
Ballin' out the house with some Gin in his cup
(Kurupt)
Now I found myself blowin' out smoke
Bombed out looney and locced
Open up them doors let me see some of th hoez
It's Kurupt and I'm liable to fuck three or four
I'm hittin' hoes like I'm hittin' licks
But I don't love that trick bitch
'Cause bitches gettin' niggaz dick sick
I don't pay pay rent, my rent gets paid
I pimp hoes like silky train
On and on it goes
I thought thete muthafuckas knew, but now you know
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch

1975 I was just a young pup
Tryin' to learn to be a dogg
But in the process steadily gettin' fucked
I met this lil' sexie dame y'all before I knew
All the rules to the game
It ain't no need to lie
A lil' nigga like me got played, and if she left me
I thought I'd die
Y'all don't ask, I don't the reason why
Thought she was sent from the heavens above
Y'all it's just a bad taste of puppy love
Puppy Love
Puppy Love
Puppy love
Puppy love
Sometimes I sit and think of how I used to be
Before I got converted to a D-O-double G
I'd like to thank that girl

If something don't smell right, what can I spray?
Tec-9 incense, say for instance
See you in the distance, hit 'em in an instant
We so crummy, countin' mo' money
But stay strapped up like crash test dummies
Put 3 to ya tummy, 2 to ya throat
And bulletproof cars, we ride like the pope
Just in case, you don't make it home
You better super glue grip the chrome

Sometimes I wonder did I tell you
How much I really love you
I know I'll get another chance to
When I'm standin right beside you (right back where you are)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm selfish
But if God would give me one wish
I'd wish you back into this world with
Me so I could be back (right back where you are)
What a wonderful day
When my troubles are erased and
I'm so tired of waitin
My God I'll be facin
That wonderful day
My heart starts to racin
No more attempts at payin'
Standin next to my savior, and (right back where you are)

I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love
When they asked me
Why I don't like love
Or why I don't have a lady
Maybe its because I know
As soon as I tell her
How I feel about her
As soon as I act like
I love her she's gone
I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (is why I don't have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love
I really was so into you
But you don't know what I'm going through
You say you really care for me
But in love there's no guarantee
So, I think I outta take my time
'Cause love ain't no friend of mine you see
Don't let me get you too confused
You're the friend I don't want to lose
If I made a choice it's you I choose
But my heart's a tad bit through
So, I try to get you off my mind
But a remedy I cannot find for you
I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (is why I don't have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love
I'm never gonna try to find
Another I'm just out for mine
I left so many far behind
But traces they'll never find
No, I can cover all my tracks (all my tracks)
Wont be nothing gettin' back to you
Now don't think that I'm being rude
Because I won't commit to you
And other women want to screw
What's a player supposed to do
So, I'll be slippin on my hat
I won't be bringin' nothing back to you
I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (that's why I don't have a lady)
I'm just a man

While y'all see her as a broad dude, I see her as food
Take her back up to the bar to get her cigerette lit
I told her, ""I be buyin liqour like it Shh..""
She told me I'm a player motherfuu...
Forget about it, she know the scam
And now she belly dancin to that Indian Jam
So hell, I'm a let her get a little more buzzed
Till she starts to get to slurrin and forget where she was
Take her purse out to her buddy car, back to the bar
For another round of drinks with a pla-ti-num star
I'm gettin' conceded, a lil bit, the game owe me
I've been humble since my first hit, but back to baby
I'm a rub her on the belly, make her scoot down the couch
Look her right up in her eyes, and take some food out her mouth, She want it

The first time I ever saw her, I couldn't look her in her face
I tried hard to ignore her, but I couldn't walk away
When I finally got the courage, I couldn't think of what to say
To make a long story shorter, I better bust a different way
I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She was kinda cavi to me
Had some nigga hangin' on, I sent that busta home
And now she ridin' with me... THERE SHE GOES!"

Before I let go...
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound
Daz-
Everyday, the 45 stays I'm jackin for whoever
I bustin' takin' now bowin' down never
Gotta watch my back for these coppers
As well as these niggaz that I kick it with
They stick you faster than these bitches will
Since I'm pimpin' everybody wants my riches
And I can't keep the Don from buying weed actin' every time
I smoke constantly and can't flinch me
From committin the murders so I chill and puff the herb
Who gots my back nobody
Little John Gotti's layin niggaz down at the homey's party
All be goin' crazy I guess we are bein who we are
Really say the nigga gotta be a star
I gots to get mine and if I blast then it's my destiny
If I die then it was meant to be intentionally
Worry stressin I'm guessin no confession
When the murder take place set yourself protection
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound"
56,Where Are You Going?,1998,G-Funk Classics (1998),,Nate Dogg,"(Feat. Pamela Hale)
People where are you going
People where are you going
Everybody wants to play the game
But nobody wants to lose
I see my people die everyday
That's why I sing the blues
Now tell me who wants to roll with me
Take a look at my world
I see some problems
Maybe you can help me solve them
Turn boys to men
And make women from girls
I see my loved ones turning to drugs
Almost everyday I lose another one
Where are you going I ask you one and all
Anyone can answer
I betcha' they don't know
People where are you going
People where are you going
What if I could save my nation
What if I could save my friends
If I had the whole worlds attention
What if people were really listening
I would tell them that I'm no good without them
I would tell them together we can stand
Another message to brothers, colors bother
I'd introduce them to the hardest man in town
Somebody tell me please
People where are you going
People where are you going
Where are you going I ask you one and all
Anyone can answer
I betcha' they don't know
People where are you going
People where are you going"
57,Who's Playin' Games?,1998,G-Funk Classics (1998),,Nate Dogg,"Just in case you didn't know, I blow (I blow)
Constantly for dough
I'm sittin' next to my heat (my heat)
Fuck peace, as I listen to the beat
We came to rock your body, ding ding dong
We came to rock your body, all night long
We came to rock your body, ding ding dong
We came to rock your body, all night long
Way back in the days when the hottest thang was Jheri curls
When you could always spot a gangsta
By the way his hair out grew his girl's
There lived a little boy who wore khakis everyday
He never would be broke he swore, always to get paid
Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie
Got them same ol' gangsta ways
Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie
And I ain't the one to get played"
58,Your Wife,2001,Music & Me (2001),,Nate Dogg,"{Chorus: Nate Dogg}
Your wife, my bitch
Your love, my trick
Her mouth, my dick
I fucked, that's it
{Verse One: Nate Dogg}
All night long, I had her on her back in my Cadillac bro
You should of heard her moan, same old song
I made her throw her back out when I sent her home
For better or worse she's
{Chrous: Nate Dogg}
Your wife, my bitch
Your love, my trick
Her mouth, my dick

Straight pimp, no shit
Gave me your chips
I drove, your whip
It's true don't trip
{Verse Two: Dr. Dre}
What's my name, my name is Mr. Game
West coast big change Mr. Fame
Bad bitch scooped her up same ole same
Fuckin' in the drivers seat while I'm switching lanes
Gettin' brains Long Beach, Compton thang
Shit ain't changed that's how we do the damn thang
Draws down nuts platinum, let em' hang
Wife missin' 5 a. m., who's to blame
I'm the reason used maginum is in your range
And while she bounced out wit me befor you came
Fuckin' lame you be handcuff sluts I banged
I ain't trippin' take em' back shit my nuts is drained
On everything this dick is shootin novocain
Have a bitch waitin bus stop, in the rain
Simple and plain 'cause we's be off the chain
My Nigga Nate Dogg pimp game please explain
{Verse Three: Nate Dogg}
Ring or no ring
A hoe gone be a hoe
While you sleepin'

Comin' to met me, at the honey comb
Smokin' and drinkin' dyin' to please me
While real playas keep playin' on
{Bridge: Nate Dogg}
Playas playin' on play on

59,Your Woman Has Just Been Sighted (Ring the Alarm),2001,Music & Me (2001),,Nate Dogg,"(Jermaine Dupri)
C'mon
Dance with me baby girl (x2)
C'mon
Dance with me baby girl (x2)
(Verse 1: Nate Dogg)
Man I was dancing, prancing, laughing, bouncing, swinging
Moving, grooving, cause the music's booming
Macking, tryna get some action, packing, acting
Manish, drinking, tweaking, winking, peeping
Seeking a freak for the evening, really feeling way too horny
Reaking from the weed I'm token, choking, smoking, real doping, hoping
My nights wide open, knowing that my girl my girls at home
Snoring, boring, ignoring, warning that my girl was coming
Sudden mood interuption, busted my girl in the club
Ring the alarm (oh oh)
Your woman has just been sighted (uh)
Ring the alarm
How'd she get in if she wasn't invited? (I dunno)
Ring the alarm
She's headed this way like lighting (yeah)
Ring the alarm
I'm not tryna be ducking and diving (c'mon)
Ring the alarm
(Verse 2: Nate Dogg)
Headed, top speed for the exit
Damnit don piece can't grab it
Habbit like chassing my cabbage
Magic, time to disappear fast with
This chick, who I sleeped last week with
Real trick, I like her 'cause she real slick
Let's dip, I don't care who you came with
No lip, got no time for some bullshit
She went, that she all in the backpen
Time spent, now it's time to hit the pavement
Two sense, got no time for your comments
Don't trip, do you know where my girl went?
(Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri)
Listen, I'm in the club, no where I ain't even suppose to be
Drinking with a girl all close to me
I'm all up in the air, telling her some superfly shit she need to hear
Thinking can't nobody see us 'cause we in the rear
All I'm tryna do is get a number then I'm up out of here
Cause my girl ain't home, she out with a friend
Ita be just my luck this the spot they in
Not the place for her to spot me in
You know specially when I'm suppose to be at the studio
I take one step, what do I see my girl coming threw the door but she don't see me
Now I'm ducking, now I'm dodgeing, hiding, praying to god that she don't come find me
What was I thinking of, I should have never parked my car in front of the club damn!
