0,409,1987,Rhyme Pays (1987),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"It's time to start the party if y'all don't mind
Me and ""E"" clean our Adidas with 409
He rocks the highs, I dog the bass
Ya wanna hear us rock?
Here's a taste!
Every day I make a sandwich with ham and cheese
Use miracle whip, I don't like mayonnaise
I eat a can of beans, good for my heart
About 1 a.m., I always...
Far from me to bite anothers rhyme
They're just too easy to write
I do'em two at a time
Like doggin' the wax and ya don't quit
And if you didn't like that then suck my...
Dictations how I write my raps
Cold maxin' with two freaks upon my lap
Chillin' on the phone, bookin' more def shows
An' if the freaks get illy I smack the...
Whole days of my life are spent inside my bed
Just maxin' an' relaxin' like I'm at club med
Ya say you like this record, you think it's fun?
Party people get stupid we just begun!
(Break)
You're get, get, gettin' real stupid
As the beat hits your body get ill!
You ain't dumb you paid dollars to party go off!
The girl you're dancin' with has got great hips bug out!
Go on homeboy and grab her...
Tape recorder turn up the bass
No time to waste just dog the place
R-R-R-Rocket like a missile in space
Evil E keeps his 1200s in an anvil case
We fly T.W.A., Pan Am, P.S.A
To places close to home, far away
L.A., New York, Detroit, Miami
If I see a girl and like her then I let her see my...
Jam rockin's how I got my fame, Ice capital T
Evil E's his name
If you can't see who's rockin' you must be blind
You better clean your gazelles with some 409!
Go Ice get busy (x2)
Go Evil Get busy (X2)
Turn up your stereo, equalize treble
Bass be kickin' stupid hard as metal
On the mic tonight that's right your rhyme opponent
M.C. Ice-T just microphonin'
33 and 1/3 revolutions per minute
This record is def because my heart is in it
Vocals laid by the Ice, tempos tight and precise
Special effects will be created by an editor's splice
The funk is in it, ya dig it so stop that frontin'
Bust a move to my groove work your body do somethin'
No way in the world that you can deny my method
As my record rotates, my words get more impressive
I'm an M.C., Evil's my DJ on Sire Records not M.C.A.
C.B.S., Capitol, 'cause they move too slow
Now Sire/Warner Bros. clocks all the dough
As the record revolves money's gettin' made
A.S.C.A.P. pays me every time it's played
I chill in def leathers pure silks and suede
And the gold around my neck will never fade
Down with my Syndicate organized rhyme
Kickin' def tempos that I design
And if you can't hear'em that's such a crime
You better wash your dirty ears with some 409
I always rhyme elite, stay on beat
Travel in a posse when I walk the street
Loved to say my rhymes when I used to max
Now I don't speak much, I save my words for wax
I just wanna make a little point in this song
With a little nonsense we can all get along and on and on
Till the break'a break of dawn
This jam will never play out because the grooves too strong
Guys grab a girl, girls grab a guy
If a guy wants a guy, please take it outside
I wanna make ya enjoy yourself
On the mic tonight Ice-T!Who else?
Evil's on the cuts, Henry Gee's shot gun
Islam's my producer, Bambattas son
Bronx Style Bob's cold watchin' my back
Melle Mel's just layin' for some punks to act wack
Grandmaster Caz and Donald D, Scott La Rock
Red Alert, Chuck Chill Out
If you're down with my crew you will be fine
But if you ill we'll get dirty-bring your 409!

409..."
1,6 'n The Mornin',1987,Rhyme Pays (1987),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"6'n the morning' police at my door
Fresh adidas squerk across the bathroom floor
Out the back window I make a escape
Don't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music but happy 'cause I'm free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Gotta knot in my pocket weighin' at least a grand
Gold on my neck my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip hop beats
But just livin' in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted
Didn't have the time to ask
-Word-
Seen my homeboys coolin' way out told 'em bout my mornin'
Cold bugged' 'em out shot allmenn little dice until my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories 'bout the night before
Possed to the corner where the fly girls chill
Through action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started actin' stupid simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to here hoe continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the god damn street
But just livin' in the city a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her didn't have time to ask
-Word-
Continued clockin' freaks with emcee posterior
Rollin' in allmenn blazer with a louie interior
Solid gold the ride was raw
Bust allmenn left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e-sean was the driver Known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin' off like a high school bell
Looked in the mirror what did we see?
Fuckin' blue lights L.A. P.D.
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found allmenn uzi, 44 and a handgranade
Threw us in the county high power block
No freaks to see no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the shit must fly
Squabbled this sucker shanked' 'em in the eye
But livin' in the county is a serious task
Niga didn't know what happened
Didn't have time to ask
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track
Told me E's rollin' Villain - BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant - Nat C's clockin' Dough
Be bop's a pimp. My old freaks a hoe
The batter rams rollin' rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowely and Hen had to grin
He said Man you out early we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy- He didn't waste time to ask
-Word-
I bought a Benz with the money the rest went to clothes
Went to the strip strted pimpin' the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
I didn't want no trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew some ounks got loud
Shot gun blasts echoed throug the crowd
Six punks hit two punks died
All casualities appiled to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were - No one had the time to ask
-Word-
Part Two
Swat team leader yelled hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my 44
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the back door like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us They musta been Blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadn't done nothin' but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn god damn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldn't shot us on sight
They wouldn't took time to ask
-Word-
The rollers gave chase at a serious speed
One more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real
This was no La-Di-Da-Di
Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doin' 60 one police car spun
And all I was thinkin' was murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my vrew we're gone into the night
Broke to my old lady's who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened
Didn't care Didn't ask
-Word-
Qwe made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie a natural freak
She ran her tonuge over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my amadeus as I watched TV
A technican with a mission that's what she was
If there had been a crowd she would of got an applause
This girl did everything on earth to me that could be done
The she backed off and teased me so I couldn't come
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me beggin' to stop as I was acreamin' for more
After she waxed by body she let me crash
She knew her lovin' was def
She didn't waste time to ask
-Word-
Up the next mornin' feelin' good as hell
Sleepin' with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my A.M.G.
Hoe's catchin' whiplash tryin' to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile yes celluar
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red Some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smkin' came
Told me to meet him at the airporrt
Said he's jumpin' bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smokin' in a serious dash
Didn't know where we were going.
Didn't care Didn't ask
-Word-
Fell a sleep on the plane and so did he
Woke up chillin' in N.Y.C.
Called up my posse when I got there
Hit the Latin qarter Union Square
Rooftop Devil's nest the rest we passed
Back doored the Palladium just for class
About 4 am we crashed the deuce
We never catch static 'cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shoot out jumped off mine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a mac 10 blast
But it was 6'in the mornin'
We didn't wake up to ask...

Put my dick in their mouth
Take it out and I ski on 'em

Problem number one is gettin' money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nothing
'Cause I ain't offering
I go hard on my bitches 'cause I'm never never softening
Putting demands on em
Fuck 'em then scram on 'em
The wham bam thank you ma'am game just ran on 'em

Getting pussy is just another expense
If pussy pays the bills
Then dick pays the rent

3,Addicted To Danger,1993,Home Invasion (1993),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"""Yo what's up man? Yeah I gotta trunk fulla this shit
Word, broads still with me man, comin' over to grapevine right now
Yo I can't talk right now man, I gotta get off this phone""
Damn, how'd I get into this scam
Roll in a car with the trunk worth 5000 grand
I came up from the curb, word
First thing it rocks, now my ride's packin crazy birds
I gotta freak in the front seat
She got crazy game, might even have more than me
And that's why I don't trust, I ain't no busta
One wrong move and I'll dust her
But she knows that, keeps a gat
Works much plastic, always stays on phat
She said she loves me
Looks deep in my eyes, sometimes cries, all lies
She only loves my cash flow, long dough
The falso love of a pimp and a hoe
But me and her gotta job to do
Get this luggage back to the crew
She got scanner, I hadta listen to the pigs talk
And if they speakin' about us then its jumpin' off
But I ain't sweatin them at all
2 cops'll roll up and 2 cops'll fall
The lines on the highway, I'm makin' my mind drift away
To my last jail stay
5 years for a 459
I'm never goin' back, no matter what the crime
Surrenderin ain't me
Fuck that, I'm holdin' court in the street G
For a nigga like me there ain't no ounce
My life filled with drug busts and shoot outs
Pure ghetto anger, pure ghetto anger
Pure ghetto anger, I'm addicted to danger
Some nights I crash clubs
Rollin' with the posse made of well-known thugs
Cool out with the freaks
Truckin much jewels, beggin for beef
Thens some niggaz roll up
Lookin' for a way to pump the reps up
But I ain't the one
I'm handin out beat downs, no need for guns
Sometimes I gotta ask myself
Is all this buck whylin good for a niggaz health?
I don't know why
Am I suicidal, do I wanna die?
The answerin, simple
A headache throbs in my temple
It says it ain't fair, it says it ain't right
It says its goin' down tonight
We finally made it to the drop spot
King and Weston Ave, snoody fox
The posse was there, but it ain't right
Fuckin' police lights
It's all goin' down that road blocks
I never seen that many cops
It was a setup, my whole damn crew's gettin' wet up
Big time, some motherfucker dropped a dime
But even in the flurry of gun shots
My adrenaline was boilin hot
I crash down on the floor of the ride
Punch the gas, drove that benz through they punk ass
Hit Vernor doin' 90
Looked in the rear-view, no one behind me
I got on the phone
Called up the homies to see what went wrong
But no time to sweat that
I still gotta trunk fulla shit, I was on phat
I just need a cool place to hide
Dumped the benzo, slammed the G ride
Me and a freak hit a motel crash spot
The streets was hot
Rubbed me down, said she adored me
Said the gunfire made her horny
The she pushed me back on the bed
Licked me head to toe, toe to head
Then I closed my eyes real slowly
Is this love? No not me
Then I felt a pain in my chest
The smell of gun powder and burnt flesh
I looked in her face, opened my mouth
And then her badge came out"
4,Ain't a Damn Thing Changed,1993,Home Invasion (1993),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Ban me? Try it
You might cause a riot
What the radio won't play the underground will supply it
I'm a MC pirate, this loud not quiet
Radical as they make, they make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise, some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
Cops hate kids and kids hate cops
Cops kill kids with warning shots
What is crime and what is not?
What is justice? I think I forgot
Squeeze the trigger, 1986
Ain't a damn thing changed motherfucker"
5,Always Wanted To Be A Ho,1999,The Seventh Deadly Sin (1999),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"This goes out to all you ladies out there.
A lot of you won't grow up to be lawyers or doctors,
But you have a dream. And I think you should follow your dream.
When you was just a little girl, you used to love nice things
Pretty party dresses, candy and rings
You was your Momma's little angel, Daddy's little girl
They used to fix your hair up in pretty ribbons and curls
Your sex drive was much deeper than the rest of the girls
You used to freak your boyfriends, take them 'round the world
As a teen, you didn't like school that much
Your moms drank, your daddy likes to cuddle and touch
Too much, so you hit the street looking for love
Affection and devotion, met none of the above
Met me in the club working your fake id
Looked me in the face like a slave set free
I said walk into my eyes baby, come with me
I can show you things that you dream to see
Take you off the street get you something to eat
Something nice to wear and a place to sleep
My name is Ice, I'm the nicest guy you're ever gonna meet
Tell me what you want, I'll make your life complete
She said, I always wanted to be a ho
I always wanted to be a ho
You just had to find the player that was right for you,
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true
The first thing we're gonna do is buy yourself a new dress
Take some pictures, put you in the LA Express
Teach you how to walk in some high heeled shoes
Let you strut your stuff by the House of Blues
Or farther down Sunset where the tricks all cruise
""Are you my pimp?""
Oh dear God don't say that
I'm your manager, your boyfriend, you're agent, your mack
Now I'm a do my hair baby, I'll be right back
Because we gotta look good when we hits the track
Now your real name? ""Shirl""
Yeah, we gotta change that
I think I'll call you Apple, cause your ass is kinda fat
How old are you? ""16""
Well that's just right
But you're 18 if anybody asks tonight
I'm a teach you how to get this long paper right
Catch a trick, suck his dick, break his ass for life
'Cause I love you, that's all you really need to know
I'm 'bout to miss my hair appointment, girl I got to go
She said, I always wanted to be a ho
I always wanted to be a ho
You just had to find the player that was right for you,
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true
""Now what if I meet a trick that got long cash?""
That's when I call the crew with the black ski masks
But right now we'll only worry 'bout the basic stroll
Hooking up my Cadillac, and upping my gold
A hundred for a full hit, 50 for a hand
Throw in a blow job, they'll fuck off grands
I may even put you where the real johns at
Some call the strip club, I call the indoor track
They got lap dancers, table dancers, mad back rooms
And you can double up your profit if you take them home
""I wanna be the best""
Well this game's the test
G-string bikinis and silicone breasts
Suckas break themselves just to sniff your nest
And if you get tired, I got crystal meth
""I think I'm in love...""
Baby doll it's on
You were made for me baby, since the day you were born
You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true
Yeah baby, we gonna do a lot of beautiful things for each other
You know what I'm saying?
We gonna get me a new car
We gonna get me some better jewelry
Some nicer rags, you know what I'm saying?
We gonna help each other out, you know what I'm saying?
We gonna get me a new pad, you know?
Maybe get me a Rolex
We gonna do a lot of things for each other, it's gonna be beautiful
Me and you
I love you baby
We gonna put a whole lot of money in my pocket
That's what we gonna do. You are so cute in that dress
That's right
Damn, go on,
Get your ass out there and do something right quick for a player
Yeah I love you, get your fucking ass out there
I love you, get the fuck out... aiite..."
6,Bitches 2,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"I once knew this brother
Who I thought was cool with me
Chilled out together
Even went to school with me
Fly nigga, my ace boon coon
Used to low ride together
Shot dice in the bathroom
Ya want trouble?
Well trouble ya found
'Cause we diss ya, then issue
The critical beat down
He needed money I would always come through
Needed a car?
He could use mine too
But bust this!
Out on the street
People say he was riffin'
Callin' me a sucker
Talkin' bout how foul I'm livin'
Someone heard him
Poppin' that shit last week
Frontin' for some pussy
From some big butt freak
Sayin' I'm his worker I was on his dick!
Talkin' that craazy old weak assed shit and after all of that
She still walked away
How ya gonna diss your boy
To get some play?
And when I stepped to him about it
He said, ""Who snitched?"" [CHORUS]
Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' 'bout you
Cause some of you niggas
Is bitches too! I knew this brother named
Mitch
Stone player
He meet a girl, in five min. he lay her
Trucked crazy jewels
Hands smothered in ice
Been to prison not once, but twice
Kept a stupid thick posse
Made of thugs and
Crooks and hoods and vet hustlers
Who were up to no good
But they all stood behind him and watched his back
That's the only way
To roll on the track
But yo,
Mitch got rushed by feds last week
The snatchbared the runk
Of his white
Corniche
Took a look inside
And what did they see?
Two keys, and a gallon of
PCP!
Oh shit!
The thought crashed
Mitch's subliminal
Three strikes, that's called
Habitual criminal
So insted of goin' under
He snitched on his whole posse
Maxed at the crib
And sipped
Martini and
Rossi
Sold out his whole crew
That rat named
Mitch [CHORUS] I knew this guy
That was never that fly
Couldn't act cool
Even when he tried
When we played rough
He always cried
When he told stories, he always lied
Black brother
Who was missin' the cool part
He had the color
But was missin' the true heart
When we would fight
He would always go down quick
So he took karate and he still got his ass kicked
But now he's married
And he kicks his wife's ass
Says it comes from problems
That he had in the past
Doesn't like
Blacks
Claims he's upper class
Joined the police, got himself a badge
Now he rolls the streets and he's cut to jack
Doggin' young brothers
'Cause they usually don't fight back
Got a
White partner
And he asked for that and every night
Another head they crack
So now he's big man
But he really ain't shit! [CHORUS]
Out one night with my crew and some new kid I didn'T know homeboy, but
Evil
E did
So I thought he was cool
We rode in his ride
Rag top tray on
Daytons
Lifted side to side
We hit the party deep
Niggas was hawkin' me
You could feel the vibe
Of thick artillery
Parliament was on, some
O.G. shit I put my back to the wall
And felt my pistol grip al of a sudden
Niggas started trippin'
Flippin', the record started skippin'
Wildin', fools started locn up
Gats cracked
The room started smokin' up
Me and ""E"" hit the floor
And then the back door
My boys let off an automatic encore
But when we made it out to the ride
It was gone, we had to shoot it out
Side by side
Punk left us there to die in a ditch! [CHORUS]"

8,Body Count,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"God damn, what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red, white and blue
What? I gotta die? Before you realize
I was a brother with open eyes
The world's insane
While you drink champagne
And I'm livin' in black rain
You try to ban the A.K.
I got ten of 'em stashed
With a case of hand grenades
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
You'd know what to do
If a bullet hit your kid
On the way to school
Or a cop shot your kid in the back yard
Shit would hit the fan and hit hard!
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts
On with the body count!
God damn what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red, white and you?
What? I gotta die? Before you realize
I was a nigga with open eyes
The world's insane
While you drink champagne
And I'm livin' in black rain
Don't you hear the guns?
You stupid, dumb, dick suckin'
Bum politicians
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
The tension mounts!"
9,CJ Mac Interlude,1999,The Seventh Deadly Sin (1999),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"(CJ Mac)
I still sell around the club, grips and bloods and hoodrats, all around me
Ain't nobody guards, but ain't nobody tryin' to clown me
Hehe, my ass motherfucker try an' test
Last six days your whole gay crew, buyin' vests and ass bets
Hit it like DeNiro and Pacino gettin' head like I'm Little Nickie
Play the ""Casino"", greedy bitches gettin' blown like Sharon gettin' stoned
But this ain't no fuckin' movie, ain't nobody yellin' ""cut"" and gettin' up
Fuck the bullshit, I pull quick and unload
Leave a nigga ass - bumpy like a toad
And stay trippin', accused of crippin'
And ain't the Nine shit that stay flyin' by in six-hundred giant shit
Ooh wee, look at me, keep it rollin' and I remember
Back when my draws were stolen, but valued to keep it ballin'
Fuck you and a nigga tryin' to speak
Realsome player shit ain't too played out to get deep - motherfucker!"
10,Check Your Game,1999,The Seventh Deadly Sin (1999),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"It's 99 players check your game
Make sure them young boys respect your name
Keep your heaters at close reach cocked and ready
Cause the streets will catch you slipping, rock ya steady
Watch your back with your homies that you feel is real
Your homeboys from your crew, yeah them the ones that do you
The suckas that got the player hater venom
I wanna take 'em outside and lay some slugs up in em
(King T)
When they need work
They call the cali drug expert
Smashing in a six hundred dollar bill burnt
Looking flossy living costly
Off the edge, out of state
They gots to break bread, for sho
I needs mo' ice drops for the lexo
Briggetts sets blow when I'm sipping the mo'
Freelancing, trying to build a mansion
And stay faded
Have hoes walk around my crib butt naked...
(Ice-T)
True, pop the remy kick back and let the players represent
High floss true boss game and take aim
These sucka wannabe's
Nigga please - you're green
I'll bend hoes on the downlow - banks obscene
Wanna chill with these niggas, bet you wish you could
And suck game out my ass like sponges
I run this
You can't fuck with the steelo
You niggas wanna be low
When I'm on the east I play ceelo
Cash flow
One track mind serial hustler
Quick to break a buster ya snitch bitch?
I'll dust ya
Bentley ballin' bastard
No hustler faster
Game maker
I knock a white bitch and break her
(King T)
But Ice, Chronic got me bruising my brain
But soothing my pain, I'm true to the game
I got my mind made I gotta be that rich motherfucker
Set it up so my grandkids don't suffer
The phat hummer
The phat drummer - what's your choice?
Trying to find a sister with a voice
Make her moist
I'm throwing up the W
Bringing trouble to
Those in sight
King T and Big Ice
(Ice-T)
But T that's trippin' and that ain't my sport
I'd rather lamp in my crib and flip the Robb report
And set my v-dozen on the streets
Bump my beats
'Cause when I'm twisting my dubs
Can't nobody compete
Imagine this:
A hundred G 'lex on your wrist
Imagine this:
About ten karrots on your fist
Imagine this:
All dime hoes on your list
Ha - that shit would be nice
But your name ain't ""Ice"" - kid...
I'll screw the silencer on - rock you softly
How you gonna step to me kid? You grew up off me
TV, Movies, and Records and Tours
So many busters wearing Versace I don't wear it no more...
(King T)
But this will be a classic
Many facets to get that ass kicked
The alcoholic Don, call me King Tragic
Watch me speak the magic
Watch me teach that old habit - full of havoc
And Ice'll tweak the mix when it statics
People pay
Just to have me stay
And say a verse
I'll freak a couple words unrehearsed
Then I burst
I mean I bust
From all angles
Guarunteed platium on your single
(Ice-T)
Yo T, I really must admit I'm blessed
Master V does some other shit TV's in the head rests
Never wear no vests because I got mad love
I catch respect when other niggas catch slugs
1, 2 I bust shit to load guns to
Beats for the hoodlums
Somebody's gotta do'em
Fed's screw 'em
Faggot's got my whole crib bugged
Mad tapps on the phone 'cause I deal with the thugs
Drugs? never
No, the Ice is too clever
I'm overseas
Checkin' G's
Nigga please
Ballin' since the 70's - yeah baby
Blew up in the 80's
Now you niggas hate me
You can't see me motherfucker your focus is off
You can't be me motherfucker, you're broke and you're soft
Too many niggas try to pert my lifestyle - romancing
I was kickin game while them kids was breakdancing
Overlord - so why the wack niggas ain't dead?
Probably because my aim is over nigga's heads
East coast - west coast, I play the whole map and bounce
They got a benz but live in their mom's house...
(King T)
To all my G's rock on
Get your ride on - when you hear it
The forbidden Gangland lyric
Player Haters fear it
Get you right up close near it
Possessed by the Eazy-E spirit
Ice-T set the limit
And niggas won't cross this line
Suicide - and niggas won't cross this nine
In your mouth
Puffin' with my niggas down south
What the fuck this really all about? man...
I'm coming out
Front and back, 98 brougham
All you fake G's stay home
Leave that shit alone
King Tee's back on the throne
And that nigga on the mic - straight gone
Cra-zy, y'all niggas wanna know the real deal?
I'll freestyle and smack you in your grill
Bomb lyrics, no special effects or gimmicks
The Syndicate will put you in the mix - biatch..."
11,Check Your Heart,1999,The Seventh Deadly Sin (1999),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Yo Ice - We heard what happened man
We heard some niggas ran in on you man
Yeah yeah, shit was fucked up man, it was real fucked up
Don't worry - We know who did it
What're you talkin' about man?
The shit just happened like 3 hours ago
Yeah - but we know who did it man... it was your boy
What? Naugh man I'm not trying to hear that
Yo listen man, it was your boy man - He talks a lot
I can't believe this shit man, I grew up with this nigga man
This motherfucker, I would've died for this nigga man
And this nigga set me up?
You're now fucking with your last nigga
Quick to blast nigga
Gauge Masturbator
Chest Plate disintegrator, rider
I never wore no mask, wacked the witness - vestless
I'll put you on the graveyard's guest list
ICE - 'cause I lack all emotions, I'm heartless
That's why I can't figure for the life of me
You'd want to start this
My crew is bottomless
Street Lobotomists
Gun slingers
Glock cocked and diamond ringers
Hustlers
My nigga got shot but still alive
He took a full clip from another player's 25
And he said he's rolling with me, if you're coming
I told him, stay home, rest up, I got enough gunning
Homiciders
Ballin' rag Rolls riders
Blood letters
Money getters
Life betters
The last thing I heard you say you said I was a dead man, bitch
I'll put you right into gun point, you snitch
Now I know your plans are rolling on me, late when I sleep
Why don't we do this man to man? Let them bitch niggas creep
I still remember in the days when we was friends chillin'
Now it seems you going to have to be my next killin'
You wanna go to war, nigga tell me why?
Punk niggas talk shit, bitch niggas die
I never backed down and it ain't no time to start
Let's take it to the streets and I'm a check your heart
You must be death wishing, what's up? You know my steelo
Got love with the illest of blacks and amigos
Your jealousy is outta hand, I can't fuck wit'cha
And all your so-called down niggas, say good luck to ya
They know you're off the hook and you're soon to bleed
My reputation states that I kills with speed
More drama than a rap verse
You'll feel the mack first
In your back first
Then the black hearse
Goddamn, I can't understand the drama why?
To tell the fucking truth I thought your crew was fly
Now you're talking that shit like a bitch on the rag
Don't give a fuck about your set or the pants you sag
I drop a hot one in your forehead, neck and mouth
Then rush a hospital and bank ya if you don't check out
'Cause I'm a mad nigga once, a crazy nigga twice
A cold blooded motherfucker, that's why they call me ICE
And if you told me this would happen
I would said never - no, we down forever - we flipped keys together
Now the street talkers say you want my spot
A lotta niggas did, A lotta niggas shot
It's obvious some sucka niggas got ya gassed
Let's see if they around you when the gunshots blast
It ain't nothing nice, letting off slugs under the street life
Early deaths, dry gags and last breaths
I seen your time before you want - war till it's on
How to fuck with the king, when you're a bullshit pawn?
I can't comprehend your stupidity, miscalculation
Word to obstetricians show your crews anhiliation
Predicted, Brains get evicted, Fuckin' with me kid
Bullets lift your lid
And watch your weak kool aid heart run down the drain
I got the Method Man who came to bring the pain
Let you know quick, niggas suck dick if you trip
Used to be my homie, now you just a punk ho bitch
Frustration leads to aggravation and dismay
Now you're player haten, but that's the wrong game to play
I light your block up, kidnap your moms - snatch your woman
You beg for me to stop, but I'll just keep coming
You're fucking with the illest fool in Southern California
I can roll with ya, or motherfuckin' on ya
Yeah, I know the real nigga can feel this.
This is dedicated to all my ""friends"""
12,Common Sense,1999,The Seventh Deadly Sin (1999),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"It starts like this
Gats hit harder than fists
Just cock and lick it
The aftermath's wicked
Brass gets evicted
Another crew shot
Can't put your strap back in your waist
Cause your barrel's too hot
You did it kid
The more dead
The more weight on your head
Plus you ganked a suitcase
Full of black tar H
Baby boy, twenty keys
Dead Colombian Gs
Now you're ballin full speed
One slip you bleed
You had your nigga with you
Hard rock street gorilla hitter
He took a hot one in the shoulder
Now he's bendin over
Mad illegal
Nigga flipped harder than Buggsy Segal
He wet the room up with the rocket launchin
Desert eagle
Blood oozin through his black dickies
Ya nigga say he's getting dizzy
The car seat's fuckin' getting sticky
He leaned back, his whole chest plate's cracked
You thought they hit him once
He must of got double clapped
Your niggas dyin' but he ain't cryin
Soldier no doubt
He looked you dead in the eye
Said ""get that money"" checked out
Ballin bent him back in the black
S T S but where he's going no stress
Your niggas dead, but you're thinkin' bout head
Fly hoes and condos
Once you flip the kilos
The fact your niggas out ain't shit to ya
More profit for your greedy ass
No one to split the grip wit ya
Common sense will keep you safer than vests
Ambulance, cots, cause real niggas give head shots
LA streets will make your guts leak
Player no doubt
Young killers live for drug wars and shoot outs
You flipped your chip
Motorola, called your hooker
Said you had a little foul up
Told the ho to wet some towels up
She didn't even talk
Clicked the phone off
Might a new some weak niggas
But this bitch ain't soft
Make your next call
Straight to your chicano connect
Said they would flip the boy for girl
Up the weight, give you Peruvian flake
You had to dump the body,
Burned it beyond recognition
Back back in commission
Scooped your hooker, cleaned your seats off
Squeezed off
Two in her head
Now the fuckin' bitch is dead
You're all alone just how you liked it
Straight laced hustler from hell
Street life you spiked it
It's time to hook up with the mexicanos
Layin in the Dooly parking lot of a McDonalds
Hit the corner they was there
You're prepared
Circled the block, screwed your silencer on
Rock the esse they had
Kickin back to get ya
Crept on the dropped truck
Double crossin ducks got bucked
Check the back of the cab
Suckas had the fuckin' math
Ten more keys of uncut pure cash (Yes!)
Now your weighin thirty full keys
Of girl and the pony
Jumped for your lack
Hit the yack threw your head back
The big time is what you wanted
And now you got it
The devil put the strap in your palm
And you shot it
It's going down now
On forever
Square life is never
Buck wildin is your life stylin
Mashed out
Hit a motel room
Crashed out
Called up a ho to get your dick sucked though
Bad bitch phat backs green contacts
Real hair, kept her feet all night in the air
Kind of square
Said she only worked the streets a week
Said her boyfriend kicked her out
And she needed to eat
She cuddled to you like a baby
Keep the girl mabey
The pussy was tighter than fuck drove you crazy
She kissed you on your chest and legs
Asked you to fuck her in the ass
Then she started to beg
It kind of got you open, no doubt
When baby doll fell asleep, with your dick in her mouth
Now you're layin there, lookin' at the motel door
Hand on your strap, some beautiful whore
You fuckin' relaxed, fell a fuckin' sleep bad move
Big game take little game, show and prove
Baby jumped up, went for the strap
Dumped off
Three shots in your face
Grabbed the sutcase
Don't forget, grab the blow then jet
Before that ho hit the door she sipped a glass of Moet
Street life sabatoge
Niggas wanna live large
Demon ho out for cheddar
Capped you with your own Berreta"

With a bullet and a smile)"
14,Dear Homie,1996,VI: Return of the Real (1996),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"(Hen-Gee)
Dear Homie, what's the hap, since your up in the sky?
With God by your side
Homie what's it like?
I know your bein' treated right
No more worries
Plus you're bein heard G
I guess you know niggaz is still trippin'
I don't know why, they see a future in it
We're headed for self-destruction
Can't function
Only thing I can do is pray
And thank God, for another day
Yes Homie, it's rough down here. I gotta watch my back
'Cause it's hard being black
If it ain't the other
It's my own colour
Tryin' to work me
Tryin' to hurt me
Ain't no L-O-V-E
Please tell me why, Dear Homie
(Ice-T)
Dear Homie, gang-bangin' ain't joke
And I'm lookin' over ya loc
Always knew there was fools out to get me
I didn't even hear the gunshots till after the slugs hit me
I grabbed for my chest and my neck, hopin
When my head hit the ground my skull busted open
You used to ask for my advice
Well Dear Homie, dyin' ain't nothin' nice
And the place I'm at is overpacked
With young blacks who crash crack and gats
I can only pray
You don't come this way
You gotta stay alive, you got a kid G
I feel ya partner but I worry alot
Bust shots
I know you're tryin' to comfort me
But I don't want no company, Homie
(Hen-Gee)
Dear Homie, even though you're gone
I still fell your presence
Sometimes I can sleep
'Cause I just can't see
Reality like it really should be seen
I still reminisce on how we used to kick it
Strollin' the yard, just hangin' out together
Down for whatever, whenever
And now I'm hopin, you're seeing a true friend in me
We where meant to be
(Ice-T)
Dear Homie, you used to call me O.G.
Now ya really gotta look up to me
'Cause the place I'm at, is way high in the sky
I didn't want to die
But the life I lived was just to reckless
Too many bad marks on God's checklist
And many many brothers will go out
Just tryin' to get that hard-core street clout
But a street reps final test, is when you're lying in a coffin
With you're hands folded on your chest.
Then ya hear the girls cry
Then ya hear the brothers lie
Talkin' about how down you was
Then the next week the back on the street, they cold forgot ya 'cause.
Don't wanna see ya on your back,
So for me stay sucka free, 'cause you don't need that, Homie.
Dear Homie...
Dear Homie...
Ya know I miss ya Homie..."

Tell dem bout da endin of da world today... COME!
(Ice-T)
I got a attitude as thick as a convict's
Bomb ticks, my heart beats as I rhyme over hard shit
Watch this, the nigga that you didn't think could do
Break through with the rhythm that'll rock your whole crew
Thought you knew; I ain't no punk or no pooh-butt
Step to me, the cops are still diggin niggaz up
What's up? What's up? What's up? You wanna try your luck
You move you weave you bob you got stuck
And now you're trippin' with your fuckin' brain
You never seen so much blood pour through one vein
You try to scream, you choke
You try to run, your legs are broke
You're bulletproof I hope...
Yo, I ain't no nigga to flex, but I will flip
Fuck up a nigga and dropkick his fuckin' bitch
I love to squabble and I'm good widdit
So if you want some nigga come get it
I ain't trippin' nigga trippin' at all
Yo, I'm fuckin' walkin' over weak rapper's downfalls
It ain't my fault they fell, it ain't my fault I sell

You punks are jealous 'cause I'm rollin' in fly shit

Fuck you, it ain't my fault your ass is on empty
Thought you was it, but you're smooth gettin' pimped G...
... I ain't no hoe fool
Got much respect for the new and the old school
But many rappers can rip mics but can't count...
... Zero bank amounts
Word and many critics are hot cause hard rap hits
They like to make it all soft that we pop shit
Fuck that, I'll die before I let the hardcore go
'Cause I'm a nigga from the G-H-E-T-T-O
I got a posse who's airtight, quick to fight
And got the power to continue or end the night
And if you stepped on wrong, then you're a done kid
The yellow tape's in the club because one did
I got no pity so don't ask me for fuckin' any
I'll break a bum off but you niggaz can't get a penny
When I was broke, I stole my gold, I pawned
I lived the life of a hustler off and on
I'm just a brother that lived to tell
I brought my ass up from the depths of hell
(Daddy Nitro)
Come! In a de ghetto tings are wild round de clock

I met this girl who act like I owed her somethin'
Nothin', all I owed her was some good steady fuckin'
Fuck that, not the one that's gonna fall on no hoe trap
Ease back bitch, before you need all your teeth back...
... I ain't no fuckin' mark
Made all my money workin bowcutters in the dark
Snatch bars and cars and vice grips
Long handled sledgehammers, saws and wire snips
I got an ill side that drips from my brain at times
It still thinks of the psycho and brutal crimes
I still remember when I had a low cash flow
No hoes, no cars, no gear no dough
And times got wicked...
... I even remember havin' to sell all my pawn tickets
But suckers spread out and they left me with few friends
But that's who wit me as we fuck up the true ends
So don't be trippin' if your luck's gone bad, be glad
It'll empty out the fake fuckin' friends you had
Then get yourself together, nigga aim straight
Shoot point blank at your goals, work hard and wait
You can do it even if you fell
I brought my ass back from the depths of hell

Yeah man we just sittin' back, chillin'
Bunch of players listenin' to the seventh deadly sin
Short dawg is doin' his thing with my nigga Ice-T
Don't fake the funk
(Ice-T)
Ice-T baby, this goes out to all you haters out there
Actin' like a brother done did somethin' wrong
'Cause he got his game tight
Don't hate the player, hate the game
(Chorus: Ice-T)
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk
(Ice-T)
Sometimes I get illy, cock back the nine-milli
I choose not to bust, smack your punk-ass silly
Just bought a crib, it cost two-point-five milli
Swimming pool in my livin' room, I guess I'ma willy
I don't get high, so I don't split the phillies
Niggas say they gonna kill me and I say: ""Oh really?""
Hit my Kawazakie I pull off on a willy
This is straight-lace pimpin', I know you hoes feel me
I come through - make your whole club petrol
You might as well let go, I blast, make the whole cub echo
You don't really wannna test an L.A. vet though
Most of my crews' on Death Row - the REAL!
Quick with the trigger, nice with the steel
Step into the kill zone caps get peeled
You WHACK! you lookin' for a record deal
Bow down, on second thought punk bitch kneel
(Chorus: Ice-T)
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk
(Ice-T)
Don't hate, cause my game's much, tighter than yours
My girls, finer than yours
My jewels shine, brighter than yours
You look me dead in my face
Then you act like you don't see me
You wanna be me, you hate my motherfuckin' guts
Lickin' nuts - what's the deal?
It's a level playin' field, my games' against yours, hustlin' wars
Roll the dice, risk your motherfuckin' life
Bank rolls and low hoes, anything goes
Ridin' rolls in a week, clap a nigga who speaks
I'm suceedin', in tryin' to keep from bleedin' in the lane
Crystal Meth, F.C.C., and Crack, Cocaine
Got a nigga tryin' to figure out the best route
I got cops in my rear view too, but I'll shoot
Every bitch I meet is fuckin' up to somethin'
Take a nigga to the crib lay him down and start dumpin'
Gat pumpin', they'll kill your ass for a G
Hate the game motherfucker don't hate me
(Chorus: Ice-T)
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk
(Ice-T)
Yo, my name will sell better than rap like the ?Acropalis?
Suckers might as well step back, there ain't no stoppin' this
Whack magazines who tried and tried to toppen this
I still got more Lexus' and gators on my shoppin' list
Make a fist, take your best shot, bet you drop it kid
Hit more licks than you and never caught a bid
Make the whole world go crazy, they said about the pig
Bald-headed hoes step back, bitch go and cop a wig
When I do a show, best believe it drop
Every night I got my straps, best believe they cocked
Some bitch talks crazy, then that bitch gets socked
If a man steps up, then he too gets dropped
Fuck the cops, I'm still foldin' fat knots
Catch me on the weekend, floatin' my yacht
Say Ice kick some game and I'll teach you a lot
Knock your bitch no matter how hard your block
(Chorus: Ice-T)
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk
(Outro: Ice-T)
I don't know why a player wanna hate T
I didn't choose the game, the game chose me"

Pipe bomb in my trunk, got a nine in my lap
I'm layin' for a sprayin', tonight there's no playin'
My posse's most strapped, tonight the crew's weighin'
Dust is burnin', the steering wheel's turnin'
I'm out a week, I'm already earnin'
Suckers crossed, tonight it's their loss
Payback time, boy, life's the cost
Gauges out the window, one lay cross the roof
They all die if those suckers ain't bullet proof
I'm rollin' death tollin', of course the car's stolen
But I'm blind to what's wrong, all I want is what's golden
A fool in a fight, too dumb to know right
Fuckin' blue light-read'em their rights
Drama (x4)
Copped an alias bailed out in an hour or less
I keep a bank for that don't know about the rest
Copped another piece, hit the dark streets
Rollin' once again, fuck the damn police
Called up my friend JOE, a roof job pro,459 on his mind car stereos
He said the spot was sleep, he cased the joint a week
3 a.m. on the dot inside we creep
Got Alpines, Fishes, JVC's,
Motorola Phones, Sony Color TV's
Had the hide packed up till we heard freeze
Fuckin' blue lights-read'em their rights
Drama (x4)
4 in the morning, lights in my face
That's the time, you know the place
Cuffed in the room with the two-way glass
Detects in effect cold doggin' my ass
""What's your date of birth?""...""What's your real name?""
I stuck to my alias, I know the game
If they don't know who you are, then they don't know what you've done
""You're just makin' this harder on yourself, son""
I know this shit by heart, I'm too clever
""Have you ever been arrested before?""
""Nope, never""
Da reject all over his face
You see no confession, no case
Then my boy started illin', talkin' and tellin'
Son of a bitch-he was a snitch
Drama (x6)
Under I went, I caught a case and half
He dropped the mallet, then the judge laughed
Now I'm in the penzo, chillin' like a real pro
I can't move until the man says go
A puppet of the big game, an institutional thing
I wouldn't be here if I fed my brain
Got knowledge from school books, instead of street crooks
Now all I get is penitentiary hard looks
The joint is like an oven of caged heat
You're just a number, another piece of tough meat
Killers and robbers are all you great
Act soft you will get beat
On death row they got their own hot seat
For those who feel that they are truly elite
The last thing you see's a priest
The lights dim-your life ends

Bout my homeboy Ed
Use to drink every day
Straight 40's to the head
You try to snap on him
He'd ask what you said
You still try to break
He'd start given up lead
Love to gamble
On one knee he stayed
Tryin' to hit seven
On one knee he stayed
Worked tees and weights
So he always got paid
Blew on the hoes
Every dollar he made
Crazy friends, crazy friends he had
Superfly drobe, super dope pad
Cars for your ass
And I'm talkin' class
Benz's and better
With his name on the dash
One night he got drunk
And started drivin' real fast...
Ed's dead"

Ya gotta keep up hops

Cuse their towers are high
They got the hype gaats
Check the perimeters good
Read the maps
It's night
They might not see us
Cuse if they catch us out there
They'll bleed us
Shoot us, kill us
Dump us in a dark ditch
Clean it up, call it a gang hit
I gotta make my move
'Cause I'm a renegade
I recognize
When mind techniques
Are being played
It's a plot they use
To keep down another
Here comes another
Brainwashed brother
Shut up do you know
How dumb you sound?
That mentality
What keeps my people down
No one wants to
Live in an urban war
You live there cause
Your parents were poor
They live there because
Theirs were also
Get yourself together
Hit the gates bro!
Ya gotta get out!
Ya gotta get out! Why?
Ya gotta get out!
Ya gotta get out! Why?
Ya gotta get out!
Ya gotta get out! Why?
Cause the fields
Are where you die!
Escape from
The killing fields
You try to keep us
Running and running faster
But I ain't runnin' from ya
I'm runnin' at ya
And my posse's thick
About a mil strong
Too late to make up now
'Cause it's on
I'm the one that's got ya
In constant fear
I'm the nigga
You shoulda killed last yeaar
But you played yourself
You let me gain wealth
Now I can change the wy
The cards are dealt
I've schooled my homeboys
Made 'em all understand
The tricks nd twists
Inflicted on the Black man
How ya make me think
To be down
I gotta stay around
Down in the motherfuckin'
Battleground
There'll never be any good
Schools in the hood
There'll never be any cops
That are any good
The hospital is a great place
To go to die
Real estate's cheap
Let me tell ya why?
The man's got a
Sure fire system
A economic prison!
Escape from
The killing fields!"

Don't stop, huh, ha, huh, uh, yeah, shit

Buckshot, he be the emcee
What, watch your step
(Buckshot Shorty)
Can I hear it for Buckshot? (Buckshot)
Buck's hot, spell it and yell it but the shit don't stop
It be hot, y'all niggas is worthless in the money market
I'm buck you ain't worth shit, nigga what?
Think about it, shorty what you drivin' stoned by your daddy
Oops, you almost had me, geesed up until I saw the truth
And one day I see you standin' at a token booth
It was on a hot wet night, I think it was a Saturday
Right after that party that he lead out down the way
Gunshots spread - everyday, all day (fuck!)
D.T.'s rushed the party in 2K
Buck - The Beef be - fled the scene right before the cops
And the Swats came with the triple beam
Uh, shit is real you know how we do when the young niggas peel out
Don't squeal [undecipherable]
(Ice-T)
If you niggas don't know you should know by now
Ice got more game than the law allows
Straight up - the biggest baller in the industry
Went straight from pimpin' hoes on the NBC
Do you feel me? I dealed it, ace off the bottom
Hoe's got 'em, I'm the one you just can't fade
Rolex in the tenth grade, hair was laid
Everything I wore to school baby was tailor made
Shot dice in the bathroom on my knees
I'll roll across the break and break that ass with these
Start hittin' jewel-liks, re-investin' in ki's
Drop the top on the flo', let you feel the breeze

Trees make my eyes bleed I come from an ill breed
Thoroughbred born from a strong seed
Led by a bunch of individuals (Ali)
Uh, criminals to generals - this is like wow!
Look at how my brain ay blew you out the frames
Twist of fate cause you say the same shit now
The Local Mobb Grill and let y'all niggas know I'm dead
I'm serious, somebody can get killed
Wait for the fire drill and when you start to smell the smoke
Run nigga Buck ain't no joke I'll buck a shot at your zipped up coat
Chop the throat like a blow from Judo, nigga you know
(Ice-T)
Is it new year God? I'm comin' back mad-hard
Movin' harder than a convict with a shack in the yard
New Jacks wanna hear me rap beggin' for freestyle skills
I've served so many rappers I can make a land field fool
You've doubt for a mic dude, the Ice is a jewel
Fuck rules, I got more pool than a mule
Matter of fact, never comprehend the styles I sin
I've been breakin', annihilate fakes and tens
See I'm a nigga from the West Side cheered I peel libs
What prayin' that you do hill when I all ready did
Like your girl gotta admit she was a sexy bitch
But I hit it with the Gin so my nuts don't itch

Buck's got ya locked, body drawn like pit bulls
We don't give a fuck if we have to pull, click, shit
Brooklyn niggas is known to rep-resent
Any nigga happened that's why I left

Get your shit taken then your shit is kept
Uh, shit in a step, if not got your back broke
Plus ya jaw tapped, snapped your 'Adams Ap'
It's just a fact that niggas ain't shit
Ain't shit like Egyptians, nigga trippin'
Beenie-eyed, never slippin', I'm grippin' the four-twenty
Motherfuck the bullshit talk - where the money?
Years ago, a friend of me ask me to start up a company
Duck Down's the name, rap music is the aim
Lyrically I bring the pain and lock the game with no padlock and chain
Some said that Buck went bust
But when I came out, I left 'em all in the dust
Look at your sound scam, original brown man
Makin' million every time I drop a jam

They love to fuck up in a frenzy, let fuckin' sharks feed me
Bitches start screamin' and stampedin'
Thank God it's evening, I didn't leave the burner in the B.M.
Where my nigga Buck, nobody seen him
Probably in the Eye Of The Storm where the ill perform, perform, perform..."
22,First Impression,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Upon initial contact with Ice-T's music, I had envisioned him to be an ill-mannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric
Frame of mind, whose raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jargon, shocking sexual audacity and repulsive images of the ghetto.
However, after further analysis of his music I can deduce that he is the epitome of
Antidisestablishmentarianism, who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle.
But to make things more plain and simple to the layman, I find Ice-T to be the dopest, flyist, O.G. pimp hustler gangster player hardcore motherfucker living today.
To be honest, I am totally and irrevocably on his dick."

All playin' the wall, it's time to sweat it off
Anybody with static -- oh, please try --
I'll do ya like Godfather 3 and do a fly by
Time to rip and hit and strangle
I eat Guardian Angels
And toy emcees with their names on the front page
I bury in shallow graves
I don't rap to girls on my L.P.
I don't beg for pussy
I love the ladies and they love me right back
Now who's the mack?
Mission accomplished
I came to stomp this
Microphone and leave suckers unconscious
And if you you think you've got an ""S"" on your chest
You better wear two vests
Watch your back, your front
I always hit, don't bunt
Crazy posse when I'm out on a duck hunt
Emcee Ice, he answers to no one
Load my rhymes and cock 'em like a shotgun
Let off like frags from a pipe bomb
A slow stroll and my mic in my right palm
The cops hate me and that's right they oughtta
Before my crew gets to their daughters
(Nat the Cat)
Do you know me? Right
That's why I carry the mic
I'm not flashing my American Express
I'm playing my cards close to my vest
My name that you say, what, I'm fessin'?
Listen up and listen close and listen for the lesson
Black Panther assessin' the situation
Executing with tact, jumping exact
Ripping' up slack, on attack

25,Freedom Of Speech,1989,The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say (1989),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"A-yo Ice, man. I'm working on this term paper for college. What's the
First Amendment?
Freedom of Speech, that's some motherfuckin' bullshit
You say the wrong thing, they'll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says ""Profanity - No Airplay""?
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?
You're bitchin' about rock'n'roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get
(You have the right to remain silent)
Fuck that right! I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin'
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers deprivin' the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfuckin' apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
'Cause once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said ""Fuck""
So I thought for a minute and said ""No,
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show""
'Cause for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen 'cause there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's comin', 'cause I'm mad and I'm gunnin'
Homeboys, and there's no runnin'
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothin' but a piece of fuckin' shit on the damned map
Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away
Outro (Jello Biafra)
What they're trying to do with radio, with this, uh, McCarron-Walter
Act and a lot of other ways, is start by saying that they're
Protecting the public from wicked rock bands, or girlie magazines, or
Whatever. But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down,
What they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information
Itself.
If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it."

(Bazaro, Boogie down Bronx baby)
I only like my shit hardcore
(Grip)
On the mic, Grip be flexin'
Who's next to wreck when I mic check, mic check
I'm checkin' any verbal an' steppin'
What the fuck nigga duck you ain't fuckin' with this
Get touched 'cause I lust to bust when I clutch
With the quickness, killin' lyricist when I spit this
Who's next on my hitlist when I rip this
Lyrically I'm material, the Rap War General
Droppin' hoes quicker than a syllable, yeah you killable
Your style, unfillable, wishin' my shit was stillable
I eel for the fuck of it, queen you know I'm lovin' it
Dick, never suckin' it unless I see a buck in it
You need the whip, cluck it kid, I'm furious
Leavin' your crew delirious so you don't take it serious
I'm guessin' you was serious about the West, none test
I got the rep for my niggas on the shaw
Got the ball, fuck the law and yep I wet 'em out
As I proceed to spread 'em out and dead 'em out
Spray 'em out, lay 'em out
Ain't no surprise, come see me with four eyes
Young Grip I'm a prize, prepare for you demise

29,G Style,1993,Home Invasion (1993),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Yeah! Right about now motherfuckers is layin for a nigga like me Ice-T
To bust some freestyle shit... but I don't do that
I just cold lounge up here at the Ammo Dump
With my nigga Alladdin, SLJ, LP and my nigga Henry G
Yeah, we do the shit like this
Verse One:
The card after the ace is deuce
So cut the nigga loose on the 3
That's me
The motherfuckin T
I got ride on my surfboard
Rhyme hard
But only buy the shit that I can't afford
That's everything
That's why I truck big fat rings
Cause in the motherland gold is for kings
I got backup
To jack up
Punks who try to act up
Do a world tour
Watch the big bank stack up
Motherfuckers get dropped with the quickness
I got an ill left and a right fist
Make mistakes and you'll lose
Or you might die
'Cause I'm the wrong Ice for your bruise
And that's no lie
Meanwhile the penile is stacked to the top with my niggaz
Mostly for squeezin triggas
I call 'em homies
Pigs call 'em crooks
So I write and put bucks on they books
I give a fuck about a cop or a G-man
They all talk shit
Their breath smellin like semen
I catch 'em in the alley all alone
Put 'em in the prone
Pop! Pop! Pop! To the dome
It's the G-style
Gangsta style
G Style, The gangsta talk
I got a teflon .9
And it eats vest
I take a motherfucker out quick
Just for talkin' shit
Ride Rolls
Catch hoes like a mitt
LA, Atlanta, New York
Yo, my shit rocks
Chi-town, Miami, Detroit
I get much props
Because I roll with the hardcore G
Every street's the same street to me
I don't bullshit
I don't quit
Writin a rhyme fit
KKK pray each day
That I get hit
Motherfuckers try to flip on the Icepick
Move and slip
Close the eyes and catch a fuckin' clip
Not in the ghetto no more
But I do hang
Got a black game
And it's sittin' on them thangs
I kick the game from the street
Not the slamma
Tighten up my knockas with a big lead hammer
Verse Three:
Some of the times
I write my raps with extreme speed
Some of the times
I take the pen and make pads bleed
My mind clicks to Homocide
Bullets fly
Ladies cry
A lot of people die
Some nights I can't right
Stare at the blue lines
I think I'm a go blind
Then the beat becomes me
Sit in the dark
And write a whole fuckin' LP
G Style, the gangsta talk
Never near soft
Hard as a knockout bout
It's no sellout
I keep crime in my rhyme
'Cause it's my thing
Packed with guns
And drugs
And lots of street slang
A-B-C-D-E-F, and LAPD
Words from a motherfuckin OG
Ammo Dump pumps the sounds that you bump in your trunk
So turn it up punk
What'cha fraid of?
What'cha made of?
Pull the pin
Set the grenade off
Blastin sounds out ya jeep
On every city street, nigga
Straight gangsta beat
Verse Four:
Many like to dress the style, and act hardcore
Many motherfuckers are and they crack jaws
I like to lay in the cut
In a nightclub
Don't smoke bud
Drink suds
But I gets loved, mack, cool
I scope the freak with the mad backs
Hit her with the gangsta style
Cool, relaxed, bam
Put her in the Benz
Bump Too $hort, let her know
Right off the top, what's my sport
You think long
You think wrong
You got it goin' on, baby doll?
But I won't sing you no love song
You either love me
Or you don't
You're either rollin' tonight
Or you won't
She likes the style
Cause it don't bullshit around
Tongue in my ear, real slow
And then it went down
I gotta flip into a ill mode
Pack a clip full of hype tracks
And then unload
Music for the hardcore beatdown
No weak pop shit
Strictly underground
And if you don't like the style, as I get wreck
Ease back nigga, catch a knife through the neck"

A ghetto is a ghetto, and a street is strict!
Eliminate the poverty disease

You can get shot no matter how much fucking cash you got
You can never get away the streets they HOT!
And gangstas ain't the ones to push
They kill ya in a second, ask President Bush!

My traps well lured, I go hardboard

Word 'em up, hurt 'em up, move out, blow the spot
Round two, rounds flew (*shots*) in the parkin' lot

You girls look so sexy
I wish you all were up here with me
You drive me crazy with those big ole butts
Girl, Let's Get Butt Naked And Fuck!
Tonight, I wanta make this real clear, dear
I've no time to whisper in your ear
No time to remove our fears
I just wanta get near
Get butt naked and roll around
Move our bodies like up and down
Do that stuff that your mama call smut!
Girl, Let's Get Butt Naked And Fuck!
Come on, you know you wanta do it, too
It's good to me, and it's good to you
I only speak what's true
You say you don't, but I know you do
Come on up to my room
We'll undress by the light of the moon
Lay down and I'll caress that butt
Girl, Let's Get Butt Naked And Fuck!
I mean real stupid and nasty
I know what you want, so you don't have to ask me
Just lay back and I'll operate
Jimbraski will go to work and penetrate
And then we'll both feel great
Make your move tonight, girl, don't hesitate
We both want it, don't make it tough
Girl, Let's Get Butt Naked And Fuck!
Homeboys, you know the situation
You're trying to rap but they give you frustration
Nose in the air, turnin' you down
When you really wanta say! ""Yo baby let's get down""
But you don't, you keep frontin'
Kickin' conversation, ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
When all that's really on your mind is what?
""Yo baby L.G.B.N.A.F.""
That's right if you're a man you want it
If you're a woman you tease him and flaunt it
But my crew got to have it
And after they dog it, I autograph it
The SYNDICATE don't lecture
We move in a group, seduce and capture
And if the posse has good luck
Girl, Let's Get Butt Naked And Fuck!
ISLAM takes the pictures
And girls, I'm a say EVIL E's gonna get ya
Get ya illin' in a nude mode
A double X-rated episode
Hotel rooms cold explode, when my posse unloads
Sex in effect when we're on the road
Girl, Let's Get Butt Naked And Fuck!
Throw your hands up in the air
If you love sex I know you're out there
Safe sex that is, ya gotta be careful with this 88 sex biz
But that's another song
Girls, move your bodies sexy and the brothers will come along
Homeboys, move in on that butt and say!
Girl, Let's Get Butt Naked And Fuck!"

It had no positive messages, no redeeming value, hated and feared
By the establishment, it changed the course of the world""
(SLEJ)
Ride as my jabos, cocked my straps watcha back
You know where you at? You in urban combat
So stay alert, use the attack of the tactical expert
Puttin' in work, and leavin' your troops with wet shirts
Your casuality rate is high, I'm closin in
Prepare for your ultimate end, tell your family bye
Better cool like Egon, and shine like veegon
Pissin on your beons, for decades and eons
You squad has no muscle plus you, my new hustle
Fuck scuffin up my knuckles, rather buck you and watch you buckle
I can't stand a snitch, a switch real bitch
I got some transcripts to say you been runnin' ya lips
Now its on, on site, if I see you I'mma sin ya
If I catch you in traffic I'mma gift ya somethin' in ya
Letcha battle with death for the prize of life
I learned ta never come empty handed to a gun fight
My advesaries feel fright, his last sight
Was a flash of light, you said lightning could strike
From the same place twice, I have your head on my death
1500, tonight's your last night gettin' blunted
""The voices could not be stopped, it began to morph
And reinvent themself, I grew like a black blade
Moving like a tornado from the west to the east coast
Leaving behind a path of destruction and mayhem""

Thick's ice fix ghosts infrared no remorse
And low from the exchange, psycho derranged
Playa lay no feel pain, killa cocka-main
I'm top framin the game, use muscle for the hustle
I zip duffle bags to muffle fags
Scuffle my knuckles bad on niggaz that think that they runnin' shit
They feel the punishment, uh, blood bath, the wrath
Aftermath, at least the guns in shit
Too under fallin' charum leads to send up on the earth
Mix things with daughters with men
Since poured from birth the worth for the others
Go to war with my brothers
I'm unstable like Kane did to Abel
I'm out the stable sinnin from the beginnin
Leavin' daddy's little girl pretty linen bloody red
What's said in the book of dead is now all forgotten
My soul's rotten, still the blood's spilled I feel
Chills, I'm still plottin, I'm ill-norm
Take life forms like light storms I laugh at the wrath
Of the guys comin' on, visions of the antichrist is risen
The question is now, am I unforgiven?
""Legends tells that the creator of this poison's name was Ice
Although, others have told different stories, no matter
Who or what invented the monster, their souls would be forever
Damned to Hell""
(Ice-T)
Enter the death chambre, cash richer, leave ya nutless
Cutless with the raw scope, double ya dope
Feel my back lash, body cash your whole fam and media
Greedy shit, tag ya out the rag Jag, speedy shit
Look in the sky, the four horsemen bustin' no discussion
No stoppin' its apocalypse, lock and load ya clips
Gonna be rich and dead, copa said don't matter cats scatter
Suckas get touched, niggaz get rushed
Watch 'em transform into animal form, wicked Hell-born
Lord of the Flies, cry and ya die
Mechanama come masses soul snatcher, fallen angel
All angles covered for you fuckin' God lovers
Possession, good suggestion run cuddle your funds
Double your guns, watch your kids grow, stay out my flow
Be wise, the magnificence, evidence, decadence mind
Seven sins, the abomination, I'm
That nigga, last nigga, street mack
Hot is my strap, wet is your back
Understand I never forgive, leavin' bodies like seive
Clap gats till my fuckin' shit's clipless
Niggaz bear witness
""Like any deadly disease, it has infected many men
From the east, west, north, and south, gangsta rap is now
Alive, God forgive me, God forgive me"""
34,Gotta Lotta Love,1993,Home Invasion (1993),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Woke up the other mornin, I heard a rumor
They said the gang wars was over
I told 'em they was bullshittin, they said it's real as hell
Can't explain the way I felt
Too many years I seen my brothers die
And I can't say that shit was really that fly
But I used to gangbang when I was younger
So it's really hard to tell a kid that he's goin' under
I never thought I lived to see us chill
Crips and Bloods holdin' hands, the shit is ill
But I love it, I can't help it
Too much death on the streets, and we dealt it
Van Ness Boys, The Hoovers, The 60s
Bounty Hunters, 8-Treys, all coolin out, gee
I pray the shit'll never stop
You used to see the wrong colors, and the gats went pop-pop
But now the kids got a chance to live
And the O.G.'s got something to give
That's love, black on black, that's how they made it
And if any busters flip, they get faded
L.A. is where I'm speakin' of
Peace to all the gangsters, 'cause I got a lotta love
I got a lotta love, 'cause you're all my brothers
Red or blue, black's the color
We got a chance, so we can really sweat the real fools
Show those muthafuckas the real tools
Check the enemy, it ain't the family
Not 1-11, try L.A.P.D.
They gotta understand, they beat on a blackman
There's gonna be drama, know what I'm sayin'?
And if we flip, let's all flip together
'Cause I'm prepared, kid, for rough weather
And we gotta realize, the boys on the east side
You call 'em S-A's, I call 'em allies
Because the day that we all unite
Watch the pigs get real polite
Punk muthafuckas gotta learn quick
That we ain't takin' no more shit
L.A. is where I'm speakin' of
Peace to all the gangsters, 'cause I got a lotta love
Crenshaw Boulevard, Sunday afternoon
Folks sittin' on things, mad systems boom
The girls are lookin' better
The gang truce is on, so you wear whatever
At Venice by the ocean
Rag-top Trey hits the three-wheel motion
There's gangsters all around
Still crazy sets, but you just don't clown
I pray L.A. can stay this way
It's the first summer I can really say
I felt cool, we all chilled
Went to the park, and nobody got killed
Now if you got a problem, it's man on man
You don't need a gang to solve em
I seen the greatest thing I seen in my life
Two brothers in a straight up fist fight
Nobody pulled a gat, nobody jumped in
Nobody pulled a knife, nobody got done in
L.A. is where I'm speakin' of
Peace to my city, 'cause I got a lotta love
G-a-t-e-s, I hope you wear a vest
Even after you're out the fuckin' office
'Cause we're on a totally different tip
Fuck that pig brutality shit
This unity is gettin' to me
Every brother on the street is my homie
I'm rollin' through a hood that I never been
And every brother steps to me as a friend
I love it, I love it
And nothin' in my life will ever be above it
We wanna see our kids all grown up
We're tired of seein our hoods get blown up
L.A. is a great place
Fly girls, dope cars, life at a fast pace
But gangbanging was killin' it quick
Another child got hit - bullshit
Pop-pop-pop, 10 on a weekend
We was goin' off to deep end
But now we got a chance, my friend
To mend, and make the colors blend
Let's all go out on a picnic, kick shit
And squash all the static
Last year I lost about five homies
This shit is real to me
L.A. is where I'm speakin' of
Peace to all the gangsters, 'cause I got a lotta love
Yo
This is goin' out to all the gangbangers
All over South Central
Watts
Inglewood
All over L.A., basically
East L.A.
Youknowmsayin?
It's basically goin' down
Peace to all the Crips and the Bloods
Van Ness Boys
Hoovers
Rollin' 60s
83's
Bounty Hunters
Yeah
And the Jungle
This is goin' out to all the brothers over there in Watts
You know what I'm sayin'?
Throwin' it up

And all them niggas out there in Compton
Rollin' 30s

Inglewood Family
18th Street
South Loc
And all the S-A homeboys
All the different sets
Every set, Crip, Blood
What doesn't matter to me
'Cause I gotta love
You know what I'm sayin'?
Hope the truce never ends

We can do this"
35,Grand Larceny,1988,Power (1988),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Stick up, hands in the air
You move, you lose 'cause the ICE don't care
No chance to run, don't shout
Flinch an inch I'm gonna take you out
Grand Larcenist, soloist, felonist, vocalist
Crime's my rhyme, but here's a new twist
I ain't here for your gold, bro
All I want is the show
This is Grand Larceny
This is Grand Larceny (x3)
I lay low for a show, and then I go
Steal the motherfucker then we count the dough
It's kinda like robbin', but it's legally done
And now days if it ain't legal I don't fuck around
I get a thrill when I ill and a jam is filled
With 10.000 screamin' people, now that's the pill
Who's gonna dog the set? The ICE will
And once I'm in effect it's overkill
Kinda like a hold-up.all the tickets sold up
And then the black stretch limo cold rolls up
And then the posse breaks, high off the Cold Duck
And then I set the mic to show destruct
Even if we open up, it don't mean nothing
I rock the rhymes.E does the cuttin'
Call it shownappin' I take a hostage a night
Do shit and break out on the next flight
This is Grand Larceny
Grand Larceny
I'm a kleptomaniac when a jam is packed
You can fight all night, but you'll still get jacked
By the show stealer, crime rhyme dealer
Rap king pin, L.A. big-wheeler
Got a posse so strong they could lift a tank
Rob a bank
But now we steal shows the cops say thanks
Breathe easy 'cause the Syndicate deep
Before we start rappin'
They got no sleep
This is Grand Larceny
Grand Larceny
Just give me a beat, give me a stage to stand on
I know that none y'all ever planned on
A dude from L.A. who could rock shit this way
Have his record go gold, with no radio play
But it happened, The Ice is rappin'
Just listen to my fans that are clappin'
Or come to my show.sit in the front row
And watch me steal the motherfucker before your ass can say ""HO""
I'm like a time bomb, but I'm a rhyme bomb
Spray the whole audience with napalm
Or something just as hot, I'll bust a rhyme, why not?
Rap hittin' so hard, you'll think you shot
I'll take a show and abduct it
Stone cold house it, and if it gets wild
With gasoline I'll douse it
Set it ablaze, and then I'll stomp it out
Many burnt emcees know what I'm talkin' about
This is Grand Larceny
Promoters on my tail now
'Cause they billed me low
Here I am 'bout to steal another show
So they turn my mic down
Fuck up my audio sound
But too late, we just dogged another town
Rappin' like a Mac 10, as soon as I begin
The only way to stop the stealin'
Is throw me in the pen
But that will never happen
'Cause I'm just cool rappin'
My Larceny is legal, so sorry Captain
I would never steal a rap
But I'll steal a show in a minute
It's as simple as that
An interstate crook, my pistol's my rhyme book
Any show that I'm on is a show that's took
Better watch my left hook, or your jaw will get shook
If my posse gets mad, it's best you book
From the Grand Larcenist, ICE-T is my name
Got a rap like a mac, and a game he same
This is Grand Larceny (x3)"

Some of police are brutal hog, I'm actor-baitin'
No hesitation to slice a motherfucker in thirty places
Fuck a case - ain't leavin' traces here to Redder-Dip
I'm aimin' a - automatic find a bitch I'm hangin' up

Flat packs will end as brothers - the bloody covers
Bloody gloves like Yo-J, AK's my brainwaves
I'll strung a nigga all day to my dear play you won't be comin' back
I put that on my dear pops when I blast a fierce drop
My bloody mask revealin' Jason it's non-stop
The cemetery is what you facin'
My steel shot is smokin' like chainsaws, brains call

Prepare for the night that you never wanted
These streets is taunted, blacked out impala with the big rims on it
Hit'cha corner with the lights out, bitch it's on
Duck down wit'cha kids, you know what you did
Motherfuck what your niggas say, watch for the ricochet
It's gonna be hard to hear much, once my trigger spray
That's neither here nor there, just beware
'Cause when I bust off my gat flings like a roll flair
You now listenin' to - the most hated and most loved at the same time 'cause
Ice nigga what the fuck you wanna do about a T
Most'cha bitch niggas can't fuck with me
Cause your chin-chalked talk I can see through
Like you're rollin' in a phat V-12
Bulllshit - pull quick and have your shit cocked or dropped
Keep a spare clip cause sometimes the shots don't stop
It's motherfuckin' game to rap about, shits' for real
Double action, ain't gotta cock back no more
Got you bitch-ass niggas sweatin' like Taibo
Rather lookin', in my face, I'm just checkin' my flow
So, I advise you to keep it in the studio
Your attittude, you don't wanna meet me dude
My crews' like a fuckin' wild bunch of escaped beasts
Like scientists, cross cells of apes and G's
All the war - get you battle gear, black fatigues
You talk shit, your crews' catch a casualty, uh!

Peep now, system, handcuffs nigga listen
Word up, robbin' white boys to buy blunts
The representative - GorTek Assassin thought to be a stallion
Yo I be splashin' Street Wars
The hardcore Ambassador in a black four door Akaror, I attach yours
The Marquise piece, gold teeth and medallion
Heads I be sappin' like the grams I be baggin'
Fightin' women, cut throat and tree smokin'
Violatin', infiltratin', blunt bakin'
Block regulatin', the cake, bake, a brick flippin'

Get touched 'cause I lust to bust when I clutch
With the quickness, killin' lyricist when I spit this
Who's next on my hitlist when I rip this
Lyrically I'm material, the Rap War General
Droppin' hoes quicker than a syllable, yeah you killable
Your style, unfillable, wishin' my shit was stillable
I eel for the fuck of it, queen you know I'm lovin' it

You need the whip, cluck it kid, I'm furious
Leavin' your crew delirious so you don't take it serious
I'm guessin' you was serious about the West, none test

Got the ball, fuck the law and yep I wet 'em out
As I proceed to spread 'em out and dead 'em out

37,Heartbeat,1988,Power (1988),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Once again, my friends, it's time to rock it till the party ends
Rhymin' with timin', while EVIL E lets the record spin
Kickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'
Because I be layin' rhymes super sly,'cause this is do or die
Make it or break it, although most emcees do fake it
I'll say the ICE can't take it, time to microphone bake it
Raise the heatin' level, break out your coal shovel
Pump the temp, I'm sweatin' like a devil
Listen to my heartbeat, it's beatin' like a wild man
But that's natural,'cause you know that I am
No punk, no chump, no fool, no toy
Try to get ill and serve you, boy
I'm on a hype tip, this ain't no ego trip
Just rollin' thick as hell, champagne I sip as well
Listen and you'll envision, this rap's metabolism
I think the beat is dope, but it's still your decision
Whether to turn it on, turn it off
Turn it up, make it loud, make it soft
EQ me with new frequencies or
Just rewind me till the tape bleeds
My heartbeat's kickin' like a Saturday movie
Some say it's def, some say it's groovy
I say it's fly, you know why?
Because it's spoken by the brother, whose name is spent with the ""I""
The C-E-T., Cold Chillin' rhyme villain on the M-I-C.
With raps roarin', I'm never borin', I keep tourin'
My record sales keep soarin' and soarin'
I'll make a million, maybe two
Buy some rides, gold blow the dough on my crew
Wake up the next morning broke as hell
But not for long 'cause my records sell
My heartbeat's kickin' like a gun shot
Why not?That's who I made it for, the hardrocks
Better watch your gold when the posse breaks
Because what they want is what they take
But I'm coolin', I'm never foolin', too busy rulin'
Sucker emcees who need microphone schoolin'
Leave'em dazed, dogged, served and droolin'
By the playin' punk slayin' mac of microphone duelin'
Heartbeat (scratch freestyle)
This conglomeration is just a demonstration
Of rap's penetration to the core of our nation
Some rappers get down with toy commercial sounds
I had my choice, I chose the underground
Like me or hate me, now if you want you can rate me
My beat is by ISLAM, the cut's by the great E.
My heartbeat is kickin', it's kickin' louder and louder
It's gettin' deffer and deffer, I'm feelin' prouder and prouder
Not robbin' or killin', just mic illin'
The phone rings,""WE MADE ANOTHER MILLION""
Break out the Dom and pop the corks
Catch a flight to New York
Hit the L.Q. watch RED spin,""IT'S CLOSED""
Brooklyn strikes again
Heartbeat (scratch)
Once again, my friends, it's time to rock it till the party ends
Rhymin' with timin', while EVIL E lets the record spin
Kickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'
Because I be layin' rhymes super sly,'cause this is do or die
Make it or break it, although most emcees do fake it
I'll say the ICE can't take it, time to microphone bake it

38,High Rollers,1988,Power (1988),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Speed of life: fast
It's like walkin' barefoot over broken glass
It's like jumpin' rope on a razor blade
All lightning-quick decisions are made
Lifestyle: plush
Females: rush
This high profile personality, who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar
Schoolboys: admire
Young girls: desire
Very few live to retire
Cash flow: extreme
Dress code: supreme
Vocabulary: obscene
Definition-street player -- you know what I mean
The high rollers
The high rollers
People of the city, stop foolin' yourself
Crime rules the streets -- who the hell else?
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Just look at the cars as they go by
Benz, Ferraris, trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology, who needs to steal?
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're livin' proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12-gauge
And you love the game, that's why you boast
Because you're high priced, high speed, high post
You're a high roller
High rollers
When I say high rollers, I mean the best
Forget the half-steppers, eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood of scarface runnin' through their veins
Silk shirts, leather suits, hair always fresh
Eelskin boots, large hearts, though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruisin' in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin' ""Pusher Man""
Yes, their fashion's high and hard to beat
They buy their Gucci from Gucci's not the swapmeet
Eat very well, much clientele
And whatever you need, they probably sell
The high rollers
The high rollers
Oh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold
Cold as an igloo, or hot as a flame
They'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name
Gangsters to the max, all narks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferraris, not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded, most men don't understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
They're junkies for fun, love life on the run
And if things get hot, they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame, no shame to the game
And they all seek power -- fuck the fame
The high rollers
The high rollers
Now radio stations probably won't play
This record because of the things I say
They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustlin' hood
And a record like this can do no good
But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
I don't know which side of the law you belong
Yes, the game has flash, but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake, hard times lurks
And jail's not your only problem, though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from an M-16
But to each his own, choose the mobile phone
The tailored suit, the luxury home
You'll never get caught, 'cause you got nerves of ice
And you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
... Right?
You wanna be a high roller

I put the lyrics on the paper with the pen
Evil E makes the records spin
Islam drops the beats that you rock to
Thought that I would never get you? Got you
Doggin the floor like you know you never done before
How could a brother be so hardcore
And still keep you on the floor like a maniac
That's your question? Well I'ma answer that
I'm on the mic tonight I'm here to do it right
Ice, the capital T, airtight
Coolest of the cool, a mack on a mission
Step to me fool - you're missin'
Minus, gone, pow, you're outta here
This ain't no game to me, this is my career
Throw me a mic, plug it in, ""Bet!""
I won't be happy till the dancefloor's wet
I ain't no rookie, I'm a microphone vet
Evil E's on the set, hit the deck!

And ""no mistakes allowed"" -> Rakim*}

E-M-C-E-E, I-C-E-T, A-N-D, DJ Evil E
Doggin the deck like it's never been done before
You had enough? ""MORE!""
Here we go, I'm about to blow up
Don't you dare bite my rhymes, I'll make you throw up
Poison soaked in an acid bath
Swallow homeboy, your throat'll need a skin graft
Toss it up, while the DJ known as Evil cuts
You wanna know what's happenin' - ""WHAT?""
The beat become my soul, I'm goin' out of control
Look in my face as my eyeballs roll
Back in my head and the mic glows red
Step in my face and you'll wind up dead
{*SLAP*} Yo, thanks, I needed that
I was possessed by this treacherous track
Watch out ""WORD"" this ain't no joke
A sucker tried to flex and his arm got broke
Don't make a move that you'll regret
Evil E's on the set, hit the deck!
{*Scratched ""kick it"" (4X)*}
(Ice-T)
You start to think and wonder bout how it's done
""An emcee? Maybe I could be one""
Drop the thought, get a job, change your mind
To be a dope MC takes time
Eight years of mine, no time for draggin
You wanna be an MC? ""Get off the bandwagon!""
But if it's in your heart, get a pen
Don't stop writin till the inkflow ends
Work and work and don't halfstep
Dog the mic every chance you get
Motivation must be kept
Stay down and build your rep
Yo so let me demonstrate, rappin' as a fine art
And when I'm finished, you can take this rap apart
Analyze my elements and tactics
First I'm over there, and then I'm back to this
I jumble topics, you won't know where I'll go
Back in your face with a cold but steady flow
You feel the power of the Ice in the first row
You already know what to say, ""HOO!""
On the mic is a stone cold vet
Evil E's on the set, hit the deck
{*Evil E scratches for a long time*}
(Ice-T)
I'm in my mode, called the fourth episode
Or the last verse, if you wanna decode
So I gotta raise the heat, hype up the beat
Switch the mic from airtight to elite
Pounce upon the deck, it ain't wet yet
Let me see how hot you can get
Then I'll turn up the amps, blow out the lights
You're in darkness, then the mic ignites
Glowin' like it did before, but even more
The room is lit, the raps are hardcore
Evil cuts the records like a psycho with a switchblade
You see a blur -- that's the crossfade
Loud and proud, words bombard the crowd
Look up in the air -- you see a mushroom cloud
I kick flavor to a musical track
Too fast to catch, too complex to match
I'm gettin' hyped as hype can get
Evil E's on the set! Hit the deck"

Yo, what's goin' on Ice?
(Ice-T)
Yo what's up Shawnie Shawn?
Man, just trippin' off this girl, man
(Shawnie Shawn)
Girls?
You?
The Iceberg?
Aw man, come on, spill it, man
She was a swinger
Talkin' 'bout high post
She was the most
Knew she was fine, dope, fly
She didn't have to try
She brought a eye on my eye in a crowded club
I tried to stare the girl down, but she didn't budge
She moved through the crowd in a straight line
The closer she got, mad thoughts ran through my mind
Yo, what would I say, yo, how would I chill?
My mind drew a blank, the whole scene was ill
She stepped in the light, she was dynamite
Her eyes said, ""I wanna be with you all night
I wanna rub you down, I wanna kiss, caress your soul
Make your body warm and cold
Do everything sexually you ever heard""
And she hadn't said a single word...
I said, ""Damn, what the hell am I gonna do?""
But my eyes said the same things too
I tried to speak, she put a finger across my lips
Followed it with a kiss
She said, ""I want you bad,"" and she moved in next to me
This woman spelled out ecstacy
Said, ""I've seen on the movies and TV
I love your records, but I ain't no groupie
Just wanna love ya, 'cause you're a real man
And you deserve this lovin' like only I can""
I wanted her bad, and I am a man
That night the shit hit the fan
(Shawnie Shawn)
Damn, man
Keep on with it, man
Come on now kick it, man
You gotta kick it right, though
Let me know what's up
She had a 500 S-E-L airtight
Cellular phone, brand-new, it was white on white
As we walked to the car, I couldn't help but recognize
Her small waist and sexy thighs
She had a beach house she owned and a restaurant
Took me in her crib and put Sade on
As the waves hit the rocks in the moonlight
She came up behind me and squeezed me real tight
My mind started to trip, flip, roll, and roam
What about my girl who's at sleep at home?
But before I could lock in on that thought
She broke out with a new men's watch that she had bought
She put it round my wrist, it was a perfect fit
And said in my ear, ""Want you to have it""
Then she unzipped her dress, dropped it to the ground
My mind was totally blown by now
She gazed at me nude in the moonlight
Pumps still on, her body was firm and tight
I looked at her breasts as they glistened and rised
Right before my eyes
And all I could say to myself was, ""Damn..""
The night the shit hit the fan
(Shawnie Shawn)
Man, man, man
I understand...
(The night the shit hit the fan)
Come on now
I feel it
Come on
(The night the shit hit the fan)
Damn, man
It's all that
Shit
Come on, Ice
Kick that shit
Now I'm a player, I been all around the world
Made love to many girls
But tonight this was the big league
And I was worryin about fatigue
I wanna do this girl, so she won't forget me
And I knew that she'd let me
She moved close and took my shirt off
She said my skin was soft
Then slipped her hand
Between my stomach and my waist band
Man, I couldn't take it no more
Fuck the bedroom, we use the kitchen floor
We hit skins all weekend
We didn't even eat, we just hit 'em again
I love to think about how it went down
But she's no longer around
Left town with some fly guy
She's on some island drinkin' D'Acqueray's and Mai Thai's
But she gave me the keys to the beach house
She knows what I'm about, at least now she figured out
I ain't nothin' but a straight up man
And I might need those keys the next time the shit hits the fan
Yeah
Uh!
Yeah
Uh...
Yeah
Uh
I want her
(Shawnie Shawn)
Damn
All that, all that
And after all that
You know?
You always know, man
In the long run
You meet another one like the other one"

Big drums, bitches, hoes and death, come on and get some
I'm not the nigga that you want to leave your kids alone
'Cause I got my own opening-dome kit
And once again I'm gonna put them under my fuckin' spell

Till you feed'em lies and the flip

Might call you and pops a fool
Tell ya that's why they hate school
Been offensive and askin' questions
Give your brain indigestion
Why? Why? Because I have indoctrinated the youth
Yhey're mentally intoxicated with truth
So they know the noise you talk are lies
Pretty damn soon they'll be by (I'm outta here)

And every night a ho gets smacked
A fool gets jacked

All that shit you taught me, mom, was full of shit!
Know what I'm sayin'?
How the fuck you gonna tell me to run my motherfuckin' life?
Bitch! You don't even know who the fuck you are!
You talkin' about you don't like rap, you don't like how I dress!
Yo! Fuck you and pops! I'm outta here!
Both of y'all can kiss my ass...
All cops want me, so does the F.B.I.
Because my rhymes are fly
They still tryin' to stop m, e shut me down block me
Make motherfuckas boycott me
But that will never happen, it's impossible
I move straight through all obstacles
They say I'm fuckin' up the minds of little kids
But half of my fans are in college
P.M.R.C. suck my dick, please
You can kiss my ass while you're on your knees
Word! You're listening to the verbal assassinator
E's the crossfader, your factual updater
Until your cranium grows like uranium
Hard as titanium, parents, I'm blamin'em
For teachin' you lies about life, racist viewpoints
And other trite bullshit they learned back in the day
While I learned about death from an A.K.
But they'll never quite understand
Bam, bam, bam, no gat is the Walkman
Boom, bash, yeah, yo, it's goin' down

But when you got inside the sight straightened your curls
Cause as you look around all you could see were girls
I love ladies
I think it's time that I tell the truth
I been dissin' females since my early youth
But you know that's a drag and there's no doubt
Cause females are the one thing that I can't do without
Female companionship is my one vice
I love to buy the girls things, love to treat 'em real nice
Homeboys you must admit the best part of each day
Is when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way
Females possess that one commodity that no man will ever have
Not that hangs around me
They got it, we want it, they move it, and flaunt it
They shake it and sway it, we'll die just to lay it
We try to suppress it until they undress it
And beg 'em to use it, and cry not to lose it
No man can deny it so don't even try it!
I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeah!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeah!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!)
I'm junkie for females and that's a fact
I'm not into havin' my homeboys rubbin' my back
Don't dig goin' to the movies alone
Or talkin' to myself on the telephone
Goin' to a disco that's packed with men
That's like tryin' to get a dance in the federal pen
Walkin' through a park with a gang of the guys
And a beach full of fellas never opened my eyes
And man if females are one thing that you don't need
You better get away from me at a high rate of speed
'Cause if you don't like them you must like men
And homeboy that's where our serious problems begin
Because to me women are God's true gift
There's absolutely no question who I'd rather be with
I love ladies
I seen this fly girl walkin' down the street
Jammin' a box rockin' to the beat
The girl looked pretty, she really looked nice
So I said to myself she's got to be with the Ice
Walked over to her, started sayin' my rhyme
She said ""Ice you're so bad, you damn near blew my mind""
I kept on rappin', runnin' my mouth
The next thing I knew I was at her house
Looked at her closely, said for goodness sake
The girl was cut like a diamond, had curves like a snake
Her top half was heaven, the bottom was the hell
I knew tonight that the Ice was gonna rock well
But then she started talkin' mess about love and romance
Until she noticed the bulge growin' in my pants
You should'a seen the girl's eyes as my body expanded
She grabbed for my leg, raw sex she demanded
My knees started knockin', I tried to run
She said ""Please don't leave Ice, I want you to come""
This girl meant business I had no doubt
This is just about the time that the Ice passed out
The next day I woke the girl was through
Room still smokin', my legs black and blue
My eyes bloodshot, my hair pressed straight
My knees still knockin', I knew I lost weight
She was the best y'all, yes on this earth
I would'a paid a million dollars, that's what it was worth
If I had got her name or number it would'a been nice
But I'm here to let you know the girl went off on the Ice
I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeah!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeah!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!)
No when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how
When I ask for a reply they always scream owww!
It's the homeboys always tryin' to act real chill
Sometimes it's jealous MC's mad 'cause they ain't on the bill
Maybe they scared if they say ho!
They might lose their cool
But I got some news for you: a fool's a fool
But don't get me wrong, most fellas do rock
They put their hands in the air, they take the show to the top
They start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins
They don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins
They don't lean against the wall like they're I some trance
They did not come with no intention to party or dance
You know what? yo dead beats should just stay home
Leave me, my homeboys, and the ladies alone
We love ladies"
46,I Must Stand,1996,VI: Return of the Real (1996),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Nobody ever said life was gon' be easy
But damn...
Just a kid, moms died when I was seven
Pops died, eleven, what's up with heaven?
It's hell when you're an orphan at a early age
This impressionable stage, no love breeds rage
In the heart of a child who never knew his roots
Looked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eel-skin boots
Parkin Caddies on the sidewalk, gangsta talk
Truckin diamonds and gold
Rubberbands around the bankrolls
Fly girls to make your head spin
Seemed they partied all night long
I was like, ""Put me on""
But they said, ""Little fellow, run and go play
Take your butt to school or else you'll have to be like us one day""
I didn't understand, but I tried to get a job
While all the players got the girls 'cause they'd hustle and rob
I was like makin' 'bout 1-50 a week
And after taxes, you know what that is - lunch meat
And I know I can be better than this
I gotta get me a car, man
I gotta get a girl
I know I can do it out there, man
I'm finna go for it, man
I gotta get some money
Word
Streets of anger, trouble and crime
I had it hard, had to sleep in my car sometime
But I never let another player see me down
I kept my front up, my gear clean
Even when checkin' minor green
Brothers knew my game was true
So I hooked up with the real crew
That knew excactly what to do
Bank jobs and jewels, quick to flex with tools
Pimpin' hoes on the block
Checkin' cash non-stop
Crack spots, armor with interior bars
No lie, I used to own 'bout 15 cars
Every piece Fila made
Drape my women in suede
Pavet Piaget, Cesar's Palace holidays
It was on, crazy out of control
We made up the word 'ballin', that was how we rolled
But the FBI had a-whole-nother idea
It's called multiple indictments for hundreds of years
What
Daff is dead?
Carter got 25 years?
Nah...
Spike 35 to life?
Nah, don't tell me B.O.'s dead, man
I don't wanna hear that, man
I was just with him
The game is vicious, no retirement, you die young
Listen to a fake, he might tell you to grab a gun
I get phone calls from condemned row
Brothers I ran with, brothers I really know
They tell me, ""Ice you got much love in the pen
You're the one that got away, don't wanna see you in""
They tell me, ""Tell the little homies the deal
Don't let 'em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel""
I marched two million strong in D.C.
Lookin' eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me
Damn, my mind was twisted in my hustlin days
But God spared me, I got a baby son to raise
And bein black ain't easy, prejudice is real
But health and liberty is all we need for us to build
We gotta come together, unseparated
Check yourself like I did, blackman, because we're all related"
47,I'm Your Pusher,1988,Power (1988),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record's revolvin'
Evil's the mixer, I'm the rap trixister
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, coolin', yo colder than ever
Punk executioner E pull the lever
Rotate the wax tehn cut an'axe the tracks
Push up the levels till the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
I'm sellin' dope in each and every record store
I'm the king pin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high?Let the record play
MC Ice t
I'm your pusher
I know you're lovin' this drugs as it's comin' out your speaker
Bass through the bottons, highs through the tweeters
But this base you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep your hype
Groovin' like I see you doin'
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high, why?..that ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
>From sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T
I'm your pusher
I'm bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up
You want it?..I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot'em up
Cops found'em in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean'em up with no ivory soap
I leave'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope
Because you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give, makes me invincible
I'm your pusher
The cops don't know what to do, because my dope breaks through
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut, then removes it
IZ checks for purity, then approves it
And then you get it, try it, and like it
And if it ain't potent, we remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Because if you're doin' crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope, come look in my trunk
The dope I'm sellin' is life,100% legit
So get real fool, and try some real hit

Cause the Syndicate's throwin' that crazy dick
Punk motherfuckers run up
You'll get done up
We'll have your ass gunned up
Before sun-up
So what's the color I'm raggin?
Been a millionare for years
Still saggin
Left pocket's stuffed with the huge-ass grip
.380 in my right so it sags a little bit
More than the rest of my gear
When I'm on tour
I empty clips
Bust lips
And break jaws
'Cause I love to loc up
So punk motherfucker don't choke up
When you're talkin' to me
Ice, Ice motherfuckin T (x4)
Bush, Quayle and Clinton got a problem with me:
The motheruckin T
I give less than a fuck about any of them
Or their fuckin' police friends
They'd like to take me out
Make me a goner
They even tryin' to sweat Time Warner
Why?
For tellin' the truth to the youth
That a lot of motherfuckers are hot
And want police shot?
You can't stop the shock (?)
The fires are out
But the coals are still hot
I got juice to bring pain
You tryin' to fuck with the Ice
Are you insane?
This shit is bigger than me
Be warned
It's the calm before the storm
And every fuckin' thing I write
Is gonna be analyzed by somebody white
Run motherfucker, hide motherfucker, trip motherfucker, die motherfucker
You don't give love
And you won't get loved
You don't push
And you won't get shoved
No joke
I ain't here to laugh
I ain't here to cry
But every night of the week
One of my homies die
Eeny meeny mynie moe
Blood's pourin out the naps of your afro
It could be you
Could be you
Could be you
Could be your whole damn crew
It happens real quick
Screechin tires
Next thing you're hit
Your body's cold
Your body's hot
You feel your chest
You gasp for breath
You're shot
And now your homies is trippin'
Lookin' for a gat to put they clip in
Street crime-
That's the thing I bring, Ice-T
I rap, B.C. I sing
They call it controversy
I call it truth with no mercy
The beats are phat Ammo Dump tracks
The kind that make speakers crack
Not made for squares
Or the weak punks
That made the bump trunks
Press-
Get the fuck out my fuckin' face
I ain't got no more time to waste
A ho is a ho, a bitch is a bitch, a nigga is a nigga
And that's it
I'm through explainin the shit
You just makin' me backtrack
The next duck reporter might get hit with a blackjack
Plus
Every one of my true fans
Totally understands
A nigga like me"
49,Ice's Exodus,1999,The Seventh Deadly Sin (1999),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Yeah, This is Ice-T
You've just been listening to the Seventh Deadly Sin
To me the Seventh Deadly Sin is hardcore rap And I'm very proud to have been a part of that throughout the years
I'd like to send peace out to all my homeboys that kept it real And love to all my niggas that have died out here
In this bullshit that we call the streets
You know? What can I say? Hip Hops been good to a nigga
I got my niggas The Top Guns here I got mad love for the East coast, West coast, North and South
We gonna sign this one off like this:
Should I ill or do right? Make peace or go raw?
My life's been a great story in the ultimate war I can't explain the true penalties of fame and the wealth
Tell me who can I trust? I can't trust myself Got the devil got me thinking 'bout them ill moves
Every damn kid on the street, they got something to prove
Push a bullet through my heart, why not? That's a start They could push their reps quicker, kill a well known nigga
And if you say you're going to kill me, should I blast you first?
Being black is kinda like being born with a curse
Do or Die, that's the code of the streets I didn't invent
Niggas sketch my life out with malicious intent My skin color's got me trapped in a never ending ghetto
I move to the hills, but I can never let go The gun shots and the homicides just don't stop
And just because I came up, I can always drop Never scared soldiers to the heart
Yo... we come prepared for guerilla warfare
And hose them body parts with the hardwear You spark a dun with Bizzaro or sequel When you catch a link on the wings of this desert eagle
Flappin, we splittin caps friend
Remember when niggas would shoot joints
Now niggas be wildin' placing hollow points Cause in this rat race, shit be moving at a murderous pace
Mad sons got slugs to the face, OG packs kilos
Over sore losers and cilo, prepare like a scout
I hold the burner on the delo
In this age of idolatry, mad niggas worship you vanity If Five ?? you nigga maintain humanity - insanity
Hope you see the light - like the prism's true colors Only a few remain brothers, fuck the others In this cold world - the war that's controlled by the trigger
Revelation or the scripture got to be that live nigga
So if niggas want to bite the sound like Tyson
Deck him in the left eye, murder sit down like ryerson
You wanna dis, don't even try son
Hey yo, Pizzone - I'm the prodigy you need to keep ya eyes on
50 mill strong, Handle like napalm. Word is bond
Yo who the don, who plays it all night long?
Who get it on when it's time to drop a bomb?
Sadq keep it cool and calm with the niapalm
Droppin' emcee's to their knees and make them pie straight
Dust and take and serve niggas on my hot plate
So cats who got beef, we can take it to the streets
Cause shit these niggas talk to the grave with they teeth
It's time to meet your maker step into the new millennium
I analyze data like intel Pentium
So follow me, I blame sovereignty for God we bust
Top Gun, move bright, smooth as Ice, sex and dust
I'm 15 blocks deep in the foreign neighborhood
Ante up the goods, Top Gun Ice-T in your neck of the woods
Street of my styles, no smiles, trying to gun down the golden child Still on trial for my old endeavors Cold weather got catched trying to buck wholes in my fucking sweater
Niggas is soft like butter, leathers and felt
Felt the welts from brass belt buckles to brass knuckles
Time to heat it up and melt My fam stay thick together
Kill all the jokes and chuckles - let's all get together
Trick off and lick off together No matter the weather Lets ease on down to the bow and to the bricks
When I start to squeeze, I won't ease off a bit
Just bunk mile sleds boot shines up in the masses
Won't be no teams up in here with no clashes
When I'm in LA, it ain't hard to find me
Life got no guarantees, I'm looking for the long lease
21st floor eating shrimp at Belonte's Every time you see me I'm connected to a dime piece
I check your styles, although you rhyme quicker
No matter what you do, I'll always lace mine thicker
Watch your back with your niggas
Jealousy will make a fool die quicker than liquor
Cause that's right where they'll stick ya
You see me in the club jeweled up, all alone
I give love to my homies, then I bounce the fuck home
Bodyguards are something that I just don't do 'Cause if I'm after you black, I'm gonna clap them too Money makes all my homies look brand new
I don't fuck with the fakes, I make moves with the true
Ice - baby chopping that real, thought you knew
I might sound hard, but nigga I can die too 'Cause I'm as real as you"
50,Inside Of A Gangsta,1996,VI: Return of the Real (1996),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Yeah
This is Ice-T
I'ma slow it down for a minute
I wanna talk to all the ladies out there
I got my man J-e-ll in the house
I got a message I wanna send out to all the fly ladies, yeah
Check me out
(VERSE 1: Ice-T)
It's time for me to kick game
And if I can't do it, then ladies, Ice ain't my name
Now real brothers ain't easy to understand
And it's a long hard road to become a man
Drama seeks and chases him through every year
His homie dies, you might see him shed a tear
But mostly hardcore feelings are all you see
Cause you gotta be raw to be called a gee
But every man slows down
You'll see this side when there's probably no one around
And there's no safer place
Than if you ever are some gee's homebase
But it ain't easy, these brothers got barricades around the hearts
It's gonna take time before the trust starts
But girl, you must be true
'Cause if your man's a gee, he'll definitely die for you
Look him deep in his eyes, let him know you're there
Show him that you really care
Trust me, you move with time
Through the darkened halls of his mind
You just might find
(Bobby Ross Avila)
The me inside of a gangsta
Yo, Jell
You know what I'm sayin'?
I try to represent for all the brothers out there
And I know my latin homies have the same drama with they girls, man
Won't you let 'em know how it's goin' down
(VERSE 2: Jell)
Man, I'm lookin' for a hina that's down
But you don't have to be brown
If you wanna hang around
All you gotta do is stay in check
'Cause if you're rubbin me right
Then you can bet you'll get respect
And that's why I guess my feelings will have to show
How can you hide somethin' that's in your soul?
Cause there's more to the l-o-c
Than all the violence, baby, that ain't who I be
I know my dogs and me can still pull straps
But I rather have you rollin' in my Cadillac
'Cause when we cruisin, thangs is all good
And that goes for every vato in the hood
Now sometimes it's hard to show the other side
Especially when my crew is caught up in a homicide
Cause East L.A. don't play
And if I had my way
I'd kick it with you everyday
(Ice-T)
Whether black or brown, the situation's the same
Different hoods, but the same game
Some girls won't take their time
Others will stroll through our souls and find

53,Intro/Rhyme Pays,1987,Rhyme Pays (1987),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"A child was born in the East one day
Moved to the West coast after his parents passed away
Never understood his fascination with rhymes or beats
In poetry he was considered elite
Became a young gangster in the streets of L.A.
Lost connections with his true roots far away
But no matter the job or crime
He never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme
New York's hip hop movement broke loose
DJ's cut records, raps had the juice
Since busting rhymes was his natural thing
He was crowned the west coast MC king
But after his inauguration there was a rush
Of wack rappers with one intention to crush
This master rapper and take his throne
A simple job, he had no crew, he stood all alone
Assassins came in groups of one through five
With raps no mortal MC could survive
But he showed no mercy, he rapped blood thirsty
Battling from Friday on through to Thursday
Never losin a bout, never ending in doubt
Every confrontation K.O. knock out
On his never ending journey to the T.O.P.
The L.A. player M.C. ICE-T
(Verse One)
Magnificent rhymer, I'm the ill beat designer
If they ask you if I'm def, don't front and say kinda
Merciless, meticulous, so fresh it's ridiculous
I'm raised in the heart of Los A-N-G-E-L-E-S
King word connector, the vocal projector
Your girl tried to jock me, I had to reject her
Always adventurous voice some say is sensuous
Now, I'm on the mic so I think I better mention this
I don't like Gucci, Fila, Louie or Fendi
Those are fads and I ain't trendy
But whether your name's Lucy, Terry, Laura or Cindy
Ice got beef and this ain't Wendy's
Bust a move while I'm talkin'
Sucker rappers I be stalkin'
When they see me on the street with my homeboy walkin'
They slow down, turn around and ask was that Ice?
Then they see me cold countin' my cash
Rhyme pays!
(Verse Two)
Moves must be busted, girls can't be trusted
I looked at your lady and I was disgusted
Came into the party just to rock the place
And your big zombie lookin' freak still won't get out of my face
I don't mean to diss her, but do you kiss her?
Look at her lips, she got them crazy blisters
Body that smells like the New York mets
Arm pits all nappy packed full of sweat
I hope this something that you never forget
Tie that freak outside next time you come in the set
Because my jams be crazy, packed with all fly ladies
I'm talkin' def girlies and I don't mean maybe
The way I rhyme no one will ever slay me
And I ain't lyin' rhyme do pay me!
Rhyme pays!
(Verse Three)
I'm notorious, I'm infamous, like a snake I'm venomous
For those who may diss I think you should consider this
I can make a rhyme complicated as a puzzle
Dangerous and as violent as a pit bull in a muzzle
But this record is for radio S-T-E-R-E-O
It not to be banned or for some underground mix show
My hearts in my pen every time I begin
Sometimes my lyrics go crazy and I just can't control 'em my friend
I try to edit what I'm rappin' about
But I can't write polite my anger just jumps out!
Perpetrators in the business claim their hard as hell
Talkin' that gangster shit, know'n they're soft as jell-
Oh! I better chill out before I ill out
And my negative potential just might spill out
And then this record won't be gettin' played
I'll save that rap for another day
-Rhyme pays-
(Verse Four)
The front stage area goes into hysteria
As I start to rhyme and unleash my criteria
Of what is to come during the beat of the drum
And Evil agitates the records with the use of his thumb
Using his intricate moves, the record stays in the groove
My boy cuts like Jason, it's easy to prove
That Evil E is the great, his cuts are real not fake
Not emulated effects or a play back tape
So suckers witness your fate while Evil demonstrates
I'm bout to get off this mic, E., dog the break - Kick it!
(Verse Five)
Like me if ya want'a, diss me if you're gonna
But my jam will still be kickin' on your neighborhood corner
As my bass is max'n out the V.U.S. on your box
There'll be no doubt within your mind whether this MC do rock
Like granite, I planned it, So you could understand it
If someone's talkin' when I'm rhymin'
Then just say, ""Damn shut up!""
While Ice is breakin' the boy don't be fakin'
Maybe they're just jealous of the dollars I'm makin'
But you're down with me. You know god gifted me
Black kids say I'm trech, white kids say I'm nifty
Spell out my name ya go I-C-E T
But right now it's time for Evil E to hit me!
(Verse Six)
Rhyme pays, buys my food every night and day
It pays my rent my bills I guess I'm doin' ok
But when I say rhyme pays, I mean in different ways
Cause rappin' gets a lot of kids out of the streets each day
It makes me feel real nice when someone likes the Ice
Or some young MC asks me for advice
But there will always be rappers who hate Ice T
Maybe I dogged 'em in a battle or just jealousy
Inevitable situation, sucker rapper frustration
I rhyme too tough to bite, too intricate for notation
Syllables jumble, competitors crumble as they witness mic attack
And the microphone rumbles like hurricane
I maim, sometimes I go insane
Step toward my rap and I inflict the pain!
No shame Ice capital T's my name!
Damn there I go illin' out again!
Rhyme pays"

The organization say they can't stay in business with us any longer
What you gonna do?

We always knew we were gonna come to this point sooner or later...
We have absolutely no option but to move forward.
We'll have to set up our own distribution, manufacturing,
Run a totally independent organization and operation.
We still got our connections in Texas, Miami, New York, Chicago,
Detroit, and soldiers on the street willing to die.
I can't put any cut on the product...
I just can't live like that.
But from now on if any cops get in our way... (5 gunshots)
(Ice-T)
Turn up the mic dog, so I can get off
Find me Charlton Heston and I might cut his head off
I'm not to be fucked with
Step in the range of my Gauge and get bucked quick
Niggas, hoes, I don't know who you are, my friends or foes
Smile in my face and plot to kill me behind doors
I got a new attitude, no trust
Got me in a corner all a nigga can do is bust
It may be you
There's gonna be a lot of dead before I'm through
I'm 'bout to break off niggas who play me and dis' me
Try to switch from side to side like they whip me
The damage is done
Source Magazine, you're the first one {*gunshot*}
You try to dis Chuck, Cube and me
How the fuck you pick us 3?
You punk motherfuckers ain't shit, you're just a bunch of hoes
Makin' money off the pros
And when I see I get you in my sights
I give your ass a story to write
'Cause it's on
It's on
(Chorus: Ice-T)
It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed
Bang! Bang! Bang! Cause it ain't no thang
To put in work and watch your head burst **a gunshot**
(Ice-T)
A lot of fans ain't shit
Let me repeat
A lot of fans ain't shit
Quick to flip if our group don't hit
They don't make you nothin' but a pop ho bitch
And I don't need ya
I love to bleed ya
All I ever wanted was a real nigga's praise
But the sad motherfuckin' fact
Is that ain't that many real motherfuckers these days
Game knows game I know too many who plays the name
And I can make it in the music or the street game
I still got hoes that'll work, still got crews that'll hit
Still roll with an extra clip
And those who think they'll stop me, doubt it
Those motherfuckers better think about it
You'd best to let me rap
Ice back on the streets?
You don't want that
'Cause I break ill
And you really after body count the caps I peel, it's on
(Chorus: Ice-T)
It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed
Bang! Bang! Bang! Cause it ain't no thing
To put in work and watch your body jerk
It's on
(Ice-T)
It's on motherfucker you goddamn right
It's on, my royalty cheque, yeah, fool, I write my own
I own my own label put my own shit out
So no one tells me what the fuck to talk about
And all the suckas that said I was through
You need to wake up to my view
I'm fallen off
Ha! Ha! That's a joke!
You motherfuckers are still unknown and broke
And I'm stankin' rich
My fuckin' maid lives better than you, bitch
So shut your trap
When it comes to this level of game, you don't know jacks
Cia, fbi, irs
Try to flip us out for sweat
But they'll never sweat you son
'Cause you're broke and you're dumb and you're no threat to no one
Them fools don't play
I gotta deal with those motherfuckers every day
They'd love to get me behind bars
They hawk a nigga like I'm Carlos Escobar
But in a way I am
Been puttin' dope on the street for years and don't give a damn
So I'm thinkin' about them, friend
The real motherfuckin gangstas wanna see me end
It's gonna end up in a bloodbath, no doubt
That's the only way I'm going out, it's on
(Chorus: Ice-T)
It's on
It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed
Bang! Bang! Bang! Cause it ain't no thing
To put in work and watch your head burst
It's on"
55,Killers,1993,The Classic Collection (1993),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"A man took an ad on TV
To enrol in the police academy
He's very talented, outstanding proof
From his clean-cut appearance to the shine on his boots
When it comes to graduation, he's number one
An expert with a rifal and also a gun
Three weeks on the beat and his weak nerves crack
And fires four warning shots into a kid's back
KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! the coldhearted killers
KILLERS! bloodthirsty killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers
A young girl marries an older man
With more money than you can understand
He smouthers her with pearls and jewellery
And they both seemed as happy as they could be
But three months later, she's sad but content
Seems he had an unexpected accident
The girl said he would be hard to forget
As the papers interviewed her while she flew his jet
KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! she was the killers
KILLERS! the coldhearted killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers
It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name
An young man loses his only job
To proud to hustle, too honest to rob
He goes to tell his family an his wife
But an argument breaks out, she grabs a knife
Tempers esculate to a total rage
Shots burst out from a loaded twelve-gauge
They call it mass murder, suicide
But somebody tell me why the kids had to die
KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! the coldhearted killers
KILLERS! bloodthirsty killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers
Vietnam vet, home from the war
Can't get a job in a candy store
Unemployment hurts and he's living proof
So to take out his frustration, he climbs on the roof
He shows no pity as victims are shot
The only thing to stop him are the bullets from SWAT
Ten people died on a sunny day
But tell me who taught him how to shoot that way
KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! you know the killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers
KILLERS! are you a killer?
It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name
A known criminal is sentenced to death
Now the legal system controls his last breath
He tries to fight execution with petitions and pleas
And a pardon from the governor is all he needs
He cries out for mercy but nothing's spared
And on his day of termination, he's strapped in a chair
High voltage fills his body in a ... jail
And all of the people of vengeance grail

Georgie-Porgie-Pudding-and-pie
Couldn't get a girl, let me tell you all why
He tried to be down like all the rest
Had girls in his hair, gold on his chest
He rolled around town in a coup deville
But he had no money, he was broke as hell
Ladies love money and he needed more
So he tried to steal something out a liquor store
But before Georgie-Porgie could get away
The man pulled out his gun and blew him away

57,Lethal Weapon,1989,The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say (1989),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,":
E-V-I-L E and Ice-T are on a jack move
Layin down the dope groove, smokin' those who disapprove
Wreckin the deck, you'll regret if you cross punk
Rollin' like a Mack truck, waxin those who talk junk
Violent your end, I got your face in my crosshairs
Wanna see your dome bust sucker 'cause I don't care
Nuttin 'bout you, your crew, because you talk shit
I'm the lethal weapon boy, ridin' the apocalypse
If you're in my way, then lay beneath the ground soon
Violence is my business fool, the microphone of doom
Mission that's to cure all punks as I bust caps
Peelin your back, my ammunition hollow-point raps
You try to run, that makes it even more fun
I just cold lamp and vamp you with the shotgun
Cops try to flex but guns they'll never find
My Lethal Weapon's my mind
:
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'
:
You hit the deck as rap busts from my lips
You think I'm finished - I load another clip
Look in my face, I crack an evil grin
Lyrics bring death from the microphone Mac-10
Sucker MC's, you ain't down with The Syndicate
Try to kick game, but end up talkin' weak shit, yo
You're weak, you're wack, you need to quit you lil punk bitch
Do it with your mother, go dig a damn ditch
Get out my face, I'm tired of the press too
You write about me, I write about you
You think I'm violent but listen and you will find
My Lethal Weapon's my mind
:
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'
:
Up against the wall - it's Valentine's Day
The Massacre's about due for a replay
I'm about to explode - like a hand grenade
Evil E do damage on the crossfade
Cuts like a battleaxe
You try to bite, get iced, my raps are boobytraps
Claim of mine, designed by the Ice himself
You beg for mercy as you read the hand you're dealt
Cause there's no let up, you walked into a set up
It's suckin you down and now you can't get up
Why because you froze the moment we met up
And I never run punk, I go head up
I ain't no fool and new jack poppin' fake rap
I rap from the heart and soul, where only facts are kept
Many rappers sell-out pop and other MC's slept
I ain't in no playin' mood, so nigga watch your step
'Cause if you cross the boss, you go to bed quick
Know my situation boy, don't diss The Syndicate
'Cause when we choose to move you're gone
And no remains they'll find
My Lethal Weapon's my mind
:
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'
:
More bodies than John Gotti, the lethal weapon is slaying
Just open any book, that's ammo to the brain
What really matters, is how well is your weapon trained
Some would say genius, while others would say insane
The Weapon power has been witnessed upon my page
From Martin Luther's ""dream"", to Hitler's psycho rage
What's more powerful - the brain or a twelve gauge?
The words I speak have scared many people to this stage
But promote violence, I really have to disagree
It's entertainment, like ""Terminator"" on TV
But some'll never see, you're stupid ignorant and blind
The Lethal Weapon's the mind
:
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'

The mind

The lethal weapon
The lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'

Think
The mind
You know what I'm sayin?
I got my jammy with me at all times
You know what I'm sayin?
They can't take this one thing away from me
That's got more power than any gun in the world
You know what I'm sayin?
I'm talkin' 'bout brain power homeboy
They can't mess with me 'cause I'm too smart for them out there
You know what I'm sayin?
Fully strapped, always packed
Go to the library and get some more ammo
You know what I'm sayin?"
58,Lifestyles Of The Rich And Infamous,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"It's eight a.m. I roll out my silk sheets
Get fly crash the limo back seats
Lookin' in the faces
Of some ladies that I never met
On the interview tip, no sweat
They ask me questions
I throw the words back
They say they write facts
I know that's bull crap
They're kickin' drama
But then drama's my middle name
That's the price ya pay for big fame
The cellular phone rings
Dot wanta pick it up
But it's my J-O-B I gotta kick it up
Another damn reporter
On the line with a word quiz
I gotta show 'cause I'm livin' with the show
Biz. Out the llimo, to the plane
In the pourin' rain
I hate flyin'
But there's no time for slow trains
Another show to do
I gotta caatch my crew
They left last night
In the bus around two
The plane's a small one
No fun at all
Bouncin' round the air
Like a tennis ball
When it touches down
I wanna kiss the ground
But it's time to wreck a new town
Get to the arena, meet up with the crew
They tell me all the speakers blew
The cordless don't work
Sound man's a jerk
Somebody's gonna get hurt
I'm crazy mad
But my fans want autographs
I turn my angry frowns
Into fake laughs
I can't be rude
'Cause they wouldn't understand
I in't human no more, I'm a superman
You can try
But you'll never understand this
You can try
But you'll never understand this
You can try
But you'll never understand this
The lifestyles of the rich a and infamous
Four hours till show time oh well
I might as well check in the hotel
Get a little rest
Before it's time to play
Ten brothers standin' in the hallway
All with demo tapes
They need the hook up
They heard that I was
The one to look up
I can't ditch 'em
'Cause they already saw me
I'll put my head down
Maybe they'll ignore me
No chance ""Ice what's goin' on?""
I listened to twenty-five songs
And after thaat
The brothers still wouldn't leave
They started lookin' at my TV
I was gonna break down
If they didn't jet soon
Snuck across the hall
And crashed in E's room
But then this freak came in
Thought I was E
Straddled her legs across me
Ripped off her blouse
Pushed her breast against my face
Started girating her waist. Sounds fly,
Like a hype sex thriller?
But see she looked like Godzilla
Pushed her off me
Home girl hit the floor
This is what it's like on tour
I hit the hallway it was crawlin' thick
""Could we take this picture real quick?""
Jumped into a pose
That I used a million times before
Took pictures
With the whole damn floor
I couldn't say no not to my fans
You see they wouldn't understand
Now it's show time, time to flow time
Evil lost the records
But we still gotta go time
The house is packed
Everybody's on their feet
So I say, ""Throw on Rakim's beat.""
E hits the fader and the crowd is lit
I start bustin' off some new shit
The stage is so smokey
That I almost fall off, I start inhalin' it
I'm tryin' not to cough
I'm catchin' problems from every angle
The mic cords are tangled
I try to flow smooth
But my words are mangled
Damn near slipped and broke my ankle
If that ain't enough
The police are hawkin'
Listenin' real close
To the words I'm talkin'
They wanna put a brother like me
In the back seat
Just because I curse the beat
They wanna tap my phone
Wanna keep my crib bugged
Call all my homes
Felonist street thugs
You might say
I think this lifestyle sucks?
I wouldn't tade it for a million bucks
Although it's all
Not glamour and gleam
It's still my dream"

So the girls can get busy, dog the dance floor
Make the guys get dizzy
(Make it funky)
Totally def as Evil E guts the records and the beat is kept
(Make it funky)
Stupid fly, it's got to the F-U-N-K why?
So that you can get loose as I produce sounds hard as the deuce
Manipulate the bass gain give the level's a boost
The lyric layer rhyme sayer, born to be player
If politics were my kick then I'd be your mayor
Governator, Senator, I'm your mentor
Rap rhythm is erratic, time is four, four
I'm the microphone scholar, clockin' long dollars
Here to make the place funky while the fly girls holler
Genius vocalist, rhyme style priceless
Pound of gold around my neck, mic in my first
The microphone virtuoso crazy insane I'm loco
With the speed to exceed, make other MC's look slow mo
Un-lease release words mean as a beast
I eat MC's for lunch and dinner, I can serve for a feast
Their rhymes are elementary, mine deserve a PH D
This beat is F-U-N-Key my name is Ice-T
Make it funky
Undoubtedly you recognize this jam is the ultimate cut
Uncontrollably you motivate and move your butt
It's rough the beat is gangsterous, call it tough
If you're diss'n stop frontin', come on what's up?
Complicated voice gymnastics are all in your face
Vegas got my highs, E.V's got control my bass
My break is comin' get busy no time ta waste
Now's the time do body work here's the place
Make it funky
Make it funky enough so the tracks lay tough
'Cause I'm tossin' it up and the Ice don't bluff
The girl charmer toy Harmer, juice strong as armor
When I stand upon the stage you could call it melodrama
Intense suspense my voice emcee
I wouldn't have you come and see me under false pretense
The girlies do be wild'n'as I'm profilin'
Limos lined around the block for about a mile'n'a half
Autographs the list goes on
If you forgot it ""make it funky"" is the name of this song
Stupid dope and you know it, it rates a ten
You pray my DJ cuts the records so it starts again
'Cause I can keep the mic cookin' for an entire month
My rhymes are always hard hittin' I don't know how to bunt
My DJ cuts like a laser E-V-I-L-E
Put your finger on the records
Make it, Make it funky
Make it funky"
61,Make The Loot Loop,1996,VI: Return of the Real (1996),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Yeah
This is goin' out to all those muthafuckas
That like to use the word 'gangster'
Although I am the O.G.
I'm representin that hustlin game
To the end, nigga
I'm tryin' to make the loot loop
I ain't no muthafuckin gangsta, wish you'd quit callin me that
Although I still pack straps I roll in Benzes and Lacs
Best believe the gats in my promo shots ain't props
I hang out sunroof tops and pop glocks at cops
(Yo, how ya livin'?) On the mellow, coolin with my fellow
Hustlers, players, super bitch-layers
Mackaronies on the true d-l - hell, most
Fuckin' with my niggas you could end up ghost
I made a million, got my shit out pawned
Bailed out the homies, now the shit's back on
Moved out the ghetto, 'cause I hate it
But I roll through your fuckin' hood and regulate it
'Cause I wasn't born to be broke, I let the .45th smoke
Before I let my baby boy go under, no wonder
I'm addicted to the cash flow, stacks of green
Flashback, I'm nudgin weights down a triple beam
I'ma make the loot loop
As fast as I spend it
I'm tryin' to get back in it
I make the loot loop
It's cop and blow
Nigga, that's all I know
I make the loot loop
As fast as I spend it
I'm tryin' to get back in it
I make my loot loop
Nigga
I'm tryin' to make my bank roll bigger
I must admit, I got a lust for loot, quick to shoot
Ostrich, fruits and Austin Martin coupes
Fill my dreams with cream, I got wet sheets
I'm bustin' nuts over currency, kid, fuck freaks
We be the niggas in the back of the club with the Moët
Bitches, shrimps, mackin like pimps
Wearin fly shit you never seen before (raw)
I turn a angel to a whore, now need I say more?
My perm got bounce, fuck a 40 ounce
I'm sippin Cristal, pal, and represent I shall
To the end of the game
(That nigga Ice got fame)
And just not over these beats
But on the 4-wheel streets
I make the loot loop
Say what you will, I'm the fool on the hill
With the pool, jaccuzzi, laser-beam Uzi
Niggas in LA know the Ice don't play
I'm just a savage for the cabbage and a pimp parlay
I rock a million with the jewels on the paw (don't start)
Cause my niggas ain't the big ones, just big guns
Pushin the limits of this game till I gets my piece
I put my true queen Darlene in a white Corniece
So stay broke if you wanna, hang out on your corner
Step back from the curb when we roll up on ya
20 black cars all tinted, we meant it
'Syndicate forever - posse of the clever'
Rubberbands strap the fat green knots
We're strictly hustlers not gangsters, but we still lick shots
For the goal
Peace, I'm out like Nicole
(Get down
Get down)
Nigga
The bank's getting bigger
Yeah
I'm makin' the loot loop
Straight player for life
Yeah
Hustler's side"
62,Message To The Soldier,1993,Home Invasion (1993),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Yo, Ice, you been down with the struggle for a long time, man...
Why don't you drop some knowledge for these brothers who
Want to get involved in this war...
Take notes: real gangstas wear trench coats
Grey suits, black ties and they seek votes
And you're not to be misled
They'll kill you in your fuckin' bed
They don't sell dope, yo, excuse me, yes they do
But they don't look that much like me or you
But if you pull up the sheets and expose them
They'll crawl up like snakes and show fangs of venom
Now I've been soldier for years
Representin' the tattooed tears
Other brothas locked up with no choice
Left in the bowels of devil with no voice
My phones are tapped, my crib is bugged
My car is tailed from club to club
And this ain't no fuckin' joke
They want to see a nigga broke
You can't slip, if you slip you're out
You gotta know what you're talkin' about
Drop science every chance you get
Hit direct and indirect, speak in code
'Cause you're never alone
That's why I use this low tone
Follow this and you might grow older
This is a message to the soldiers...
Now they killed King and they shot X
Now they want me, you could be next
All you gotta do is speak too loud
All you gotta be is be too proud
Cause once you let'em know
Who you are and where you're at
You better watch your back
Cause you might think you're just dope
While you're livin' in a sniper's scope
I'm not tryin' to scare you
But there's a danger if you get too deep
Some nights I don't sleep
All you wanna do is tell the truth
All you wanna do is save the youth
Ice Cube knows, Souljah knows, P.E. knows
They throw death blows
And if you got kids or a girl that's true
They'll move on them too
But when I'm gone I need you to carry on
You gotta be strong and fight for our salvation
But there will be retaliation, soldier...
To think that rap could be attacked
Is ignorin' the simple fact
That they never meant us to speak
They had planned to keep the black man weak
But rap hit the streets
Black rage amplified over dope beats
Now they want to shut us down
And they don't fuck around
Check the history books, son
Black leaders die young
They tell us that your words are scary
They're revolutionary
Because we speak the truth
About crime and drugs
And expose the real thugs
This info is not beneficial
To the groups that go by three initals
So they try to discredit
They'll dog you with an edit
Print the words the way you never said it
But we gotta make'em regret it, soldiers...
Word! I know a lot of brothas out there want to get in this war...
You know what I'm sayin' a lot of sistas got a lot of knowledge
To drop on our people but right now they're movin' to shut down
All hip-hop! The first amendment had absolutely nothin' to do
With black people at the time constitution was written, we were
Considered nothin' but property... The expectation of havin' black
People speak on records never came to mind, so we gotta move!
But believe me all the black leaders have been silenced and most
Of the time it's been violent so if you choose to get in this war,
Realize what you're in for but we gotta move on...
And we gotta stay strong...
Message to the soldiers, welcome to the struggle...
Message to the soldiers, be careful, soldiers..."
63,Mic Contract,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Brainstorm microphone napalm
This is it, words from a timebomb
Attack speed, fast as an F15
Raise the heat, light thhe gasoline
Overload, it might cause a blackout
Dead end
There's no chnce to back out
Hit the tripwire
Duck from the gunfire
Broken glass, screech'n car tires, bodies hit the deck
As I commence to wreck
Eject another clip and drip sweat
Face of danger, increasin' nger
Point blank
I smoke another stranger
Grip the mic tight
I see the brake lights
Hit the back door
I lay down cross the floor
E's on the wheels
He makes the rubber squel
Blood's on my gear
From caps I've peeled
About a block away I sit up
Look back
It wasn't nothin' but a
Microphone contract!
Dressed in black I stalk my prey
Parabellum in a leather attache
Low tones I speak, I speak to few
Just give me the money
And who the fuck to do
Four blocks away my aim's clean
Night scope on a silence carbine
Place my crosshairs on my vic's eye
Squeeze the trigger
Watch the brains fly
Violent? Yeah you could call me that
Insane? You're on the right track
But turn the sounds up
So I can stay amped
Do another crew and breaak camp
The only way I sleep is in a cold sweat
You think I'm crazy?
You ain't see shit yet
'Cause I love to kill and kill for fun
The microphone goes off
Like a handgun
It's goin' down now
Grab your girl hops
No excuses when the bodies
Begin to drop
Look in my face fool
It look like I'm play'n
Don't become another
Victim of mic slayin'
What's up?
You want your feet in some concrete?
I got some brothers
That'll do you for gold teeth
But most the time I move, I move alone
Take a bat
Break your motherfuckin' dome
Shoot you dead in the face
With a sawed off
One hundred ten degrees
Ice don't get soft
'Cause I'm hard as they come
I come correct
You can't handle the vandal hit eject
If not you better get
Out my face sucka
Or else you better be
A good bullet ducker
'Cause I'm a rip shop
Tell that ass drop
Five o Ice, yo fuck a damn cop!
'Cause I move hard and cold
With a gangster stroll
Five thousand dollar suits
And fly gold
Rolex, you can't fit no more
Diamonds on it
Pinky ring, worth a house
If I decide to pwn it
What's up now punk?
Yo start to choke up?
You try to move on the Ice
You'll get broke up!
Midnight, time for a homicide
Showtime, somebody's gonna die
E hits the switch
And thouands of volts connect
With the weapon that's in my fist
I see a sucka in the third row
Try'n to riff
A paragraph and a half he's stiff
I start bustin' off barrages ear high
Mothers grab for their children
Tears fly
I'm like a psycho
In the mircrophone zone
Speakers blown, mind gone
I can't be touched
Once my lyrics begin to fly
Simple stage radiation
Could make ya die
Ya got a prob nigga
You think your rep's bigger?
Hold your heard right there
While I squeeze the trigger
'Cause I'm a crazy motherfucker
That's no joke
My favorite smell is
The aroma of gunsmoke
I'm bustin' off another
Lyrical nightmare
Parents hate the Ice!
You think that I care?
Well I don't give a fuck
'Cause I rhyme tough
Drop science, still bust the ill stuff
So now it's time for crime
And the rhyme is mine
Track the movement
Hide from the punchline
I rhyme with quickness
Microphone fitness
The assassinator
Stay off the shit list"
64,Midnight,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Midnight chillin' at A.M/P.M.
Coolin' drinkin' apple juice
In Evil's BM
The sound's up loud
To attract attention
Armoraled tires
On a lowered suspension
Nardi to steer with
Alpine deck was glowin'
Bumpinn' Big Daddy
And the nigga was definitely flowin'
I was ridin' shotgun
Donald and Hen in back
Look through the tint recognized a jack
Two brothers strolled up
Talkin' bout get out
Donald D blazed
Shot one fool through his fuckin' mouth
Why would they step
When they know we're strapped?
I never cruise L.A.
Without a Gat in my lap
The other fool shot
Caught the E in the shoulder blade
I busted through the car door
That's where the nigga laid
Hen jumped out
Dropped two nines in his forehead
Evil was bleedin' bad
The car seats were turnin' red
Looked to my left
There were two more carloads
Niggas in hats and hoods
In an attack mode
And they hadn't yet begun to fight
E hit the gas
It was one past midnight!
Take me on a walk through hell...
(Screams)
South Central
Yo, E, drive! Drive, man drive, man! Fuck it! Just get the fuck outta here, man!
We boned down Vernon
Right on Normandie
Left on Florence
Gettin' through the E.T.G.'s
Spun out on Vermont
Made a left on Colden
Right on Hoover
E where we goin'?
He didn't even answer that
Checked the rear view
They were still out back
Where were these brothers from?
What made these brothers come?
Bang! our back window
Was removed by a shotgun
Now Hen G was shot
Don caught a ricochet
These motherfuckers was ill
They didn't come to play
Bust a right turn, parked
And then we got left
Hid in the the bushes
Shot the gas tank to fake death
But would this really
Keep them psyched?
Three of us bleedin'
It was ten past midnight!
Midnight. Time for a homicide.
(Screams)
South Central
C'mon, man. You all bleedin' bad, man. You got to keep up, man, we can't stop here.
I really didn't like
How this shit was goin' down
Wrong night, wrong time
Wrong fuckin' part of town
Ya see we was deep
In the Hoover's hood
Three niggas bleedin'
That shit don't look good!
See over there red don't go
Some places red's all they know
But not our luck
Tonight we was real fucked
Broke down an alley
And we instantly had to duck
Fuckin' police on a gang sweep
No time to deal with one time
So we had to creep
Broke through a back yard
Ran through a vacant lot
E, Hen and Don kept up
To be some niggas shot
Shit was gettin' craazy
So I had to get busy
Hen was bleedin' worse
And Evil was gettin' dizzy
Looked in a parking lot
I needed a snatch bar
Had to hot wire
So I moved on an old car
It was a bucket, but fuck it, it had to do
Started it up
And scooped my whole crew
Two blocks later
We saw fuckin' blue lights
The pigs were behind us
It was half past midnight!
Take me on a walk through hell.
South Central
You all just lay down on the floor if this car, man. Fuck the police, man. I'm-a handle this.
When they pulled us over
Shit got worse
I wait utill they got out
And then I hit reverse
Fucked 'em up, I seen one cop fall
Threw it in gear, yo I'm outty y'all
Don't know how
But somehow we got away
Lost the jackers, the cops
Dumped the G.T.A.
Made it back to the hood
Fixed the crew up
And even though Evil's car blew up
We made it home and then I crashed out
Thinkin' bout my all-night death bout
Then somethin' woke me up
From my dark sleep
The sound of fuckin' police
When they're tryin' to creep
Broke through my door
With no goddamn warning
Looked at my watch
It was six in the mornin'!"
65,Mind Over Matter,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Yo Yo, 1-2 in the place to be, M.C. Ice-T, ya know wha I'm sayin'
Cold loungin' here in the new O.G. LP, you know, Original Gangsters in the House
This is goin' out to all my homeboys on the streets and all the brothers locked-down
It's been a long while
Since I hit ya with freestyle
High tech selection
From the vaults of the Ice files
Kick back, relax,
And watch as I melt wax
Don't never let a brother like me
Write a dope track
Cause once I hit it with the vocal tone
It's mine, have motherfuckers
Rush'n to rewind
'Cause I'll flow slow
And still twist your tongues up
Rock the house from night
Till the sun's up
Cause it really ain't
How much you say
It's what you sy
I got no fuckin' time on the mic
To play
I write rhymes
With addition and algebra
Mental geometry
Don't even come at me
Talk'n that weak and
Popin' that bullshit
Get out my face
A fool could get his head split
A lot of doubters
Said it couldn't be done by me
Them same suckers
Are now lookin' from under me
Wonder'n what I did
I didn't play myself kid
I respected my fans
And made the high bid
Sometimes I write my rhymes
At night and fall asleep
Wake up with new techniques
Grab the pen
And place it on some loose leaf
Nothin' soft, always the tough meat
The white paper and
Blue lines excite my mind
Not allow'n me to stop the rhyme
Until the whole motherfuckin'
Book's complete
Then I write on the
Back of the sheets
I made promise
To my brothers in street crime
We'd get paid with the use
Of a sweet rhyme
We put our minds together
Made the tracks clever
Now we're checkin'
More bank than ever
Mind over matter
(So ya got to have Mind Power, like the fellah's say...)
Mind over matter
(Mind Power)
I can drop rhymes in twos,
And threes and fours
And still have much shit
Left for encores
'Cause when my mind locks
In on a dope idea
Motherfuckin' ducks
Should stand clear
'Cause I'm a hit the topic point blank
It's jail ya better keep your shank
'Cause I got mine
And I'm out on a solo creep
(Uggga!) Your face hits the concrete
You wanna roll
With the niggas that don't play
I think you got false courge
Get out my damn way
Cause the car I'm in
Is rollin' full of men
No kids or boys, E got the Mac 10
Islam's got the Zulu Nation back up
DJ Aladdin's who
Hooked the fuckin' track up
Syndicate's make'n the move
With the ski masks
And I'm house'n the long cash
So now you realize
You underestimated the Ice
You thought that I was OK
But now you realize I'm nice
But that's all right
'Cause I knew I'd mke it in the end
Those who like me now
Might not of liked me then
But I'm a keep impressin'
Stressin' my lesson
And keep motherfuckers guessin'
Armor plate my mind
With walls and shields
As I escape from the killing fields
(I can understand)
Mind over matter
(I know what it means.
Mind Power)
Mind over matter
Wise up
Move the tempo of this hype groove
You know this shit is dope
So what you try'n to prove
Vu's max as Evil E
My niggaa dogs the wax
My brain's a handgrenade-catch
I'm a hit you with an over load
Of bottomless thought
Reversin' all the shit you're taught
Then throw words at you
Syl-la-ble-at-a-time
Your brain recites the rhyme
No matter what you do
The power's over you
When you sleep
You'll be say'n these rhymes too
Cause the brain has the power
To control all
Think positive
You'll be unable to fall
Brain cells swell
Thought process becomes a trance
Makes you feel possessed to dance
I'll say I want a million
My mind is so deep
I'll be bustin' a check for it next week

66,My Word Is Bond,1989,The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say (1989),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Let me tell you what happened to me
The other day I spent a million on a def gold chain
It weighted thirty nine pounds, my name plate the same
I put it on, it was too heavy
So I hired me this brother to wear for me
One night, we was out chillin', he and I minus crew
I was held at gun point by a thug's .22
But when I told him that I was the L.A. player Ice-T
The brother robbed somebody else and brought the money to me
You might think I'm lyin' but man, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond
You're the master of lying, man
I played ball back in (name) Park
The (name) on the board, hit three pointers in the dark
I got a scholarship but said: ""Yo, forget it""
Goin' straight to the Pro rank, coach, so don't sweat it
The Lakers wanted to pick me, but I said: ""Step""
Cause takin' Magic's spot, could be bad for my rep ""what""
So he sent me to Chicago, to play in front of... you know
But then I said: ""Either he go or I go""
I gave Jordan a break, then came back to the city
You know, cause everybody missed me ""right, right, right""
You think I'm lyin'?, but brother, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond
Lies man, man you're crazy
Look at Donald D comin' through the door late
We're makin' a record, brother
What you're doin' so late, man
What's up, man? ""Stop lying""
My girl was pissed, so she tried to diss
The D, until I showed her my fist
I argued with her in the pouring rain
After the fightin' with her, I missed the train
It was delayed for an hour, so I fell asleep
When I woke up, I was on 14th. Street
By the time I got there, it was way too late
Came back uptown and decided to wait
Ran into her cous', and hung with him
Met Billy, Joe, Bob, Frank, Chuck and Slim
Went back to the crib to watch a VCR
And then I had to pick up my father's car
Looked around for my brother, to see where he went
And then I had to pay my mother's rent
I know y'all think I'm lyin', but listen, you're wrong
Like I told you before, my word is bond
Lies man, you be late to the show
How you gon' make some money, man?
I got so much money that the bank couldn't hold it
Car so dope that I didn't wanna roll it
So many houses, sometimes I forget
I brought a yacht and a brand new lear jet
I flew to Paris just for good meal
Then to Rome, to sign a record deal
Off to London, to kick with the Queen ""what Queen? ""
Back to LA, I bought a football teem
I just can't stop spendin' that green
My girl loves the water so I brought baby a submarine
But see, I left my house without my credit Cards
I think I left my wallet in my other car
If you could loan me ten, I'd pay you back
Yo man, you're lookin' at me crazy, what's up with that?
You think I'm lyin' but man, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond
Yo man, I'll pay you back
Yo, you be talking about them girls you got, man
You ain't got no women, man
Monday morning, walkin' down the block
Saw this girl in a Jag, y'all, and she stopped ""aww man""
She said her father casted for the Cosby Show
And she said: ""Bob, would you like to go? ""
You know, so I went with her, and we chilled
Got her drunk off the Eight Ball, and we illed
She was stupid rich, so I bought myself an island
Charged it to her Master charge, I be wildin'
So, after that I stepped and she was cryin'
She gave me mansion, yo, why should I be lyin'?
You got me frontin'?, well homeboys, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond
Yo Ice, I did a concert in the White House
And after that me and Donald Trump hung out
And then I knocked Vanity boots in a limo'
I rejected Michael Jackson's demo
Smacked Freddy Krueger and he didn't reply
Hit Mike Tyson in his eye
Sharks around me and didn't die
Drank a case of Cisco and I didn't get high
You might think I'm lyin', but listen, you're wrong
Like I told you before, my word is bond
You think I'm lyin' but I'm tellin' the stone truth
I have been player ever since my youth
In 1st grade I was knockin' kids out cold
In 2nd grade I was truckin' the large gold
In 3rd grade I was checkin' the youth bank
4th grade puttin' Gas in Benz my tank
By the 12th I was gamblin' outrageous
I drove through Desert and broke Los Vagus
You probably think I'm lyin' but brothers, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond
What you talking about, man?
You and that basketball stuff you talkin' about
Donald talkin' 'bout Donald Trump, ' man, y'all is crazy
Shawnie Mac, what are they talkin' about, man?
My Word is Bond, home boy"

All the way to (NY NY)
And when I get down
I get down here in LA
All the way to (NY NY)
And when I parley
I parley here in LA
All the way to (NY NY)
Touched the Iceberg baby
I'll send you under like the Titanic
Gun fight romantic
Gigantic on the pages
Of the hustler trade
World renown for my realness
Only the real will feel this
Stainless steel is
The straps that I'm copulating
Touch'em a lady (?)
Blow your hand off
African stand-off
The general
Ice the hardest mineral
Feel me, a gem correct
One thing that I got you'll never get's respect
I stick the pits on ya
I represent California
Home of the shooters
The looters
The drug movers
Girl barracuda
Set you up for the kill
Where you're really not ballin unless you got 10 mill
I shine so bright I blind ya
Cross my crew, we'll find ya
It's a motherfuckin shame
My dominance to this game
I live for gun smoke aroma
Mack yo' bitch into a coma
Two hoes like Noah of every type
Bitches I kick to curbs, you would make your wife
Twice hit by the gun spit, kid still breathing
While half you busters in this damn game are still teething
Believe it if you say it enough that you'll be it
You never lived none of your raps, or even seen it
I mean it, every word a brother say
Everyday a brother play, kid
I politic and parley
The fact is I practice
Camoflauge to this
R & B androgynous
Get the most play
So I get fly
Do a movie - quadruple my cash
You just went double platinum
Let's see if you last
Every word that I say is documented and repeated
The truth is, I dropped the raw game, boy believe it
I've succeeded, in turning dirty dough legal
Bounced to the Bentley from the prime-it-up Regal
Like Biggie says, It's unbelieveable
My street pull
You even play like step in my way
You'll meet my people
I've been round the world ballin, did it all, what's next?
While most of y'all busters on your first rolex
Been deep in the life kid, since 76
Touched the water, the crack game, the jewelry licks
Fix yourself if you're broke fool, that ain't my fault
The game must be taught and comprehended, then implemented
Moves done illegally, carried out strategically
Or else incarceration is felt, the hand is dealt
You lose it's frightening
Hit with 10 indictments
Kiss your baby and your wife
You're riding kites for life
Alot of y'all won't feel me, but some of y'all do
I'll move at least a half a mill of this before I'm through
That ain't the most, but I've done this longer than you
Plus it ain't my only gig, I'm still connected
With the boys that can flip a thou to a ticket
Wicked
My stature when you're in my rapture
Meet me on the street? I'm the nicest brother you meet
Confusing sometimes, the way I bust a rough rhyme
You might think I'm lying, cool I like that
I smile in your face, squeeze off the case, rock the glock back
In your stomach, then I'll smile again
Don't want to be your enemy, I'd rather be your friend
Only the real win in the game, but what's the prize?
Every man goes through mad drama, and every man dies
Look in my eyes, touch my soul, I ain't like you
The evil I've done, I've got lots of retribution to do
That's an impossible task, 'cause every night the gats blast
So I look to the sky and ask
I've been blessed by God to rock this mic hard, so I do it
You got a problem, work through it
I love New York night, bright lights and action
I love bailin with my Bronx niggas, party crashin
I love switch hittin with my niggas on the shaw
You might see me in New Orleans at Mardi Gras
Or Miami at the Lex, in the Oaktown live
Or in Chi-town at the Players Ball, true P.I.
Pimp or Die, Ice baby, it's a well known fact
That true players play the whole map.

You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out,
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out.

The ends justifies the means, that's the system.
I learned that in school then I dropped out,
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout.
I had nothing, and I wanted it.
You had everything, and you flaunted it.
Turned the needy into the greedy,
With cocaine, my success came speedy.
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox.
Every dollar I get, another brother drops.
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand,
God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand.
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned,
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn.
With my posse, out on the ave,
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh.
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam,
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block,
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot.
Pregnant teens, children's screams,
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam.
You don't come here much, and ya better not.
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot.
I gotta get more money than you got,
So what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
That's how the game is played,
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
BUT they're givin' us a Band Aid.
My education's low but I got long dough,
Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro.
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician,
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician.
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe,
There'll be another one after me!
A hustler.
Hustler.
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler.
New Jack, New Jack..."
69,O.G. Original Gangster,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Ten years ago
I used to listen to rappers flow
Talkin' 'bout the way
They rocked the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was goin' down
With my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes
Somethin' like them, my boys said,
""That ain't you Ice,
That shit sounds like HIM.""
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn'T fantasize, kicked the pure
Facts. Motherfuckers got scared
'Cause they was unprepaired
Who would tell it how it relly was?
Who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast
L.A. South Central fool
Where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties
It didn't fit
Six in the Mornin'
That was the real shit
O.G. Original Gangster
When I wrote about parties
Someone always died
When I tried to write happy
Yo I knew I lied, I lived a life of crime
Why play ya blind?
A simple look
And anyone with two cents
Would know I'm
A hardcore player from the streets
Rappin' bout hardcore topics
Over hardcore drum beats
A little different
Than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane
Drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there
Knows that life ain't sho lovely
On the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint
You'll be comin' out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill
The other times buck wild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker
If I acted like I didn'T care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game
In a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move, and your caps peeled
I ain't no super hero
I ain't no Marvel Comic
But when it comes to game I'm atomic
At droppin' it straight
Point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, 'cause I lived it
This ain't no fuckin' joke
This shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T
O.G.
Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me
And said
""Hey yo, Ice
We don't think you're down
What set ya claimin'?""
E drew the Glock, yo my set's aimin'!
Dumb motherfucker
Try to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
And hoodlums and hustlers
And bangers with Jeri curls
We won't even count the girls
'Cause they got my back
And I got theirs too
Fight for the streets
When I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga
But they just didn'T figure
What my wit's as quick as a hair trigger
""He's not your everyday-type
Prankster.""
I'm Ice-T, the original gangster
So step to me
If you think that you're ready to
Got on your bullet proof?
Well mine's goin' right through
This ain't no game to me
It's hollow fame to me
Without respect from streets
So I don't claim be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slippin, I can even get worked
But I don'T slip that often
There's a coffin
Waitin' for the brother
Who comes off soft when
The real fuckin' shit goes down
Take a look around
All them pussies can be found
They talk a mean fight
But fight like hoes
I'm from South Central, fool
Where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast
You'll get whiplash
Numbers on your roof top
For when the copters pass
Gang bangers
Don't carry no switch blades
Every kid's got a Tec 9 or a
Hand grenade
Thirty-seven killed
Last week in a crack war
Hostges tied up
And shot in a liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
""The children have to go to school.""
Well, moms, good luck
Cause the shit's fucked up bad
I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun
Andthe goodtimes
But the pen yanks away and explodes
And destroys the rhyme
Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from
L.A. that was a shot gun!"

Why don't you throw them a fly jamie man
Word! thinking of a demo, late nights alone in my lemo
Not a Pictum my man, I'm talking black sadan
Stretched like a fine truck, E counts the grants
My plan; write a rhyme like nobody can
Totally unpredictable, understand? (WORD!)
Talent is mine, but the judgement is yours
You vibe my records, my crew tours (Yeah!)
You make request in my sale sore
You clear the shelves of the record store (UHH!)
Soft core I'm not, but knowledge I got
I keep my posse in effect when I rock the spot
Grand hot, or maybe you forgot
You should've cracked the jams early before the cops block the lights
Mack magnifier, Hitman for hire
Drop when I fire, watch the guard wire
Ice ain't no lier, I'm never retire
Cause my back went [?] with young troops I inspire
Cold as nitrogen and fold as hydrogen
Thought you had a chance to wax, you better try again
Hip-Hop commando, Bum Rush Rambo (UHH!)
Intelligence is my weapon, dum dump my ammo
It's okay plea it, call it as you see it
I'm from L.A. ~ this joint is like Viet-nam gangs illing
Wilding and killing, bars on your door please protect your children
I ain't no bad guy though suckers may try, they say I'm violent WHY?!
Because I'm fly, got girls to date, therefore
Don't wanna hear no more, chauffeurs shut the damned door (WORD!)
'Cause I'm a player, I ain't no Beat-boy
I love the ladies and money is my real joy
[Evil:] Word Them Up! Yeah, I know that was down, yeah, you know the poetry was deaf

[Evil:] Yeah, and my man Mike, Mike Love, my man Hen-Gee are stood out there baby pal
[Ice-T:] DAT the Most Requested Record, if you don't play this record; you'll be sorry
My whole crew is gonna come down and have to...
Run a bum rush on you, you know, the same stuff took a round, you know what I'm saying?

This is what you want to Rap, this is what you want
Ice-T and DJ Evil E, 1988, taking no [?] yeah boy
[Evil:] Taking out all simps and suckers, y'all know the flavor, No Time

Don't worry about it homeboy, we've just rocked it but we'll rock it again
Cause that's our most requested record!"
71,Outro,1988,Power (1988),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Yo, I knew it I knew it, this tape was the doppest thing I eva heard in my mothefuckin life.
This boy
ICE-T ain't no joke, that' my nigga right there, I'm telling you, man, I love this stuff,
Power
Power
POWER, woo woo woo woo, oh, my man, gotta common, on man, were man I'm out of he...
Oh, man, homeboy steel bleed, not forgot all about, homoboy!
Oh man, let me...

Well on second thought...
Let me jam this tape just one more time..."
72,Pain,1987,Rhyme Pays (1987),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Deuce, deuce revolver was my problem solver
Had a def girl, really didn't wanna involve her
In the life of a gangster, use to rob bankster
But now I'm locked up, I'm just a punk low rankster
Jail cells know me too damn well
Seems like I've built on earth my own personal hell
No matter how high I climbed, somehow I always fell
I guess a lot of players got this story to tell
No matter how cold you roll you simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But pain in the end
Pain (x4)
Organized crimer, big trouble finder
In and out of institutions ever since I was a minor
But now I'm on the bricks, deep in the mix
Crime smarts searching hard for some new street tricks
I think I'll join a gang, sling a little cane
Put a beeper on my belt and get myself a name
Fresh sneakers, silk shirts,24/7 work
Nine to five to survive, you gotta be a jerki
I clock two grand a day, yet I was born to play
Who me at micky dee's?It wouldn't work, no way
I'm a big money haver but not the last laugher
For me infamy makes me no autographer
Custody haunts my dreams, nightmares of capture
Paranoid of surveillance, phobia of cameras
My banks bigger, but so are my fears
Past records proved players live limited years
But I'm unlike the rest, know to be the best
Fast money, true wealth my eternal quest
I hustle all night long, there ain't no gain in rest
12 gauge close range, bloods on my chest
I looked into his face, I thought he was my friend
My boy had me set up, this wound would never mend
No matter who you trust, you simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end
Pain (x4)
Gold rope wearer, neighborhood terror
Can't hang around my mother 'cause she says I scare her
Got a light sunburn from too much pool-side sittin'
Coroless phone keeps me on 'cause there ain't no quittin'
Mind's in a money mode, seems like it should explode
Girlies on my jammie, got a female overload
Young street messiah, professional liar
19 gotta Benz,21 I'll retire
Crazy money it ain't funny, suckers lovin' my jock
But there's some people at my door that didn't even knock
Task force boomin', doggin' my crib out, can't shout
F.B.I. got a gun in my mouth!
Threw me on the floor, called my girl a whore
Pulled ten G's out my mattress and was lookin' for more
Cracked my safe with an axe, then illed out to the max
When they seem my money kickin' it in twenty G stacks
Booked me on ten counts, with bails of different amounts
The charges stuck like glue, some that I couldn't pronounce
They threw my ass the book, my life wa surely took
And then they gave my girl
Ten years for hangin' out with a crook
She played the game herself, fast lane quick wealth
No respect for the law or the city's health
The sweat of hustlers greed is not reserved for men
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end
Pain (x5)"
73,Peel Their Caps Back,1989,The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say (1989),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"(Ice-T)
Coolin in my crib, cold video dubbin
FBI wanted? Huh, don't mean nuttin
They call that shit a crime? Yo that shit's a joke
Hit record on my dope remote
I heard my phone ringin', I wonder who could it be
It was the E, the V, yes the I-L E
He said, ""We got static - word, I just got out
Punks tried to move at the club and we shot out
Bullets everywhere,"" Okay what's the prob?
""Ink got popped, he's dead as a doorknob.""
You bullshittin! ""I ain't fuckin' around.
The posse's rollin' tonight, nigga are you down?""
I grabbed my AK, my 16, and my baby Mac
Strapped on my vest, and threw the 9 in the small of my back
I said - Chill, don't let nobody move without me
Say you know where they are?
He said, ""I know where they be""
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Twelve o'clock midnight, posse was airtight
Twenty-five cars, under the streetlights
Some people talked, while others cried
Ink was a brother, who shouldn't have died
Then the silence broke, Ice what's it gonna be?
38 hard brothers stood and stared at me
There were only two words that I had to say
P-A-Y, B-A-C-K
The car's loaded with a silence that could rape the dead
Pistols clipped as the chamber's loaded full of lead
Everyone in the crew knew what I said
Would mean by morning, somebody else soon would be dead
Let's peel their caps back
The cars at the corner like a long black snake
Nightprowlin for a life to take
Ya see down in the ghetto it's an eye for an eye
That's the answer to the question why
In my throat, there's a lump, then I swallow it, I ain't no chump
Face of Death, then I cocked my pump
I'm a nigga on the trigger, madder than a pitbull
Just layin for a reason to pull
On you, any duck motherfucker that gets in my way
I'm insane, and my homeboy's death made me this way
But then we spot him, Evil E shot him
Dead in the face, made sure that he got him
Others ran, but no mercy to the posse's wrath
Automatic Uzi motherfuckin bloodbath
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Then all of a sudden, a bullet came through my eye
My dome exploded and I felt my other brothers die
I drink my blood as I fell like shit into the street
My corpse stunk like a burnt out rotten piece of meat
Ten brothers died in this stupid homicidal binge
Cause whenever someone dies, nobody wins
But this drama, you'll never hear a word of
Cause all the paper's gonna read is a gang murder
Gang murder"
74,Personal,1988,Power (1988),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Emcee's no time out, it's time to rhyme out
You've dug your own grave, now you must climb out
Dig out, crawl out, hide from the fallout
'Cause when I get mad I go all out
ICE cooler than the coldest cube, dude
And when I'm micin', boy, I'm know to get rude
Criminal background, it's time to get down
I use a silencer, don't like the loud sound
Off my mic blast, you better run fast
The last punk that popped junk passed
Spit on his grave, laughed, jumped in my stretch
Signed his bitch an autograph
Syndicate boy, I don't fool out
You're full grown, school's out
You try to diss?..I think you better cool out
'Cause your butt is smoke, if we ever duel out
This jam is directed, to all of those who expected
For me to cold be rejected, but now I'm highly respected
And now their ears are infected
With dollar signs I've collected
Jealous punks, I said it!
Personal
Take a personal
Take it personal, punk, I'm talkin' to you
And if they agree with you, then your crew too
I never diss an emcee, I wish'em all good luck
But if you diss me to my face, duck
My style don't ramble, you shouldn't gamble
With your grill, I got a fist like an anvil
I write a record, lock it on the topic
EVIL and IZ dog the track, then we drop it
Record stores rock it, stock it, fans buy it
People that never heard of ICE-T try it
Then you try to diss? You got gall
I got gold on my neck and gold on my wall
Gold in my fingers, gold in my ear
When this jam's spinnin', gold's what you hear
Toy, this ain't Christimas, no time to play
I ain't no child, punk, you'll get sprayed
Illin' on a mega-villan
You must want a pine box to go chill in
Buried deep, creep, no one will weep
'Cause the next night with your bitch I'll sleep
Personal
Take it personal
I ain't East Coast, West Coast, new style, or old style
You wanna know about me? Check police files
Get out my face or you might have a bruised one
Brass knuckle prints? Yes, I used some
I ain't here to boast, I don't do that
When I talk it's straight dope, pure facts
I rock hard but still called a new jack
But talk shit, you're sure to get heard cracked
I don't drink or smoke or do dumb drugs
But my posse's still labeled street thugs
L.A.P.D's got all my boy's mugs
Can't use my phone for the damn bugs
I live in privacy, don't like suckers hawking me
News reporters, some think they can talk for me
Lies, misquotes, changin' all my words around
But if I catch'em on the street they'll get beat down
They get money for hype-type publicity
They don't think twice, about dissin' me
But that's a mistake, with tha SYNDICATE you shoudn't mess
I hope those punk reporters wear vests!
Personal
Take that personal
Now the words I speak to some may sound radical
But I'll explain, it's simply mathematical
You diss, I diss, this is creates an equal
You reply to my diss, this is called a sequel
I reply to your diss, this is called a battle
Not intelligent, not very adult
So I don't battle, I just put heads out
A straight line is always the direct route
I write lyrics clear, to leave no doubt
Don't even have to say who I'm speakin' about
You know who you are, you just jealous
'Cause you hear my records are million sellers
Try to say I'm wack, out on the streets
While your whole crew is jockin' my beats
See me on TV and in the papers
See me at a jam, and catch vapors!

Ah shit
Ice-T back
Representin, nigga, once again
That real shit, nigga
I thought you knew, bitch
Better recognize
Players, check your grip before you get popped
Bitches, get my money before you get dropped
Gotcha - buggin off the words I say
Because this type of pimpin' happens every day
Niggas wanna know my steelo
Bitches wanna get with the baddest
Hustlin apparatus
It's the LA cash flow master-roller
No one gets colder, I used to flip boulders
Of caine, on my brain, it's outta control, crime plot
A dead-ass cop and muthafuckas get got
In the game it ain't safe for the weak or the timid
Known to break a bitch but barely rarely slide up in it
So you see me in a club, grab your woman like you wanna
Blink your eyes and the freak is out there freezin on the corner
She got caught by the curls and the jewels
Lookin' for a nigga that is quick to pull tools
Now she's breakin herself, makin' herself
Respect my technique of pimpin', minus all simpin
Check it bitches, it ain't nothin' nice
You're gonna seal or sell pussy if you roll with the Ice
Oh my God, the nigga rolls hard...
Every player mentions me
The hustler of the century
(Ice, that nigga ain't nothin' nice!)
I got more freaks than Heff', my bankroll's off vice
Commandin straight pimp tactics
None of y'all can match this
Meet a freak in a week, her workplace a matress
Really though, recognize the pimp type flow
I don't smoke endo, I count cash on my patio
So much love on the streets, don't need no bodyguard
Big up to my homies with the pimp type nod
I'm off the hook, checkin' traps in Vegas [Name]
Full link mink with the matchin' borsalino
I change cars like you change drawers, bitch
I got a stable full of thoroughbreds that make me rich
Niggas hate me, 'cause they can't control they roll
They see that fat old ass and start givin' me cash"

77,Power,1988,Power (1988),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"I'm livin' large as possible, posse unstoppable
Style topical, vividly optical
Listen, you'll see'em sometimes I'll be'em
Cops, critics and punks, necer ever wanta see me in POWER
Well, that's too bad, Apocalypse Now I'm back and I'm mad
We're comin', you're runnin' cold and cunning
Ice-T on the mic, TopGunning
After your neck, checkin' respect, makin' you sweat
Rhyme Syndicate boy in effect
The rap motivator, teacher, talker, night rhyme stalker
Words thrillin', so real they're chillin', the hit author
Gettin' louder than a shot gun, you don't want none
RHYME PAYS was the name of the album
But that was number one, this is the number two
The posse grew, we're gonna break through
Power
Somebody line up the suckers who refuse to recognize the truth
Tie up the punks who refuse to understand the youth
My posse's growin' and it's gettin' larger every day
Detroit, Chi-Town, Pittsburgh, Houston, L.A.
Come on, come on, come on, toys, let's play
Circle the calendar, perpetrator doomsday
ICE T fool man of my own full grown
I cause havoc when I speak upon the microphone
I'm outspoken, no jokin', get in my face your jaw will get broken
Layin' it, sayin' it, then you're playing it
Lyrics so heavy that you might try weighin' it
Hated by many but I hate'em back
Loved by troopers who know where it's at
You might like me, might think I'm wack
But don't step to me 'cause the boy stays strapped
I'm taking no shorts, hatin' the courts, hatin' the judges
Punk DA's with their personal grudges
I hate the clubs that think with their butts
No hats, no jeans, no sneakers, no what?
No beepers, no gold? Yo kiss my ass
We'll wait and see who gets the last laugh
We'll have the power
Power (x3)
Power it starts with P like pussy
She knows she's got it, she doesn't worry, does she?
Spendin' your cash, leavin' you in the trash
While your little head's thinkin', they're gone in a dash
They got it, know it, that's why they show it
The power of sex, if man could overthrow it
He'd be king in a day, no way.We get rich, hard, give it away
We're weak and as we speak, the girls are hawkin'
Sizin' me up straight out as I'm talkin'
But you gotta have control if you want the gold
I don't wanta be alone like Stallone
So I keep my mind thinkin' 'bout the green
And stop dwellin' on the in-between
I got the power
Power
I'm on a mission mackin' hard as a hammer
Take my picture, I might take your camera
My posse might move, and they move fast
A fool's move could be a punk's last
Ain't no criminal although I used to be
Ain't no new jack rappin' ain't new to me
I been makin' records on wax since 1982
Now it's 1988 finally I'm coming through
That adds up to six years of makin' ok jams, but now I'm mad
Here comes the body slam
Turnin' out concerts, house'n the industry
Lovin' all the fly girls screamin' for ICE T
Rollin' with the Syndicate my unstoppable battalion
38 Solid gold my medalion
Gainin' velocity, momentum and energy
ICE Capital T
I got the power
Power
So you say that I'm a fake think, you really must be a fool
I been to jail more times than you have probably been in school
Shot at, shot back, hit, and seen my buddies killed
That's the foundation upon the raps of ICE-T are built
I say what I think, the system does stink
Money you walk, you short, you're writin' from the klink
Come on, what's up, you know the laws are full of bull
Prey on the lame, release those with pull
Power!I know you wanta try it
Well check out money can buy it
Control and mold the world to do your wishin'
The knowledge of power is mine, so just listen
Money controls the world and that's it
And once you got it, then you can talk shit
Power
You have the power
Power
You have the power
I got the power (fade out)"
78,Prepared To Die,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Watch me flip and rip
On the freedom tip
Open your mind
See the point of the ice pick
I stand tall
While my brothers
Still choose to crawl
Black power, it7s in effect y'all
But you don't understand
You're still a slave to the man
Prepare for revolution
Some sucker say we're free
I gotta disagree
Half my posse's in the penitentiary
So I'm a drop and kick the science
With defiance
Because I have no alliance
With suckas who choose
Not to act Black
When they are Black
Get out my face with that
You better ease back
Cause Mandela did 27 hard ones
Not in a windowed room
But in a barred one
While his wife had tears in her eyes
The man is a hero
He needs a Nobel Prize
But that will never happen
So I'm gonna keep rappin'
Freein' my brothers' minds
From their entrapment
To silence the Ice, they'll probably
Put a bullet in me
But I'm prepared to die
And Mandela's free!"
79,Pulse Of The Rhyme,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Just checkin' my microphone once
As I check your audio
Increase the bass response
Hope 'n' the speakers blow
I got no time to sit and flip
And pop bullshit
Turn up your stereo hops
Insert the rhyme clip
Roll your windows up
Make sure it7s air tight
E.Q. the track exact
So shit sounds right
I rhyme of death
And darkness and danger
Your crib or car
Becomes a torture chamber
I write my rhymes with violence
What you expect?
Sounds of pain
The snap of a broken neck
All alone in darkness I sit each night
Write my rhymes
With blood upon a butcher knife
You say the Ice is ill, and ill I am
They try to ban my shit
And I don't give a damn
Roll up, your eye will get swoll up
Suckers who flexed
Yo, their deaths got tolled up
'Cause I'm not the nigga to toy with
Boy with the big mouth
Ya got time to riff?
There's time to take you out
Put a couple caps in your ass
Cut your head off
Send it to your mom with flowers
'Cause I'm so soft
Lay on your wack crew
Smoke the whole bunch
Bury 'em in my bck yard
And then I'll eat lunch
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you
Or him or her
Whenever I'm in the house
A death just might occur
Is this real or fiction
You'll never know
While you're locked to the
Pulse of the rhyme flow!
Once I lock you up, you can't get loose
You put your head inside
And I placed the noose
The mic drips juice slow
From its steel mesh
My words feel like hooks
Underneath your flesh
Makin' you twist and turn
Scorch and burn, when will you learn?
The '90s are my turn
To pitch a vocal fit, like the ultimate
Gangster rhyme, yo, I invented the shit!
Watch me dod it, as I do it
And I do it right
Grab the gauge
Duct tape on the flashlight
Doin' the black ski mask
And come to your house
Cut off your power
And do you with the lights out!
Is this real or fiction?
You'll never know
A pool of blood
And floating body parts
Would make me grin
A close view of a razor
When it's breaking skin
If you were burnin'
I'd use gasoline to put you out
'Cause I walk alone
And choose the dark route
Nightmares gotta be loved by some
And I'm the one
Ya wanna come, bring your shotgun
You ever see your partner die?
No? Well I have!
You ever see your father die?
No? Well I have!
You ever see your mother die?
No? Well I have!
So shut the fuck up, punk
And clear the rhyme path!
What would make meel calm and nice
Is a slow slice
Through your jugular and windpipe
Throw me in jail
I won't even try to make bail
Put me in the gas chamber
And watch me inhale!
Is this true or false?
Well you'll never know
Jason, Tales from the Crypt
And the Dark Side
Another fly murder, another suicide
Did these flicks
Have an influence on my brain?
I really doubt that shit
I think that I was born insane
When I was young
I had a lust for knives and guns
Use a magnifying glass
To fry an ant with the sun
And on and on
My lust for death got bigger
At fifteen
I was placed behind a trigger
Although I'm dirty
Not the one to be swept up
Step up, I'd love to open your chest up
I've got no concept of life or death
All I want is your last breath
Give me a motherfuckin' break
I should behave
Give me a motherfuckin' shovel
I'll dig graves!
I break ill in extra large portions
Where's your parents
I'll make you an orphan
So when you're talkin' crazy
You better think of me
The I, to the C, to the E, to the fuckin' T!
There'll be no tears
No screams or cries, just a laser beam
Between your fuckin' eyes
You feel strange well now you know"

What is a rapper doin' when he starts at hardcore, but can't sell
Enough records to remain in the record business?
Answer:
He goes pop...
This answer is not set up to diss anybody who starts at pop, or
For the rapper's who started at hardcore, and now makin' weak
Ass dance music, 'cause they couldn't stay down wit the hardcore.
I just got a question for you:
How does it feel to wake up every mornin, and look in the mirror,
And realize, that you're a fuckin' ho"
81,Race War,1993,Home Invasion (1993),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Yeah
Yeah
Check this out: now I'm black
But black people trip
Cause white people like me
White people like me
But don't like them
What's the fuck up
Are you my friend?
Hell no, you're a racist
You say you got one black friend, so you're in
Sorry homie, no win
Check the facts
Mexicans are still gettin' pushed to the back
Puerto-Ricans gettin' dissed the same
Won't speak on the Indians, shit's insane
Fuck John Wayne
I don't hate whites
I just got a death wish for muthafuckas that ain't right
You got black skin
Still you gotta show and prove, friend
Back to the facts
What about Australia?
A fuckin' failure
The Aboriginal people are black
So they got jacked
You ask me about free speech and the Riots?
So what's in store?
I'm talkin' 'bout a race war
(Get yourself together)
(Upen your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Race war
People gettin' killed in the street
Blood on your feet, the ends don't meet
And who they gonna blame it on, me?
Try the media
Try the P.D.
Try your TV
Try your quest for wealth
Anybody but yourself
But once the bullets start flyin
People start dyin'
It's all because we're lyin'
History books that teach hate
A kid has no escape
From the racist fate
And pretty soon South Africa
Will stop chillin'
And start killin'
Race war (8X)
Every night I pray
That people get this shit together one day
But this country ain't with it
America was founded on that racist shit
I judge the devil by his deeds
It's usually connected to the size of his greed
And keep the hope
Even though they'd love to give a nigga like me the rope
And when this shit hits
There's gonna be a lotta white kids rollin' with the Africans
You can't sweat skin
Cause ??? a lot of blacks is down with the Republicans
This shit don't have to happen
That's why a brother like me's still rappin'
Just treat each other right
Either that, or you're lookin' for a sure fight
Fuck the police
We already know they ain't about no fuckin' peace
You wanna know what I think's in store?
Justice or a race war

So why the distrust?
The system wanna keep us at each other's throats
While we're payin' the tax notes
Cause bein black ain't no fuckin' minority
It's the fuckin' majority
So they gotta make us hate each other
Word, check the brothers
Mexicans - black
Jamaicans - black
Iranians - black
Indians - black
Hawaiians - black
Puerto-Ricans - black
Eskimos - black
South-Americans - black
Orientals - black
Yeah, that's right

So listen to my words I bring much
Sense, as I commence, my lirycs intense
Get telephoto, break out your big lens
Look, check out the sales charts
My record's kickin', I'm breakin' P.D.'s hearts
They banned me from their shows
Because they said I'm too hard
But no sell-out, I guess I'm just barred
I ain't changin' mine for no body
They bleeped words from Doug's LA-DE-DA-DE
I can't get a bleep?What's the deal?
Maybe my words are just too real
It's not profanity, it's just the man and me
He doesn't want you to see what I see
Doesn't want you to be what you can be
Word, censorship of reality
Radio suckers never play me (x3) (sampler of PE ""rebel without a pause"")
Suckers don't, but some do
The real troopers bring the ICE to you
And close friends to me, yeah, PUBLIC ENEMY
These stations have high intellect
They don't pretend to be, too bourgeois to rock a jam raw
Understand what I'm sayin', they're down by law
They play the jams that are right, sometimes not polite
They realize you gotta get some people uptight
Speak the word, your voice will definitely be heard
Lie to yourself, you're destined to be to the curb
Some stations don't care, they'll never put on the air
Nothin' but commercial junk, their brain power's impaired
They don't listen or try to hear what I write
Maybe just think once, or try some school at night
They're makin' radio wack, people have to escape
But even if I'm banned, I'll sell a million tapes
Radio suckers never play me (x3)
I made records for music, not for the money
To some of you that might sound funny
But I ain't broke, and I don't joke
And my lirics are known to make ears smoke
Clear as a gun scope, I speak the pure dope
Can the radio handle the truth?...Nope
Uncut, no edits, no censors
You can get a plastic rapper from any ol'dispenser
A penny a yard, to make a record ain't hard
But to make it mean something, that's a job
But then we do it, they refuse it
So I tell them duck suckers to cold go screw it
We shouldn't sell out, we should just yell out
And get them wack motherfuckers the hell out
Radio suckers never play me (x4)
Cruisin' down the street what do I see?
Crash Task Force, L.A.P.D.
Gangs illin', wildin' and killin'
Hustlers on a roll, like they got a million
Girls on the strap and you know that
You know the guys will stop wildin' if you stop that crap
But you can't, you want money so bad
You'll jock anything with the Gucci tag
You gotta have it, so the men go get it
Robbin' and stealin', soon to regret it
Livin' in a jail cell, feelin' like a dumbbell
While you jump the next jock, well
That's reality, that's what I see
Nobody says that you have to agree
Censorship that ain't the way to be
I thought you said this country was free?
Radio suckers never play me (x2)
Tone it down,...Is what they say to me

Your subject matter's too hard, make a love song
You better get real, come on
I ain't no lover, I'm a fighter
Hard core radical rap rhyme writer
Pushin' the botton, E does the cuttin'
Everything I say amounts to something
More than a single rap, I'm too deep for that
I lay my lirics with logic, press the wax

Too many hardcore muthafuckas out here in this business
Ain't gettin' their proper loot
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Right)
Check the technique
(Aha)
Everybody talkin' 'bout the way hip-hop ain't the same
Suckers kidnapped the game
I know the biggest in the business, and no joke
Half of 'em broke - and none of 'em smoke
(Bust the facts, loc)
I got into this hip-hop game
Just to try to get a girl and get some light-weight fame
There'd never been no cash made in it
So who thought you could get paid with it?
Just crash the club with my crew and then I'm outta there
Hit some skins, act bugged, that was a rap career
Then Run-D.M.C. jumped the fuck off
Got mad paid, word, kicked the bucks off
There wasn't many rappers out there rockin' the streets
When hip-hop was just cuts and beats
I seen Wildstyle, dug the scene
I wanna be an MC, rock, rock on - know what I mean?
I started crashin rap contests
Shootin hardcore rhymes through wack MC's chests
I signed on the lines of a wack contract
Didn't even read it, fuck that
They gonna put my record out
I'm gonna be large, know what I'm talkin' about?
In the first 2 years I made about 300 bucks
Yo, this business sucks
But I got another chance and I came correct
Got a lawyer and accountant, now my shit's legit
But many won't get no second chance
And get fucked in this biz without a kiss or a dance
The game is to exploit young ghetto kids
A straight pimp game, and there ain't no shame
And the shit's gone too far
100 hip-hop labels with all white A&R's
The game's hijacked
The rap game's hijacked
Let me tell you how it happened
Now while every MC in the game
Was worryin about a white boy gettin' the fame
They dug out the foundation
Now let me give a demonstration
Say you got a dope group from the hood
Talkin' mad shit like they're up to no good
You take 'em to a label
Now who sits behind the table?
Some jewish muthafucka that don't know shit
Tryin' to tell y'all what's a fuckin' street hit
The shit's way off course
It's like me tellin' Johnny Cash how to sing about his horse
You go on tour, the white agency says you're wild
Tone down your style
The radio jocks are all pop
So how the fuck this nigga know what shit to rock?
The shit that make your face turn green
Is when you get dissed by a kidnap magazine
I give a fuck about these muthafuckas
I'm doin' this jam to save my hip-hop brothers
Get your paperwork straight, kid
Get a lawyer and accountant just like I did
Don't blow your dough, cause you will see g's
But this game has no guarantees
Learn about publishing points, so you won't be blind
Learn to read everything you sign
Then you might have a chance
If not, bend over, pull down your pants
The game's hijacked
(Yeah
I don't they hear you, brother)
Yo, the rap game's hijacked
(Word)
I'm talkin' 'bout a hijack
(Say it one more time, baby)
The rap game's hijacked
Check it
(Break it down for these niggas)
You can go gold and still owe the record label cash
Yo kid, check the math
Learn about the word 'recoup', troop
And stop walkin' round all hyped and souped
You ain't nothin' but somethin' to be used and worked
You ain't nothin' but a sucker to be duped and jerked
Cause the fuckin' record label don't love ya, pal
They didn't love ya on the street and don't love ya now
They're out to make an end, friend
Cause every dollar you make, they damn near make 10
They'll take you for everything you got
Or else they'll sign you and they put on the shelf to rot
I'm tryin' to tell you what's up
You best to listen to this record even if you hate my fucking guts
'Cause I just can't stand around and watch rap get done
And my brothers ain't gettin' none
A nigga like me has gotta spit game
Nigga, get that cash flow. fuck that muthafuckin fame
Cause the white man's rippin us off once again
Real hip-hop, my man
Fool, the rap game's hijacked
You need to listen, nigga
The rap game's hijacked
Need to play this record about ten times
The rap game's hijacked
Black people don't own shit
The rap game's hijacked
Check it
R&B's hijacked
Black acting is hijacked
Just being black is hijacked

Stupid muthafuckas, they rippin us off
You better get a end...

84,Reckless,1996,Cold as Ever (1996),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Hey, boy!
Once upon a time a DJ's task
Was just to play records, what more could you ask?
But then came remixes, scratching and cuts
Which was too much for many, drove some DJ's nuts
But the DJ named Glove has reigned supreme
As the turntable wizard of the hip-hop scene
So listen to him, check him out, but remember this
When the Glove's on the wheels of steel he's reckless
This high-powered music is truly unique
As the Glove cuts the rhythm to the hip-hop beat
He moves like a madman as he spins his disc
He's the number one scratcher on the DJ list, he's reckless
Now I've seen DJ's, too many to name
Some gained recognition and even fame
But when you talk of MC's, Ice-T is the best
And when you talk of DJ's, forget the rest, Glove's reckless
So listen very closely as the Glove throws down
He cuts like a razor to the big beat sound
Dave's layin' down a groove that we know you'll like
With the Glove on the turntables and Ice-T on the mic, we're reckless
So listen to the music, let your mind feel free
Realize you're with the master G-L-O-V-E
Dave and MC Ice-T, you know you're with the best
Because when we're in the mix you know the groove is fresh
And reckless, reckless, reck-reck-re-reckless"
85,Retaliation,1999,The Seventh Deadly Sin (1999),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"(Intro: Ice-T)
Every year the same shit happens
More fuckin' funerals, dead homies
Niggas out here killin' each other
I don't know why
And when it happens to you
Just can't turn the other fuckin' cheek
Gotta get back for your dead niggas
Yeah I'm caught up to
(Ice-T)
Sometimes I sit and wonder
How many motherfuckers gonna die this summer
Gunshots from the hummer
Now the sawed-off riot pumps lead across your beds
They said: ""Mama, less you wouldn't strike back""
Mack ten, eleven, twelve, hit us and then puts us to hell
They started it, there's no way to mend it, we'll end it
My crew'll hit the matresses, G.O.D.
Father style - all prepared to get buckwild
Half my niggas ball, other half ain't got it all
They stay up at nights waitin' on a combat call
Drinkin' hard liquor, smokin' mad loop and shit
So high, sometimes I even gotta load they clips
I ain't mad at them though, they dumps the ammo
In you, suspend you in here, hell yeah
It's the time that the real niggas live for retaliation
Move on 'em, show, improve on 'em
All you punk bitches just stand back and watch
Me, I'm oilin' up the Heckler and Gotch
I gots no love, for them busters, who put the work in
I can still see my fuckin' boys' body jerkin'
I ran over to him, put my hand on his chest
Hole like an apple in the side of his neck
His eyes glanced up, his body jerked once more
There's nothin' else to do but to go to war
Slide the hollow-tips in the chrome four-four
Roll down the windows, hang the heat out the door
Catch all the fuckin' bodies that I can tonight
Double-back on your bitch crew, broad daylight
(Chorus: Ice-T)
There's no innocence allowed in these ghetto streets
Grab your guns, buck 'em off, when ya hit your leak
Tell me what would you do if they killed your best friend?
Could you keep your cool, would the wounds mend?
If I said ""peace"", I'll be a motherfuckin' liar
(""I'm lettin' off until my arms tired"" - cut and scratched*) Retaliation
(Ice-T)
Been packin' straps so long I gots some permanent bruise in my leg
Better that than dead
Now it's time to show you what I'm trained for in this
Rally up the wolfpack-attack relentless
Make ya understand it was the wrong crew ya fuck with
Now it's on bitches, guys are darker than shit
You musta not a known when you fuckin' hit that day
Or maybe you di, you're dyin' anyway
And not just you, some of your family
To tell you the truth any fuckin' body we see
You might just wanna turn yourself into me
To save your hood pain of my crews' treachery
You fucked up, we know who you are, where ya live
We got your place ran up to a cop on the tick
We'll hit your block so hard, you'll swear it was an earthquake
Squeeze off the fully-auto, make your whole crib shake
I know you're breathin' hard, livin' on your last day
Or maybe, you're laughin', thinkin' that you got away
I don't give a fuck, I won't sleep
Till one of us lays me and my nigga
That's the fear of these triggers
If ya smart, ya probably make a break out of state
We'll just snatch your kid, grab your fuckin' bitch and wait
I'll catch ya down South, lay your ass out straight
There's no where to run, it's time to meet your make
You got one chance, arm your whole damn crew
I couldn't stop my fuckin' niggas if I wanted to
(Chorus: Ice-T)
There's no innocence allowed in these ghetto streets
Grab your guns, buck 'em off, when ya hit your leak
Tell me what would you do if they killed your best friend?
Could you keep your cool, would the wounds mend?
If I said ""peace"", I'll be a motherfuckin' liar

On these muthafuckin records talkin' all this bullshit
(Man, I don't know about these niggas out here
Them other sucker-ass niggas, them old fake-ass bitches)
I ain't tryin' to hear that shit, man
These bitches ain't players, man
(Yeah man
You know these niggas out here been fakin for years, man
I'm glad my nigga Ice comin' with that HP shit
That high-powered shit..)
Peace to my street niggas movin that weight
Much love to my comrads who's out in upstate
Mad connections from the bottom to the top of the game
Street fame, I got much that's in touch with my name
Got a overload of guns to unload on a lame nigga trippin'
Wake up my posse, interrup the Rémy-sippin
Four in your back and keep bailin
Listen to the HK wailin and your vital signs failin
Everyone that ever met me knows
I work bitches like niggas, pimp niggas like hoes
Command a mack that's immaculate, your girl's naked
You think she ain't been hit, kid yo, you best to check it
For ten years I been connected to the top of this
Hold your breath, kid, I'm never droppin' this
Too busy rollin' off them fat chrome rims
And niggas who trip get sung hymns
We crash clubs and security shits
'Cause they know they got size but they know we keep clips
Crazy muthafuckas lickin' shots in doors
Leavin' suckers' bodies bleedin over nightclub floors
You don't want none, son, stay gone
Break north when I come and you might live long
Yeah, my face kickin treble, you're just a pebble
You're gettin' rocked, yo E, cock the glock
And let these niggas know, yo, that the west don't play none
Fire shoots out of my strap like a ray-gun
You broke ill and you cold fucked up
Now you're bleedin through your fingers while you're holdin' your gut
For real
So get your money how you want to, friend
But when it's time to count the chips only the real will win
(Return of the real) the game of life is only fake and true
But it's all about the dollars when the day is through
(Hot Dollar)
(Cause the pimps don't get no bigger
Than these here niggas)
It's the return of the real
(These muthafuckas best to get to recognize
Before I gets to chastizin
Cause see, the shit all ties in
It's just some of that pimp, player, hustler shit
Ice-T been around for a while now
Nigga was gangbangin when gangbangin wasn't even cool, nigga
What you know about that shit?)
I go deep into the street life's anatomy
A nigga take me out - yo, what a upset that'd be
And if I fall I fall on cushions, ???
Hittin niggas up with the Tec and watch the blood gushin
I see your videos, a 100 niggas in it you don't know
Framed in the lens, bought friends
Who really got your back, nigga, check it out
You really possess like zero street clout (think about)
The only place you're safe is in the studio
Yellin' in the mic, you'se a bitch, that's right
I take a nigga like you and make him prostitute cute
So what you got a gun, punk, you're scared to shoot
You front hardcore, but I don't feel ya
Kids from my hood'll take your punk ass and peel ya
Let me check my Rolex quick because time's money
Squintin from the Pavet face because it's kinda sunny
Skinnin the top back, flossin the rag and the thing
Feelin' the sun, backin off of my pinky ring
Hittin the 'Shaw with my niggas and clown
Lift the ass, hit the switch, raise the front off the ground
But most of the time you can't see a nigga
Deep in the archives parlayin new ways to get my bank bigger
(Hot Dollar)
(As I slides up out the do'
Gots to give a special props shout out to that nigga the O.G.
Got muthfuckin Red in the house
[Name] and the muthafuckin ringleader of funk, DJ Ace
Hot Dollar's up in this muthafucka
If you didn't know
Count your muthafuckin blessings and handcuff your hoe
You know what I'm sayin'?

For four days I was up on the mic
All sucker MC's were on the bite
Bittin' my rhymes, stealin' my style
I rocked so hard, it wasn't true
I won the virgin girl, and her MAMA too

Your things, your chest
You put all my lovers to shame

You can have my cars, my jewels, my wealth
I love you more than I love myself

And then our two hot bodies meet
And all at once she felt the thrill

Then she rolled me over, took me to the stage

In their brain their little panties that their boyfriend saw
I put it in their mini skirt and up their thigh

I move it in and out, know what I'm talkin' about
Then around your neck until you show respect
Then on your cheek until I reach my peak
Then in your mouth girl, no joke, I'll take it out
Don't want to see you choke
I'll run it down your back, might cause a heart attack
I'll put it in your butt until I get enough
And then I'll take it out and put it in my pants

90,Somebody Gotta Do It (Pimpin' Ain't Easy!!!),1987,Rhyme Pays (1987),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"My lifestyles crazy, I'm luxury lazy
So much gold that jewelry don't phase me
Coroless phone, eight or nine homes
Girlies on my Jammie with Ice-T Jones
Bank account boomin', fast lane zoomin'
Known around the world for my high post groomin'
Mac like a preacher, love like a teacher
Got a girl who lives in Paris
When I want her I beep her
Too many clothes, gotta rag top rolls
1.000 Watt system and my speakers are bose
I kick it like a champ, I throught you knew it
But pimpin' ain't easy
But somebody gotta do it
My thumbs are tired just from countin' cash
No more room in my diamond stash
Filin' my nails is such a tirin' task
Gold knobs on my benzo dash
Five freaks just to comb my hair
Monograms on my underwear
Bodyguards around so please don't dare
You're takin' a chance if you just stop and stare
Livin' my life is just so hard to do
Makin' deals a million one or two
Buyin' new cars for my entire crew
Matching Ferraris, E's black, mine's blue
Can't swin a lap in my pool because it's just too long
Could never go broke because my banks too strong
No matter what I do I simply can't go wrong
And I'll make money, I don't need this damn song
But somebody's gotta do it
When I walk in a joint, punks always look at me hard
Because I wear enough gold to tie a dog in a yard
Cold maxin' in my mansion so big it's silly
Got a butler named Humphry and a maid named Milly
Mink sheets on my bed, that's what I said
Gourmet chefs in my kitchem so that I can get fed
So tired of sailin' on my boat I might just Helicopter
To my jet and catch a midnight flight
So many girls in my book, it weighs a tom
Gotta leave the damn country just to have some fun
Private suite at the track to watch the ponies run
And there ain't nothin' in the word
That me an ""E"" ain't done
But somedody gotta do it"

Mic smugglers, hustlers, hold your jugglers
Forty guzzlers, muscular, Son'll fuck wit'cha
One of ya, actin' funnier, think you're hungrier
Some of y'all know, the streets stay ghetto govenor
Swash Buckler, Club King, pull the gun to her
For the love of her, punish 'em, drop they juggler
Son's guns stompin' dirt, hurts come at runnier
Son's luckier, put your money up and stumbler
Raise her birthday, cut yo' - Son Gun-the-Gun

Club tumblers who thug wit' us - double up
Mother-luggers shots blast, Ice what the fuck?!"
92,Soul On Ice,1988,Power (1988),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"It was a Saturday night on the streets of Cali
Threw on my dope silk suit, brushed off my suede Bally's
Threw on enough gold for any girl's pleasure
Left a pound and a half of that shit still in the dresser
I slapped a clip in my nine, threw a clip in my sock
Hit three grand up off the dresser, it was ten on the dot
Now my beeper started beepin, I threw that shit in the sink
I didn't need it no more, I had more money than Prince
See, I was quittin the game and tonight was my fling
You see, on the streets they're players but only one king
Now that's the title I held but the game is real fast
You gotta get in and get out if you expectin to last
Now my homeboy Evil was downstairs chillin' in his brand new Benz
I had many adversaries but very few close friends
We broke to the set, E parked the car on the grass
High-signin was his trademark and he did it with class
Hit the door like two titans, the whole jam stopped to stare
And as we walked through the crowd they threw bills in the air
I spied my man Jazz maxin out with two stone cold freaks
""Yo, what's up Ice, you rich now, man, you too good to speak?""
Now Jazz was a player from the east coast, the Bronx
He was known to be hard on the women and a brother he'd stomp
Smack a bitch in a minute, some say just for fun
And he was known for his chrome-plated pearl-handled gun
""Yo Ice, you my brother and I love you and all
But what's up with that six g's you owe me, man
...'Member when your boys took that fall?
And I posted the bail cause yo ass was locked up""
Evil gave Jazz ten g's and Jazz shut the fuck up
Just then I saw Donald-D hit the front door
More gold than a Aztec, black leather he wore
Hoes grabbed for they niggaz when D hit the set
'Cause what Donald-D wanted is what Donald-D'd get
Donald's eyes hit mine and a smile crossed his face
Then a light hit his ring and blinded the whole goddamn place
""Yo Ice, you the coolest and Evil, you mean
But I got the fliest new shit rollin' off gasoline""
Everyone in the party moved quickly outside
To see Donald-D's ultimate Superfly ride
It was black, it was low, cost twice that of my Porsche
A Testarossa Ferrari - convertable of course
It purred like a jet, ""Yo man, I bought it with cash""
It had 'Donald-D' written in gold on the dash
Then out of nowhere came a shot across the street
I felt pain in my chest and my knees got weak
There was blood on my hands and I fell to the ground
And all I could hear was, ""Yo, Ice is down!""
Somebody had shot me that night that I quit
The night that I ended all this hustlin playin' shit
It's ironic ain't it, the night I retired
Would be the same night that my whole life expired"
93,Squeeze The Trigger,1987,Rhyme Pays (1987),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Squeeze the trigger
Rampage on stage, my crews in a rage
Searched my posse, found the Uzi but missed the 12 gauge
Maniac, I'm a rhyme brainiac, livin' on the edge of a razor
Remember that
Cold rollin' thick as a shake, I'm rockin' hard as a quake
I can't live on bread and water or lobster and steak
My mino's a riot gun, there ain't none bigger
About to unload the ammo,""E"" squeeze the trigger
They say I'm violent, they should watch their TV
They say I'm brutal, they should check their P.D.
You made me, now your kids rave me
I rap about the life that the city streets gave me
Murder, intrigue, somebody must bleed
Miami Vice is small time, L.A's the big league
From the rollin' 60's to the nickerson ""G""
Pueblos, grape street, this is what I see
The jungle, the 30's, the V.N.G.
Life in L.A. ain't no cup of ter
Squeeze the trigger
I've been dogged out by cops, shackled and socked
Paid my dues to the streets, took my hard knocks
Disrespected by snobs, damn near trampled by mobs
Persecuted by squares workin' nine to five jobs
Like a panther I prowl, like a lion I growl
Learn to see behind my back like the head of an owl
I'm the voice of the youth, the prophet of truth
What I speak is really though some
May say ruthless tactics are takin' by me to awaken
People to life but I feel no fakin'
No jivin', no lyin', no frontin', no playin'
Say exactly what's up, understand what I'm sayin'
Ban me, try it, you might cause a riot
What the radio won't play, the underground will supply it
I'm a MC pirate that's loud not quiet
Radical as they make'em, make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise, some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
But most do respect the words I inject
Kick credit for realism and the truth I project
Because I could bust rhymes for fun, or cut MC's like a knife
But the topic I love is the drama of life
So don't diss me don't dare, I feel you should care
You may think I'm soft but you're just unaware
Of the wrath of the Ice enraged prepare
For a true nighmare
Squeeze the trigger
Cops hate kids, kids hate cops, cops kill kid's with warnin' shouts
What is crime and what in not?what is justice?I think I forgot
We buy weapons to keep us strong
Reagan sends guns where they don't belong
The controversy is thick and the drag is strong
But no matter the lies we all know who's wrong
Homeless sleep on the city streets
Waitin' to die with nothin' to eat
While rich politicians soak their feet
In the pools at their ten million buck retreats
People hate people for color of face
No one had a choice in the race we were placed
A brother in queens was beaten and chased
Murdered cold in the streets, a goodamn disgrace
Just because of his race, his life went to waste
And no one went to jail when the court heard the case
Justice or corruption?it's all interlaced
How can you swallow this?I can't stand the taste
Squeeze the trigger
I get paid for illin', cold makin' a killin'
My pockets keep fillin', I got dollars to the ceilin'
Got a safe in my floor, car got bullet proof doors
Every time I rock the mic I leave you wishin' for more
Because my raps ain't bull, got cold stupid pull
You wanna eat my rhymes like candy, till your mind's over full
But most MC's today ain't got nothin' to say

This next track is dedicated to some personal friends of mine, the L.A.P.D
For every cop that's ever take an advantage off somebody
Beat him down or hurt him, because they got long hair
Listen to the wrong kind of music, bronde color
Whatever they thought was the reason to do it
For every one of those fuckin' police
I'd like to take a pig out here in this parking lot
And shoot them in their motherfuckin' face
(Verse 1: Ice-T)
Cop killer, yeah
I got my black shirt on
I got my black gloves on
I got my ski mask on
This shit's been too long
I got my twelve gauge sawed off
I got my headlights turned off
I'm 'bout to bust some shots off
I'm 'bout to dust some gats off...
(Chorus: Ice-T)
I'ma Cop killer, better you than me

Fuck the police, for your freedom
Fuck the police, don't be a pussy
Fuck the police, have some motherfuckin' courage
Fuck the police, sing along...
Cop killer, cop killer, cop killer

What you're gonna be when you grown up?
Cop killer, good choice, cop killer
I'ma motherfuckin' cop killer

96,That's How I'm Livin',1993,Home Invasion (1993),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"I was born in new jersey, I said it before
But I guess nobody heard me
My mother died young
No sistas or brothas, I was the only son
When I was twelve my pops died too
What a brotha was supposed to do?
They sent me out West
To live with my aunt
I guess they though it was the best
But there was no love there
Growin' with no moms
I guess I was prepared to live in a vacuum
The bedroom the kitchen, the hall and the bathroom
I didn't leave home much, didn't like L.A.
Didn't have no friends to trust
Got busted to a school
Blacks and whites, I guess the shit was cool
But in highschool I changed
Didn't wanna bust, didn't wanna play the game
I walked to Crenshaw high, shit was fly
I hooked up with new cru
Some brothas that knew what the fuck to do
You might call it gang but we called it a set
And it was our own thang
The whole school was down
And one way or another everybody fucked around
When the hardcore or not
You wore the right color or your ass got shot
That's how I'm livin'...
I did three years in and made close friends
Havin' no love my homies came my only
I was glad: a family I never had
But I grew up fast got a girl on 10th grade pregnant
Needin' cash, I had to change my style
Switched from bangin' to hustlin'
No more goin' buckwild
Had to get a cashflow
But my hustle was weak, it was a no go
I join the army, four years in that shit
Be all fucked you can be
Came back to the hood
My homies had done good
Had elevated their game
About 100 gees a lick, no mothafuckin' shame
Passed for the jewels
Baby sledgehammers with the tools
I speak on this with a hesitation
Even though it passed the statue of limitation...
I checked the bank
Bought a porsche and gear, earn high streetrank
But as I grew my whole crew fell through
Cops had us on the books as innerstate crooks
Murder robbery rape escape, the whole damn nine
You robbed a nigga blind
I had too much juice, I cut my boosters loose
I was intread with the pimpgame
Took on the ice-name
But the pimpgame moved too slow
Especially for a nigga who was hooked on quick dough
In one night late I was in a carwreck
And I was lucky to escape
Hospital for teen weeks, in bed almost dead
And when I got well, I got gaught in a cross
And got locked in a jailcell
That's how I'm livin'...
They cutted me loose
And I had to change troops
This time they didn't catch me
Next time they'll strecth me
Cause my time was gettin' short
All my homies was in court
Or locked in a hole, this shit was gettin' old
So I changed my life
Putted down the gun and picked up the mic
It took ten years to get from there to here
But I still keep a gun, cops got me on the run
And they hate me more now
Than they ever did before
My homies came back from pen
And we all worked together
True friends but every once and while
Some punk mistakes me as a junk
And he gets in my face
Wrong mothafuckin' place
And I ain't lyin', that's how you dyin'..."
97,The 5th,1996,VI: Return of the Real (1996),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"He yo, Ice
This guy here say he wants to get in, man
You're sure homeboy's ready?
Yo Ice, this nigga said he's ready, man
Yo, kid you're sure you wanna be down with this, right?
Yeah, I'm sure, I'm ready
Aight
Know what you're in for, right?
Blood flows like sands in the hourglass
Cash moves everything
Bitches in g strings
Gats flashin, mothers make cream on a stick move
Improve your dope flow
Cold max with the long dough
High rollin', back breakin plot diggers
The ill niggas
Comanche style
Blood letting weapons of death
Stop your breath
If you trip on the click
A hot thump to your chest
And your back just rips
You wanna be a made man
The fam accepts no mistakes
Chopped up bodies, lots of funeral wakes
Make your bones
Bring a rat back dead just ahead
A cop's better
Use this beretta
Snitch, bet your bitch
She in a pre-dug ditch
'Cause I command a whole batallion of life takers
Plus the other bosses wanna see yo guts
Check your nuts
Dump the bodies in the desert
Here's the keys to a truck
Me, I'm overloaded, born hard and scarred
Crime intellect
More complex than nerves in your spinal chord
Bank job my forte
Not off of gunplay
Hostage taker
I killed my brother with a salt shaker
He tried to short me a buck
What the fuck?
A nigga that lies
Is a nigga that dies
No cries for the punk
He got trunked and bombed
Since he tried to steal I chainsawed his arm
I drink blood from a cup when I wanna then
Plus the bosses up north made me kill my friend
They told me, ""This ain't no game, kid, you're in it
You're down with the Syndicate, but never admit it""
Muthafucka, now you're down for life
Rat on the fam and we'll kill your wife
Fuck up a scam and you'll feel the knife
Who is this?
(The Syndicate does not exist)
A thousand ki's, off-shore private yacht
Really ain't no sweat, Coast Guard and customs are bought
Columbian-Mexicano connect
Raise the bet
One DEA woudn't roll, we pulled his tongue through his neck
Just a message to the rest: don't test
Housing developments are built on the bodies
Of punks who wouldn't party
Big shots are called from the pen's inner sanctum
Where the mega-gees
Regulate the streets, fuck release
They got power that you can't comprehend, my friend
They want you dead, yo, you're dead before the daylight ends
Your eyes shiver and you grit your teeth
You sold your soul, now cold blood's how you get relief
Now you do what we do, say what I say
Muthafucka, don't blink unless I say okay
This is a organization, not a one-man gang
And you die if I ever hear you spilled my name
My friend, I thought this day would never come
(What do you mean, man? Hey!)
Who was there when your wife had your first child?
(Hey, why you're lookin' at me like that, man?)
Who looked out for you when no one else was there?
(Hey, I'm your friend, man!)
Now word's out you're talkin' to the feds about me
(..They lyin', man)
There's only one thing I can do
(Hey man, wait a -)
You treat me like a bitch
(Hey yo -)
(*Shots*)
Now look at you!
Look at you, muthafucka!
Now look at you!
Cops on the take, I got moves to make
Feds ain't that easy, I still got 'em to shake
They had my man's bitch wired for a month and a half
Snatched my nigga up in Aspen, bail's five million
Bounced him out in a hour - power
Went and met him quick, hit him with a ice pick
Can't take no chances, he romancin with whores
No tellin' what he spilled when behind closed doors
The fam's protection and loyalty is top priority
Violate, your body is found in three states
Cargo is heat on a Hong Kong cruiser
??? Contact ???
No cash, they want a ton of crystal meth
High risk'll bring more riches than the national debt
We launder money through he s&l's and pro-ball teams
Ain't no business untouched when it comes to cream
Documents forged from my hitters from Jamaica
In and out of town before you hit the ground
This is the mob, baby, now you're on, no off-switch
Suffocation ??? you snitch"

Yeah, seventh, uh-huh, first things first man you're messin' with the worst
One, come on, come on, one
(Chorus: Marc Live)
Yo, yo, yo motherfuckers can't fuck with this, realness
Seventh sin deadly, raise the key to rock steady
Run son the hour has come, touch ya
Remember this, real niggas don't rhyme
We walk up and buck ya
Stuck ya in the head, rush ya
Trife niggas knife you, seven venoms fight you
Your life's through, fuckin' with the wrong click - kapow!
From the crackhouse, niggas quick to blow your back out
(Marc Live)
Enough talk, niggas talk too much, let's set it
Time to splash bitch niggas, gun fights, paramedics
Call my regiment up at midnight, tape on a flash light
Youn claim you want beef, it's too tough, called your bluff
Shot you at such close range, blew out your eardrum
Caught you with my mack, blast your cage our your back
Yo, the nigga stepped up and got bucked by my ninja's
Casualty after casualty all up in ya
Ya not a street vet yet bitch, just a beginner
My niggas eat punk like your crew for dinner
Rock ya in broad daylight to make the wrist-double
Hit ya then lower my gun and watch ya chest bubble
Step up, feel the Teflon, black talent
Rip through your vest, hit your chest, lose your balance
You never had no drama with the real, now ya want it?
My skill got you haunted, my ski-mask got ???
(Marc Live)
Aiyyo blackout, my whole click we blastout
The wrong move, show improve you assed out
Venom it, warn the niggas, treacherous
Squeeze automatic, quick to bust fuck with us
Yo the worst niggas, work the bitch to double figures
In new sixes, hennessey with dark mixes
The richest, fuck around, you won't fix it
Toke, heavy metal, settle shit, rebel shit
Fuck a cop, why not, we last niggas on your block
Last standin', coked up, we fucked up
Twenty g's, rope 'em up, you in the trunk - Lex Coupe
I'll leave a nigga with cement boots
Now we off lootin', hold me down, yo I'll start shootin'
In ya double lefts and tell the rest an'
Marc Li-I've, fuck the pad, bust his ass
And slide my fuckin' heat in the stash

Your life's through, fuckin' with the wrong click - kapow!
From the crackhouse, niggas quick to blow your back out
(Ras Kass)
She musta kicked off like special teams
I walk rare from a muchy bled nigga all lookin' like Grenedine
Murder scene, three to the head, three to the sline
We tied that motherfuckin' number like Kareem
It seems that I used to wonder why niggas don't give a fuck
Within 2G - niggas is just buck
From hip-hoppers to gangsta's, sportin' stompers at yompers
The mirror has two faces in this room is not proper
So we religiously pray for peace and pack one
I walk softly, carry a big dick
These family jewels is my most important riches
But I still want my liquor, my sorry-ass friends and my bitch
And nigga this me, I only see green like a Marine
Support Calvin Klein jeans, fed a bitch from the Philippines
With a immoral nose ring (masterbatin' with a magazine!)
Yeah, I'm acid 9 and half the time undercover
Fuck you, your lesbain lover and your mother with the same brother
The blade runner, my games' tight
I could talk the Virgin Mary outta panties the same night
(Castrophe)
And that's the seventh deadly sin as the terror begins
Me and my friends came to rob ya for your props and your ends
Tuck it in, my niggas want, whatever's costin'
The rings plus the watch, plus thst chain from the slossin'
Son, that's why I go in and shit stop
Last night my nigga Ice-T had to pop a cop
I write the chop-chop lyrics, tryin' not to scratch the detail
I put 'em through the system, slang 'em out at full retail
It's thirty g's for the title and the ki's
Throw in the extra three and take the tyres and the D's
Nigga please, this is lik-wit and I'm the Alki
At three months from now you're gonna read all about me
One 'cause I smoke 'em, two 'cause I'm wealthy
Three because I rapped on my nigga Ice's LP
It's Castrophe, lik-wit fam, lik-wit crew
West Coast is in the house nigga, what you wanna do?
(Chorus: Marc Live)
Yo, yo, yo motherfuckers can't fuck with this, realness
Seventh sin deadly, raise the key to rock steady
Run son the hour has come, touch ya
Remember this, real niggas don't rhyme
We walk up and buck ya
Stuck ya in the head, rush ya
Trife niggas knife you, seven venoms fight you
Your life's through, fuckin' with the wrong click - kapow!
From the crackhouse, niggas quick to blow your back out

Yeah, seventh deadly sin bitch

102,The Girl Tried To Kill Me,1989,The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say (1989),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Verse One:
Yo! I met this girl the other night
Hype super-dope body and face, her mini-skirt tight
Talkin' 'bout legs and lips, mindblowin' hips
Had to cross my legs just to look at her tits
Said she came out lookin' for some fun
Looked me in my eyes and told me... I was the one
I said ""Why?"", she said I was fly
Grabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die
Said she wanted to take me home to make love
Now that's the kind of rap that brothers dream of
I said, ""Fast, slow, hard or soft, baby?""
She said, ""All the above""
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life
Verse Two:
Now, I ain't no sucker on the weak tip
But let me tell you, she was on some motherfuckin' sex trip
Took me to her crib that night, leather and spikes
Broke out the rope and the dope strobe-light
And started buggin', lightin' candles all over the room
Then she did a backflip, landed on my dick
I knew that I would be dead soon
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one
Verse Three:
Yo, my pants were on, but so what?
She ripped off my shirt and tied my monkey-ass up
Faster than I could say ""No!""
It was like a rodeo, I was with a sex nut
I looked in her face...
She sweated and she grinned with delight
And then she broke out a whip, I said ""Shit!""
This girl had crazy plans for the night
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life
Verse Four:
Now whips ain't all that she had
All kinda crazy shit was at this bitch's pad
I'm talkin' about latex suits, spike-heeled boots
Oversized vibrators so that she could get loose
I said, ""Don't... don't... don't whip me!
I'll do anything you ask!""
And then homegirl stripped, 38"" tits
Man you shoulda seen that ass
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life
This freak tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one
Verse Five:
My dick was harder than a bulletproof vest
She started pourin' baby oil on her chest
And then she said, ""Gimme gimme gimme""
Jumped on my Jimmy, and rode me like the Wild West
I almost passed out, then the front door cold bust in
It was her fuckin' husband, six-foot ten
I knew my life would soon end
Homeboy tried to kill me, he didn't use a bomb or a gun
Homeboy tried to kill me, yo... yo, nowhere to run
Homeboy tried to kill me, he didn't use a gun or a knife
Homeboy tried to kill me, 'cause he had caught me fuckin' his wife

Where the kids are
And every day
They seem to have a new scar
Something strange is going on
And everybody knows
Doors always shut
Windows always closed
The little girl had a burn
The boy was black and blue
They said it came from play
You know that shit ain't true
The boy's arm's broke
Girl's scared to speak
Their parents drink all day
Couple of dead beats
Some days they go to school
And other days they might
It's hard to stay awake
After you cry all night
You see 'em every day
Tear tracks on their cheeks
But they will never tell
It goes on weeks and weeks
(But what can they do?
They're only children man!)
You ain't no fuckin' kid
Act like you give a damn!
Won't someone save these kids
Do something, call a cop

Wanted for a homicide ride, the gun's still smokin'
Didn't know what I was doin' but did it anyway
Now the posse's on my trail, they say I'm gonna pay (Run!)
I had a gun, it's mine and I packed it
Out with my crew, the boys caught some static
Me and this sucker punk went at it
Bang! Nine automatic
Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child
(Sources say the assailant was 17-years old and lives in South-Central
Los Angeles)
Now I'm on a hideout tip 'cause they're after me

Was I crazy? I guess I had to be
'Cause once you kill it's instant catastrophe
Your whole life is over (Through!)
Forget about your girl your (Crew!)
Nowhere to run, so what you gonna do?
Be glad it's me, homeboy, and not you
The Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child
Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child
I'm only 17, I didn't mean to kill, man
But I was slangin' and bangin' for the thrill, man
When they said (Kill!) I felt chill, man
But once I pulled the trigger, boy, then things got ill, man
My homeboys dipped out the back fast
Left me alone in the echo of the gun blast

Today with the 'ends justifying the means' mentality ain't happenin')
I'm sweatin' heavy 'cause my face is on TV
Everybody in this whole world's after me
Since I was young I never had a damned thing
At Christmas time I'd hate to hear the bells ring
'Cause in the ghetto Santa ain't got a dime
Your mother's standin' in the welfare line
The way the youth survive is crime
My life is over so I might as well speak my mind
I killed a brother 'cause this system had me geared to kill
'Cause what I call home you call hell
My ghetto quarters ain't no better than a jail cell
But there's a message in this story that I'm tryna tell
We're just brothers on the streets killin' brothers
This system has us geared to kill one another
Sellin' dope to poison each other
The plan of The Man, word to the mother
But I'm a sucker 'cause I fell into their plan
187, I killed a brother man
My life on Earth was hell, you understand?
But when I die I'm goin' to hell again

Gots to roll
Till my cash flow's mega
Baller not a beggar
Bitches workin plastic with the fake ID's
Life in the Lane, stackin up g's
Chop shops taggin up Benzes and Beamers
Crack spots boilin full kilos in beakers
Damn, the game's quicker than shit, don't slip
Cause bet your life there'll be another hustler checkin' yo grip
It's the Lane
Brother on parole need a quick lick to come up
The score went bad, now he's back stuck
Bitches settin niggas up jacked and waxed
Small-time workers movin weight in a g ride Lac
Don't talk on your cellular, your phone is tapped
Don't check the rear view, there's no turnin' back
It's the Lane, now you're in it, hit the gas and mash
Through the land of the hardcore hoes and cash
Jackers and robbers, hustlers and clockers
Everybody'll squeal, take the l or the deal
Yo, spin the wheel, for the cops you're a meal
Tailor suits gator boots make the fly hoes kneel
But if you miss, my friend, guess what you win
A one-way ticket to the federal state pen
It's the Lane you chose, you fill your shit, ride Rolls
High-priced clothes, baddest fuckin' hoes
Anything goes, there's no limit, just mash
The cops will be there when you crash"

Liquid, solid, gas - we'll be kickin ass
In any form, or matter, or mass
(This ain't science class) I know but it's science
From the rhyme boss of the Syndicate alliance
(?)
Rhyme Syndicate brotherhood, we rock a blood oath
Radical posse down to death
While your crew's on the tape, Donald-D break
(Donald-D)
Syndicate comin' through, I'm talkin' to you
Flexin hardcore, what could you do?
When we roll up you send your girl up to the crib-o
Is it Rambo? No, the mic ammo
Stompin you down on the ground, task forces
Let you know Rhyme Syndicate bosses
Any show, any tour, we house program
Donald-D is who I am, damn
(Hen-Gee)
Atttempt to do this, boy, you're takin' a risk
Cause my voice sounds doper than a compact disc
Styles and lyrics (?) in the pocket
Stupid dope beats and Evil E rocks it
(?) Straight from my heart
My jam is sure to hit the top of the charts
Ram is my sign, he's different from all kinds
Rock you all of the time, just form a single line
(Ice-T)
A lot of MC's like to talk 'bout they self
A first-grade topic, I think you need help
How many time on one album can you say you're def?
""I'm baaaad"" - Yo punk, save your breath
That's weak shit from a weak mind
And a weak mind creates weak rhymes
You ain't never kicked knowledge one time
Just livin' on your own dick (that's a crime)
Homeboy, why don't you talk about somethin'
You just talkin' loud and sayin' nothin'
And if you get mad, sorry brother
And when you're in LA, watch your colors
(Donald-D)
I'm a MD, but no medical doctor
Mic-Dominator Donald-D has got you
Comin' to the jamboree to hear the poetry
And when you break north, the melody
Stick to your mind like paste, it can't be erased
Face to face I overpower like bass
To the climax, I don't carry a sax
I carry a axe to tax and wax those who rap
(Hen-Gee)
Born in Brooklyn, crib West Coast
MC's I toast, you that talk most
Trash, noise, can't throw, get with it
Comin' from the mouth of Hen-Gee from the Syndicate
Ballers, mafia down to throw
Gangsters, convicts throwin' solid blows
Start prayin', your sisters I'm layin
I'm Hen-Gee, a Spinmaster, hear what I'm sayin'?
(Party on the dancefloor)
(DJ Evil E cuts up)
(Evil E's in the place)
(Doggin the wax)
(Hen-Gee)
An organization, alliance, no duplication
Rhyme Syndicate, a strong creation
The Syndicate's stronger day by day
12-gauge leave suckers brutally...
Layin in a (?)
Your lines are thin, Hen-Gee came to win
Don't talk a bunch, just known to crunch
My one-two punch will put your butt out to lunch
(Donald-D)
Full-court pressure's what I'm applyin
No relyin on the next man, roar like a lion
Flexin, plexin ultra, the Bronx is my culture
Strikin hard like a vulture
Flingin, I'm slingin my hammer like Thor
No singin', bringin' it raw to the core
Shogun assassin maxin in a limousine
You stick your head in, out comes the guillotine
(Ice-T)
(?) The game as I kick it
Don't miss it, get with it
Diss it, you're a knucklehead evicted
From the crowd that's proud to be the Syndicate connection
Respect mandatory, up is the direction
I stand alone, one man that's true
But you, my crew, you're on my side
We're on a ride
Power and pride is our gift
And you're down with
The Syndicate"
108,The Tower,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"I'm rollin' up in a big gray bus
And I'm shackled down
Myself that's who I trust
The minute I arrived
Some sucker got hit
Shanked ten times
Behind some bullshit
Word in the pen the fool was a snitch
So without hesitatin'
I made a weapon quick
If found a sharp piece of metal
Taped it to a stick
Then a bullhorn sounds
That means it's time for chow
My first prison meal
The whole feeling was foul
It wasn't quite my style
But my stomach growled
So I flushed the shit down
And hit the weight pile
The brothers was swole
The attitudes was cold
Felt the tension on the yard
From the young and the old
But I'm a warrior
I got my ground to hold
So I studied the inmates
To see who hd the power
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower!
In a blink of an eye, a riot broke out
Blacks put their backs to the wall
Cause it was north and south
A gun man shouts
And everybody had doubt
Until the bullets started fly'n
Took two men out
Thn they rushed everybody
Back to their cells
Damn the pen is different than
The county jail
I'm in a one man cell
I know my life's on a scale
I wonder if that gunman is goin' to hell
This is my second day
I got a ten year stay
I learned my first lesson
In the pen you don't play
I saw a brother kill another
'Cause he said he was gay
But that's the way it is
It been that way for years
And when his body hit the ground
I heard a couple of cheers
It kind of hurt me inside
That they were glad he died
And I ask myself
Just who had the power?
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower!
You see the Whites got a thing
The call White pride
The Blacks got the muscle
Mexicans got the knives
You better be wise
You wanna stay alive
Go toe to toe with a sucka
No matter wht size
A fool tried to sweat me
Act'n like he was hard
I stuck him twice in the neck
And left him dead in the yard
It was smooth how I did it
Cause nobody could see
With my jacket on my arm
And my knife on the side of me
Bam bam, it was over
Another one bites the dust
I went crazy in the pen
With nobody to trust
Bench'n ten quarters, so I'm hard to sweat
Used a tat gun, and engrved my set
They call me a lifer
'Cause I'm good as dead
I live in the hole, so the floor's my bed
And I ask myself again
Who has the power
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower"

Bump your Queen plus we want the chips

112,Valuable Game,1999,The Seventh Deadly Sin (1999),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"(Intro: Ice-T)
This song is dedicated to my man Tupac Shakur, rest in peace!
Notorious B.I.G., rest in peace!
And all my other homies that have died
In the madness called street life
Rest in peace!
I'ma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go
(Ice-T)
Nineteen eighty six, deep in the mix
Me and my team out for cream and jewel-liks
The faster, the better, blood, leather, the baby sledge
Case hitters - me, I'm the point man
Give less than a damn about anything, just let my hammer swing
Come up, give me my cut - what?
Girls don't mean nothin' to me, don't push the button on me
Out for the twist, ya nastically nasty G
Basically makin' me anti-social individual, too hype
Recognize the type?
Then a music called hip-hop came along and saved my life
I had a story to tell about my knowledge of hell
$2.50 for a book, listen and look, now let's do some Math
A gun and a hand, plus an angry man, minus love
Equals and me, the sky's blue and they rags
Toe-tags and body bags - y'all feel me?
Is it too real G? Brothers say drop some heat T
Absoultely, everything's goochie since we realized
This games' the only one we got left
Hip-hop's become the game of death
Some of y'all busters out there tryin' to waste up
It would've took some of us hustlers all this time to lace up
I'ma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go
(Ice-T)
Ok, let me break it down, they got the one strike law
You go in, you reach the other two before you know
What happen to you - game's over dude
On the next page, they got power in effect
While you two rednecks waitin' to see which one of us
Kills the next brother next
Think about it too long'll make you sick
Believe me the last thing they wanna see is us risin'
Economically, astronomically it could happen homie - follow me
Hip-hop's the black goal - mind and soul
Refined as we roll, another ghetto story is told
I stopped flippin' ki's in eighty three
They need a time machine to carcerate me
I'm square as a pool table, twice as green, know what I mean?
Flippin' from heat, the legal green, the hip-hop scene
Beef, the only beef I got is the steak
I'm tryin' to eat from the players elite
East, West, North, South, Moon, Star
I'm gonna ball wherever the chips are
I hope y'all players listen, ain't out there hatin' and dissin'
Y'all know the game is to be sold and not told
I should be takin' a collection, this time I'll make an exception
I've just been here for the start of this
I gotta come from the heart for this
I'ma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go
(Ice-T)
Some nights I lay awake tryin' to analyse
And anticipate the moves of the fakes
Wonder if the cancers' in too deep - can't sleep
Tryin' to diagnose the poison that's increased
Injected into a pure hustle born on city streak
Migranes fill my brain as I reach toward the realm of the insane
Wishin' and prayin' that another brother gets
To live the life that I got to play in
Tryin' to represent to the fullest
I gotta come hard y'all, no time to pull it
Y'all fools think illin' and tearin' up
Hip-hop is the thing to do G?
I'm paid I don't need rap no more fool I make a movie
Y'all tryin' to lose me
And to y'all suckers with your afrobatic, player hatin' tatics
Tryin' to jump over the bree and plannin' and hustlin'
I've been corporatin' to this music over these years
Y'all will fall victim to your own lies and the P.I.
Will continue to rise, over your eyes kid
This games' immaculate, dramas' irrelevant - stay sucker reppellin'
Invent, incoporate, parlay, play
And I got no reason to lie to you
I'ma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go
I'ma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go"

Ooh, that's what I'm talkin' about
Ice Berg, 2006, remember this
Go Ice man
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""uha""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind ""yeah""
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""uha""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind
(Verse 1: Ice-T)
Damn, this record takes me way back, to day that
I said the words I love you, I'm not that kind to say that
I spent my lights in the streets with beef crooks
Shook cats get lifted off their feet with heat
Nobody loves, you can feel the cold in their hugs
At each man checks his weapon that protects his life
And last thing on my mind was ever having a wife
No, I'm not the type to do that, I can't commit to that
But then you stepped to me ""Damn""
Blew my whole spot up
Dropped me to my knees, and I still don't think I got up
Ugh, you made me revaluate my G
Now I'm gangster for you baby, and you gangster for me
And we're walking...
Go Ice man ""ugh""
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""you know""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind ""uha""
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""come on girl""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind
(Verse 2: Ice-T)
The truth is, it ain't easy for a brother from the streets
To ever show an affection or an aim at direction
When we roll, you're by my side, I feel pride
And my partners got no problems 'cause they know that you're true
And if anything just jumps off I taught just what to do
Get low, get the bail money, call up the crew
You take a bullet for me, I'll take a bullet for you
We'll do old, strollin' girl
You know how we do, we're just walking...
Go Ice man ""ugh""
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""uha""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind ""yeah girl""
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""ugh""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind
(Break: Ice-T Talking)
Break it down, yeah, you know
It comes in time in every man's life
Player hustler or whatever, that he realizes
That he needs that companionship of the women
Strong women to hold him down
Through them cold nights
Through them hard chips, pains and struggles in the streets
Stress ""go Ice man""
(Verse 3: Ice-T)
Realize I've grown in life I had to get shot before I understood
That you come in this world and die alone
Don't wanna spend my life chasin' flash and cash
I'd rather whip through the hood with your feet on my dash
The homies understand and they lookin' for girl to their own
So they can't get out these streets and stay home
It's cold when you got no one, but I've found mine
As long as we together girl I know we'll be fine
'Cause we're walking...
Go Ice man ""ugh""
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""come on""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind ""yeah girl""
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""ugh""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind ""we're just""
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""holdin' hands""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind ""holdin' our pistols""
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""grabin' your booty""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind ""yeah baby""
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine ""come on""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind"

I got my nigga SLJ and DJ Aladdin
Droppin' the fat tracks
Hit 'em with it
Syndicate's in the muthafuckin house
All duck MC's get flat, muthfuckas
Yeah
1993
And it's still me
A rappin' brother from L.A., the cool T
Diss a brother, hate a brother, I still come back
With the fat tracks, fuck the pop crap
I got a mind to cold diss a fool
Wack rappers sellin out urge me to pull tools
For no reason
Pop suckers hookin for hits like hoes skeezin
Prostitutes that can't shoot, yet you clock loot
Dancesteps with the weak styles, but you look cute
Bitch, that shit's wack
Let Hammer dance, and you other fools ease back
The microphone in some twist in a clenched fist
Mind locked on ???? load of my hit list
And make duck rappers pray
Many talk shit, but none step this way
'Cause I'm quick to beat down a weak clown
Clock crazy juice from L.A. to the Boogie Down
I play the whole map
Got hoes locked like a muthafuckin bear trap
Ice muthafuckin T
Before hoes gee they need two forms of I.D.
Never fess, not the best, but I'm hard to shake
Huh, watch the Ice break
Watch the Ice break
Yo, let's see now who's tryin' to diss me
Say I sold out 'cause I rocked with the B.C.
Y'all are bitches, you're straight wack
Quick to talk shit, but always behind the back
I do whatever I wanna do, punk hoe
I rock a perm, you rock an afro
I wear khakis, while y'all wear silk
Y'all drink forties, and I drink milk
Cause that's my muthafuckin biz
I never sell out, 'cause it's no sale, kid
Hardcore to my heart from the fuckin' start
Whether done over beats or loud guitars
I drop the dope hits
Case you forgot, I invented this gangsta shit
You wanna step to me? New jack, walk
Come back in five LP's, then we can talk
You're just new, kid, you got a hit out
In interviews you talk a lotta shit out
You got paid, you really made out
You went broke when your one jam played out
Now you're searchin for that one more hit
Shhhiiit
I ain't new to this, I got gangs of gold
I come original, then I break the mold
Too many MC's hit, then fold
They're just fakes
Hah, watch the Ice break
Watch the Ice break

On some old fly smooth shit
All the muthfuckas out there down with us
You know what I'm sayin'?
We're rollin' strong
All the busters out there that got some static to say
We're settin this shit off physically this year
Like KRS-One says:
Sucker MC's duck down
Muthafuckas ain't takin' no shit
I'm swingin' on busters, point-blank
Diss me and it's on
Straight up
Now it's the break of dawn
And the mic is still on
All hoes are fuckin' and the rhymes are damn strong
Many MC's that choke from the mic smoke
Those who tried to get with me
Lost in rhyme infinity
Or they lost breath
Try to step to the Ice equals sure death
Cause ??it's then I begin?? than you ever assume
Drop the mic, go rap in your living room
I love the quick kill
Swing on a nigga sometimes just to break ill
Knuckle up, buster, fool, in his fuckin' eye
All hands, I need no gun, yo punk, why?
'Cause if I pull my gun, you die
No second try
I gotta cool out now, so I don't over-freeze
Nut up and start murderin MC's
Start catchin bodies from state to state
Throw on a ski mask and walk the streets late
And do me up a whole damn crew
The Geto Boys was trippin', but my mind's trickin me too
Cause diss me, and I meet you one day
And bet your life it won't be a fun day
I hope, nigga, it's not your fate
That you're around when the Ice breaks
When the Ice breaks"

Down with the Syndicate posse
It's you we rule without a tool
Mathematics in effect, it's time to school
I'm the principal and knowledge is the key
Shaquel in the place to be
(ROUND 1: Toddy Tee)
I climb a mountain top with just one rope
Get to the top of the stairs and say a rhyme that's dope
'Cause I'm a cliffhanger, no, I ain't a stranger
Yo, I'm Toddy Tee, and I'm a Compton banger
Wanted by the F.B.I. for transport of
Sucker MC's across the Syndicate borders
No, they can't give me no time, 'cause it's my rhyme
Everlast, get funky for me one time
(ROUND 1: Everlast)
Everlast is in effect gettin' big respect
Then I collect big checks
1's, 5's, 10's and 20's
A 100 g's and I'm pullin honeys
Left and right, day and night
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight
They're all on the tip to get a sip
Of this poetic performer that's fully equipped
(ROUND 1: MC Taste)
Y'all played yourselves right in front of the mic
Moved your body so that the feelin' was right
But if you get lost scream out and admit
That the beat's too fast, slow it down or I quit
I'm not the kind to give you a call
To stop on a rap that I lead, so I pause
I give you 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
If that ain't enough, sit down till we're done
(ROUND 1: Divine Styler)
Syndicate scorned, you act obedient
Tired of your fish rhyme (?) ingredients
Black on black while styles (?)
(?) Of brothers that's gotta be
Circlin cyphers into molecules
Takin' over your space, that's illogical
The vocal chords on a board with 24 tracks
Get away from the break (?) gotta rap
(ROUND 2: Ice-T)
Syndicate posse growin', goin' out of control
You say we're weak? This record's shippin gold
Power, strength, my posse got unity
We stick together and we're soon to be
In your town, we gonna bring the roof down
Ice-T and the syndicate underground
No selll-outs, 'cause it's caps we peelin
Girls we love em, and shows we steal em
(ROUND 2: Randy Mac)
Knowledge and wisdom, it's a mystery
I drop science for the ones who know it's me
You say I'm dope, cool, it makes sense
I ain't conceited, I'm just convinced
Strapped for the attack Randy Mac is rollin'
The mic, the mixer, then the show is stolen
The pimp, the player, hustler (?) kicker
Watch your girl, 'cause I stick her
(ROUND 2: Nat The Cat)
Nat The Cat, my man will rap when I'm playin' the back
Some think my stage presence is low, I think it's loud
Enough to see me flowin and showin
Go psycho breakin backs like bolo
Give me the mic, a metamorphis ignite
I break down on a cat stand, I kill ya like a hitman
And come out kickin with the (?)
Rockin' on a rappin' rampage
In control of the stage
(ROUND 2: Donald D)
There's a mouse in my house, so I bought a cat
The cat ran away, cause now there's a rat
I'm on the attack with my baseball bat
That one rap brought many of us back
All through my house I set up traps
It seem like the rats have a map
But nowadays I don't know how to act
So now I feed the rats crack
(ROUND 2: Bronx Style Bob)
Back and I'm statin the fact
I know you're waitin for a rap
To make you get up and start to clap
For Bob, a Bronx (?) Syndicate style
More bounce to the ounce and trizzy to the file
'79 the time I was inclined
To get smooth and prove that I can rock a funk rhyme
Hey yo, ice-cube chillin'
'Cause we got the gats and knack to see the kids top billin
(ROUND 2: Hen-Gee)
Impressionalist, not a ventriloquist
Don't hang out with suckers worth less than piss
Suckers can all come kiss the tip
Of my knob when I aim I don't miss
Aim it to suckers that come around jockin
On my tip when on the radio my recors be rockin'
Don't come frontin askin me for a pound
You ain't invited means you simply ain't down
(ROUND 2: Shaquel Shabazz)
Wake up it's time to be noticed
I'ma do this, I'm gonna show this
Beat to be mathematical
Syndicate's in the house, let's get radical
Bum rush the show and grab the mic
Syndicate's chilllin out tonight
They let me loose and now it's war
(?) Let the rhymes roar
(ROUND 2: Toddy Tee)
Grab a partner and hit the dancefloor
'Cause I'm back to rock for you once more
I don't worry about what he said or she said
As long as what's said-said is done-done in my bed
The Juvenile Committee's on my side
And I'm kickin knowledge on a natural high
And I'm feeling strong
Yo, take this mic and get the party on
(ROUND 2: Everlast)
This is mortal combat, there ain't no comeback
You're tryin' to get with me but you don't know where I'm at
Cause in this world there's no bombs or guns
Just a microphone, metaphors, words and puns
Sentences and phrases, no clubs or razors
No mercy for a sucker that wages
War, I'll take the floor, even the score
Grab the microphone and proceed to roar
(ROUND 2: MC Taste)
Are y'all set, all prepared to start
Move in close cause here comes the dope part
By the way, I'm the Taste, if tracks
Could talk but they - but here go the facts
Brace yourself, you shoulda grabbed a grip
Protect your clan 'cause we're about to trip
Bass reflex, the kicks that drive, divide
The weak from the rest (?) can't survive
(ROUND 2: Divine Styler)
Syndicate's housin all competition
We paralyze a physical powerful vision
But savage ignorants pop that's ignorant listen
Divine is (?) no time for style
And I rock your grey matter with a smile
'Cause I'm the rhyme thriller with dimensions of flavor
The knack - stylistic black
(ROUND 2: Ice-T)
The reason we're bustin' these raps are what?
To make all you wack MC's shut up
You're always buyin rap records jammin def beats
Then dissin rap artists out in the streets
You always say our jams are wack but yours'll be tight
But you never been near a studio in your life
You see, disrespect is your last resort
You're like Howard [Name], you never played this sport
But you're always talkin' mess bout how it should be done
And when we ask to hear your record you never made one
So this message goes to amateurs and pros alike
We're the MC's that cold be doggin the mic
You may be good but there's no one better
We rock you so cold, you need a cashmere sweater
Fight dirty in the pit when combat is on
We always attack before attacked upon
(OUTRO: Ice-T)
Yeah, Rhyme Syndicate, we in here
We tossin it up
I got my man Everlast in the house
Tossin it up, youknowwhatimsayin
Kid Jazz and Bango couldn't be here
But we gon' to' it up for them anyhow
Wherever you are you're a star
Rhyme Syndicate blowin' up like napalm
I got my man Chilly Dee deejayin on the set
And the one and only DJ Evil-E, we in here
Yo, we outta here like last year
Rhyme Syndicate
We gotta do it like the alphabet and a-b-c ya
Yeah
(Everlast)
Everlast
Everlast in full effect
Where's my gold record?
Where's my record?
Where's my record?
(Divine Styler)
Divine Styler with Physical Poets, look out
(Donald D)
Microphone King Donald D the notorious, yeah
(Bronx Style Bob)
This is Bronx Style Bob...
(Ice-T)
Nat The Cat, boy
(Randy Mac)
Randy Mac
One in a million on your back, boy
(Ice-T)
Yo
So we bout to get outta here
Seems like the police is outside, man
(Yo Ice, man, they got King Tee, Aladdin and Islam)
What, the police, man?
I knew somethin' had happened
I was wonderin why King Tee missed the party, man
Yo Randy Mac, you got some money?
(Aw, you know what time it is, man
I got...)
Yeah, for some bail, buddy
We got to go do some work, man..."
117,Where The Shit Goes Down,1996,VI: Return of the Real (1996),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Ice-T, nigga
Representin
Strictly Westside, nigga
South Central in the muthafuckin hiddouse
Check the technique, nigga
Representin for my real niggas out there
Fuck all you buster-ass niggas
Word
Saturday night in L.A., time to play
My peoples hummin like a vibrator, gotta make crime pay
I'm packin two gats and I wish I could carry more
Might sound crazy, but I ran out of slugs before
Yeah, I know the feds watch me
But my vest clashes hard with the Versace
So I'm just rollin' in the black five hun'
I used to lowride, now it's just for fun
I had 5 cars, but now I got one
Hard to keep up ballin when you're on the run
I got two ki's in my trunk and a shovel
Stepped on the one, so now I gots double
The shovel's for drama, need I say more?
Got the fat stash spot under my passenger floor
That's for the other strap, the automatic type
I gotta keep it close in case shit gets hype
Got a bitch in jail, she didn't snitch, she did three
I'ma have to roll solo till they set her free
'Cause I got some other crimeys down, true gees
But they got all day, so now it's just me
And I'ma kick this slang until the day I die
I can't go straight, I won't even try
I'm stuck in the game, so don't ask me why
It's life in L.A.
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Long Beach and Compton are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where the shit goes down
Now niggas like they credit and they like to get they loans on
So I hooked up with my boy who turns them phones on
He told me bout this nigga who won't pay
He also said he knew excactly where the muthafucka stay
So I went and got some homies I hang with
Some crazy muthafuckas who I used to bang with
We took a trip to his crib
I snatched his hoe and his kids, and this is what we did
I tied they punk ass up
I cracked the safe with an axe, and then the phones we cut
I didn't hurt his wife
But I promised next time that I would take her life
I shot a nigga in his neck for disrespect, caught a body
Got a murder in Miami for a shoot-out at a party
Got blood in my trunk from a punk who squealed
Had a partner tried to play me and his cap I peeled
Now I rest with my finger on my heater
Hand on my beeper, a light sleeper
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
New York and Philly are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Frisco and Oakland are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down
I use to sling enough water you could float a boat
You could ski on the mountains of fuckin' coke
But now most niggas serve chronic
So I let 'em check the bank, and then I'm all up on it
I serve 'em with a cute hoe
In a week they tell my bitches 'bout all they dough
Then I jack and I kill
The jack's for the money, the kill's for thrills
I got 9'000 blacks that still serve crack
Got a bitch who works the Plaza too on the track
Got a GTA connection and I fence for jewels
Got some little kids that move my fuckin' dope in schools
Got warrants for arrest in about 20 states
Got a bigger body count than fuckin' Norman Bates
I'm a killer, jacker, dealer, pimp supreme
I'm livin' out the hustler dream
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Houston and Atlanta are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where that shit goes down
Tonight I gotta meet this nigga from around the way
Some think he's cool, I think he's DEA
He said he want it bad, he heard that I got it good
I bagged up ten ki's of flour and met him in the hood
I met him at my spot, 'cause I know it's cool
Pat him down on sight to remove his tool
I made him name 10 niggas he should know
But that still ain't shit in the game of blow
He asked to see the dope, I asked to see the cash
He reached for that briefcase too fast
A fuckin' pig, yo, he thought he had the chump
I had my nigga in the closet with a bull pump
And now there's fuckin' shot-up body all on the floor
But that's what the shovel's for...
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Newark and Miami are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Detroit and Chicago are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where that shit goes down
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
D.C. and Cleveland are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where the shit goes down
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
I know all my niggas live in down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down"
118,Ya Shoulda Killed Me Last Year,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Before I go id like to say a few things. this album was completed on January 15th 1991. By now the war has probably started and a whole bunch of people have probably died out there in the desert over some bullshit. There's a war goin' on right now in my neighborhood but I can't really determine which one is worse... I think the one that we are all fightin is fucked up and that's the war inside out brains you know. but uh I feel bad about all the brothers and sisters gettin' pulled right out of their neighborhoods all the citys and small towns in America that go over there and fight for that bullshit. that most of them don't really have anything to do with. So I gotta send peace out to em. Also peace out to all my homies in jail brothers that are dead locked up right here on earth... talkin' about the brothers in solidad, san quetin, all the way up to pelicans bay, tracy, chino, and all my homeboys out there in the east coast lockdown facilities. I'm talkin' about clinton, rikers, jolead, you know every prison in the whold fuckin' world man, that's like you know all bullshit you know. they say slavery has been abolished except for the convicted felon y'all need to think about that. that lets you know what the fuckin' constitution is really about you know. Alot of my homeboys have been locked down
My whole entire career and that's some bullshit. So for them from the Rhyme Syndicate and Ice-T Id like to send this special shout out... Fuck the police, Fuck the FBI, Fuck the DEA, Fuck the CIA, Fuck Tipper Gore, Bush and his cripple bitch this is Ice-T I'm out of here, told ya you shoulda killed me last year..."
119,You Played Yourself,1989,The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say (1989),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"This is it, dope from the fly kid
The Ice mic is back with the high bid
Suckers you've lost 'cause players you're not, gangstas you ain't
You're faintin', punk, if you ever heard a gunshot
Yo, the pusher, the player, the pimp gangsta, the hustler
High Roller, dead pres folder
Is cold lampin' like a black king on a throne
Evil E... turn up the microphone
So I can ill and break on the rollin' tape
Another album to make? Great
Islam turn the bass kick up a bit
Hype the snare, now I got a place to sit
And ride the track like a black mack in his 'lac
Hit the corner slow where the girls are at
And kick game the way it should be done
How you gonna drop science? You're dumb
Stupid ignorant, don't even talk to me
At school you dropped Math, Science and History
And then you get on the mic and try to act smart
Well let me tell you one thing, you got heart
To perpetrate, you're bait, so just wait
Till the press shove a mic in your face
Or you meet Boogie Down or Chuck D
Stetsasonic or the Big Daddy
And they ask you about the game you claim you got
Drop science now, why not?
You start to sweat and fret, it gets hot
How'd you get into this spot?
You played yourself...
Yo, yo, you played yourself...
I'm no authority but I know the D-E-A-L
When it comes to dealin' with the females
What you got they want, cash is what they need
Slip sucker and they'll break you with speed
But you meet a freak, you try to turn her out
Spendin' money's what I'm talkin' about
But you fool out, your pockets got blew out
And after the date, no boots, you got threw out
Mad and shook 'cause your duckets got took
Call her up, phone's off the hook
But who told you to front and flaunt your grip?
You can't buy no relationship
You played yourself...
Yo, homeboy, you played yourself...
I'm in the MC game, a lot of MC's front
And for the money they're sell out stunts
But they claim that they're rich and that they keep cash
Yo, let me straighten this out fast
Two hundred thousand records sold
And these brothers start yellin' 'bout gold?
You better double that, then double that again
And still don't get sooped, my friend
You think you've made it, you're just a lucky man
Guess who controls your destiny, fans
But you diss 'em 'cause you think you're a star
That attitude is rude, you won't get far
'Cause they'll turn on you quick, you'll drop like a brick
Unemployment's where you'll sit
No friends 'cause you dissed 'em too
No money, no crew, you're through
You played yourself...
That's right, you played yourself...
You played yourself...
Yo, yo, you played yourself...
You got problems, you claim you need a break
But every dollar you get you take
Straight to the Dopeman, try to get a beam up
Your idle time is spent tryna scheme up
Another way to get money for a jumbo
When you go to sleep you count Five-O's
Lyin' and cheatin', everybody you're beatin'
Dirty clothes and you're skinny 'cause you haven't been eatin'
You ripped off all your family and your friends
Nowhere does your larceny end
And then you get an idea for a big move
An armed robbery... smooth
But everything went wrong, somebody got shot
You couldn't get away, the cops roll, you're popped
And now you're locked, yo, lampin' on Death Row
Society's fault? No
Nobody put the crack into the pipe
Nobody made you smoke off your life
You thought that you could do dope and still stay cool? Fool.
You played yourself...
You played yourself...
Ain't nobody else's fault, you played yourself."
120,Ziplock,1991,O.G. Original Gangster (1991),Gangsta Rap|Hip Hop,Ice-T,"Once again I'm back in the place to be
The I, the C, the E, the T
I'll never get a Grammy, so fuck the G
All I need is crowd, and my M-I-C
Got a gangster ass DJ named Evil E
My record label's called Warner B
William Morris is my agency
I'll never go broke, I got property
Got a dope pitbull named Felony
Got four gold albums
So what you tell'n me?
Power was two, Iceberg was three
This one here shipped five hundred G
Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep
Benz's, Bemers, and boomin' Jeeps
I'm always strapped
Cause my money I keep
You move on the Ice
And you're goin' to sleep
But when you see me
Walkin' down the street
You say, ""What's up Ice?""
And I say, ""Peace!""
You give me a dap, I give you one back
'Cause I ain't souped
So forget about that
We might take pictures
Sign 'n' utograph
Kick a little flavor
Have some fun and laugh
But step to me wrong
You might get shot
And wind up lookin' out a ziplock!"
