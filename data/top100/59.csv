0,10 Bands,2015,If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man
Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin' let 'em rest in peace
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell these story I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was paying momma's rent was I turning 17
Sold it dirty like Diana never clean
My ex ask me where I'm moving I said ""On to better things""
10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man
Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin' let 'em rest in peace
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit going
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo in a week now
10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man
Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin' let 'em rest in peace
I been on a mission haven't left the condo
This that OvO that SZN this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless you can keep the diamonds
Treating diamonds of Atlanta like it's king of diamonds
Take a flick I look like Meechy look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man I told my city I'd be gone till November, then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God put both hands together that's amazing grace
6 God selfish with the love, I need all the praise
(Woo)
They got me feeling like the one again
(Woo)
They got me feeling like the one again
Yeah shout goes out to Nike checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been
10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man
Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin' let 'em rest in peace
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit going
In the six cooking with the wri-wri-wri-wri"
1,30 for 30 Freestyle,2015,What A Time To Be Alive (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids'll lose their lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need it 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to get no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champ√∫, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena
But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know"

They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm workin' too hard let's get into some fun shit
281 in my city, heard you had trouble at customs

I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know, ah that's the worst boy (worst)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6 boy
Shit hot up in the 6 right now shit hot up in the 6 boy
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now

I give a fuck about your mob boy
I'm the real 6 God boy
I'm about to say a true thing

It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now"
5,6 Man,2015,If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm...
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly 'cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift
If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me"
6,6PM in New York,2015,If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Yeah, oh you gotta love it
Oh you got, oh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but can't change it alone
I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside
Oh you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual
So I guess it's understandable man
Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait till next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses
Putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
Oh you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it"
7,9,2016,Views (2016),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city
This shit ain't gonna stop
It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better
Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than 'em telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'mma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose a bet, we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jangalang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)"

9,A Scorpio's Mind,2006,Room for Improvement (2006),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"(Nickelus F: speaking)
Niggas in the city hatin' me man they trippin'
When I'm the only one that's really spittin'
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really grippin'
Why you deck (?) me up actin' like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop
(Verse: Nickelus F)
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbin on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yappin off
Mad 'cause the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they neega (?)
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are 'cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, for prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock 'em like Blanca from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin'
Hope your listenin to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin
That its crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond
VA,
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day
(Verse: Drake)
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at 'em I guess you could call it a parody
But compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it ain't how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touchin my palm
Seein your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artist feelin' threatened
'Cause I'm harnessin a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
To play around, to perfection I'm the spittin' image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spittin' image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin' Hova
And writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad, I say ""I expected this""
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding it's a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protege, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boi"

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings

From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many [?]
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the PIT STOPS
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put it in the heart of Pickering
And tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh
(?)
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
(Drake)
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane [?]
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina go rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country y'all
Orangemen and White Haven, an back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
[?] Light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
(?] Pass the torch and sell they soul [?)
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that
'Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they [?] to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and [?] dro and twenty stacks
(?)
(?)
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at!
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM"

It's Southern Smoke Boy!
Ho, Yeah, Uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boy of summer are here man
Ayo Track, I got something mean for this one boy
(Verse 1: drake)
Chances Are Most of the day you was lying around
I made money that's why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem desitend for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled
In I take q's from my big boy popz
I 'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm coppin some vows for the bar
Get it guess not picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me
Now a day I peep they intrests
Specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a
This knowledge if you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money then lovers separate for I commit the date up
I put a split in the middle then I seperater
(Chorus: trey songz)
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
That's it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more
(Chorus: trey songz)
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game
(Verse 3: trey songz)
When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)
(CHORUS x2: TREY SONGZ)
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
That's it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)
(CHORUS x2: TREY SONGZ)
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coop of my truck

It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game"
12,All Me,2013,Nothing Was the Same (2013),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line,"" ok
Made a million, off of denim
Fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
I touched down at '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked girls that used to babysit
But that's was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck wit' us and we don't fuck wit' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, ""You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help""
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear y'all just wastin' y'all breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'mma make it last forever,
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Hoe, shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, needles it
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch
All Me. All Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
Before the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking all that kush all in our section like its legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm less than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, touching they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-through
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do."

14,Asthma Team,2007,Comeback Season (2007),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Swear to you, Lord
Same dudes that used to laugh at me
See me in the CL6 with half a B
They know that money begets money, so naturally
Me, I have to blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
'Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two partners in that caprice
With no copies made, I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mold you rappers like plaster, see
I have the dreams but dog, me and success are two things
You don't wanna find your ass between
Back against the wall like a plasma screens
The inside of my wallet is pasture green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while is smash the scene
I should leave Earth, it's nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and every night is new years
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these skeptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all
Family, money and music is all I ever knew
My neck will suffer from depression
It is forever blue
Cheer up baby, You don't see all this revenue
I started the game at level two, I'm saying
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel flying spur Tony Park it
And it's cool if you spill something it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colors only dark shit
If Toronto's where you living today
Then you ain't making records the people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move
Sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints
I'm giving away
You feel me?"

We don't even go out no more
It's always the same eh
Always complainin
It's obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see there's a lot to lose
'Cause we got a baby
And people are shady
(Bridge: drake)
My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we denied from the back
You can die where from, or die where you at
(Drake chorus)
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they don't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next
Lend me ya kleenex
I'm tellin' you baby
I think I'm a bout to cry
Still gotta go out tonight
'Cause I gotta feed you
I hope that I see you again... again
Hope that I see you, see you
(Chorus: drake)
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they don't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
(Verse: drake)
Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'Specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, that's how the world is
That's how niggas puttin' they dirt down
Streets are seedy I call 'em sesame... berkstown
'Specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, it's hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin'
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good"
17,Barry Bonds Freestyle,2007,Comeback Season (2007),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"It's what you all been waiting for ain't it
You weakly entertainin
For me to get a hold of this beat
Go ahead claim it
I'mma bout to paint a picture
You niggahs go ahead frame it
Since we gettin' sinfeld
With that jerry and elaine shit...
I flow far from medeocer
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck a 54
So it's obvious y'all be steady rollin' with some jokers
And me? I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn. can you niggahs get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the ebarresement, don't even aproch her
Disguise your self, go buy a costume
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms
(Ughh) and I was praying I would drop June,
But label reps applying preasure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for pet sakes
You fake gangsta rappers a clecha
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet drake
I'll be in your face,
Like ""no speak a la engliash""
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for y'all material motives
'Cause if you like it y'all shud stick with me
My money good, I ain't neva had to flip a key
Alotta ice, alotta cream like dickey d
Might cut the phone and disapear like mishy me
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me
Slid in threw a harry bendale like it's slippery
And your ex man's a hatter oficialy
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah... that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I've done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar
He just made cause his gurls at the house
With her tongue stickign out,
Like a Michael Jordan rookie hard
Let me addrres this, parden me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could have been gotti in the flix
But at this point I'm just pocking a body with a stick
Now a days rapping is a childrens hobby
And grils keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I gotta buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp
I try'd to sell weed, give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pump me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionare shades, fade with the waves
I smurk at a niggah if he still rocking braids
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every niggah except trey...
(Ey) I'm outta here baby, they asked me about the past years and how does it phaze me
I wudnt take it back, naww not if they pay me
Unless you betcha that's expencive 'cause it's not a?
Spittin' a crock pot of bottemless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggahs some hope
You put the yay beat and put that shit in a joke
Well... I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Niggah keep your two cents I ain't trynna leave you broke
Life of a don, lights keep gloown
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
Something crazy on my arm...
And heres another hit barry bonds"

Magazine, paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle

Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

Sweatpants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest

You don't even trip when friends say
You ain't bringin' Drake along
You know that I'm workin'

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' 'cause I be so official

Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
So then I gotta hide, what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damn
Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
Is why I gotta ask...
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you and damn
I can't even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
This why I gotta ask,
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand (new (6x))
Or is everything I'm doing too (late (6x))
Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late?
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Show me if this is brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

25,Buried Alive (Interlude),2011,Take Care (2011),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"If you was in a pine box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep
Cause you are the death of me
(Kendrick Lamar)
Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling
Hands I was dealt when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when you're my type
And you're winning from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience
One day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word
Like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation
A reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
And it didn't help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I'm breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died"

But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long
Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down

On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen

Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything

Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down
Who's callin' my name? Who's involved now?
Tell me who I gotta down, I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute

Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein', 'cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release date
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, ""Are we straight?""
Two-faced nigga back around with the three face
Damn, oh, triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face
Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think you niggas teamin' up and scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
Six side, east side, all that for my area
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I'm confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high."

Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
Burrrrat stick it, b-burrrrat stick it

See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place

I get a dessert plate

35,Come Thru,2013,Nothing Was the Same (2013),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon... and nothing was the same
Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib,
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something
Come through... come through... come through... come through...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come through
Come through... come through... come through... come through...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come through
Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, Crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing forreal
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something
Come through... come through... come through... come through...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come through
Come through... come through... come through... come through...

36,Come Winter,2006,Room for Improvement (2006),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up north
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter
But listen...
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like where's my hi?
I swear, that I never called you 'cause I really get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter
Where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drugs dealers standin and they parka hoods slip up
Where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
(Talking: over chorus)
Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just west of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed 'cause she's sweet
Then she says ""i heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat,
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good,
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat""
Off this I'm kinda takin' it back for a second,
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin' off I should've been more southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!
(Talking: over chorus)
Yeah, uh, I told y'all I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is
And now, I'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin' different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin' everyone imma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her,
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then spring shows up, and it's dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
I miss you, most of aaaallll, my daarling [beat fades out]
(Gimme a second to gather my toughts)
[Fades back in] strolling in the park (ho!)
And watching winter turn to spriing (such a beautiful day man)
(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing
(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)
(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)
I remember them encore pms, breakfast and the wake up
Now drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her,
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladie's hearts always gettin' damaged and stolen
But this summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handin' them crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and chomp clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
'Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song special I recorded with voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin' for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find a heavy girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the though of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also room for improvement as soon as June arrive
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing"

None of them as hot as me
The industry standard
So I am what they gotta be

I think I should pass my own amendment

You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows
And tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me ""Is that a rose?""
You mean ros√©?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless

My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb
Ticket on the dash
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard
So I am what they gotta be
'Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows
And tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me ""Is that a rose?""
You mean ros√©?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
You're in need of ya own, man"

That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelin's
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself""
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Cause you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road and the East end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause this nigga's creepin' and I like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, ""You drive my whip like it's yours""
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'

What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So girl, what you singing for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake IDs and the trash we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of girls, first flight from Poland
Why? 'Cause
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, then made history
Tell them imma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathing

I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine

They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Caterin' is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sure√±os
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira
I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I"
49,Do It All,2010,Young Sweet Jones (2010),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I'm at home yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded, well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
Probably why I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it
(Drake - Verse 1)
Tonight I'm into breaking up
Somebody's home
I'm drunk as ever
I'm not alone, I, I, I, I, I'm with my people
I know you love it
I don't just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair Pinot Grigio
Baby forget about it
I'm headed wherever this muthf-cking jet is routed
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it
My judgements never clouded
That's why I'm steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I'm about whatever man
I'm tryna f-ck with tinkerbell in never neverland
But I'm polite about it
Baby after you
I've had a glass or too so
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do

I'mma do it all
Probably why I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it
(Drake - Verse 2)
Tryna get the green like I'm waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where'd I just put my bow tie
Millionnaire multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a given
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask what's up and they just always say the cost of livin'
I love from it though, I've been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love I don't think should happen
Because everythings easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Cause the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I'm still the mafia, still run the committee
NY forever n-gga, Diddy,
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking that it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did

I'mma do it all

Watch me do it"
50,Do It Now,2009,Born Successful (2009),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Uh... yeah, all right. well all right. well all right. uhuh. yeah... feels good.
It's a celebration, clap clap bravo,
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado for the girl who's a student, and her friend who's a model.
Finish the whole bottle, and we gon do it big like this... yeah, and he was just practice.
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas.
Girl, you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card, and baby you can max this, ah-out.
Show me where your tats is.
Show me where your heads at; maybe I can grasp it.
They say if you get her, you can understand her better,
And she's known to be a cheater, but that's only if you let her.
And I got it together.
So when they talk and try to deter me, it's like whatever.
Tell 'em I appreciate the help, but I just gotta know for myself.
Ayo, ayo, ayo...[repeat 4x]
This lifestyle is foul, this shit'll damage ya.
Especially when you think no one's understandin ya.
These girl groups with their overprotective managers got paparrazi over my shoulder,
Clickin they cameras.
Snap, snap, snap, until they runnin' outta card space.
You remind me of Tony's sister in Scarface.
Just take it easy on love, and slow your heart rate.
Goodness gracious, the top is such a hard place. Yeah.
But if you never even been there, it kinda makes sense why you dyin' to pretend, dear.
Spillin all your drinks, and takin' pictures in your swimwear.
Head up in the clouds, you survivn on the thin air.
I know that shit is exhaustin, girl... and your mistakes are costin, girl...
And maybe you don't need the help, but I just gotta see for myself."
51,Do Not Disturb,2017,More Life (2017),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep till morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life"

It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different

We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

I can't believe
Don't you have a man?

It's all right with me my girl
We can do anything
Why you over there looking at me?
While your man standing right beside ya
The temporary happiness he might provide ya
But you know and I know
That nobody gon' do you like me
Tryin' to say you're like a goalie in line of sight
I say I know that I feel her
But slowly I'm kinda like
I don't really wanna
Hit this girl
And so she want the chef stick
Like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, Ima give it to you hunny bunches
You feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on some Subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it
They wanna wrap it and cuddle with
Consequences keep weighing me down
So whenever she think I'm serious
I'm playing around
It gets deeper and colder
And funny thing is
I'm writing this in my head
And she asleep on my shoulder

Look, we had a little thing
A winter time fling
Used to get back to my man mistreating
But that was then
You know,
Some hush hush
I ain't ever really see a future in us
Plus your man still there
Let's be fair
You'll do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past
Some late night smash
I don't wanna take the place of he
Late nights 85 south
On my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about
'Cause I been the other man
And you not gunna try me
With your silly little plan
It's my bad
Should have chose a woman
But now I'm in a mix
With this lil' girl playing
I'm saying
You need to do what you do
I'm not trying to take it
Any further with you
Don't you have a man?
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe
Don't you have a man?
It's all right with me my girl
We can do anything
I met her at the bar
Sippin' on patron and
Now it's been three years off and on
Cause the same page, we are rarely
Off and on
'Cause when I'm in, she out
And when she in, I'm gone
We lost contact like bausch and lomb
But regained it when she was building
A house and home with this new cat
Saying that he doing her right
It just proves that,
She don't know
What to do with her life
'Cause if so,
She wouldn't have to change her strategy
Snd wouldn't need me to recharge her
Batteries...
One minute she mad at me
Next minute it's all good
And I'm in her body like grays anatomy
I don't understand why
God sent me to you
And I can't try to justify the foul shit
We do
All I know is that each time I'm
Stickin you, I think to myself
Damn
If only homie knew
Don't you have a man?

Why you trying to be my girl?

All they want to talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all
Young Money man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded so please bring your finest
And what are all your names again, we drunk, remind us

She wants me, she wants me
'Cause I got it all shawty, tell me what you don't see
I would fuck with all y'all, all of y'all are beautiful
I just can't pick one so you can never say I'm choosey, hoes
And Wayne say pussy, pussy, pussy
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all, damn
And every time I think of stayin' wit her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider
'Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too

Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every house of diddy chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Will so married woman and MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss you-can-get-the-business, hah

And I swear I'm feelin' all y'all

It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
Look I ought to be thankful because for women I have plenty of love
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at 50 you make love, 30 you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw,
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right now, wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change
Because you special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'ma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'ma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'ma change yeah this summer is gone
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own
Because you special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
Believe me baby, Stevie baby

Just like Norma Jean

I can't believe I've fallen for you

Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days

When I 'em hear talkin'
I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me
I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural

You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it

Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
And you makin' it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before now it's me clearin' it
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though

And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learned to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city I let her explore
And now she's sayin' she more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flyin' back home for the heritage classic

Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake, though
Miraval to the face, though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows and front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin' our name on a double cup
We ain't even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin' me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?""
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, ""Poor me""
Where you at? I never see you
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It's bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me pay it no mind
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Hidden Hills where I post, yeah
'Ye already know, yeah
I'm the troublemaker in the neighborhood
Far as troublemakin' goes, yeah
House party up the road, yeah
I'm not Kid 'n Play
This kid doesn't play about the flow, yeah
Y'all keep playin' with your nose, yeah
You get high and do the most, yeah
How you let the kid fightin'
Ghost-writin' rumors turn you to a ghost?
Oh, you niggas got jokes
Free smoke, free smoke
Baka
Yeah, we outchea
Ya don know, aye?
It's a OVO ting, aye?
Ya don know, aye?
It's a East Side ting, aye?
Ya don know, aye?
More life"
71,From Time,2013,Nothing Was the Same (2013),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'll never make you feel like that
'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?
'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?
'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love"
72,Furthest Thing,2013,Nothing Was the Same (2013),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show their face now
What they got to say now?
Nothing they can say now
Nothing really changed but still they look at me away now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothing was the same
I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know
I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know
And I hate that you don't think that I belong to ya
Just too busy running shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it
I can't help it
I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me
Stop pretending, stop that fronting
I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger
Girl you know I seen ya naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Getting high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing
And makeup sex is tradition
But you've been missing girl
And you might feel like nothing was the same
I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know
Drinking, smoking, fucking, plotting
Scheming, plotting, scheming, getting money
Drinking, fucking, smoking, plotting, scheming,
Plotting, getting money
This the life for me
My mama told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more
Y'all niggas build and destroy
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't fill it before
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
This the shit I wanna go out to"

Money is everythang, and its every other thing.
I'm part of the choir, it's the motto that my brotha sang.
Cash is the right now, women are the post game.
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain.
It's comin' too soon, album on the way.
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon.
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em.

I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake.
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake.
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin' to roller skate.
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit.

This is for all the stripper 'cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it.
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear.
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year.
Text brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin' full circle, get up on my axis.
Maybe Imma kill 'em, only 'cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest.
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin' loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth.
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience 'cause I want it to make sense.
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness... DRAKE!
Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone.
Homie scared. 'Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy.

I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout y'all
I ain't talkin' moths but you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog.
I went from penny pinchin to private planes.
Never sat on any benches, I got in games.
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit y'all order.

They take off their clothes and put on my t's.
This supplement I'm on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese.

Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze.
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need.

If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it.
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer.
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me.
I'm a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I don't have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually.
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering.
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery.

(Verse 1: Drake)
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor, tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO, D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again, return of the mack again
""Deceiving"" was cool, I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rappa friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' you know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me... little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best decisions you've made
I'm sunnin' them all, I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited to degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin' Long Sands Beach, kinda adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall
With friends that I ball with
Hear me: Trey's girl go and get me some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise, I will kill this song till it actually dies
With military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best till the stats arrive
At all these a-list parties you fratranize
Where you can't wear hats inside only slacks and ties
Bu you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy till the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya

Canadian visitor, lady exibitor
Play me I'll visit ya, lay ya in critical condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim face, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos, now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be, niggas know how dis shit be
Step to the club, security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor, dey give us a couple sips free
I be on Henessy, straight no cubes
Take me where the women be, I won't lose
Drake take Patron to the face till he wasted
I'm blowin' till I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
All me Mister Anderson huh I'm ramblin
But at the same time, I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's you're name, hey call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's gametime
We could take a couple shots, break down ya d'z
Take it to the hole, post up on me
Let me feel the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas

Big stage, and I holla ""where dem thugs at? ""
Fellaz hit me and they holla ""where the drugs at? ""

And I be all ova da streets

Believe that my haters are my motivators

If you could you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in your throne
I done flipped the trunk on her
They screamin', ""Nicki leave me alone!""
I am, I'm still the one to beat
Ain't in a rush from these streets
I am the streets
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard!
Carter called, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man down!)
Hit 'em on a walkie-talkie
Hit em, hit 'em knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians
Or a real real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the Mac, hit 'em with the Tec 9
Hit 'em with the Ruger by the intersex line
Hit 'em with a tommy so my niggas call me Kimmy and I always the jammy in the Trunka of the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda

This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas whellying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back-east, South Ishakis (?)
This is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinsky
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed

I show up rite before the store clothes
And blow the feed from my last 4 shows
I do 1 song and use 4 flows
She use to be a christian before...
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes,
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me and the salesman build a reporso
He understands tha fact that I'm spending all sure doe
Cash only, transactions homie,
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dnt know I bought it
I been doin' this for yrs homie, thoroughly I thought it
Through, what it do? I am currently recorded on a track and made most of my currency's imported
We're too late now, too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if they're crimes that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker, playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A mis kite as they say is a legal bender
And ATF is present every legal member
The coalition, is so officient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so dnt try to make Compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen,
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Use to record in a basement that rennie gru was pimpin'
When pops turned over the keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with pimpin'
Till I met janette I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, NIGGA
And I'm a keep killin' 'em until the day tht Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I'm a comer w. great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate somethingg
I try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
They collo that I just purchased is sound vacant
'Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic,
Aside from the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life..."
80,Goodnite & Goodluck,2009,Born Successful (2009),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"I guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elavated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a century
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo'
Converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight by
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, y'all the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
'Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, nigga"

Got a cannon on my hip but nigga this is not Mariah.
Nah, this the record killer for hire.
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require,
Look what I created despite the niggas that hated,
Every single bar gettin' first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin' so sedated.
The me and bitch the same we feeling so related,
Forest Hill estated or Dennis Caded
I put a thousand on it, I could prolly fuck the waitress.
So wait just take this,
One line at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, nigga haha
Yeah, I wrote this verse sittin' in my new car,
Sometimes where you headed is too far,
It's more about where you are.
And I am everywhere that you wish you could be
Somebody somewhere just really understood me

Gotta do what I gotta do
(Verse 1: Drake)
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like
(Hook: Lil Wayne)
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say
(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fucking right
Fucking right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fucking right
Fucking right, all right

So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like
(Hook: Lil Wayne)
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?

And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now
I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down

Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months

So she's here and we're both so gone
Hotel to hotel, girl -- I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me

You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes -- don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo shit -- I put you back in yo place
She tells me ""I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face""
And hangs up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you

I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl""
You be like ""oh, word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

Boss up, I'm the bigger homie

That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again

But uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion

Look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here I got chauferred
Bring me champagne flutes
Rose and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke good ain't no glaucoma
I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot 'Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it reppin', I never do it second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
'Cause we have nothin' in common
Since I done became star
I done became big swervin' right in to my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holla my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
An show me the city that I'll without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money see the paper cut fingers
My song is ya girlfriend's wakin' up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause a eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figga
How to get these label heads to offer 'em good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous 'cause
Them hipsters gon' have to get alone with them hood niggas

But in the meantime you can call me Young Roy
Jones Junior fightin' the drugs and gun charge

My mind is on succeed
And I am in the lead
Don't buy into the skeems the science or stratege

Never tired nor fatigue
Never defiant to my team
Never lien on the thing until

Hooked to wires 'n' things imma die as
A king, if I don't do it now imma try it again
And when I do accomplish it ima try it again
Ima riot insane
I'm a lion my mane hangs down to my strains
And their tied to the game
I stay dry when it rain I'm tired of the fame
Got everything to gain and I'm proud of the pain
The pride and the plain the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane beside were the same
Whose guidin the train
Whose flyin the plane
Whose drivin' the lane
Who dies when it bang
Who fires when it bang
Who lies in the aim
Two lives in the drain
Who cries when they sang
You hide but you can't
You hide but you ain't
I advise you to thank you don't
Find what you can't
Revive what you tank survive what you paint
Supersize what you shrink
The fries and the drink
Admired as a saint
Defined by my rank
Combined with my strength
My time and my length
Ima iron out the kinks

You can't harm me mentally
Not physically not spiritually
You never get rid of me I am the epitome if this is
What you did to me nothins what you did for me
Nothins what you give to me
I take whatever I'm visioning
I break all of the limitings
I shake all of the gimicking the fakery the trickery
Nurse how sick is he worst I'm sickening
I'll be at the finish line first how quick is he
Ima make sure they mention me for the next century

And I hate failure and I am in love with
Achievement above and beneath it
A hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize and I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin' begun with the preachin

I play until I have won whatever we win
I play until I have won and then I rewin

103,In My Business,2010,Young Sweet Jones (2010),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"(Gucci Mane)
I'm so f-cking dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs,
There's a diamond on my d-ck so there's a diamond on her tongue,
I can't feel you baby 'cause I romantically numb,
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,
There's nothing on the God son that I haven't done,
I got a lot of problems, getting p-ssy just isn't one,
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,
Man they like potato chips I just can't have one,
And I might like you for a minute,
But I don't like your friends in my business,
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,
'Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping,
(Drake - Chorus)
Uh, uh ah,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
Problem is you prol tell that sh-t to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you,
Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,
I'm all star team Jordan, small forward,
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,
How how (?) f-ck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,
Life is moving fast, where the f-ck do all these minutes go,
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,
Now I get a hundred what the f-ck you think I'm in it for,
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree,
F-ck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,
Shout out to your girlfriend n-gga lately she distracting me,
Wondering if I'm the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas,
Girls wanna f-ck your n-ggas, guy don't wanna be you,
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to,
So you can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,
(Sean Garrett)
Ain't that your girl,
Ain't that your money,
Ain't you the same n-gga that say she want you that you funny,
Ain't you a gangsta, yeah funny,
You gave 'em funny, gave you to you, f-cking dummy,
Classic line, b-tches run like buses,
Gucci say n-ggas asking why, why you with my girl,
She let me get it n-gga,
She ain't stupid, go turn up your radio,
I'm the next young Lionel Richie,
I gives a f-ck about doing a f-cking cameo,
We don' love em, we don' love em, we don' love em, NO!
They just love us, they just love us, 'cause we stack them O's
'Cause we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
That's gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don't go
(Drake)
Uh UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
Problem is you prol tell that sh-t to everybody,

Then I said, ""Baby, wassup?""
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug
Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil' buzz
Up in VIP with all my thug niggas
You leaned over and said you want me

For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it
Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help

I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed

Being indecisive makes me anxious

I should have gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm all singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help
Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
That tells 'em my life is too much and moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know
I always up too late I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home
Warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money I'm still young and just unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead

113,Keep the Family Close,2016,Views (2016),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing 'cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer
Anytime people want to start problems
It's like ""for real, are you dumb?""
You know who man's are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither

Uh, what up y'all!
Soundtrack what's popping baby?
Y'all ain't know, I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that first and fifteen
Jyea, uh!
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying?
Legally and illegally
Hahaha...
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out
(Verse 1: lupe fiasco)
First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip
And bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like THISSSSS
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling
Something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, just the first kickflip he land it
Uh, labeled a misfit, a bandit
Kakunk Kakunk Kakunk!
His neighbors couldn't stand it so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop till after dark
Yeah, when they said, ""It's getting late in here...
...So I'm sorry young man there's no skating here""
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast
(Verse 2: drake)
(Waddup Lupe, Chi Town!)
My style is very Tennessee
Mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barley remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
But check it gets boring growing up in memphis
Trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board it gets expensive
Luckly my aunt working as a nurse
So every time I needed something she just reach up in her purse
And plus she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I 'm staying in her house then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She say you need to be doing something other than skating
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
I ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting
So now it's me and old school
Chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Open up the window told me that the coast clear
Now I coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
Homie this is Recess east test
Life's ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes I'm literly Landel Lewis with a kick and a snare
Kick flip in the air
The kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here
Breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
Cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
I say aunty this is a safe career
She said Drake I told you there's no skating here
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast
(Verse 3: lupe fiasco)
Before he knew he had a crew
That wasn't no punk
And they spitfire shirts
And SB dunks
They would push till they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
Any escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy
They needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds
The world was theirs
Uh, and their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, ""There's no skating here""
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel

You don't even smile, for me

Tell me that we posed to be together till the world end

I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back
Convince you that time will heal that

And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to

I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire

Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me

Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy

The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging

'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors

That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do

Both N'Sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
Where niggas said I know, tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well tell her fall back caught up in some more shit tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass

Wake up in the house I look around see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see hell everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked outside Buford County came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean I ain't even started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean my shit still there
Just imagine you was living lavish and they still there
Walk up in the crib look pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that will keep it real yeah
Got a lot of pretty bitches I just paid their bills now
Money make me feel good but does she make me feel good
Known for gettin' that guala out in Europe while we're still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a motherfucker like I'm on my last damn dollar
Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch
I ain't talking about some real money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money bitch
Reporting live from the gutter, I will buy this motherfucker
It's not even a discussion (whoop)
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gon' end up dipping with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her tripping off of yay, yay
Pillow talking dishing out on all y'all
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take what's coming
Live from the gutter dog, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as that night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dogs who go Karrueche with the chopsticks
And we gon miss you
They don't wanna smoke they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through
And I'm...
Reporting live from the fucking gutter
I ain't talking about some real money shit
Reporting live from the damn gutter
Swear to god I'll buy this motherfucker ah"
121,Look What You've Done,2011,Take Care (2011),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father -- my one button, you push it
Now it's ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son -- man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it
This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now -- he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
It still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked from me to you, got from me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out man
You deserve it
(Drake's Grandmother)
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help
In keeping me in this, in this comfortably
All I can say Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feelings about that
So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you..."
122,Lord Knows,2011,Take Care (2011),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"(Intro: Rick Ross)
All we wanted was opportunity
(Just Blaze!) Lord knows!
(Verse 1: Drake)
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple porn stars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Hefner and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing
I'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real
Places they say they've been, we've actually going for real
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping
I'm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real
(Interlude: Rick Ross)
You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal
(Verse 2: Rick Ross)
I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink
The hustle's an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription strength of the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Everyday them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae
I run the game but the ladies think I'm running game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothing short of great"
123,Lose You,2017,More Life (2017),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)
No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
This is the 6's year
Six hundreds instead of six, OVO
You know we'll be rockin' our asses out
To my big brother Drizzy
You know what I'm sayin'?

124,Lust for Life,2009,So Far Gone (2009),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"I'm tryin' to do it all tonight,
I got plans,
I got a certain lust for life,
And as it stands,
Everything is going as right,
As it can,
They tryin' to shoot down my flight,
Before it lands,
Before it lands
But you could miss me with all that,
Diss me then crawl back,
I really wish y'all would fall back,
But gettin' rich suppose to solve that,
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say,
No no no,
My ex sendin' late night text 'cause she don't know how to let,
Go go go
Uh,
She in love
And as for the pretty light skinned models standin' in the cold ah yeah they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see
Every time that I'm here but when am I really even here?
Black surburban wit' the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'ma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Mars yellow tux
I don't really give a fuck
And we only getting older
So what I tend to do is to think,
Of today, as the past
It's funny when you comin' in first,
But you hope, that you last
You just hope,
That it last (echoes 5x)

Throw your ones up in the air,
Throw your ones up in the air for her,
Oh oh, throw your ones up in the air,
Throw your ones up..."

What if I pick you up from your house
We should get out
We haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go
You know that I did
I don't know if you know but I know who you are

Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man

That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you'll always be the one
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?

It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too

Cobblestone, good view, little gravel, too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel, too

Steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in

Ya are part of the speech 'cause

I'm from the city where people be gettin' lazy
Litterin in the streets
And the club district is poppin' like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers
Money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams
And dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events
Bouncers give you pass
Directors give 'em a shot
So girls'll give up the ass
And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
Daffy and bugs, it's all laughing and hugs
Till the dude catch a plane
And she back where she was
Right back on the bus
Its ashame 'cause now at his rental
She throwin' bricks like shaq in the clutch
You can see that's she's colder
'Cause he doesn't hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her
That he couldn't mold her

Chances are that it ain't you

And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple that's eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in and the out

Whenever I'm out in memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm andreena mill
Japan and brazil, the audience acreaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
Think I had the mothafuckin' plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I'm the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn!
That punch line was predictable
I still got you shittin' bricks, homie, quit the bull
And we don't need new members
To me the clique is full
And I be getting' the same women that tip the pool
Believe or not
I receive a lot
So, I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buyin' the Louie that Kanyizzy cop
And I be rippin' the same reords that Weezy rock
This shit is east pot
That's why I'm ready, man
I'd never copy Norbit like eddie, man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head?
Did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just tryin' to make a four fit
Yeah, they need ot issue out a recall
I'm goin' up and they headin' into a freefall
The fundamental are needed, you playin' street

And the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades
In a group with no kids
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cuttin', we can cut some more
Then after you get high, make 'em, get 'em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got alota dough
Plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain't heard?
I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend, even if they been offended
They ain't really got a choice, it's an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it's a given
Plus a nigga famous
Plus I got a vision
Not to mention havin' bars like a mothafuckin' prison
They takin' too long
Their records on hold
They threatened by my presence
'Cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they braggin' 'bout what they sold
Just remember where I lived at, 50,000's goin' gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known

Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
Think I had the mothafuckin' plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I'm the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn!
That punch line was predictable
I still got you shittin' bricks, homie, quit the bull
And we don't need new members
To me the clique is full
And I be getting' the same women that tip the pool
Believe or not
I receive a lot
So, I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buyin' the Louie that Kanyizzy cop
And I be rippin' the same reords that Weezy rock
This shit is east pot
That's why I'm ready, man
I'd never copy Norbit like eddie, man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head?
Did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just tryin' to make a four fit
Yeah, they need ot issue out a recall
I'm goin' up and they headin' into a freefall
The fundamental are needed, you playin' street
And I was out at BET, but I didn't see y'all
These skee-low rappers wishing they could be tall
Lettin' all their fake friends use them like a free stall
Yep!

If I'm with the right niggas, you can scoop a O.Z.
All the hustlers and the bouncers
And the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades
In a group with no kids
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cuttin', we can cut some more
Then after you get high, make 'em, get 'em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got alota dough
Plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain't heard?
I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend, even if they been offended
They ain't really got a choice, it's an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it's a given
Plus a nigga famous
Plus I got a vision
Not to mention havin' bars like a mothafuckin' prison
They takin' too long
Their records on hold
They threatened by my presence
'Cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they braggin' 'bout what they sold
Just remember where I lived at, 50,000's goin' gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
'Stead of hatin' on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man
You actin' like a bitch
I ain't actin' like I'm rude
I'm just actin' like I'm rich, rich

131,Marvins Room,2011,Take Care (2011),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Hello? Yeah I just walked in.
Yeah I'm good... you still working?
Tonight, right now? Did I go out? Yeah I went out.
I went... I went to a couple of clubs.
I never went to bed, shit... wine or water?
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious...
Cups of the Rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that imma call her anyway and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me
Uh, cups of the XO, all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much that imma call you anyway and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor till it all goes bad, but shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, ""Well I'm sorry.""
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me
You're not going to come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said ""You niggas crazy.""
I hope no one heard that, I hope no one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble"

And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride

Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, 'cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!
I, take time arrange that (Money)

Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?-this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things
That don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man
Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
'Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6
And you don't ever come to where I stay
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day

But I just can't remember at all
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over
All right bottles on me, long as imma drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language... Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
'Bout to go Thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good Smir-do', a package of the Swishers
I did overnight, it couldn't have happened any quicker
Y'all know them? Well fuck it me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it
Throwin' hundreds when I should be throwin' ones

One thing about music when it hit you feel no pain
I swear I got that shit that make theses bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that
It's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain
Everything is Kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer
But I probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
And if you thinkin' imma quit before I die, dream on
They treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old

And still, I ask myself ""why do you worry?""
You know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...
(Drake - Verse 1)
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...
(Drake - Verse 2)
You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
'Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together -- I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before huh?
I still got 10 years to go huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
These kids wear crowns over here
And everything is all right"

Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me
They still out to get me, they don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
They like Pablo, ""why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?""
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago, aye
South, south, side, that's the motto, aye
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye
Throne is back up in it, aye
In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'mma let you finish but I...
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki
(Perfect)
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (lifestyle)"

You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball.

Dolla dolla bill y'all
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
Holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are
Cash rules everything around me

I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jes√∫s
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too

Fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel
Fuck all that happy to be here shit that y'all warned me on
I'm the big homie, they still tryna lil bro me dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and I say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin' different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same, man, I'm doin' it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just thoughts that I share with myself
But I thought Fuck It its worth it to share it with someone else more than Paris for once"

When it come to being Trill I'm a litmus test
I run it like a fitness test
And when it come to making history I'm like (?) son
A million ways to die you already chose one
A million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning
We on the top now go back and tell the hook we winning
And while ya there let 'em know we did it just for them
I made them cough the cash up and left them just the phlegm
Is that the King of the trill go tell 'em yes it's him
And his testosterone is up who's got the oestrogen
I like your girl and I think she like me even more
I hit her with that heave and ho and them I'm leaving bro
The dirty South's finest and dirty south's behind us
Now that's a plus on the report card not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your lighters
You got a problem with us you know its just as hard to find us

I broke my bread and fed the team just like the Holy Father
I helped the blind to see and keep it G just like I oughta
The only thing that's left for us to do is walk on water
We playing all four quarters till the clock expire
So till I see the ref waving I will not retire
My flow is still official and I still got the fire
Can't take your eyes off me, like when you watch the wire
And in '0-10 we finna go in
So let the opposition know there is no win
And I am no friend so put your hand down
Tell 'em stand down before it's man down

Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?

Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it

It's Young Money, motherfucker
If you ain't runnin' wit it, run from it, motherfucker, all right
Now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first
Uh, how do he say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more off my second leg
Ma'fuckin' Birdman Junior, eleventh grade
Ball on automatic start
I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
No-now, c'mon, be my blood donor
Flo' so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big, and let the small fall under that
Damn, where you stumbled out? From where they make gumbo at
Kane got the fuckin' beat jumpin' like a jumping jack
But you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga, nothin' short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it

Yeah. Ren. M.O.F. Haha.
It's Drake man. It's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma half to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doing
The samples that they using, can't get through the clearing
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careering forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doing what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son he gon miss you
And plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too
Now you looking for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, or question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'ma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
It's stress my nigga!
I'm just trying to live my life 'cause
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife 'cause BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life 'cause
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife 'cause BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
This is my life, and so the rest is kinda been cool, question what I been through
I write a verse addressing it, and yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school,
Me being the closest thing to black, and guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered, I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a ""nigger"" I'd punch them I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raising they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve, I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Because black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
It's stress my nigga!
I'm just trying to live my life 'cause
Make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife 'cause BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life 'cause
Make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife 'cause BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
Am I hot as the rest, should I strive for my spot as the best
Like girls with Double D's, I gotta lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of staring at quizzes (?) now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should have been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could have been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, or maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody running with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady, daughter, and her grandson
Nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been
Around the world and back, and I don't wanna question half the places Nick been
I got stress on my shoulders (Uh!)
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder (Yeah!)
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older (Oh!)
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers (Yeah man!)
It's stress my nigga!
I'm just trying to live my life 'cause
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife 'cause BO!, BO!, BO!, BO! (This that gritty shit boy)
I'm just trying to live my life 'cause (Got me winded over here man)
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife 'cause BO!, BO!, BO!, BO! (Uh)"

Mr. fano poloto suits on your night clothes
And jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full
Now this shits just been light pole
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets
Showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camara
Someone gotta tape dis
I make hits and like a bitch
Just married I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness
I'm that close to
Don't ever forget the moment

Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los angeles, cabanas or atlanta south
Watchin home shows
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarased
To put my phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She said I shouldn't have until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is and counts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters trying to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how

Standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now

Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em
Oh they did pole

And they think they can market you

Mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed in the slightest
Could of fooled me
Baa into my city I'm da 2-3

I quit school and is not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type

Lost some of my hottest versus down at cabo
So if you find a blackberry with the sides scroll

It's time to change your mobile Ringtone!
(Drake)
These girls ain't got nothing on you
Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
Obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to
Put those f-cking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what your doing
Put that f-cking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures
Shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it, hey oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you nothing on you
What you need
(The Dream)
I can be (I can be)
Your everything
(Who knew)
Them other n-ggas
Just wanna hit it but if they had it
Wouldn't know what to do with it
(And together)
(Drake and The Dream)
We shut it down down down
They know we shut it down down down
Your the baddest girl around...
(The Dream)
(?)
You shut that muthf-cker down down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that muthaf-cker down down down
Oh yeah,
Yes indeed, you shut it down down
Drizzy, The American Dream
You shut that sh-t down
(Down down down)
You shut it down
You shut it down
You shut it down
You shut it down
You shut it, oh
You looking good girl
Go go go get 'em girl,
Go go go go hit 'em girl
Go go go go go go
You shut it down"
169,Since Way Back,2017,More Life (2017),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Yeah
Thorn in my eye, as you beg I testified that
I hate being alone, girl, you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know how to treat you, but it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news, like ""dun-dun-dun-dun""
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful
We gotta listen to the old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you
Girl, I know you
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a little sexual, with you
Because I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wavecap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out, if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you, babe
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours
Yeah, you know already
Six months since I've been back in the Six
I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, baby
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe"

Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish
You don't know me
You better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni (shing!)
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud 9, a man's extra cosy (greaze!)
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, man's so unruly
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy (greaze!)
Front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade
Red umbrella when I make it rain
My whole team winnin', we don't play your game
Sound like me, but they ain't the same
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans

Yeah, they're nothin' like me, I'm a fuckin' villain
Go against me, that's a tough decision
Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision (straight)
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
Greaze, so don't forget to remember me
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me?
(Greaze) Taliban, Halloween
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now it's my world, you can have the scene
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness

That way you can call me
Every time I come into town
And then I will drive up to your house and
Take you out to dinner
I don't expect nothing at all
What if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And if feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right
All this lasts is just one night
Baby we should slow it down
Hey girl, I'm back in Atlanta
Seconds dates are lovely
This time you should choose where we go
Need suggestions, how about the movies
Then we go for ice cream
I'm not picky, you let me know
But what if we happen to kiss, and we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And if feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right
All this lasts just one night
Baby we should slow it down
Girl I ain't pimp, girl I ain't a player, no
I ain't tryina move too fast so I'm just gonna take it slow
Girl I just wanna know
What would happen if we made love
Would we have the same feelings when we wake up
Will be still spends hours on the phone
Wishing we was alone
Would you speak to me in a totally different tone
I know but, I guarantee two thing in life
One is death and the other is I can change you whole life in one night
Doing wrong always feels so right
It can start up with kiss, leading to a touch
Forming a relationship based solely around lust
I'm trying to move slow, relaxing the drift
But every time I do my brain's reaction is this
What if we happen to kiss, and we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And if feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right

Clearly rules don't apply
Can't believe that I just met you
You got me here
Watching minutes past by
Wondering when to expect you
There you go
Is this a dream
Looking like every picture
That I've seen of you before
I've seen it all before
Now that it's over. I shoulda known better
Then you think this is real and
You could be mine
I should have known better
Slowed it down 'cause I feel
You needed time
But I kept thinking
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
This could be

I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We wont be here for ever
And I'll realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We wont be here for ever
And ill realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
The girl or the world
You see someone gotta lose
I thought I could have it all
Do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash
If it doesn't buy time
And what good is being famous
If I'm never on your mind
Nights fallin'
Lights glowin'
And I'm just tryin' to pay the price on
And I don't wanna feel the comfort from my ice showin
And I ain't tryin' to be without you at the right moments
Nigga nice going is it worth it?
That decision 'cause hearts breaking
I ain't tryin' ta be in that collision
So imma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good girl if this my chance I swear
So can you do me a favor
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We wont be here for ever
And ill realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else"

(Drake: speaking)
Uh yeah man, vo, back again like we never left huh
Yeah man, I'm sending this out to any of my girls that's different man
Anybody that's special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so ima start off like this
(Verse: drake)
Uh look, I'm bold from the get go
Go by the title of drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressin a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating that's less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to aleshia, keisha and nadia
And shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like drew lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I don't change now I don't think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
'Cause I know that once I have it that's it and uh,
(Yeah man; yeah)
You can't just love me like they do
(Talk to 'em v; I need somebody special in you girl)
I need someone special in you
(I know they out there somewhere dude; ho!)
I know that out there there's a few
(Put ya hands up ladies; yeah man)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
Can you help me?
(Uh)
She gotta be special
(Yeah; you gotta hold me down baby)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
You gotta be special
(Yeah; you never know right?)
'Cause you never know how people stick around
(Uh)
Gotta be special
(Verse 2: drake)
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog [?]
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for [?]
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
'Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They wont sign so
Drake and vo back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since drake done took it from curls to waves
It's been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin like they world is staged
But from georgia to bk and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh
(Yeah; uh)
You can just love me like they do
(Vo we back man; it's a beautiful thing dog)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; I'm looking for somebody special man I'm serious; ho!)
I know that out there, there's a few
(I know that they out there man)
See I've been searching, I don't know what to do
(Ho! you gotta help me man)
Can you help me?
(Uh)
Special
(Uh; yeah; I need you to hold me down babe)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
Gotta be special
(Yeah; you never really know right?)
'Cause you never know how people stick around
Special
(Verse 3: drake)
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be
Look there's requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a nia or tyra
So we can be jenny and swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe its karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a night so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when addin basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double o, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh
(Yep; ho!; were makin' history right now man)
You can't just love me like they do
(Yeah; and you a legend for real, ima give you that man)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; yeah; I know they out there man)
I know that out there there's a few
(Ho!; yeal uh)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
(You gotta help me baby)
Can you help me?
Special
(All around the world)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(From la to va)
Special
(Memphis tennessee what's goin' on)
'Cause you never know how people stick around
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be
Vo and d-r-a-k-e

(Drake chorus from ""Still Fly"" (Drake from freestyle))
I'm still fly (Yeah), I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try and cut my wings (Uh)
I'm still pulling out the Phantom
And these haters can't stand him (That's me singin' by the way... in Case you didn't know)
Nigga I'm still doing my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high (Yeah some new shit... new shit I'm on)
And I dare anybody to try and cut my wings (I promise I got 'em)
I'm still shutting cities down (Look) every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing (Here I go) I'm still...
(Drake verse 1)
Responsible for everything you listen to
I mediocre talent proceed to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to
Started popping bottles 'cause it's ATL tradition to
Celebrate it by law fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing dropping and these bitches wanna snow blow and
They just give me head while the haters give me promoooo
And man my DJ shoulda won that but listen and respect man the city Owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me I run Toronto holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko,
Party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da,
Shout goes out to Future,
Shout goes out to Teddy muthafucka I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
'Cause I see the flame flickering, ex girls bickering
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickering
I tried to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'll take a minute if you're listening,
Please start doin' you,
I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewing me
But I got love for everybody,
Even if you're suing me
My brother P. Ray knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil' Wayne show
Me and Little Jazzy, please do not harass me just holla if you got me
And fuck you if you had me,
Shout goes out to Brian E.,
Shout out to Photo Will,
Shout out to Oliver and 40 Man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P. Plus the names I mention are Crucial
You're gonna need us and life is good everything is just fine

I'm still fly, I'm sky high

And these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still fly, I'm sky high (Yeah)
And I dare anybody to try and cut my wings

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost
(Drake)
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change it, I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know
They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste (aww)
Pushing me away so I give her space (Aww)
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow...
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
(Rihanna)
'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...
I've loved and I've lost

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends, when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do
You do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know
You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact, that you bought the dream, when they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you something
To save you... instead they say:
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true
(Rihanna)

By someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself

Me and you so crucial, baby
And that champagne, so fuchsia, baby
I do things that you ain't used to, baby
I take ya back home and sing Lose Ya, baby
When raindrops hit the tin roof, it's crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
Well you all wet, covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like, Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to you if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then, then I promise you a relapse
Forget what you guessin' I'm on
And who was in your past, I'm fresh n' I grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you let us girl, I'ma bring the dresser along
Hear that professional tone, half of that's ice and the rest Patron
Show up on time for the class that I'm teaching
'Cause guaranteed, I'ma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring ya breasts along
Instead of holdin' out, wonderin what it coulda been
I confess, this addressed to you
And I'm the postman, looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number, mom still upstairs I'm two floors under
But my room soundproof, you so tempted
To satisfy your urge, so you don't wonder,
Yeah, I know I told ya before
I grab that for ya like holdin' the door
'Cause mines is Polo and yours is Vicky, and they just spread all over the floor like...

Where did we go wrong, where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...
You know, everything gone be all right, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put y'all in this position and vent to y'all but...
40 mom always say, ""Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness""
You know, so... forgive me.
Uh, And life is so insane, look what I've became, tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention and fore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why ya girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yeah, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain...
Me, Yeah... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man."

Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""

Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""
I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you

Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time

Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga

Not even for a second, the hustlers become an obsession,
I'm on the front line, so my weapon, I AM THE LAST HOPE.
Kardinall:
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ,
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that martin lurther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die.
I was conceived to beat all odds like las vegas.
T-dot mutherfucker watch the world rape us.
Great test strugglers hustler to us succeed.
Cross water smugglers tussel to burn weed.
It meets that pressure to success in the south.
Niggas watchin what I say magnifin my mouth.
I never take back talk I apply the force.
Hand blistering for many years of holding the torch.
When the skin rebuilds it grows tougher then leather,
So we can keep on hold it forever.
My names kardinall
I gotta make it out, or move quickly, can't allow the past to restrict me,
But this time around they won't skip me, I AM THE LAST HOPE, don't hesitate

Drake:
Jealousy is suttin I haven't felt in years . there's nobody around for me to be jealous off . I bet you do is showing my city and no one cheers even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove . I'm incredible often unforgettable but when it comes to records I will eat it if its editable . they say the futures always for-seen that's why I'm steady getting more money more cream . my flow is stuck in the moment that comes before a dream I stay avoiding unlucky like 14 . and people get behind and they fight for 'em 'cause he won't let no other niggas wright for 'em . and even when its quite warm the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm . the name's drake and I don't take it for granted I can take it you offended 'cause I'm taken advantage mang.

I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)

I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone
But, I guess that's just the motion
And their phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help
But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor

Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
25 sittin' on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, imma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, ""Light one, pass it like a relay.""
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
One... time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven... grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, torn down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day

On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that.
I'm cuttin' lights out like it's bedtime.

I can't even afford a mistake these days.
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days.
Please don't take offense to my ways.
'Cause I need drug money,

Cause you deal with agents from check collections.
I'm keepin' it clean in a little X direction.

Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, cause girl you're fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her

You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
(Verse 3: Lil Wayne)
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass.
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last...
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, cause girl you're fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
We look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
'Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them ""That ain't true.""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place I can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or someone that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell ""Girl, that shit crazy!""
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies"

My memories never faded
I can't relate to these haters
My enemies never made it
I am... still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Uh, I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said
I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead, uh ah
That's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!
What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit

You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh

Am I wrong for making light of my situation
Clap on, when 40 got some shit for me to snap on
Now that I'm on I don't want to really worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
Get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
That I barely know at all and ...
Plus this women that I mess with unprotected
Text us saying she wish she woulda kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread it's like I'm high right now
The guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now
What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit

You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh
You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh
(Drake - Verse 3)
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
But a fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
I know, the same time I'm quick to forget
About to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer time
Yeah, I just need some closure, ain't no turning back for me

My memories never faded
I can't relate to these haters
My enemies never made it
I am... still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Uh, I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said
I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead, uh ah
That's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!
What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
(They say)
You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh
You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh
(Drake - Verse 2)
Am I wrong for making light of my situation
Clap on, when 40 got some shit for me to snap on
Now that I'm on I don't want to really worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
Get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
That I barely know at all and ...
Plus this women that I mess with unprotected
Text us saying she wish she woulda kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread it's like I'm high right now
The guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now
What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
(They say)
You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh
You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh
(Drake - Verse 3)
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
But a fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
I know, the same time I'm quick to forget
About to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer time
Yeah, I just need some closure, ain't no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over"

You won't feel me until everybody
Say they love you, but it's not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered
Then forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass getting thicker than the plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce
That shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It's feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down
They just keep on saying that they feel you nigga
(The Weeknd)
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
When will it stop? The ride
When will it stop? The ride
(Drake)
You won't feel me till you want it so bad you tell yourself you're in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced
Rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know its real when your
Latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could beat a nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga
It's been too long man

I've been faded too long, ooh

I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I'm driving right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking what's good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping M's and sipping dirty Jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl, and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I'm 'bout to fuck and I'm just praying that it feels good
I really don't know much but shit I know a secret
They say mo' money mo' problems, my nigga don't believe it
I mean, sure, there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket-holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches still scorching as if I didn't notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
I'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldn't fuck with my freshman floater
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore I was all for it, they all saw it
My junior and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga

Faded, faded, faded

They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all
(Drake verse 1)
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition,
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position.
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference,
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen.
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi,
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy,
Now I'm out in A-Town,
They tellin' me Trey sound,
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around.
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game.
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows,
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train.
Dog, personally mane,
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they Purpose is game.
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame,
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game,
I keep on, on, on, on, on
(Drake [Saukrates] chorus)
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all

Yeah.
Let me show you how to blast up,
Now tell me who is a masta.
A mind never wasted,
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up,
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up.
See where we from,
The 50's are bloody and the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown they love Me.
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money,
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of,
My lapel, is custom made,
You off the rack shit,
I'm off the chain, come on.
The dogs are loose,
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay,
With 40 and Mac Dre.
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk,
Drake'll give you the deal.
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills,
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill.
Keep on, keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh)

Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda,
Ol' time killin'.
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin',
And now the girls like,
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place,
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin',
They one in the same when you need it to happen.
My city full of players they just needed a captain,
In need of him right now in need of him back then.
But back then I was actin',
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin.
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men,
Whoever chose to back out is back in,
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told,
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold.
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old.
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold.
And keep on, on, on, on, on

And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It's about time that you made it
I was bumping yo' songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beat in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can't sign nothing till my lawyer get the fax and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murry look at what my talent did
And what yo' business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it's not about who you know, it's just how you balance it
It's always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you comin' the hardest
It's how you start actin' when nobody can reach ya
My plan just hatched, happy Easter
I'm doin' it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I'm is
It's only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun

Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I'm in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I'm neva looking down so I always know wassup.
A lot of people sayin' fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck T's
And I never trust a nigga sayin' trust me
Nick Cannon and Will never did it this ill
So you tell don't you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to uncle Steve my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us
And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn't leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Cher
I'll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel I hope Heavens prepared for whenever you there
Uh, I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through ya Stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don't cry for me this ain't mothafucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isn't at my session
It's the anticipation keeping everybody guessing like

203,Think Good Thoughts,2007,Comeback Season (2007),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Yeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
Uh, El' be saying that I'm humble, I'm hella nice
For that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
Haters tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like I'm Ellen Brice
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'm a take this hat off, and I'm a hit it till I backs off
And then I'm back sorrowful
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-trail, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping bout trapping youse a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, 'cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well reared/red like sunburn
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned, uh, c'mon
They say you never judge a book by it's cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
No El' will never judge a book by it's cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under"

Loves gone
Love lost
Love is gone [x2]
(Verse 1: drake)
Look,
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin in women
Most of 'em sick of favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy omar
Because so far
And that's some higher learning
Trying ta excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot
With the tires burnin
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of sadey by spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
'Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of aleshia lately
I'm all alone, I got a feelin' its on
'Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh
Loves lost
Loves gone
Love lost
Love is gone
(Verse 2: drake)
Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
Circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating 'cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like macgyver
'Cause you sneakin around
And she don't know that you there when you standin right beside her
I can't relate to that
I had to take it back a couple a years
When some of the best kicked it with drake in fact
I bet that they knew it 'cause in my mind I play through it
With [?] and they lewis and a couple things that they true in
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
'Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy 'em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' its on
'Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh
Loves lost
Loves gone
Love lost
Love is gone
(Verse 3: drake)
Check,
And nowadays some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusin
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spendin
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinkin' she been spoiled
But golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it see
You take a dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing
Her reputations in jeopardy
'Cause it ain't take her 3 of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and callin and textin me
For thinkin' that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh
Loves lost
Loves gone
Love lost
Love is gone"

She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again,
If the card declined you need to check that sh-t and run again,
They don't give you limits when you keep that money coming in,
Yeah, just fold some paper round the magnet,
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag, she mature to say the least,
And if I get a car she make sure to pay the lease,
She used to have a husband until she found out he cheats,
Then she filed for divorce and watched that bank account increase,
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool,
A son that's 26 but he just went away to school,
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's a baby,
I hope that I never meet him, that n-gga look craaaazy,
And I be spending all my lady chips,
She got me feeling like my daddy back in 86,
Yeah, she say that she lucky that she his,

If you getting money, just throw it in the bag,
Shorty so nice, I don't mean polite,
When I say nice, I mean looking right,

If they ask how much, tell 'em what it's looking like,
Everything I buy fly, it's like I'm booking flightsif I want it I'm a get get it,
That should not be tooken light,
And it's on everything I got a crazy lady,
So money ain't a thing, jay-z, JD,

Supporting your women goes beyond paying,
Watching me ball is like LeBron playing,
I'm in the Louie shoes you might see Kanye in,
They saying it ain't trickin if you got it they lying,
I say it ain't trickin if you got her she mine,
You n-ggas ain't got to worry 'bout her she fine,

Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me

Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
Gyal a you mi waan
Pay fi yuh visa meck yo fly out regular
Baby, cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit

And in my pocket
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it

208,Too Much,2013,Nothing Was the Same (2013),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"(Hook: Sampha)
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Verse 1: Drake)
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out mo'
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and then end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it; I just ride with it
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun comin'?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' before I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out""
(Hook: Sampha)
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Verse 2: Drake)
Uh -
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family goin' backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like ""Oh well, this is life, I guess."" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treatin' me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
I'm writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down
(Hook: Sampha)
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Don't feel like, you give up
Your heart's done
Your love's done
Don't give up
Don't fake it
Don't have to..."
209,Try Harder,2006,Room for Improvement (2006),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Yeah
Check
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just wanna be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
It is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snappin
And they try to make you out as a lie
Symbolic 'cause you were just trying to please em' by using logic and reason
It's a lose/lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
To try and make 'em a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working what I'm receivin' at first
And niggas wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourselves 'stead of claimin' you couldn't help
And maybe next time you ain't in town
You gonna try to try harder 'cause
Try harder 'cause
Try, Try-Try-Try
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spittin' the pressure
Than most of the rappers running the game
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit to cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a range also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I ran
Sometimes I wish that I woulda just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers
'Cause I'm really telling me what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted late out at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I working hard on the winner
So this album is a labour of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
Then she can rest without a toss or a turn
'Cause she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to...
Try harder 'cause
Try, Try-Try-Try"
210,Tuscan Leather,2013,Nothing Was the Same (2013),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
I don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The Fresh Prince just had dinner with Tatiana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to know and except yourself
And if you end up needing some extra help, then I can help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup"

On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing you'll never lose me
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on till we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on till we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the ""are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin' make sure you tell me
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on till we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on till we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
Remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow, Oh, oh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit"
212,Under Ground Kings,2011,Take Care (2011),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see straight, I can't even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you don't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this hit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important and what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing ""walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah""
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
If I don't nothing I'mma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah, I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways"

And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
'Cause I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it ain't a Buick
I never redezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the fuck you want to do it
My nigga you better do it (Aye)...do it
I say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I fuck with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drive it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia
And coppertone
And girl I heard your man's a fed
Don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city
Got it mobile like the lock is gone
Keys out
I ain't talking white though
Baby what you be's bout
I mean for tonight ho
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out

I mean paparazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out

And all the girls that played me
Eat your muthafuckin heart out, it's Drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find

Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save

Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel every time
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cards saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
But I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake
Bought the president the Louis presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain't talking about the peach state
Man for Pete's sake scratch that, sweepstakes
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 though at the venue
Pop bottles with my team, Young Money till the death of me
I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night
Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas
(Nicki Minaj)
I mean we don't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag
I mean, I mean but then again
Who looks at the price tag? You know.
(Drake)
Oh yeah, we in this bitch
Oh, oh, oh

I would die for these niggas"
218,Uptown,2009,So Far Gone (2009),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Yeah, Uhuh
(Verse 1-Drake)
Uh hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always resting
And when they call you,
The answer you will hardly question
I... I'm doing classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas situations they are all depressin
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game... you stupid mothasuckas
I see all this 'Money' through my ohio state 'Buck'-eyes
Shit been going good, but good could turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, & I'm about to get her
(Hook-Drake)
It's okay x6
You could run and tell ya friends that I'm on
I'm on x5
Best believe I understand
It's okay x5
You could run and tell my city I'm on
I'm on x5
You could run and tell my city it's on
(Verse 2-Drake)
Yeah, wrong way down a one way
Women don't get saved round me, even on a Sunday
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wondered who
Then they meet my pop and tell 'em ""Drake is just a younger you""
And shawty wanna party, so don't let ya girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth to mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I dropped to black cards, I named 'em Malcolm X & Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just used to 'Love', those are 'Tennis' games lady
Have you counting money going duffel bag crazy
Sippin on Pink Floyd and puffin Wayne Brady
Damn... Whose Line Is It anyways?
I'm in a daze
You been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yep I been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right
You look nice and your frame makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well all right
Guess I might... know what? Fuck it
Yes I will
I am more that what you bargained for, nothin' less than real
Put it to ya like...
It's okay x6

I'm on x5
Best believe I understand
It's okay x5
You could run and tell my city I'm on
I'm on x5
You could run and tell my city it's on
(Verse 3-Bun B)
Bun B, king of the trill also one of the dopest
Rep for the streets or on the mic I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my locc'ness
No joke... it's... time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a py-Thon
That's the type of shit I'm-on
I wrote this on my I-Phone
So let me drop this I-bomb
I-palm the game like it's a Spalding ball-& take flight
From the free throw line and slam it down like I'm the great mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mayne it's gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over, I just fake left then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Lettermans Late Night
This that major moment you been waitin on for too long
The best that ever did it and doing it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton
So what the fuck is you on??
It's okay x6
You could run and tell ya friends that I'm on
I'm on x5
Best believe I understand
It's okay x5
You could run and tell my city I'm on
I'm on x5
You could run and tell my city it's on
(Verse 4-Lil' Wayne)
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, all American bad boy
I own the swagger super market, & you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy
The swag you never had boy
Hate & I will leave your chest the color my flag boy
Suu Woo bitch I do this shit
I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my spoon bitch
I'm so uptown
And muthafucka if you ain't... don't go uptown

And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in... I'ma start shootin in the mosh pit
Haha... fuck is you talkin' bout?
Weezy in ya mouth

Young mulah baby

219,Used To,2015,If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' PlayStation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?
Yeah, sound sound sound
Real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man
Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check 'cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview"
220,Video Girl,2006,Room for Improvement (2006),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"(Drake: talking)
Uh, yeah, get in my slick rick mode
N'a mean?, I'm a tell ya a story real quick
(Verse 1: drake)
Look,
She got a saying there's no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be witout my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin' what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin' to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin' good when my wallets thick
Chillin' on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch that's she's feelin' other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin' every race that I enter and she a
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin' that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
'Cause I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin' you shoulda stayed yourself
(Verse 2: drake)
You're all the same
Look at vida guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles 'cause she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin directors instead
And frustratrated 'cause she's already been addressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin' as if it's your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in effect he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it
I got some beats still
Regina hall and garcelle and alice neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin' that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
'Cause I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin' you shoulda stayed yourself
(Drake: speaking)
And I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
Say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
Accept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
You know as a person man. I love to see my black women strong, single,
Independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
Video you n'a mean? it's a wonderful thing baby. so uh, don't hate me for
This one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? 'cause it's like uh,
If she beautiful and honey dances
And you always downtown making money transfers
And anything the color of braces she get excited
She always showing up at these places she get invited
She a video girl"
221,Views,2016,Views (2016),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay's, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana trying not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
""It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait""
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm getting straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think running this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Running through the 6, thumbing through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either"
222,We'll Be Fine,2011,Take Care (2011),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it like it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans, but neither was making it and here I am
In the presidential do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon, she deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?
Well fuck let's get it then
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double?
You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? yeah, you all the way down, every time
Am I down, am I down? yeah, I'm all the way down, we'll be fine
Are you down, are you down? yeah, you all the way down, every time
Am I down, am I down? yeah, I'm all the way down, we'll be fine
Used to make us proud we had dreams of getting bigger man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga man
You keep talking that, ""you was this and you had this
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it""
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, ""you're such a dog"", I said, ""you're such a bone.""
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always saying, ""show me some""
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then fuck let's get it then
(Birdman)
Yeah! drizzy, yo turn nigga!
Take care of the business nigga (shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck em, we don't love em!
Yeah, it's just that uptown gangsta shit
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas
Drizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?
Toast to this gangsta shit, (to this gangsta shit)
Ovo ymcmb (belee that!)
Yeah, you understand me?
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing
Throwin' hundreds, rubber band stacks
That ymcmb shit nigga; flashy lifestyle
One hundred"

Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night
Girl I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet
Girl I'm lonely
That shit ain't my fault girl
'Cause I'm lonely
Name another woman, ain't no other woman that should comfort me
When I'm lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely
Heard you spend your summers in Miami
At somebody's house
That you didn't buy
You're young, yeah, have fun girl
But I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I'm not here to judge
Fuck it I'm not here to love
Everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell I ring
You and I got options bae
Name another woman, ain't no other woman that should comfort me
When I'm lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely
This shit ain't my fault"
224,Weston Road Flows,2016,Views (2016),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"One of them ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza 'cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin' at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east
Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
To busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right
Yeah"
225,Where to Now?,2007,Comeback Season (2007),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Ok there comes a time when you gotta be like
You know I've come this far on my own
Done a lot for myself
Where to now Ya know
But I just tell myself this one thing
It was worth it it was all worth it
And by this time I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit but they served they purpose
And I got verses I got verses
My 16's should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied You see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah heartbreak Drake I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's over priced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come over night
Got got got got damn how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over watch a season of Flight of the Concords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But uh tell me you surfin let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the dimes poured
Yes I swear to God girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Ford's
Ethiopian girl Ethiopian girl with yo long curly hair and yo big ass bootay
Reading all them pro black pro female books
Just let 'em let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription a vision correction
I'm young and successful I'm living perfection
And man if 09 is when I'm a see mine
Being cool ain't enough homie I'm a freeze time like that"
226,With You,2016,Views (2016),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the M.I.A
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you
Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry 'cause I'm hopeless
Choose your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story of just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, oh
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you"
227,Worst Behavior,2013,Nothing Was the Same (2013),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Worst motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions,
Nigga' we don't know shit
Flex, nigga I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you, and look at you,
Ah - I'm glad that they chose us
Command, it's a mission,
Trying to fight to the finish just to see 'em all finish
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us,
Remember?
Motherfucker never loved us, remember?
Motherfucker, remember?
Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior,
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man, motherfuckers never loved us
Worst behavior

Fucker never loved us
Worst behavior
Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done grown up
You know me, you know me
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for the shit like O.D.B.

Motherfuckers never loved us
Man, motherfuckers never loved us
Worst behavior
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Worst behavior
Who's hot, who not
Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks,
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop
Same old pimp,
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed with these funny style niggas
We done put out of the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And its back to L.A.,
Open the mail, staring at the check
Enough to make you throw up
Man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could be Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it looks like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from?
I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my name Mordehigh
Fuck you bitch, I'm on that high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead of time I'm coming back on my worst behavior
Remember?
Remember?
Motherfucker
Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember?
Motherfucker never loved us
Remember?

Remember?
Worst behavior"
228,Wu-Tang Forever,2013,Nothing Was the Same (2013),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure
How you feel about, coming home with a, nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 A.M. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure"
229,You & the 6,2015,If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"Having conversations with mama, man my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said ""I heard you back with you know who
I told her ""Girl I'm always back with you know who""
And she like ""Who are we kidding
You're only 27 you just being you
You're your fathers child man thank god you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's always someone better
Like that girl from that gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart but I'm not here to give out compliments, or boost nobody confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I don't pretend with this momma
I'on joke with this momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it momma
I'm ""Game of Thrones"" with it momma
I'm "" Home Alone"" with it momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma
It's just they cloning me momma
Them niggas wannabes momma
It's like - I'm the one they wanna be momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me momma
What more they want from me momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough or making stories up bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it momma, rolling stone with it momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma
I'm not condoning it momma
They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma
Know I don't call enough momma
I just been working with so little time for personal momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life"
230,You Know. You Know,2010,Young Sweet Jones (2010),Hip Hop|R&B,Drake,"You know, you know
Uh uh yeah
You know, you...
You know, you know
You know, you know
Uh uh
Yeah
You know, you know
You know, you know
How the story go
You done jocked my style
You done stole my flow
You done seen me out
You gets no hello
And you wonder why
Man you know you know (you know, you know)
Yeah, and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in '02
And everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah, but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it, I made it
But I'm still playin' like I'm being scouted till I'm out it
Game time bitch I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I'll be outta time 'fore I'm outta luck
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know, you know (you know, you know)
You know, you know (x6)
Uh, please make your long story shorter
'Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border (you know, you know)
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on a atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my acting days (you know, you know)
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So were courtside when lebron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there, I be there
You see that '62 sittin' outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin' to the top this my leap year, prepare
I'm puttin' in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' that I coulda done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin' (you know, you know)
Damn, what happened to us
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I gotta party you stare at me in disgust
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus (you know, you know)
'Specially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore
The paparazzi outside trying to record
Why has every woman never dined here before
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur (you know, you know)
The (?) the Gaia's and the (?)
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn't what your motive is (you know, you know)
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know, you know (you know, you know)
You know, you know (x3)"
