0,(The Roof Is) On Fire,1998,Heaven'z Movie (1998),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"For the Menensky tribe worldwide
(Will you please sing along with the old negro spiritual?)
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire.
We don't need nothin' but the weed and a lighter, and a lighter
It ain't a thug those that's livin' that is realer than the villain
Witha million still killin' dealin' and all for the children
Came out of Cleveland with Steven,
And even my peoples was creepin',
But now they reapin, seepin, retreatin, deletin
Did ya feel 'em give my niggaz the fist and,
Keep the pistol gripped
Now whistle if you need me and quick I'm there for murder and mayhem
Look out for lay man
His trigger finger itchin' to lay them
His trigger finger itchin' to lay them
Don't run to lose your life
Enjoy
I ain't fuckin' around and makin' the noise,
But better believe I'll get up and leave and keep my poise
(O yellow boy you holdin'?? Hell, yeah!)
Thuggin' on Brackland when I sold crack,
And I got a mini-mack for the action
The murder and mashin,
Nigga millennium fashion blastin' over trash
50 thousand dollars cash
As fast as you can smash
Stabbed in the back and anxiety attacks
Flash through the childhood relax and,
React it be like that nigga you know that prescribin me prozac
Forgive but never forget
Sin yeah even within the thin begin again
With that pretty little bitch in your click
Uh spittin' demonish shit
Hey baby you need a friend
And act a little bit feminine take the fatigues off
Fuck the club even the six it's hellish
I be the one to tell it lust for the thugs
Who be fuckin' with
Seven... seven... seven... seven...
Seven... seven... seven... seven...
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire.
We don't need nothin' but the weed and a lighter, and a lighter.
Gather up gas masks for biological war
We know a whiff of the shit will make you wither fo sho'
Niggaz in the C.O.
We livin' in this AB World 144 thousand full of tribes
With the last word (SHUT UP!)
The book of old it got 'em thinkin' that they crackin' code
Oh no pin it computers ain't pinnin the Millennium
Your future youth be the truth in the music
You better your soul triple stage darkness in the unsolved encore
Little E, B.I.G., Tupac Shakur
Murdered in California
Need I say more
Killa forget it's in Heaven'z Movie was it?
Lose the Lord's covanent
I'm huggin it and Imma duck and trust I'm all thuggish as fuck
Uh what nigga bust and up by creepin' on a come up
Eternally stressed my faces of death for the world war
Yes quiet on the set the shoots expired
The Roof is on fire...
We don't need nothin' but the weed and a lighter and a lighter
We don't need nothin' but the weed and a lighter and a lighter
Now what I want ch'all to do is I want y'all
Put y'all muthafuckin lighters in the air
Keep their bitches up there, fuck wit cho - lil' nigga...
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire.
We don't need nothin' but the weed and a lighter, and a lighter."
1,4 Da Ladies,2008,Ruthless (2008),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"(Verse 1: Bizzy)
A little something for the ladies, gettin' that money by any means.
Who get with the player type, thuggish ruggish, from the hood with good genes,
Who kick it in high heals, plenty tank tops, camouflage, fatigues.
Her thongs clear to the vision, so you can see some good things.
Stretch marks, body smoother then Marble floors in hamptons.
Lampin large in a condominium or mini mansion.
Sidekick mobile phone, three flip like kirk (?)
I'm sorta religious, superstitious, but I ain't scared to flirt.
I'm from the dirt, root and soot. Came up on my own foot.
Used to hang with the crooks. I keep a job in my books.
I took my chance with many girls, but still I look for a woman.
I like her crazy, sexy and cool. Waterfalls, good lookin'.
I can remember back in school, being judged by chicks,
And soon I hooked up with the Bone Thugs. Suddenly I'm the shit,
And baby's mama drama, karma, dillemas and problems
And now I'm single, ready to mingle, Holla, holla, holla, holla.
(Verse 2: Bizzy Bone)
Women who keep a pedicure, a manicure, Plus orchids,
Keepin' their (?), Take care of their son's, and their daughters,
Wanted ta understand, From a woman who has a man,
Hangin' on, (?) another, Go home, ""baby girl scram"",
And the love game eyes go blind, When you shine,
Please, don't try to be something you ain't, ""Quit lying"",
Still you're beautiful, The opportunity is around,
If you take it, then you take it, If not ""don't make a sound"",
And never set a brother up, Just so you're man can fight him,
Especially, if he don't want you, And he fellin that hottie,
It's stupid, when you fight for a woman, Who gonna leave you,
It's been written, many women, Have torn down many kingdoms,
Seen (?) go, seen'em run a game (?)
Fun and games and treason, Slug her thangs, when thay drinkin',
Where the women at?, ""Stand up without no (tails)""
I like a woman, When you're man's in jail,
""You playin' the field baby""."

Mad streesed, that I can't even sleep were I rest

Were I won't have to skeem, or roll around with the team
And niggas I can't trust, & I mite have to bust
For a somethin' (Don't know) Rim, Comin' from (Come on) the fuss

My name is bryon
I am a slave of allah
The master of creations

The birds the bees the trees and all that existed
And if the big bang theere was actually true
Then you must explain to me
Explain to me flesh
Eplain to me equalisation
And explain to me neffa"

5,"All Day, All Night",2006,The Story (2006),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"Ain't she bueno, mi amore
I represent a, dios, the uno
And I was told to write this
Miss you in the worst way, I can't fight this
Give me a stick or a candle so I can light this, c'mon
Baby I love you, and I was told to write this
Miss you in the worst way, I can't fight this, huh
Give me a stick or a candle so I can light this
Baby don't wanna hit it, is you chicken like Tyson?
Baby you hear me, for the moment while I'm walkin' in the Garden
Madison Square, New York, New York, whatever I beg your pardon
I been lookin' for you, not to be a stalker so I'm keepin' my distance
I'd rather sing to you and hope that you'll listen
I'm reminiscin on the rib, how much did I give?
Keep that money honey, I can eat Ramen Noodles and live
What about the kid, ain't the children, better watch those numbers
I got on my silk clothes, I'm so prepared for the slumber
We go all day, all day, all day
All night, all night all night
All day, all day, all day
All night, all day all day all day all day... [echoes]
All day all day all day all day... [echoes]
I hear you whiskin me away, in a brand new ride
I don't have to worry 'bout the Caeser, and the money's inside
The father tellin' me to win, and I'm goin' for mine
You can reject me if you wanna, it's the sign of the times
I like the {?} after the rhyme, the beef prime
Baby I don't believe you but I'm feelin' you Bryon
It's all good, wanna cry, your presence steadily takin' me
In the same direction, of the Father who made me
It's gettin' crazy in the Garden of Eden without my lady
Baby, can't you see, that I'm yo' baby
Walkin' around and I'm thinkin' of you
And I feel like you cut my fuckin' head off, but I know it's not true
I see you throwin' up the one more and more and more and more than ever
Forever your love I spiritually kiss you I can remember
I see you throwin' up the one, more and more and more
Forever your love I spiritually kiss you I remember
All day, all day, all day
All day, all night all night
All day, all day, all day
All day, all niiiiiiight... in another life [echoes]
Blast on these motherfuckers!
In another life, when you held me close
Said it'll be all right, and you love me so
Screamin your name and I'm feelin' like you predicted it
But baby I didn't plan it but it happened little baby, didn't it?
You feelin' it the love of the Father, so subsidiary never
It's the love of the people that we cherish like September
I cherish your voice, your spirit and yo' life and your breath
I feel you righteous, I feel you righteous to death
So tell Alicia, love and respect, and of course, the kid in love
I got a question what they say I've been waitin, from up above
Tryin' harder everything, but you stay in my heart
I'm finna cry little baby don't even start
You better believe it, 'lieve it
All day - you better retrieve it, 'trieve it [echoes]
All day, all day, all day
All day, all day all day
All day, all day all day
Haha, yeah
One time for they mind, what?
One time for they mind, what?
Buck, buck buck, buck buck
One time for they mind, what?

You know
Paul wrote he said man I die everyday
Ya know
Time moving so fast
Ya know what I'm sayin'
A day on earth like 1000 years in heaven
Ya know depends on how you livin' it's like
Where you bread at?

You know what I'm saying
A lot of muthafuckers out here going shoppin'
And I be tellin' people about the west side
And let them know what's goin' on over there man
Spirits man, it's a spiritual thing
How can I make the spirits understand?
That I am just not to be tested by the outer man
And everything that we can't comprehend
It's not a mystery that god drinks champagne moet share dawn
Baby girl sayin' that there's imperial
Watchin the tube, store up the blunt, please don't get it confused
Slurred your speech, love, or follow the rules
Home of the tomb, shake ya stick, these playa hatas don't know shit
What do you do, when the homeboys try to play you?
Get some new homeboys, or just ride as a playa?
When the prayer in the system the Father, the force revolvin
Any problem, we can solve it
If we want it, then its ours then
I say the blessings, manifested from God
Don't get it twisted, this the Heavenly month
I see these bitches trying to trick you
They trickly moving quickly
And it's moving to the swiftly

Load up some funs, get a cab and baby, fuck those guns
Yeah, what if I died?

I really don't know what you want me to do
But just get away from here, and only the Lord can guide me
Okay, you don't want me to stay and I can't wait
They say don't turn around cause again, you know what it is
Get away from here
Heh heh heh heh
And only the Lord can guide me, can I tell you all?
Do they keep throwin' up twos, I will never understand why they do what they do
Go tell 'em they need to get the freedom from the normal evil world and take the time without wilin out and of course they gotta watch out when they cast they pearls
That's because I love you
You know that I'm not gonna hurt you
All in, you're never alone

And that shit start getting broken down into the fullest
Ya know what it is
Representatives

While I'm runnin' in a circle, the demons say I am murkable
No weapons are formed in the storm; it's gettin' warm
I'm purple hearted, watchin the world
While dippin up out of the science with alliance, one all, there are many worlds
Heavenly Father, while we dippin in this wilderness
Watchin where we castin our pearls, that's to the wickedness
Old school bible vocab, spit up the bible
Slice in math, spit it in a paragraph style
But me don't want no bad man, give me some medification
Baby that ain't a word, you know my edumacation
Split up the verb dawg, I don't think that that's a verb
Feelin' like the troubles have become so absurd
Forever, pay for the sins that we know that we've committed
Been admittedly, born in the sins, is we sinners?
Let me take you out to dinner, so you can study my life
Will you love me or condemn me? That's the price (that's the price)
(Bizzy Bone)
Lord when I need you, I'm feelin' like I'm lonely sometimes
And yes this money don't make a difference, the soul is Christ
I put God first, I give it up to the father
Daddy do what you will, I love you forever cause you the father
Never selfish, make myself selfish for you
Do what we gotta do, I'm only here for you, it's true
Gotta do the righteous thing, God will protect us through the right in things
Rightin wings, tighten things, lighten things, excitin things
And what more should I say, now let me tell you in the chorus
'Fore they break me in phosphorus (I said hey)
What more should I say, well let me tell you the chorus
Before they break me in phosphorus
(Bizzy Bone)
I got an envelope of paper in my pocket, we grindin
Turnin' 50's into 100's, baby that's perfect timin
While shinin in the black Ac', windows tinted
Four women in the car with me, is this pimpin'?
Baby evil always lurk in the dark, ooh park
We bustin' down the (Chambers) in the Wu-Tang art
Now chitty bang-bang, take a trip down memo' lane
Picture me runnin', picture me comin', we all 100
Feel the fuckin' drummer drummin, we live and direct
And come connect, with the posses of soldiers and resurrect
Selective of my word use, know of truce
Obstruction of the justice that we did in our youth
See it's a new day, new way, see me in the afterlife
Holla at me, love me don't condemn me, that's the price
It's a new day, new way, see me in the afterlife
Holla at me, love me or condemn me, that's the price

I can answer you quicker than them,
Shall I begin keeping my mouth closed, keeping my mouth closed,
I don't chase when they fucking with me,
You don't fuck with me when I'm down and out though, when I'm down and out though,
I keep a map and they jealous of me,
They're jealousy is no doubt y'all, no doubt y'all,
And looking for something, they want to attack,
Pushing 'em back, knocking 'em out cold, knocking 'em out cold,
What do you want from me, they don't want your dreams, they want reality,
They get up inside your head, you tell 'em ""I'm dead"" I tell 'em ""get outta b"",
Will they try to rob me, in the direction we chill,
I'm only moving by the grace of the lord, it's god's will,
Huh, go get that vital money, foreal,
They better not fuck with us, we get 'em honey, what the deal,
They go the other testing, mic checker, dipping skill,
For somebody dippin in fluids baby, I don't want nothing but liquor and beer,
Listening into the hearts of a bizzy, apart of me, time to grow,
And if you don't me now, what do I know bout myself, I'm taking it slow,
Admit it, I'm a little bit different than others,
I'll tell you the story I know 'bout the church and you my brother, you my brother
If kid you was fighting me, fighting behind me, give me some money or give me some change,
Steadily working to keep it moving, if it was grooving, I'd do it again,
What I don't know... this place to be playing, and treating the knowledge,
Don't weak up the rhyme and they probably think that I'm crazy,
My brain will be running, I'm coming to die, my,
Come in a time, medical federal, what is known, don't have to be spoken,
Do it congruently, making the music so truly,
I'm keeping it moving and leaving the secrets of picking,
And moving in silence, evidently I don't want no bentley, baby,
I'm keeping it quiet, roll out, they start a riot, no now,
Baby, don't even try it, no doubt, picking up his diet to get the mission with precision,
As the superstition set aside, showdown,
I smoke the chronic, baby, peace release me is mine, is mine,
... Don't play baby, (I stay in this muthafucka)
And better don't play baby, (gonna go get a beer)
Handle your business and diminish the thoughts,
The elevation of survival when it's vital, the rock, (the rock)
Dedication of the love for myself, the love for my wealth,
The love for my stealth, the love of everybody else,
And I'm coming to meet that little baby, you staying on top,
You know what we do baby, solid as a muthafuckin rock
And don't even worry when we scurry up in the flurry,
It's getting blurry in the stormy of the purgatory, the thought for me,
Wanna eat with the angels, be patient, still wait for the party baby,
What party, I party, you and your body, baby,
Right here, right now, get 'em up when they get down,
Shake thoughts, don't ever get caught, now let me pray now,
In the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit, amen,
In the name of our lord and saviour, Jesus Christ, amen,
You better believe it, I will say it again, (Jesus!)
From this day forth, god willing,
Lean back chilling, precious medal of steel, titanium,
Nine percent of the cranium, baby you feel me,
No adultery, dultery, when I see-ee, I see-ee, we kill em,
Stay dry for me daddy, baby, sunset,
Come get a taste of what you never had, you ain't come yet,
When we raise up the one, yes, poppa he guide you,
Standing right beside you, in the midst of the storm,
Baby I ride with you, never die, not in spirit,

With Flesh workin feedin the family in the C-L-E-V-E-L-A
Better believe indeed, I got somethin' up under my sleeve
Connected to the thieves, when it gets thoughtless grow some weed
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could smoke on forever, ain't it true that I do?
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how I feel
Remember when my neighbor Linda let a nigga eat a meal
Learn to fight off my back, on my own did he struggle
In the 'Land on my hustle tryin' to piece on out the puzzle
Nobody knows when we'll die, it still maintain through the rough

Origin-al, with the mirac-al, to bow down
And tell the sixes that we comin' to get 'em
Unleashed by the disaster and you see these
Little brothers thinkin' they weathered the bible's evil-minded women
But the chicks never had me shook
They thought they had the good cookie
Until they hooked up with the cookie crook

My flight is paid on the chicken hawkin

They done read the book of demons, man what a slut
And then they only, heh - do your knowledge to the bitch, so what
And I'm about the kitten so what, and it won't even show up

Sorta like Noah's Ark, the people here be like cannibals
I figured the war was so important that I give 'em the rules
But be sell out to bail out, in the moment of dues

And the money that you possess as we possessed in the womb

Pick up the double for reverends and devils
More weapons will give 'em the bite there
But the war yeah, he got us a sword right out of a drawer
Now give me a reason this isn't assault, my fault
Caught up in the crosshairs, here's more playa
They thought it was over and it was a wrap
I tap-dance, for the paper, escape in a world that they never did care playa
And when it was written, the devil didn't deliver it in your mail
And what do you know, it's just like livin' in hideous times here
Addicted to kick it, compete with the price
Pour me some ice, yeah, now give me some liquor to get with the vibe
For quicker than fast to get with the mass
The underclass is what they call it
Call me a drunk or an alcoholic I'm ballin, motherfucker!

Jones... now I'm a push it to the limit, I was dyin' to be the boss
And we was up early cause grindin was a sport
Rewindin in my thoughts, late 90's it was cold
Lost a friend every month, couldn't survive another loss
My niggaz in the pen, until we meet again
Picture me in the Benz, blowin' weed in the wind
I caught a few cases, and now the Coupe races
Right through the Westside, floor seat at the Lakers, the milli-makers
Uh, and do you know what that money mean?
The wintertime turn to sunny scenes
50 thou' on my dungarees, I made it rain like it's thundering
But the money got me nervous
My niggaz pack guns 'cause I ain't tryin' to get murdered
And the feds tryin' to serve us
'Cause we ballin, but I'm a thug till I die
Until I hug the sky - Jones!

As soon as we judge you give me the grudge you get it away from me
Always seem to be druggin the bud, they get with the scrubs
I'm sittin' here waitin for somebody daily
Hopin for love cause shit it is hard enough, myself, get 'em away from me
Probably does continue to move it and groove it
And why you never get rid of me
Can never get rid of beef, nobody know me and nobody owe me, I get it myself
I'm earnin respect and wealth up under the belt, the baby can feel the welts
Been livin' in poverty, livin' and prosperous
Livin' in the matrix, I'm gettin' it how
Huh, I'm movin this shit, I stay on the edge and ready to smash
And we better then that, Lord I hope we kick it to get it together real fast
Together at last, under the bridge, you know what it is, move my ass

Gimme the reason to stop your breathin'
And I will leave him eatin' lesions

Till I escaped in Cleveland, sinnin' and shootin' Uzis
You won't punk me, a stack don't front me
No crack, put it up and laugh
And get with the Bone Thugs mash
In the winter walkin', real weezy by myself
And dreams of hookin' with Eazy made me queezy
Maybe no food and bad health
You see, my forefathers left me no wealth, put it in my loins
And plus, my groins stay poised
And only count on yourself
Damn, who would've found thanks, swing I'm slick
And even though I'ma stick all of my shit, you better back off em, bitch

Why don't you lend in need cause niggas is out here strugglin'
Holdin' back the tears, but it ain't nothin'

I stay strapped down, hold the gat down, hit the floor

But then start runnin' when it ain't no fun
And when the war gets close, and niggas get gun-sick
Tellin' me to think about my kids
Big bitch, swear to God, they ain't punk
You can turn a ho into a house wife
Or fake niggas into real niggas
Where everybody wanna be in the limelight
Or they wanna be tha killas,
To the frontline,
Stickin' to the message,
Cause other mothafuckas have you thinkin' like prison
They ain't tryin' to go to Heaven
Might as well pull out your weapon and blast yourself
I had a vision ?????, I'm on a mission traveling the world
Talk to all the little children, the adults is fake
And don't listen, watch your back

20,Bizzy's Story,2006,The Story (2006),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"The one baby!
As a child, army days, cancelled the fun childhood
After runnin' away with mom so many times
It's tearin their relationship apart
I wasn't doin' anything but bein a kid, no evil in my heart
Never played in the area of they minds, anything like that
Just a normal kid, yeah, yeah
I remember messin with these little girls around the corner
My stuff wasn't even hard
Remember a brother was lookin' for a little candy out the park
My mother went, my mother vent, momma what happened, momma I'm scared
Momma my head, so won't you get it baby
We carry on, we carry on, we carry on, we carry on
Experience with different women, my dreams
And Sirita was a Cleveland and Sirita was clean
Now I'm explorin, the world around me very much learnin
And a, nurturing phase and a, lurchering phase
God with dirty people comin' against me
It's the life of the dead, record of company defend me
Still workin, the musical group, is that the crew?
Are they with me? It's Mr. Majesty, Capo and (Que!) Que, huh
From the West Wing, soldiers of the West Wing
Money straight flowin, it's the best thing, best thing
They say sacrifice is I-N-C
With my buisiness partner Kanardo Davis, D.A.P.
That's the love, that's the love, that's the Lexus, that's the Benz
That's the thug, that's the thug, that's the thug, that's the thug
The owners, it started in the night life
I don't even remember havin' fun, all I can remember is a trife life
Bizzy's... story (we want Bizzy's story)
Bizzy's... story (we want Bizzy's story)
Time to clean up and get sober man
The kids came moved over I took the last $90,000
And put it on a $5,000 square home and got $10,000 worth of furniture
Frigerator full of food, it's for the kids
We moved on and we got a nanny
After much struggle we had a home, finally
My early manhood, strange bein the man of the house
Without Sirita it was terrible, small as a mouse
Soon I met up with the women in the park got married
It's the way that we do it now it's time to get carried
Las Vegas at the time wanted a mother of mine
Myself I needed somethin' I could shine
Fortunately, goin' to the fast, gettin' at last
Hey, I'm bein tested...
Irreconcilable differences, it's not over
I lost my house and my jewelry got stolen
And the kids were back with Sirita - it was the worst feelin'
That you could think anybody could have, and Lord I need ya
I'm runnin' around the struggle, runnin' around the crib
We ain't gettin' robbed again, we ain't gettin' robbed again
Paperwork's an issue, attorneys and lawsuits
And the lawyer fees concocted to get me fucked up and keep me on recruit
Bizzy's... story (we want Bizzy's story)
Bizzy's... story (we want Bizzy's story)
Yeah, the ""Resurrection"" and ""The Gift"" came out
Beautiful deal and we worked it out for about a year hittin shows
Doin' the road workin real real hard
Well shit, we had a new team and fresh settings and a healthy body
For the road after 11 months of sobriety
Shit recorded that album in L.A.
And of course we gettin' the kids back
I think I'm gon' get married
Still never could I fight the night
All the women tryin' to take my girl's place
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, up above, up above
Do you feel it? Do you feel it? Feel the love, feel the love
I could not, find in a physical looks, it wasn't there
After goin' back and forth to L.A., L.A. cares
Handlin business, we under new management
But I'm growin', you know I'm still flowin
And another year passed, we still gettin' gold and dash{?}
It's the greatest appearance, and they showed it like wow
Dodge, quick, move!
You know you got to be slick and watch out for that bullshit
Watch out for that pulpit, they got me standin and I'm duckin the guns
And yes I'm duckin the bullets and it's always 'bout the one
The one, we represent it forever
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit I still remember
Bizzy's... story (we want Bizzy's story)
Bizzy's... story (we want Bizzy's story)
I can remember drinkin' with Uncle Damon and his buddy
While we shot ball in the back
And finishing up I was thirstier than a muh'fucker
I ask Uncle Damon for a drink of the water, shit he said ""Sure, drink it""
Ice cold cup sweatin and I gulped it
It was Gin, wasn't water, but I still downed it
Uncle Damon said, ""You got a rock gut boy""
I used to think about Man Man often (Man Man often)"
21,Blown Away,2006,The Midwest Cowboy (2006),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"(Intro: Bizzy (Playalitical))
What's goin' on, what's up my nuh?
Ay Paul man, roll up some weed, y'knowmsayin?
We 'bout to rock this shit, with Spoke-In-Word (yeah)
Knowmsayin, we 'bout to really make this thing happen
(It's that smoke session) Bizzy Bone the Midwest Cowboy
Light a blunt up man
No man, you smoke that I got mine
(Interlude: Bizzy Bone (Playalitical) {female singer})
So get hiiiigh (uh, I can make a call, it's on its way)
So get hiiiigh (so we can pinch on some hay)
So get hiiiigh (I wanna get) {blown away!}
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get hiiiigh {oh no}
(Bizzy Bone)
Now roll up the weed in the swisha, heavenly smoke
We gonna smoke smoke smoke, leave it up in them lungs till we choke choke
It's bittersweet, when I get high, but it settles
Also topsy-turvy, swerve on the curb
With a fifth of grape Kool-Aid and Thunderbird
With the misfits, I pitch in, some of them switch though
Havana just be poppin' for Doris, Bahamas be smokin' 'dro
Fly home nervous, with the customs, enter a sweet
I see my babies and my maid, and then Puffy made my money sweep
Forty thousand, five thousand for a pound of yo' sticky
And I'm talkin' purple haze back in '94, just stuff it in that sock Bizzy
But they downed me on it, and they kept the bag for three days
I stood at the front door, right at the airport
Better believe I'ma get my trees
I smoke the whole pound, met a broad and now we out of town
Got married and divorced, and ever since then, carryin the cross
Got married and divorced, I met a broad and we out of town
It's Bizzy Bone, he been carryin his cross - one love, one love
(Chorus: Bizzy Bone (Playalitical) {female singer})
So get hiiiigh (uh, I can make a call, it's on its way)
So get hiiiigh (so we can pinch on some hay)
So get hiiiigh (I wanna get) {blown away!}
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get hiiiigh {oh no}

So get hiiiigh (so we can pinch on some hay)
So get hiiiigh (I wanna get) {blown away!}
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get hiiiigh {oh no}
(Spoke-In-Wordz (Playalitical))
Yo, yo
Take to the sky on a natural high, lovin' you more till the day that I die
Dead or alive, I'ma be puffin that weed, whether y'all like it or not
Addicted to the pipe and the pot, I'm gifted like a light in the spot
I can't even keep count of so many clouds, they just keep on passin me by
(Layzie) Bizzy when it comes to smokin' people say I'm (Krayzie)
Could never get enough, this is my Wish and my Flesh
And all that that made me
Somebody roll up a staff of merlin hash, those that spoke-in-word and pass
If I ain't smokin' I'm servin', therefore I smoke in third person, ask
I can recollect the swishers, but I can't remember the type and
Some burn, while I was writin these - bars, punchlines and hyphens
Been smokin' since I was two, glued off aeroponic soul food
In school, I had a locker full of Downeys stuffed in blow tubes
Takin' advantage of blazin' ads, paid for inflatin vaporized bags
Thus I'm smokin' to pay my tab, for smokin' and smokin' to pay my tab"
22,Bottled Up Like Smoke,2010,Crossroads: 2010 (2010),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"I can still feel her
From distances and miles away
Galaxies and dimensions and cosmic aspirations
Are you ready? C'mon.
So she wants to make me pay
I am expected to lead the way
Baby, I'm on the case
Respect me and clean my slate
Save face and watch what you say
You the thing like I watched you play
Covered it up like smoke
Now that I'm back, you can get all your dough
Do the words still love you?
Can you secure its claim?
Bottled up like smoke
Floating over flames
Babe, so you expect me to endure your pain?
I can't wait to, oh forgive me, okay
I'm gon' bottle it up like smoke
Can you endure this flame?
Say ""I have no conscience, I'm all about game""
And I say ""That's shallow, and you won't change""
And those words hurt me in the exchange
So I splurge and send my tears away
Do the words still love you
Can you secure its claim
Bottled up like smoke
Floating over flames
You talk about the women that I'm running with
And why you even care about the women that I'm running with?
The funny thing is I can't remember when you was the only woman that was running it
Coming here and talking that gutter shit
The money was good then it was good with the covenant
The money got low and you rolled for the what of it
The better you test when I'm broke with no lovin'
And I'm floating over the flames and maintain my thuggishness
Ready for the world, steady my palms and pearl
And the pearl of the man from sayin' it's my girl
Twirl the baton my God 'cause I twerk
Gonna get it gotta get it and that's when I hurl
The word that I'll honor forever is that I love the bitch
Excuse me let me dig it on that dime down and say excuse miss
Excuse me let me dig it on that dime down and say excuse miss
Do the words still love you?
Can you secure its claim?
Bottled up like smoke,
Floating over flames
Say ""I have no conscience, I'm all about game""
And I say ""That's shallow, and you won't change""
And those words hurt me in the exchange
So I splurge and send my tears away
Do the words still love you?
Can you secure its claim?
Bottled up like smoke
Floating over flames"

{Gun cocked and a gunshot} Waitin' on the bail whiles I sittin' in the county jail/ Question my intuition 'What have I gotten myself into this time?'

As they take advantage of corridors, get away from hell
Carry in here baby, tell me what ya need to know

Turn that shit up, turn the vocals up, fuck 'em
Let's get this shit started baby
This why I like this shit, it's like this

Destiny praise God, we warriors, 7 crunch ya
Crack the devil's head (ha ha)
Crack the devil's head; whylin out, pandemonium
Crack the devil's head, whyle out, pandemonium
Official rapper's suspicion, it's like I'm on the podium, podium
Buck the money y'all, yeah
That's the season, that's the season
Now my season, season goes through the people with the evil
They don't rule shit, bullshit, evil won't meet the reaper
Latch gate keeper
They couldn't even tie the laces on Jesus sneakers
Warrior with a speaker
'Cause we are warriors, warriors, warriors
(Bizzy Bone:)
They tryin' to reach ya with them old school tactics, make us strong
But when the karma comes back in other physical forms
Tell 'em man up, stand up, sit down, hands up
Hit that, smoke that, dope fingers, that slug bitch
So what if I strap with the warfare, everybody is here for the sightly change
People in physical war, only the Lord is keepin' me sane
Above with the grain, in the go-go with the love
With the Lord you know we got him, in the name of our lord and savior Jesus
We never stoppin', tell 'em we never won't tumble but think what they did
They humble about love but love is here
We struggle up over the form for fears
We struggle up all the sin of queer, we live outta here, open the beer
Get to the finish the realish to get, realish to get, realish to get
Warriors
(Bizzy Bone:)
By the grace of God - tell 'em about the... out the show
Carry my baby, tell 'em I'm 'bout to come up out the show
Carry my baby, wherever you need to go
Carry my baby wherever my baby need to go
So we warriors comin' to spit it without no princess
Plenty fuckin' piano got your brain spittin' senseless
We represent this, throw up your trigger finger now
And ain't no weapon formed against us, bitches love my style
But it'd be realer if you really love me
And I ain't never want a woman, just a woman love me
Let me convey, baby I ain't no physical game
In sucker love they tell they homie put the stick away, let me convey
Warriors
(Bizzy Bone:)
By the grace of God, by the grace of God
'Cause we are warriors - by the grace of God
Tell 'em I'm about to, tell 'em I'm about to
Tell 'em I'm about to, tell 'em I'm about to
'Cause we are warriors
(Outro: Bizzy Bone)
By the grace of God, and by the grace of God
And by the grace of God, praise Jesus Christ
'Cause we are warriors, 'cause we are warriors
Warriors, warriors, warriors, warriors
One, in the name, of our lord and savior Jesus Christ
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit amen
That shit is just rappin' what you do"
26,"Come, Go, See, Know",2006,The Midwest Cowboy (2006),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"(Intro: Bizzy)
And one for the love of the Lord
Heavenly Father we need us a sword, sword, sword, sword, sword
And one for the love of the Lord
And one for the love of the Lord
Heavenly Father we need us a sword, sword, sword, sword, sword
(Get off me, get off me!) What, what, what?
(Chorus: Bizzy Bone)
And where do we come, come, and where do we go, go
Tell me what do we see (see) see, tell me what do you know (what, what?)
And where do we come, come, and where do we go, go
Tell me what do we see (see) see, tell me what do you know (what, what?)
(Bizzy Bone)
And one for the love of the Lord and Heavenly Father we need us a sword
But we know no weapons are formed
They'll go up against us, we got us no sword
And I'm ridin' the midst of the war, money galore, gunning my gunny
My sonny, and honey I'm feelin' it raw, watchin it every step of the door
Whatever you seen and you saw
You should be shuttin your jaw, killin' 'em y'all
See that is the only thing I wanted to do, what I'm here for
Remember you gotta be you, I gotta be me, we gotta be
Forever together you'll see, where most of them flee it'll be B.B.
I gotta do me; what'chu expect, forgot that I come from the set?
Wanna get wet and punched and how to get crunched
You come and you get with the best
Nevertheless, one of the blessed, some of the rest, comin' to test
Envious friends, we're here for our enemies
Never pretend to be rude I don't even have to poke out my chest
We up in the rep, the story is told but baby you don't know the half
Places I done been without sellin out
It'll make me cry until I laugh (till I laugh)
The higher power watches over me every day
Every step of the way
Now one in the house, yes, it's one forever
Now it's time to move out, rough, rugged and clever
(Bizzy Bone)
Tragedy, bodies are flyin, spirits are cryin
I am Bryon, here to rock it for planet Orion
Deep, breathin and sighin, tryin' to make it righteous
With everything goin' against us, why they still tryin' to fight us?
Brighter days for the titans of Christ, throwin' the rice
Prices is ice, cyanide, high in the light
Elevations of plateau-able, still with the unknowable
Showed up, for the show-able; still, I'm down to roll-able
You know, ready to go, the posse of my people
Meek, and still feeble, royal, and legal
I'm feelin' good baby, and makin' love, it is phenomenal
Don't treat me like an animal, I'm not an honorable
Get it poppin' baby
(Bizzy Bone)
Now let me sit back, relax and let these rhythms teach you the facts
As I massage yo' feet - you need somethin' to eat? (woo)
It's Mr. Loverboy, with a pocket full of tender
Baby, these are my sisters and brothers, we livin' in splendor
Remember me? It's baby Bryon born in September
I will never leave you momma, not never, ever, ever
I mean forever, forever ever ever
Through the winter and the dawn even of, stormy weather
Jewelry, draped in the dawn, court cases adjourned
Make, praises of joy to the Lord, poise boy
I'm tellin' them that I need some quiet to kill the fuckin' noise
These motherfuckers don't know I need some oint-meant
(Outro: Bizzy)
Thank you, thank you, thank you for tunin in
Most definitely, thank you very very very much
Praise God up in here; oh hey, sit down, have you a drink
Y'understand what I'm sayin', get you a drink
Lean back, let your toes rest
Bizzy Bone the Midwest Cowboy, please believe me
With no bullet-proof vest, it's on and motherfuckin crackin' baby
Shouts out, to the family members
Lil' Layzie Bone, in the motherfuckin house
Krayzie Bone, in the motherfuckin house
Wish Bone, in the motherfuckin house!

With my boys in the club, in the back. fucked up
Walk past me lingerie, lingering

Why do you stay with me, don't play with me, and please tell the truth
Do you really even know that I don't even love you
I don't really love me, so how could this be you waste your time on a wretch, is the sex that sweet?
I'm just a cowboy, hanging out making money daily
On the prowl with my new thing, not thinking of your felony
Cause really I don't need a woman, I don't need a friend
Bend over backwards for a woman, and she'll find another man
I see 'em all down the church girl
It's just us in the world
Baby mama wanna ball so I ball on the curb
And still I seen nothing, no love no nothing
And nothing brings nothing, so why should I give you something.

It was Adam and Eve, and not Adam and Steve
It was our path and yes indeed, tell her she's out of my league
I don't need to breathe I create, hey bitch
You always been a downfall, always been a snitch
Keep my drugs at your crib, give you money just to live
Fuck it up, smoke it up, now you wonder where I live
Never take care of my kids, just lay back in bed
With a nasty name and a nasty game, eat shit
Ask R.I.P weak bitch, we them county niggas, and we never betray the body we them bounty niggas
It's going down my niggas, we got money and one penny
Any problem, yes we ride alone zoned out with nitty
And anybody asks, we pass and keep bread
And a chick just a harlot, we cast her in the bed

With weak souls, come kick it.
Written, rewind, get it, look out, hit it, rise. Dig
It, wig out, feel it, ride. Mimic, die. Nigga, fly.
Boom bye-bye. My kind in time,
7th Sign, 7th Sign (7th Sign). Time after time get
Mine, gon' get mine. Pick up the phone line, pick up
The phone line, ready for
Truth on the loose? Got a dime or two and I'm
Liable to tell you, only if you know, woo. He flew
Right bye you, true, demons
Follow and resume from the womb in the tomb. I fool
You, boom, boom, boom. B-b-b-boom, boom, boom, boom,
Boom, boom.

Demons surround me
All the time."

You Krayzie (Bizzy the Kid the midwest cowboy)
But the widow tried to play me (play me)
Home in front of my vaugh
They say Bizzy he think he Pac
Passin out on stage Rollin' Stones was shocked
Bizzy the Kid grippin this baby makers
Tellin' the whole story
Runnin' from cops
Bustin' shots smack the top with a forty
I'm never gonna pop
I'm never going back to Ruthless
Stick to the block
You better believe it
And I'm sorry to the fans of Bone
But I'm bently, Adi Faus, and drop tops
Lou Gary, swisher sweet
And that's the way that we monster mash
Homies gonna respect my gangster
Watch the way we count the cash
Bang the gang
Seventh sign
Twenty seven, seven years
Looking young feelin' fit
And I don't have to depress the crypt
I don't need no make-up neither
I don't want you to touch my hair

Making money everywhere
I don't wanna have prop appeal
I wanna work with real niggaz
Real biggas
Trill niggaz
Rappin' with only ill niggaz

I am the general realin incredible better than
Ten year veteran

Never no evidence, ain't no best friends
Shut up and handle your business
This the new thang, the true thang
Seventh sign's how we doing thangs
Gangster parties, smokin' and drinkin'
Puttin' on my dancin shoes
How to get that money right
Pay me and I'll come dance for you
Stay the night and bend your broad
While I'm talkin' in turns
Let me swallow that, it tastes like peaches
Must have been a mango blunt
Follow that, I am the future
Evolution of elevation
Knowledge is the power
We shall over come the hatred
With double barrels and rucas
Inscripted like an egyptian
Incripted like lyrical lucifer
Seventh sign conta, seventh sign boy
You done put that Anjo when I met from sancroy

See, I went down and dirty and she liked the sucky sucky
And liked it all in her tummy, and started askin for money
It was over
Off to another one, never leave my house without packin a gun
Jumped in the Benzino, while Nikki was in L.A. smokin' primo
She said no one could make her cum, till she came met Gambino
I ain't need no introduction, I'm that Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
And I don't give a fuck what you got goin' on
I left Watts, gold Zenith tootin, while shootin my show
Is that cocaine?
Boo, you gotta go
I miss her though
Back on the ho stroll, drinkin' and losin control
Got back to Cleveland and hooked back up with Mo Mo
Pretty young thugstress, who loved the thug shit
And on the lo lo, I like that, even rolled the getaway
'Cause I ain't that ordinary thug, go on all about that gun play
Soon as she popped up with a baby, drivin' me crazy
Watched her push it out, cut the cord, little Christian, love you baby
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss,
And this is...

So now we havin' sex again, hittin some different levels
The babys lookin' Mexican, I look at you like the devil
My sisters only using you, 'cause I never abused you
So she's doin' it for me, only if you knew, boo
And plus, she fucked Layzie, was makin' eyes with Krayzie
And old Flesh had her first, but I'm that one that made it work
You can kiss my ass, hear my laugh
Hear me now and listen later
Anyway, I'm still the playa
On the real bitch, you hurt me, if that's any consolidation
You was just another temptation, on to the next one
That's enough of her
My belt is just the way I like it
Don't bite it and you can get it when you want to
You love the way I ate that, your girl hated that
But don't be dumb
I guess it's too late for that
Don't be dumb

Oh, and I seent you hangin' with sissies,
All that sinnin, women with, actin' feminine
But you said he a sho' thang, that'll make him a better friend
But then again, how could I judge?
But they still can't kick it with the thug
Check all the glasses, and check the toilet seat for bugs
As soon as you passed it, I was high enough
I ain't a fascist, 'cause I don't like to kick it with faggots
Do yo thang, and I hope that God helps you on your quest for thangs
Rain, rain go away, come back another day

I don't love them hos
I don't love them hos
And the moral of this story is don't love them hos
If you searchin for somethin'
You searchin for a woman
You searchin for a man
But through your search
You gonna come through a lot of obstacles
A lot of twists, a lot of turns
But you gotta be able to taste it to know what's sweet
To know what's sour, to know what's good, to know what's bad
But fuck all that get back to the chorus

Yeah,
One time for they mind baby,
(Buc, buc, buc, buc-buc, buc, buc-buc, buc...)
Keep the wicked numbers away, haters,
I know you want some, but you can't get none,
And its said for those that we are put around, if they don't entertain us,
Shall we continue to be around them, no we shall not,
Get on about your business,
One time for they mind, give it to 'em baby
(Choruse)
And what, ima do it, just keep 'em away, without worrying about a thang,
And you know my name, I'm not taking the blame, not playing the game,
Evolution of elevation is way bigger then your big bang,
Explain to me breath, explain to me breasts, explain to me death mayne
Heaven is high, how you doing as I'm walking by,
I've been in the blur, heat of war, and enemies ain't talkin' right,
I don't have the time, ain't a speck of no love up in here,
Allah I pray you forgive me for closing my eyes and ears,
Nobody wanna tell the truth, huh?(shh!) Nobody is real,
Everybody tryin' to cover up what's already revealed,
Why am I tortured just for tellin' the way it really is,
No questions asked, I'ma pass, I don't want none of that ass,
I don't need leaf that of fig, I can walk around here naked,
No I'm not Mr. Shakur, I'm so secure in the Matrix,
I'm baking up in this blanket, your fire is Child's Play,
Chucky, I'll stomp you to pieces and take him out my way,
We prayin' like everyday, see you at the crossroads,
I'm gonna miss everybody, cryin' for the lost souls,
Horses, fire, and crossbows; the righteous that lost those,
My titans in cornrows, ignite 'em then turn slow
Now what I want you to do right here man,
Is I want you to flip it like you used to flip it way, way back in the days,
Now you gotta get back to that man, you know what I'm saying,
Right before you done cut your hair, I want you to flip it on 'em baby,
Iight cool
Generals sit at the desk, and please pay attention, we selling our sales and units and
And informing them midst of the moment of you and then everything that he was doing,
See heaven is high, now get with the real, we studying islam people,
We walking alone, without any help, and ducking like every evil,
Is there anything that you want me to tell you, are you learning anything new on this internet,
But now you've got something that you can come listen to, give 'em the real on these politics,
Its more and more obvious that were oblivious to any negative thinking,
Plus we are the warriors, slaves of allah, without any negative drinking,
You know what I mean, no need to go further and further the burner is serious,
We keep to our selves with nobody else around to make us delirious,
I carry this ... moving like militant soldiers,
Now what do you feel when all the receptions are going around your shoulders,
Rocks are bigger then bolders, wheter its colorado over to California,
The haters a demon, its looking for war, not rocks, when they runnin' up on us,
It's so many jealousys they'll never win they'll only be mad 'cause we back y'all
And there ain't no need for me to worry, allah you akbar,
Yeah"
39,Father,2001,The Gift (2001),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"We all so scared cause its, its war everywhere, you know
War everywhere
How many friends will we see die? (Why we so scared 'cause it's war everywhere)
How many friends will we see cry? (It's war everywhere)
How many friends will we see try? (Why we so scared 'cause it's war everywhere)
How many friends will we see die? (It's war everywhere)
All we need is a little love, and someone standing for the little cubs
And I see brutality all over niggas killin' niggas
The ghetto got them being born to be killas
Flooded with drugs and tryin' to get us, so get up
But don't give up, y'all gotta sit up
If you last before they kill us
And the guerillas, try come kill us
Pillage the village and we'll be winna
I love it when niggas the way we took it to another level
So many rebels doing the best shit forever remembered
And in the killing fields, everybody's locked up
And good niggas getting shot up da dadan dada
Mind if I say something for mine
'Cause it's about time, to get serious
A mysterious time, blind melons
It ain't no telling, if the willing
Will stop chillin', then help the children
Turning them out, then burning them out
Like morphine, waters getting shallow
It's over and over the gallow
A president in the drop, it's on now though
The end of life, for now so
I think it's the ozone, bad to the bone bone
Mother Nature be long gone
And don't nobody wanna do nothing but speculate
And all they worried about their own
Wrote a song for the future
Millennium, I'm in, I'm hopeing it don't last until we all past
Living in the stars, looking through grass
Aboard the enterprise, recognize this, in the course of a da-da-da-da-da-da-day
And that's the way we sing, that's the way we play
That's the way they ... now and
Still got bombs from the cold war, radioactive
And the critics, they won't take action
They want us to repo this to your satisfaction
But while they build more, computers keep crashing
What about felling, pestilence dammit
How do we manage to keep standing
Living in a legacy of bitterness
With the epitimy of vigorous trips on the ships we were crammed in, slammed in
Other man and them, why don't we demanding our damn money
If we can't get forty acres and a mule, let a nigga get a range rover
Shit you got time you, I'm still waiting on a canoe, but it will never come
I don't even know where I come from or where I'm gonna go to
I'm headed to the mother land, but will I be accepted by the brotha man?
Awww me so confused, with nothing to gain and everything to lose, choose
The righteous and the high, look in the eyes and realize the lies
Family ties, but not even for the have-nots
Who the enemy? It ain't me. It ain't even the police
Unless they trippin', and use that authority and start flippin', flippin'
Leaving dead bodies, and with them bitchin' hotties
That poppin' the collar, my god I'm horny, ride shotty
And tellin' the kids that ain't the way to live properly
Get yo monopoly and get your own property
And that's the way we sing, and that's the way we play
And that's the way they ... now and
Ooh and the daddies and momma forgivin' so we can live with us
And all the runaways get off the bus
Kids, put the guns down, come down
If the rest build a bridge with us, it gotta get better than this
It's head of the risk, shoulda been poor, and I been rich
Lost so many friends to the war shit, caution
When I get to walkin', and it's mobbin', nigga in a crypt
Life is a fight to the street life, tonight
I might go meet the reaper, and I will give him a hug
And tell him ""Thug luv won and I'm so glad to meet ya""
And that's the way we sing, and that's the way we play
And that's the way they ... now and

And the frown on, and turn it upside down
You put the smile up, I move on fast real quick, real quick
In the weapons of the mind real slick

Praise the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
Increase the beast survive, your relatives and tribe
As long as you spiritual, you always alive
By the bloodshed in Jesus Christ, I truly thank you

Don't let the light skin fool you nigga
This your real homeboy
Lil' Bizzy the Kid, is definitely in the motherfuckin community
As I sit down and I write this letter to my dear brother
Dear brother, heavenly grace and peace be unto you
In your time of persecution, dear brother
I pray this letter greets you in good spirits and peace and health
I love you
For the mothfuckin hood and the ghetto
Ain't nothin' you need but a homie
(Bizzy Bone)
For the homie, doin' it tight, give you the shirt off of my back
For the homie I sing songs in fact
For the family, I'll never forget you whatever you need
For the family, I'm walkin' the streets, I know you see
For my momma, I'm doin' it again - I'm doin' the best that I can
Gotta love my father, he fathered a man, man, man
For my sister, I help you on out with the nephews
I do the best that I can, for my sister I tell 'em to spread the love
For my brother, I greet you with a spiritual kiss
For my brother, spiritual kisses sellin peace
One, collaborations only to spread that joy
One, for my father, the best homeboy
(Chorus: Mr. Silent)
You can find me with my homies, I'll never run
I'll never hide from my homies, I'm down to ride
I'm down to die with all my homies, kickin with the West Coast soldiers
Reppin for my homies, deep in the streets we stayin up
(Mr. Capone-E)
My homies, they're my young thug outlaws
Down for whatever when it's on Jermaine makes his call
We miss you O.G., from the families locked away
Upstate behind bars up in Pelican Bay
All the rappers, who lost their life in the struggle
From Biggie Smalls, 2Pac, Eazy-E we'll miss your hustle
The trouble, when the lights went out
It's still a war zone and you still the homie, no doubt
Life of a vigilante, with the street authority
My homies are forever till, eternity
Enemies get bucked, trust no, man
I'm in the land where they bangin' every kids on they hand
Propaganda, in this white man's world
A devil's reject, with a meth-amphetamine burn
The world turns, never leave you lonely
I'm your confidant, your one and only homie
(K.O.)
My definition of a homie is a brother with pride
Therefore that I'll always have your back not givin' a care who's down to ride
To never leave you astray, to put his life in front of yours
I'm havin' a vision in my mind, my dogs are seepin up through my pours
'Cause I'm a true blue thug, and I'm keepin' it real
My dogs ain't never given away, that's what you call the real deal
As I poured a little liqour for, those who passed
My true, soldiers in the green the game of life and they crashed
(Mr. Silent)
My definition of a homie
My dogs ain't never gonna leave me lonely
Straight riders, we ain't no phonies
My criminal styles and Mr. Capone-E's
Straight ridin', through the city
Givin' it up for Bizzy Bone and Frank Nitty
Mr. Silent puts it down showin no pity
Rollin' it up for all my homies that are with me, with me"

And Leon Cohen, drip, my different fam flowin';
Michael can change his nose, Michael can change his clothes,
The only thing I take off Michael was those panty hose;
Everyone think I'm crazy, everyone think I'm drunk,
I told the world I was molested and they called me 'punk';
No compassion or passion, my khaki suit be mashin',
But then a nigga come with some tight jeans and they call it fashion;
Rappers don't battle me, I'll call 'em all out,
Ain't nobody said a word, Bizzy Bone, no doubt;
The voice is just stupendous, his fan base is tremendous,
So I decided to give you all of me on Heaven's canvas;
Painstakin' then child birth,
I tried my voice on auto tune, they said it just ain't work, my voice just too twerk;
I'm from the middle of the Universe, I should be Captain Kirk,
Mothafucka I earned it, and plus I put in my work.
Yeah, Yeah, BUCK BUCK!
Y'all can't stop it, y'all can't stop,
Gangsta music (sic sic sic sic sic);
Y'all can't stop it, y'all can't stop,
Gangsta music (sic sic sic sic);
Buck buck!
Can't stop my gangsta music, I keeps this gangsta anthem,
Look at the blimp, like a pimp, oh Tony Montana;
I'm numba one amongst my greatest with my country grammar,
Twenty records, still goin', I persevered through cancer;
I hear that 106 don't like my music,
But I got fans overseas tellin' me ""B.B., let them states lose ya"";
I do my shows, y'all some lyin' hoes,
I'm never sued because the promoters ain't do what they was supposed to, oh!;
Wendy Williams, you need to kill the noise,
You made your name up off of gossip, and laughed 'cause I was touched as a boy;
Get on my nerves, like you the next Oprah,
I put it on Tyra banks, you look straight up like a drag queen mixed up with a gopher;
I'll never forget what you said about Pac, I'll never forget what you said about Big,
I'll never forget, and I never forgot, I never forgot...;
But you commentate like you got the scoop, bitch you like 70 years old,
Listen here, Grandma, you was Geritol when Melle Mel was cold, Bitch.

Lord, crush they numbers daddies eyes can see
I know Jesus carry me, he ever need me I'm there verily
I love the Virgin Mary, Mexican food, without the children
Or the child shall lead to mommy, daddy love me I'm chillin'
Bless the world if it's possible, I cry on my knees
Praise the Lord, God almighty the creator of all lightning
Ass booty and cattle, blood stop, I'm feelin' the brain waves rattlin
Tryna stop what we got, ain't seen no cops come
Stone cold producer, bad to the bone, I ain't no sell out
Better leave him alone, I'll clear this bitch out
Shut the fuck up out of they pencil walls and then shake that dust
Fuck the lust, non-physical, now they got me in cuffs - one love
(Bizzy Bone)
Deep in the mind where they question me, what do you want to know?
I don't know nothing, but I heard that legend tellin' me take it slow
Finna be, within the body this is a blessin
Better get rid of whatever you need
You better go get it remember to plant that seed
While I'm dead holdin' the microphone, closer to the spirit
Clearly I get that jealousy somehow I just don't fear it
I blame nothin' and it's surrounded, we're surrounded and trapped
Come up off that bullshit, pulpit, feelin' the fact
Everywhere we lack, in the battlefield the shit like that
Baby we serious and I'm not curious, you tell 'em to watch that
Ideologies remember scientologies, isn't it bloody enough?
Fuck it, we are the soldiers in the rucket rough
Runnin' from the spiritual po-po
Don't act like you don't know though 'cause I don't know either
So y'all relax and take a breather, drink a liter then roll
We gotta, we gotta find somewhere to leave for our souls
(Bizzy Bone)

Fucker don't test us come and arrest us, show me how we play
Feelin' me with the spirit, fight you back like I was anime
Quick to have a baby sick as fuck and jump right on the stage
Comin' up out that limo pockets swollen payin' attention to everything I say
Open up my mind with a prayer, as I worship the Lord Jesus
The Dragon Slayer verily, verily I'm reborn
Tarnished and torn, burnin up I'm feelin' scorned
It's gettin' warm I'm tellin' 'em turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Tarnished and torn, burnin up I'm feelin' scorned
It's gettin' warm I'm tellin' 'em turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Can you feel me? Fuck it, I can feel it; Love it or leave it

Take a look around, but feel don't nobody care
Look to the sky, but I feel that nobody answer your prayers
Yes, money with these houses and your friends disappear
And I know that you hear through the sounds in the air
When you pass by, I know that you feelin' those stares
Let 'em try, you don't need 'em, you got family right here
When life gets ugly, you need beautiful, just look in the mirror

Kiss me on the cheek like they' Judas? But Jesus, please keep it
Beat her all up against for, baby it's fine
Shot at mine with the world on its back, he still rides
Realize synchronation, and dedication of life
What life, nigga? I blacked out from drinkin' liquor

We put our trust in you
You give us strength to do the things we wanna dooooo
(Bizzy Bone:)
Not a party, but we did it like children study in school
I refuse to get deep deep inside of the mystery to know that it's you
How many people are true?
Never could stress me out, thinkin' attention of who?
Mention the representation of plus dedication I'm lacin up the boots
Happily out of the wonderment now
Massage a thought, never could be my style
Shoulda been bred they brought, go and provide some perfect wild
Forever in a day and including now, beautiful love when nobody's around
How could I clown when it's so profound, you know what I'm talkin' about
Round for round and pound for pound, Heavenly Father I praise him now
Our lord and savior Jesus Christ, Lord comin' in on a cloud
Never commit adultery, phsyical thinkin' outtakes the spiritual
Never neglect the fact that, bad medicine, leads to sickness literal
I think you think too hard
And yes, we're comin' up out they yard
What do you see? I see them soldiers takin' charge, march
I see them soldiers takin' charge, march

Said in Psalm 7, ""You do unto others as you would want them to do to you""
Honor mother, honor father, praise God
Love your brother and it'll be one love
To the day way sinnin be livin' and it'll be alone, oh - feel it, heh, ooh
What they wanna do? I see jealousy, element of people in the family
Check out the medley, ow, we sinnin up felonies; thank you
Praise God runnin' and the police thank you
Elementary in the love school till the women come out to beef
And I'll shank you, shook you, shank you - heh, heh
And runnin' in the belly of the beast I stank you, element shank you
And it's worse than a canker sore, don't let 'em flank you, thank you
Don't let 'em flank you, haha

Tell me what do you see?
I see some soldiers takin' charge as they march

Bring that song to the Bentley (?) swangin
The wind is changin, spirit be arrangin
Strange as it seems in these crazy dreams, lean, on Jesus he's as one
That's the real thing, that's the real team, got some real cream
Poppa makin' honey, not money but the real bling
Bada-boom bada-bing, and let your freedom ring
Oh me, I'm mystical as ever all clerical, no little bits in the wind today
Cannibals pullin out a can of that bullshit
That bullshit, tell the bitches plan away
Scan away, literally been broke with a script
In the name of our lord and savior; Jesus Christ
In the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit all of it wise
That's why

When I come back near this Milky Way where N.A.S.A. is blindin
As we keep the Sabbath Holy, dear Lord, that is un-touchable
That angel was so beautiful, gotta love him from a distance though
Quit it, oh shit, you know
This how we dip, we not worthy
Only God can love you more than us, quit it
Hoodtails, strictly for my niggas doin' fed time
Dead time, lookin' for Revelations, look in yo mind
Hoodtails, woodtails, shake yo stick
When you up in here, misunderstood the Holy Grail, can't have no fear
The spitta with no adultery
Battle me, we gon' save ya
On a manjor, on a stranger, gonna tell him what it is
Rightousness the guide, when you're writing to live
Ain't no pain, no lies, no time for fear
But a little gangster in ya elo eems story the 10 versions
Allah who act wise, I sing to the surgeon
And four winds, one excursion
Sweat pourin outta the pourin pourage
And plus these portious portions
Of importless extortion
Never that, keep cool
An arm, no back
And little Lay still flippin
Carry the doubt, and might even track
Stay strapped, shit, relax
I'm chillin' and feelin' that
With no words, just love
Up the mountain, the fountains back
Countin' stacks on my way to the court room, what
It's just dreams anyway, one love 'cause, and we buck
Thuggish ruggish and rough
Tough, and yes we humble
Turn the other cheek, stay meek in this royal rumble
Hoodtails, strictly for my niggas doin' fed time
Dead time, lookin' for Revelations, look in yo mind
Hoodtails, woodtails, shake yo stick
When you up in here, misunderstood the Holy Grail, can't have no fear
Yeah, hoodtails
Woodtails, shake yo stick (Shake yo stick, nigga)
As I walked up to the serpent and he said ""suck my dick""
I looked at him like, nigga this me, nigga
Who the fuck you talkin' to?"
54,I Must Fess Up,2006,The Midwest Cowboy (2006),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"(Intro: Bizzy)
My first, my first Briana
I named her after me and shit
Send shouts out to my family
Y'knowmsayin, my daughter Briana
If I never see you again baby, we gon' do it
(Chorus: Bizzy Bone)
And I must fess up if I mess up, babe I want you back
B my daughter, get the babies, move the fam attack
And if we never see each other 'member you are the best
I'm still wit'chu, remember me, don't stress
If I mess up, I gotta fess up, boo I want you back
B my daughter, get the babies and the fam attack
And if we never see each other 'member you are the best
I still love you, I still love you
(Bizzy Bone)
If I had you in my arms and we had money to spare
I'll take you anywhere, ev-erywhere, it don't matter I don't care
You better do what'chu gotta do, you're freedom is so precious
Kisses and hugs and love, my beauty, you're excellence
Manifested in perfection, I can't say no more
Have fun for me baby, slammin' Maybach doors
They broke my jaw in the club, Billy nursed me to health
She more than a friend, she showed me that I wasn't by myself
And I been broke, Keith blessed me with paper to go get fed
A hot meal and a bag of weed, plus some liquor with nothin' said
Never asked me for the money back, my love I thank you
I'm very grateful when I'm lonely and I know that God loves me
Reminiscin on the good times, the best was good times
So misunderstood times, good times
And these are so misunderstood rhymes, woodgrain, get it on
And when I'm not in the battlefield you know that I still get it on
Evaluations wanna vision you and never rejoicin
Baby I love you, everything that I can muster, uh
Evaluations wanna vision you and never rejoicin
Baby I love you with everything, no choices
(Bizzy Bone)
I scoop you up, up in the limo with a bottle full of Bacardi
12-pack of Bud Light, bumpin ""Let Me Feel Your Body""
The whisk for the moment as the driver say ""Where
Are we goin', round the city? Roll the weed, I don't care""
We'll be feelin' 'em, so in love with me, and yes the feelin' is mutual
As I ride pass the graveyard, reminiscin over the funeral
My brother is here in spirit, made his peace with the Lord
You can ask Ninja when it happened, Capo loved the Lord
I put 'Pac on, all rap music we bumpin
Baby lookin' at me chillin', she feelin' me, makin' a million
Pass the cup into my girl and Brandy, I mean Britney
Kinda tipsy on the backseat in the Lincoln stretch fizzy
I still love you boo, still true to the affection
Never abandon this protection, the fuckin' direction
I still love you boo, still true to the affection
Never abandon my protection, the focus in yo' direction; what
(Bizzy Bone)
We at the road, still chillin', watchin movies and we smokin'
Baby she lookin' so beautiful, ""You comfortable?"" ""Boo, you know it""
Was the answer that she gave me as we finished the spinach
Cause dinner at Ruth Chris, let's get drunk for the reel spinnin
Fi-let mig-non, big lobster, champagne was Dom
We need some Cristal, won't get it for now, let's get it on
And we kissin' at the table as the patrons sip Patron
One patron told us go get a room, and go home
500 dollars on the table, we half-naked
Makin' out, tearin our clothes off, the limo get to shakin
Better save it for the room, I can't wait no more
With the slow jam of ""Secret Lovers"" playin' at the door
The star shinin so bright, they watchin from afar
You're a shinin star, forever and ever you are
We at the corner, I guess it's just like Ike and Tina
Clothes messed up, bra on backwards, I gotta see her, gotta see her"
55,I Need You,2008,A Song For You (2008),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"(Intro: sample of James Brown's ""Try Me"")
Try me (try me) try me (try me, ooh)
And your love, will always be true
Oh, I need (try me) try me (try me, ooh)
God'll tell me... I need you
Try me (try me) try me (try me, ooh)
And your love, will always be true
Oh, I need you
(Bizzy Bone:)
But you know if I love unconditional
This the residual, world individual
Indivisible, little old me
Keepin' me lonely, no woman to hold me
Where my lady? My lady ain't crazy, my love
My lady is all that I have
Want that below (?), and what do ya know
This is the path, so narrow the arrow is pointed
At somethin' and I just can't do me
It doesn't suit me, just boot me - I'll make it alone
I'll make it with Bone, I'm comin' get home
Baby I don't accept clothes
'Member the tone, the tone, the hollerin is dumb
Where is she from? She needs to be gone
My word is my bond, your word is your bond
Whatever whatever, bring David this song and I'm gone
(Chorus: sample of James Brown's ""Try Me"")
Try me (try me) try me (try me, ooh)
God'll tell me... I need you
Try me (try me) try me (try me, ooh)
And your love, will always be true
Oh, I need you
(Bizzy Bone:)
What's she doin', my darling, let's get away fast
I give you no money, don't give me no ass
We upper-class players, riders forever
They never will get us so get us remember
Eleven times comin', she's stuntin, she frontin
When you ridin' me then ride Ezra, it's nothin'
I make him go fuck the flo', you know
Mi casa mi casa now watch, that hoe
Say boy, that ain't no money, this money is money
Johanna, you're so fuckin' hungry, it's funny
Messin my body, my ink, back and tummy
Be fastenin, can you run it?
{""Try me, you can't buy me"" - James Brown}
Can't fuck with my book baby
I read the rook for you baby, ha ha ha
(Bizzy Bone:)
Tell them quit with that foolish, this schoolin is due
Don't mean to be rude, with no attitude
Just the gratitude, latitude, gradually after you
How could I ever be mad at you?
One in their face, with one in their place
What should I taste? Give me a woman, I'm straight
I said one in yo' face, one in yo' place
What should I taste? Give me a woman, I'm straight"

What's wrong with your mind
I didn't know what to say

Cause fuck it I love you
Fuck it I need you
Said baby I do love you
Baby I do need you
Well like ion, eon, love and hate
I don't want the? that'll be my fate
Mama I wanna sing
Mama I wanna sing
The way that he loves you
How can I do, what he does
I'm not a fool
The way that he thinks
The way that he drinks
It's all the things that he does it makes me sing
I said you deep in love
But I can't be your son
I can't be the one
I can't your gun
Well fuck it I love you
Fuck it I need you
Said baby I do love you
Baby I do need you
It's like David, Solomon, and the rest up in the bible
If I get with this girl then I might go through a trial
Or tribulations
Ain't no hating
My secular speech
Has got them waiting
I love you
She said she hates you
She don't hate me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Well fuck it baby I love you
Praise God I do need
Hmm
And baby I do love you

59,I'm The One,2008,A Song For You (2008),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"(Intro: Joel Madden)
Oh, to the sects. Oh! This' the one right here.
(Chorus: Bizzy (Joel))
(Oh! I'm the one...) Through the fire, pyre
Through the rain, through the rain
Through the fire, pyre
Through the rain, through the rain
Through the pain (Oh! I'm the one...) And only one can be the one, it better be, get out of my way, say (Oh!)
(Bizzy Bone:)
Through the fire, pyre
Through the rain and pain and pyre
The temperature hotter then lava, the medium, medium, meetin' em, tedium
B.B. The Kid saga
Allah the king, administer candles
Kiss the rain, dig in the brain and find the Ying
Part of the negative, there go the Yang
Thinking they're deep and they're ready to get with the glory thang
Steady the people that think that we're whispering, baby we born in the sin and we bang
Steady the thugs, and look at the buzz
I look at the drugs, I look at the buds
Out of their minds, you know what it is
If you're getting mad, you don't know what it was
Memory blood, the duster, the dust in the wind, I don't need to cuss
If I was a women, I'd come as a women, and give you an angel you never could touch
The spirit, the light, the birds, the flight, the bread, and even the rush
I don't need nothing, whatever your doing is makin' my brain feelin' the touch
Eliminate hate, open the palms
Carry the babies, I sing this song
Walk in The Garden, open arms
Disgusted, gotta stay calm
Look at the angsta' angels, walkin' the earth, they miss their spouses
Humans, homes, and houses, mini-mansions and mountains
All will be found and...
(Chorus: Bizzy (Joel))
(Oh! I'm the one...) And only one can be the one, it better be, get out of my way, say-ay-ay-ay-ay (I'm the one...) And only one... And only one... It's only one, one, one... (I'm the one...) And only one can be the one, it better be, get out of my way, say-ay-ay-ay-ay
Yeah, and only one... It's only one... Crush yo' ass. (Oh!) And only one...
(Bizzy Bone:)
I know what they're looking for, huh, but they never gon' find it though
Overflowin' the cup, and then what? Shall I go further, yo? Shalt never murder though
Shalt never covet another man's propert-o
Shalt never steal, never use thy Lord' name in vain, and though many more to go
Never act like your The Lord and you'll see
No adultery, gotta be all you can possibly be
And, don't make out to be a lion, funny you think I'm lying
It's me, and walking the streets, and ridin' the ambulance straight to the bed and an IV
An eye for an eye I never go by, gotta forgive them and let it be
Think of the sign, the temple the mind, we get on the grind and decree
By any degree, feelin' the burn, the family saying they love me
Is that what I see? Is that what is? After everything nothing but your greed? Remember the vibe? Remember the tribe? Never could murder me twice
Remember the pride? I got rid of mine in '89, still got a life
After all, you handle your promises
It's so man
Y lies, a smokin' gun
I forgive you, but I know who is the one, Allah
(Chorus: Bizzy (Joel))
(Oh! I'm the one...) And only one can be the one, it better be, get out of my way, say-ay-ay-ay-ay (I'm the one...) Yeah, and only one... It's only one... It's only one... (I'm the one...) And only one can be the one, it better be, get out of my way, say-ay-ay-ay-ay (I'm the one...) Yeah, and only one... It's only one... (Oh!)
(Bizzy Bone:)
How many men you know that can birth up a baby, and burpin' my baby, and don't have a lady
Come back from the walk and she actin' so shady
Smokin' with homie, it still doesn't phase me, and leave
It's nothing to eat, the baby is crying, I walk him to sleep
And he wake up as Bryon, no money, I crawl out the gutter, and tell me to whoop on the child
Better believe, when the beating is what you receive
Wake up and you'll wind up in the beginning with no precious metals and demons are pleased
Now you in the breeze, why you fuckin' with me? You're visibly stripped to your knees
And giving your self more credit then you deserve
I worship the Lord, you worship a dream
The triple the beam, the trinity
And eyein' the fiend, the theory of rocks, you know what I mean? (Damn) The Big Bang (What?) Duster, the duster, with the dust of wind, I don't need to cuss
If I was a women, I'd come as a women, and bring you an angel you never could touch (Whoo!) The spirit, the light, the
Birds, the flight, the bread, and even the rush
I don't need nothing, whatever your doing, and making my brain feelin' the touch
Eliminate hate, open the palms
Carry the babies, I sing this song
Walk in The Garden with open arms, disgusted, but I stay calm
(Chorus: Bizzy (Joel))
(Oh! I'm the one...) And only one can be the one, it better be, get out of my way, say-ay-ay-ay-ay (I'm the one...) Yeah, and only one... It's only one... It's only one... (I'm the one...)

If the globe stops spinning and the sky falls down
And we go all on the mountain, and the trumps make sounds
And the hand stop ticking, and the horse rides in
And the sails (get buff?) you'll all be down
(Bizzy:)
Yeah, gimme dat water baby
This world'll drive me crazy, better watch ya back playa, playa
Yeah, gimme dat water baby
This world'll drive me crazy, better watch ya back playa, playa
Stuck in the game, passing the flames on these lames
Never could fade me, enter my wall of shame
Hotter then lava, and the sound of the kitchen cajan, mayne
Maintain the main thing, blame, it is a mystical frame
Enter the circle, exit quicker than aim
Slums up in the barrio, baby I guess I'm a bum, hey
Come for me mama, it ain't nothing but legitimate rhyme skills...
And baby as we represent the one all the way
In the circumference, dhunn-dhunny gimme the money
Hun-ga-ry muthafuckas, say what? I'm Still sunny
Bizzy, he does it, what was it? What is it?
Hittin'em harder in the bank, inquisitive with straight saints
Daintily in the ain't, is following the bears
And quizzing me, is you crazy, I know you know what it is
It's just a starter, if I'm a martyr, give me my paper
Knee-deep like sheep, these wolves, they can't escape us
One time
Holla back, you gimme the rhythm, I hit 'em up in that hat
And I hit 'em up in that back, if need be, the Mack
Slack? Never... but on the 12th of September
You better get everything you need, remember, One Time
Baby boy, feeling the clout, gimme the music properly
Yes, I'm God's property, monopoly, who gonna stop me?
Nobody, Gettin' in em, we winning, seeing the women
Venomous in the minimum, baby boy, as we sending em
Ending 'em in the beginning, rendering what they want
But I don't pay no fucking taxes, I only smoke up the blunt
And I don't have time to front, you're rolling with me, well let's move
We duck the funerals, the usual, Bizzy let's groove
One Time
Secular, molecules protecting us
Brain waves, respecting us, Punk muthafuckas, they ain't connecting us
Recollecting us, and we bust, in God we trust
And the plus, I got mission, precision listen to us, trust
In the imperial, water floating and flowing
Get it up, uptown, all around, they not knowing
Skyline, high line, I sign this
Gimme my money muthafucka I'm pissed
One time in the apparatus, no status, no gladis
Only the pimps, no simps, I'm still rapping
Keeping it moving for me, no nuts, no glory
Know your heads strong, scary story, that purgatory
I said it's ore-y or we eerie, do you hear me much clearly?
The streets in that direction and real people can feel me
I said it's ore-y or it's eerie, do you hear me? Much clearly?
Still in that direction, and real people can feel me
One Time"
61,Intro (Layzie Dedication),2008,Ruthless (2008),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"Through the weather the storms, my nigga will always be my nigga
Through the weather the storms...
Through the weather the storms, my nigga will always be my nigga
Through the weather the storms...
Through the weather the storms...
My nigga will always be my nigga
Through the weather the storms...
There was a thug I knew in Cleveland, strugglin hard to survive
He wanted the finer things in life, whatever the streets could provide
Hooked up with the killers slash dealers started to grind and reside
Slept on the streets and stayed on the block with a bottle of rocks and a nine
Gathered his homies, started a crew, stood on the corners in sloo
Way back in 1989 when they wore flats in they shoes
Before there was (?) in they dudes, no metal detectors in schools
Had him a gun in the bag with his books and took it to class and he'd shoot
Whoo, suddenly he was the man, everyone knew he was gettin' that money
Brand new jewelry, bought him a car at 14, and everything lovely
Had him a stash, dreams of upper class, cash in his pocket to spend
Had it so good, had it so hood, man I wish I'da been there
And one day, the po'-po' was on him, he couldn't escape even though he was quick
They offered a deal, but just like a thug, he was what he was, he wasn't no snitch
He went to jail, did all of his time, back in the Cleveland, this time with a dream
He started a group called Bone Thugs and wanted all of us on his team
That's my nigga
Through the weather the storms, my nigga will always be my nigga
Through the weather the storms...
Through the weather the storms, my nigga will always be my nigga
Through the weather the storms...
Through the weather the storms...
My nigga will always be my nigga
Through the weather the storms..."
62,It's 1999,2008,Ruthless (2008),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"(?) Matter
Why did he deserve to be chosen so angels could bow?
We have to go back to Jurassical classics, so fasten your safety belt, it's goin' down
The dinosaurs speakin' with life, who knows of the spirit, the soul or mind
Only the lord, and some of these babies, and others; one others were leavin' once in the night
Enlightened when men was created, did Adam survive on the ship?
I don't know, soon as it's told, there's my stone,
These delicies, cause these intracasies are to cold
Let us move on with the story of Egypt, where Pyramids roll through the desert
It's only in aims,.. from Allah
Evolution (?) is ever so present; think of handsome birds,
And animals, strictly to show Allah as much as they can
What of the love, beaming with light
They probably about to come back as a man
The knoweledge that one would possess
When they dig deep in the psyche, the brain
In the midst of that haze, understanding their dreams
And what does it mean, show us the way
So many wars, it's so many pressures,
Opressive?, a lesson for change
Some vultures could never come deal with commitment so they pick on the strays
God was teaching the kids to stand on their own as a father would teach his son
Then come back, and be proud of his children
Jesus sacrificed his life for some love
And Allah already had a plan
Adam, man, prophecy logically, possibly
Probably; oh, look at the monopoly
Best friends, nobody can stop me

Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me, it's only me, only me
For you, I walk in my sins
And put it out to the world about the things that I did, that I did
For you, I give 'em the paper, look at the world
And the haters and watch where I cast my pearls
For you, I'll walk through the fire and the blistery winter
Constantly in prayer, even pray for the minister
For you, they can call me any name in the book
I take a look and skip the knowledge, put it on my knees brook
For you, it'll water the longer we stand in fire
When the grace and the peace and we'll never retire
For you, I'll answer your question, in a secretive manner
Very selective of the answers
I'm for you, I grind in the most righteous way
If possible if it's probable I'll give you anything you say
For you, tears they will drop like rain
I can't help it I see you hurtin' it make me damn insane, for you
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me, it's only me, only me
From death and destruction, vivid pictures of the corpse
Nobody would tell me, I see the matrix takin' a loss
And cherish your soul, the main ingredient of course
The liquor to soothe the mortal spirit, baby I'm tossed
I'ma grind in the church, in the body we walkin'
Our cathedral, the congregation's beautiful equal
But when the time comes my people, better be prepared
For anythang in these last days better be, aware
Smokin' this purple haze, I'm goin' crazy on the voices
Throwin' shit inside of my brain I maintain the sickest noises
Alliance and allegiance, for the one almighty
Without the science we the faithful ready for war, y'all try me
Wicked army they could never buy me, can't even ride with me
Bitin my babies and we need the love highly
They frightening my babies but it's good 'cause I'm a soldier
And I'm walkin' in a narrow path, baby I told you!
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me, it's only me, only me
Bryon, Orion my vision I'm here to unite the fuckin' aliens and angels
My solomon give me the angle
Who in the dango, pop on one of my partners, c'mon my mama armor
Flip out with the wicked dip out, I'm doin' the damn thang
School by the ministers, sinister wicked to contemplate
Sinners they wanna comply with hate, baby don't even play me
I was raised by those Africans, protected by Ethiopians
And I read that grease was deep in the ruins, open yo' fallopian
Philomina my Grandmother, Masedonia Mama
Bah-bah Corinthians on simpletons fast
With the job Bone everlast, got the narrow path father
Set up shop come up out the coffin and we finna go find the grass
Clash with the titans, I don't even think that motherfuckers be bitin
But I know that other fuckers be fightin
Sit this Mike Tyson missionary, dictionary rappers said Emmanuel
Fuck with the chambers and I beat that ass well
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be
Baby it's only me; nothin' but mud, spirit, indeed me
Let us be all we can be

It's the light, light, light, light
Shinin so bright, bright, bright
Comin' out the darkness, angels we're callin, it's all right
All right, right, right, right, it's all right
(Bizzy Bone)
Been in a good fight, street wars and bar room brawls
And the arguments with the family but we family y'all
Get it back together as we laugh it off, baby it means so much
How could we ever ever stay out of touch?
So many tears that the children were to appear as they there
And I'm tryin' to provide our kids, steadily on the grind but I'm sad
As the life roll, I need a humble abode
They think about it so warm cause the world's so cold
I gotta provide, stay ridin', tear slowly
Gotta get up by myself and pray to the Lord so lonely
Missin' my Bone Thug homies, Makaveli and Pun
Left-Eye, Aaliyah, Biggie Smalls, yes we represent the one (one one one)
Long life prosperity, a huge fuckin' family
My granny Philomina and she care for me
Time we get it together so we can shine so bright
Praise God in the darkness, yeah the light
(Bizzy Bone)
One time for they mind, see
It's a busy lifestyle, handle my business, I get a witness
And I kick it with the posse, I'm still chillin', can you feel it?
I don't need a copy, I'm a straight up G
I said I represent the Lord, no adultery
I stay focused on the mission, good music and drink
Honor your mother, honor your father, your people they links
Sink deeper in the thoughts and as quick get 'em out your brain
You get in if it's searchin, drive me crazy insane
Plenty water up in your body, flushin liver for health
Drink milk, eat fish, and remain yo'self
Complication, shake the loss, slow thoughts we crush
Remember, back in the days with galoshes and slush
Don't rush me, don't touch me dawg
Stay spiritual, I'm blessed, get up up out that fog
Don't rush me, don't touch me dawg
(Bizzy Bone)
Be about it, be about it
Be about it, be about it, be about it
And be about it, be about it when it's on, it's on
This battle was not colonel, sex demons be gone
Hex me it's on, Bizzy Bone bring 'em again
Break change of imprisonment, you feelin' me mayne?
Still family orientated conducted in the spirit
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent this
I represent it properly, yes I'm God's property
Nobody can stop me, nobody can stop me
Opt to be a lover and a fighter for truth
And the cops give me a hard time, raise the roof
190 proof, ever so clear as can be
See I can only be me, can only be B
I'm walkin' in the forest as we dance to the trees
I've learned so much, hurt so much, everybody hurtin' me
Still love 'em and it's all forgive 'em
For everything if someone asks
(Bizzy Bone)
So right, so right, so right"

Seven times seventy, heavenly, melodically
Remedy, talkin' that brainwave centipede
Elementary dear Watson, spark the light bulb often
I'm better off in a coffin, it'll be her caught in an orphan
The mighty fuckin' warrior, wa-wa-wa-warrior
Two different floors, bet yours I'm the matrix at its finest
And wine it gets sipped on, attitude it gets dripped on
The thought's stayin gripped on, I'm quick as a bit
It's Mr. Misfit, with the fifth smokin' the crisp
With water let me tell you what a lift (hey)

Get your money mayne (one time for they mind baby)
Get your money mayne, go get your money mayne (yeah yeah)
Go get your, go get your money mayne (get off me, get off me!)
Go get your, go get your money mayne (one time)
Get your money (Bizzy Bone, The Midwest Cowboy)
Go get your money mayne (holla back boys)
You so lovey dovey
Concentrate on your paper kick back (one time baby, c'mon)
Hey, don't let 'em search you, only talk to God (c'mon now)
In a mirage, duck the mEnage and (you know what it is)
(Chorus: Bizzy Bone)
Baby go get your money, you're so lovey dovey
Concentrate on your paper, kick back, and sip bubbly (hey)
Don't let 'em search you, only talk to God
In a mirage, duck the mEnage, and blahzay-blah (uh, one time)
Baby go get your money, you're so lovey dovey
Concentrate on your paper, kick back, and sip bubbly (hey)
Don't let 'em search you, only talk to God
In a mirage, duck the mEnage, and blahzay well blahzay-blah (one time)
(Bizzy Bone)
Duckin the system and I'm wonderin if it's physical
Baby I'm feelin' the fury and the money and it's still spiritual
Somebody tellin' me why you hurtin' me baby you hurtin' yourself
Feelin' the one I'm feelin' the same, see you around the town passin me
'Cause I'm a loner on the planet taken for granted
With only one body to manage, no knowledge I'm schizophrenic
Tellin' me I should suck your johnson just to humble myself
Charles Bronson, strictly the victim, I'm comin' in with stealth
Huh, who do you believe in? I believe in God Almighty
The prophets, the saints and the angels, Michael and son righteously
Don't ask me any questions after that, we ridin'
Stack blame, bless Jacob the Jeweler, we not slidin
Bring work constantly, and get you 9 percent
And that's for your own protection, what do ya mean I don't pay rent?
So why should I have to suck it? I'm so fuckin' (Thuggish Ruggish)
I'd rather fill my mouth with sharp-ass teeth so we both can love it
Fuck it, I go celibate, celebration of elements
My sentiments exactly, and exact me through these tenements
Testimony been done, repentance bein taken care of
Nobody to care for me? Well fuck it, I'm finna share love
(Bizzy Bone)
Rollin' in a hoopty or a bucket, who gives a fuck
Listin to slow cuts, smokin' weed, so what
And held up, I'm in a hold-up, Bizzy baby don't fold up
And this is ain't the way it's supposed to be, I'm tellin' ya, I told ya
Soldier, grown men callin theyself Jehovah
I only hope when they get judged that they was representin Jehovah
No adultery don't ever roll over
Feelin' the pain of a spiritual warrior wanted a platform to warn ya
Been scorned, ever since I was born, ""America's Most Wanted""
John Walsh family in a trailer park in Oklahoma
You want it? Yes I'm on it, B we on it fo' sho'
'Member you want it you go get it, I'm wit it, admit it you know (yeah)
Ha (for the utmost) for the utmost baby, fo' sho' the tongue's wicked
Pay attention to the water and the way that we kick it
Pray over the food (over the food) bless this meal
Bow down and kneel, and we never accept the seal
Or the number of the beast, I serve God, not mammy
Let me give you knowledge (one time for they mind) let me stop my ramblin
Or the number of the beast, I serve God, not mammy
Instead of me givin' you extra knowledge, let me stop my ramblin
One time
(Bizzy Bone)
On that tropical, logical thinkin', E's an impossible
Probable, beer in the bottle, I'm full throttle
Unstoppble, jealousies make 'em envy my words
So they can think of somethin' heinous to do, when I'm on the curve
Smoke herb with my closest family members and friends
Bend corners in the Lambo while I'm stackin them ends
One for the dub and the real, together always
And if the end of the world comes and we call V
See the Lord'll save his children, I love him, may I exalt him
Above the heavens and the Earth the creator is L's calling
Ultra (Alpha and Omega), the father Jesus Christ
My everything I love you, you so right
Expressions of my heart, it gets painful to think
Baby why do you think - that I drink, that I drink, that I drink
Anything that you need if it's possible, I'll supply
I can help but I'm emotional and that's why I cry
One time"

74,Maybe You Can Hold Me,2006,The Story (2006),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"Starve me, beat me, then chastise me
Love me never leave me, I see it super-sized

Never spare your rod, maybe you can hold me, hold me
Starve me, beat me, then chastise me
Love me never leave me, I see it super-sized
Work me, sculpt me, maybe you can mold me
Never spare your rod, maybe you can hold me
With the I.V. stuck in my arm, and I'm calm
Feelin' at peace, through this madness, through this song
My darling's gone, and my family, is left in sadness
There is no more money to give, everybody's glad-less
This is the life, that I live, and my breath that we breathin
And I'm without any blood, and it's only blue bleedin
Just a wretch, and I just sometimes did wanna be alone
Lord God the Father will you please take me home?
Cause Jesus is our Lord and our savior
Beautiful Jesus your love is so major, born in a manger
I thank ya... for yo' sacrifice
I feel my spirit is in danger (danger, danger)
Starve me, beat me, then chastise me
Love me never leave me, I see it super-sized

Defend me my dear Lord, that's when I need you
Make me pay for what I've done wrong ten-fold
And the love is still in danger, please let me not be a stranger
To the tender and the kindness... [echoes]
Lift the shame up off me, God I feel so dirty
But Jesus is our Lord and our savior

You know I thank ya... for yo' sacrifice
Jesus our Lord and, Jesus our savior
Beautiful, Jesus, your love is major
Born in a manger, you know I thank ya
For yo' sacrifice, I feel my spirit's in danger
Starve me, beat me, then chastise me
Love me never leave me, I see it super-sized
I said this hospital isn't any place for yo' light
And regardless of the situation there's always love from life
And the charges of inception, failin inspection
Remember it's only one, it's only one
Jesus our Lord and, our Lord and savior
Beautiful Jesus, your love is major
Born in a manger, you know I thank ya
For your sacrifice, I feel my spirit's in danger

I'm riding a caddy and daddy I'm rolling it sadly
But I don't mind, if they laughing at me
The movie I hardly think that they be singing singing
I never gave up on my lady, but she still ain't listening to me
Gotta let them 24's spin, chins ain't chipping or flipping
And let me get another victim again... gain-gain-gain-gain
And whether they don't gimme any hen or befriend them
When they said I was, but I been right here, cause
You know what it is, you know what it was
So they wanna move dude, Watchu gotta do, who
Not me...
I said I'm glossin', and who you thought of flossin' baby
Baby, I'm not Pac though... And I'm not God, no...
But I float like a butterfly, sting like a... (bee)...
Mo Money, money, money, money, money, money
In the face of the crowd
Plottin' and now, I don't need no pride to hide
Oh wow, oh wow...
Mo money, money in the face of the crowd
Plottin' now, I don't need no pride to hide
Oh wow... But baby I'm not Pac, No!... (BUCK, BUCK...)
(Twista:)
Ya now out by the windy city south park
No cookin' in the kitchen, homie we put out raw
Midwest outlaw... Fuck with it? I doubt y'all
Somewhere between Chi-town and Cleveland is where they found y'all
Rolling through the alley in a caddy...
Throw my cali's at the hataz... O with a P
When they hit a nigga grizzle rocking city after city...
They gon' ask, ""Is he doing it with Bizzy? ""
And you know I ain't done now (Why?)
'Cause we 2 of the coldest muthafucka...
To spit these fast lyrics on one track
Buck 'em with a lyrical bullet in the body...
Because I gotta get this fire to know shit don't stop
Pull up in a Lamborghini or the Ferrari...
Other one gotta get the props, so I gotta get the drop
Gotta get the doe and get the money, money
I could really feel it when I hear they coming for me
Try to get it if you think you feeling kinda lucky
Twin Glocks... so you know you better bring a buddy
And I got the ammunition for anybody...
That wanna go against the Midwest Militia
A whole crippled the competition for Bizzy
A whole crippled the competition for Twista
A whole crippled the world because it's us against it...
And the shit about the get ugly
The static come and hit 'em with the automatic...
Running through borough after murder but I'm a go and so I gotta get
(Bizzy:)
Me and my brother Twista getting it crunk
And drinking that goosey, with 'em a brew
Doing whatever we want to do
Get to the club, ain't nobody knew
Thought that we beefing, they try to divide the truth
Talk about who really started the style
How bout everyone living in harmony...
Look at the army, now
General 7, the belly is purest and we wanna get it...
At heaven, we dancing our way to the gates
If you coming we'll need every Muslim
We human, we're all in the brethren
Veteran deep in the city I pity the fool...
Who jump out of this fake
What do I look like massaging the thought
When they come with the matrix and say that we 'fraid
We'll never break...
'Member that conny and Twista
We're gonna go through the fire, never expire
Give it the way that they want it...
The fun of for you if you tired (What about...)
Money, you tell me what's money to you
Pay for the rappers and corporates...
The office that burn wood, but the burn good
And the brain wave... Puts the energy, certainly
I don't have time for emergencies, baby the word...
And we walk with the covenant
Party and popping the melody...
Baby, I know that the ladies be loving it
Brush the dust (in the) enemies way, get 'em a drink
We look too lovely, the spirit is present
And never be hesitant, Twista and Bizzy
We getting this money, Nukka"

This is Mr. Majesty representin' on behalf of the 7th Sign Regime. [Laughs].
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, 7th Sign Regime representin')
Thunderstorms when they mourn fallen angels. Mental methodical mind, niggas
Wanna tangle. 365 I'm live at every angle. Mental methodical mind, niggas wanna tangle.
Everybody knows 7th Sign got the hoes. Everybody knows we divine wit' the flows. Shouldn't have to tell you when it rains wear your coat. It's thunderstoms because we mourn the dope.
Manipulatin' metaphors I take full credit for. You can rest assured you'll never more suffer through flaw. You can steady toughen the law; they'll be harder criminal brushin' the shores. Tuck in your jaw. If your confidence is lower, minus lead blower, sinus flaired to the smallest odor. Tried to get open but just a file folder, next man style holder, weightless chest a tasteless death, I'm compound to be a sound souljah. On tracks compact, bolder abstract flava, drift like the mist holdin' a black fist with right shoulder. Addition to the culture went fishin' with these vultures, enlistment predicted to be held over. Hired wired cobras to work front desk, smoke, dress the dress, pure moist no choice but to be less. His ploy to decoy the congress, skills, too broke to pay homage. In a craft he shows his ass, in a trash conglomerate. Had your staff astonished. Precise math, most dominant. Switch.
Enchanted romantic mechanics will banish no talents damaged in fragments
Unbalanced and silenced. Stompin' the housing, crowdin' kids that's pounding playgrounds and courts where small missiles went through. So often a sport on the wrong course trailing the horse. Raps biggest divorce needs figures. For me, my niggaz: weed, food, and cloth. When the greed mood falls off, the danger remainder is a hard rock slagged soft. Walked past slop almost crushed by a bus, not lookin', in a rush, might have been a mascot for I.H.O.P. as human slush. Keep it lower than hush. The diploma for lust and slight comas when I bust and then again works skins to heavy musk, everready cuts. Coincidentally is simply a mystery melody rush.
Thunderstorms when they mourn fallen angels. Mental methodical mind, niggas
Wanna tangle. 365 I'm live at every angle. Mental methodical mind, niggas wanna tangle.
Everybody knows 7th Sign got the hoes. Everybody knows we divine wit' the flows. Shouldn't have to tell you when it rains wear your coat. It's thunderstoms because we mourn the dope.
Percussion rushin', crushin' the sounds. The inner raggamuffin', got me bustin' them down. A nine milli really make a nigga worship the ground. Preparering kings. Courtship is now. Ignite torch for sundown. Quiz of a ninja disguised as a stupid nigga. This biz will injure the unwise and traumatize offenders. White lies turn shades of gray like skies in November. At the brink of dismay. My eyes will never flicker. Herbs, got the nerve to pray when the city gets sicka punks intellectually drunk with butter flies in their liver. Have no ties to the beginning. Cold fries, but I've put in work for dessert and dinner, no perks.
Incentive: soul search the whole earth extensive. Had a low chirp, slow birth in placenta, incubated and escalated to contender. Pushin' through gush waitin' for air on mush. Now sexually molest ovaries, finessed. Locally approach me with respect and royalty - Majesty.
""And after this you'll call me 'Your Majesty'""
Motion sicknes prevents the wickedness from overseas magnificence. No talents with instruments, but the choke-hold vocals compensate the difference. Society full of menaces--abnormal residents.
It's like I'm floatin'. I think I'm floatin'. Got me open. I guess I'm floatin'. No jokin'. I'm movin' as my words are spoken. A vibe in groovin', lightening movement. I feel so exclusive."

Everbody ain't gon make it out the hood
You wanna flow like bizzy did
Just keep the faith
And it's all to the good
Your girl is cheating on you
You finna go to jail
Now you just lost your job
Your house is up for sale
Your friend just passed away
Before you said goodbye
Your son going to war
And you still don't know why
Your mum contracted aids
And right before she died
She could'ntspeak a word
But she can blink her eyes
See she was paralyzed
And you so scared to cry
You wanted to show her your strength
And tell her the lord provides
The church is taking money
Selling granny a dream
She wanna a go to heaven
Think she can get it with green
Your cousins gettin' rich
Off of a triple beam
You see him losing weight
It's started off with greens
It elevated with rocks
And now he's on the pipe
He used to ride 22""
Now cousin ride a bike
Your mama got a man
Her man he got a temper
So he beat you right up
Gets drunk and don't remember
As soon as you go to school
Your teacher asked what happened?
Your peers they know the story
You say ain't nothing cracking
Your money's runnning low
And it ain't no welfare
Remember PAC said ""who in the hell cares? ""
But bizzy cared for you
See I can only stay?
These are the muddy waters
That I can see and hear (repeat)
And that's life in the city kid
Everbody ain't gon make it out the hood
You wanna flow like bizzy did
Just keep the faith
And it's all to the good (repeat)
You had your 4 friends
And you all grew up together
On the corner swingin' rhymes
Singing the vibe? together
Breaking bread stealing cars and staying in trouble
House partys with the homies
And then watching 'em rumble
But soon your friendship crumbles
As you grow up in life
You reached the age of 30
And soon forget your plight?
What if they blew up
And became the biggest group ever
I guess we'll never know
That's just the way it goes
Having highschool dreams of turning pro
Catch an injury and now the scouts? ain't around no more
Studying to be a doctor but get pregnant in school
You decided to keep your child
And now you must provide the food
At the tender age of 50
Reaching your golden years
These are the muddy waters
That I can see and I hear
Bizzy cared for you
But baby I can only stay
These are the muddy waters
That I can and I hear
And that's life in the city kid
Everbody ain't gon make it out the hood
You wanna flow like bizzy did
Just keep the faith
And it's all to the good"

Enemies please I keep my chest out believe me
700 laywers and they all actin' greedy
Money hungry strugglin while thuggin'
My baby momma complain I'm full wit pain
Cigrettes tha tame enemies filled wit pain
Itchy fingers while niggaz they snitched out
And bitches inches from havin' pussy poppers wit pistol switches
Picture that
I actually I'm happy daddy just don't understand
I'm back on tha block wit chucks and my man
And store my sexuality when all tha chickens where virgins (now)
Rebellin in excursions wonderin if it be burnin up suburbans
And my community we watch fights and it really don't bother me
Sadamized by poverty
Cause nobody think 'bout the babies
Cause nobody thinkin' 'bout the babies
Yeaaaaa! murdarah murdarah
Yeaaaaa! murdarah murdarah
Heavily in tha drug thang
And if they can stop Saddam from sellin missiles
How we satuated wit pistols they illegalize
And tax which changed and mark my words
They doin' tha same thing wit cocaine
And herb how we everyday handle well
Jesus planted tha seeds and help ease lil boys and girls ease
There minds and I ain't talkin' bout smokin' weed
Tha word is all you need follow my lead
I'm thorough I know wit different homies barrowed through different girls
Have double barrow pro hammers
And I sold crack to sherrell and blastin
Got cleansed to save my selve and no turnin' around cause tha ??????
Cause nobody cause no one's thinkin' 'bout the babies
Cause no one's thinkin' 'bout the babies
Yeaaaaa! murdarah murdarah

Here for tha babies and I'm takin' my kids wit me
See Moses never made to tha promise land Satan come get me
He's ready to burn us all baptize is flames like Kane
Takin' tha shot to my body can enemies aim for my brain
Pray for tha devil hopin he change his ways he still laughin'
Screamin I don't know tha half but tell me wha tha fuck done happen
I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing GOD got my back remember that
And fuck me 'cause I'm on tha attack
Can't waste my time wit these niggaz my brothers are just like me
Makin' a form wit tha image but I love to scrimmage wit tha team

Where would I be without my niggas? I love my niggas/ I could do it all alone, but you're mine/ I would never bite my niggas or hide my niggas, just continue writin' my niggas, you're all my life/ My niggas, I love my niggas/ I could do it all alone, but you're mine/ I would never bite my niggas or hide my niggas, just continue writin' my niggas, you're all my life

I've been guerilla stomped, turned into a killer from that/ I seen his family, damn glad that I had my strap/ Because I've been about it, and I don't talk about it/ Shot so many niggas in the 90's it's a blessing they ain't find me/ I can floss if I wanna nigga, fuck your bitch/ Half bitch and animal, back up off me (Rowl!) so I can dip/ Fuck courteous, do you think I'm stupid?

You better believe it ain't no fairy tale/ Don't nobody pay my motherfuckin' bail, I'm goin' to jail/ With a stomach full of Hennessy, exstacy pills, and I'm a do it once/ You only live once, for real/ Fuck it, snort the cocaine, give me a drink right out the bottle/ If you give me a germ, it ain't nothin' my girl can't swallow/ Is it the first of tha month? Is this tha crossroads? You niggas is lost souls, I am the arrow stuck in the crossbow/ Suffered too many things, I did it all on my own/ Liquor was only loyal, but niggas was always gone/ Don't give me no shyste shit, don't need me no feisty bitch/ Niggas is feelin' froggish, I'll murder you with the quietness (...murder you with the quietness)"

They entertainin' now, you know what I'm sayin'? They entertainin' the street niggas, entertainin' the hood. You know what I'm sayin'? And this is safe. The whole industry and I come to bring the real nigga, that's where I come, I come to keep it real. I know, I come from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. You know what I mean? I know all of that. You know what I mean? I started in the nigga business when I was young, but that don't mean that I can't grow and own my own. And understand what I need to do as a company, as a label, and as an artist, and as a man and encompass that in one movement which is 7th Sign/ Enter the kingdom, nigga."

Album: The Gift
Title: Nobody Can Stop Me
(Bizzy)
What are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?
If you only knew, if only you knew
What are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?
If you only knew
(Nobody can stop me Damn)
Nobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now
What are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?
If you only knew
(Nobody can stop me)
What are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?
If you only knew, if you only knew.
(Bizzy)
Look at my sister sadden when my baby's mammy
Like she can't stand me
Say family be the first to turn so pity (?)
Filamina, my granny, celebrate the grammy damn
Nobody knew no plannin' was so perfect
Rollin' my (?), never forget the Bones
Trippin' on foster homes
Sayin' I wasn't manly with a scarred up soul
Why can't my skeletons understand me
What if I said I was molested
Would you look at me peel,
But I keep on bailin
And I hope I don't go to hell, stressed I will
Can I sell my bio? I was born in Ohio
Already on trial
Cause Pops said I looked too light, but mom 's just white
But I still had your smile
And look at me now gotta be proud of myself
Ain't nobody else soundin' so worried about my health
And all the while takin' care of my kids
How would they live
If I ain't hustlin', strugglin', (trustin') still keepin' Jesus a part of
Solution
He gives life in the lungs
Breath through tongue
Now here it comes
Now, here it comes; and here we go
Nobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now
Nobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now
If only you knew
What am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?
(Bizzy)
And my mama took plenty beatings
Now in her third damn marriage and man
Actin' like he cares apparently till you perish
But I was always there for you
Even though you let me leave he's beatin' the shit outta me, too
Probably why I got my bodyguards
And I'm in charge
Watch me sleep the pay is meek
But stay with me
And keep my heart collateral, we'll never break apart
Y'all didn't see me with Eazy, as a child of god
With the underdog
Never applaud once you reminisce through the ball
Movin' in Heaven's movie
Y'all, think of all that fucked-up shit you saw
Only if you knew what I was goin' through
What am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?
If only you knew
Nobody can stop me, now nobody can stop me, now
Nobody can stop me, now nobody can stop me, now
If only you knew
What am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?
(Bizzy)
Flashback to may and with the weight of the world
Can't stop my girl from steppin
Lookin' for affection in wrong places
My lesson be learned world turns
The early bird gets the worm
What if it's rotten while you rushin' for love and get burned?
Five kids and that's my only concern
I was a father before I became a man society don't comprehend
Callin' me worthless but I could purchase what they purchase
But I understand behind closed curtains you workin' on being a man
Death scares me
But Jesus will prepare me
And hopefully repair me
As god would want him to, really really
Ghetto media see the thug
Watch your sins
Then it's true you can be born again.
(Chorus) (repeat till end)
What am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?
Nobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now
Nobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now"

Yes indeed no tension, and just remember never forget to mention
God first uh, Come on, come on
Yeah, I say my preachy flow like cream stackery umbrella
Holly water to shower my skeletons and gather my Bones together
Let the world wind swirl inside of my vessel, have no association with the devil
Nah nigga, heaven is on my level, you never speak to the savior
Casting them down quietly, pick me against the irony
Television with wings, be gang bangin' the spirit
Leave me the fuck alone I've been cool since Jesus feel us
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, that's what I do when I'm on that oxygen
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, it's just like heaven it puts me on a natural high
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, just take a breath 'n' you will touch the sky
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, you know that oxygen puts me on a cloud
I'm smoother then Omarion, strong soulhjah like Gibson
Belly dancin like gypsys carrying on a mission, tipsy upon this oxygen
Snortin the toxin given, focusin on the molecules, no focus on vixen
Crack money my recipe Kentucky fried chicken
Lifted up with wings of Angels with no predictions, I'm posted up like missing dogs
Barkin towards expedition, Father Jesus keep on servin' them uh, and I won't listen
It's like revalations they took us to the beginning
And even if we loose we still winning, watch out cause Judece isn't
And time is so forgiving but some of us over did it
Goodfellas we hoodfellas you know I'm on this mission, holla back
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, that's what I do when I'm on that oxygen
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, it's just like heaven it puts me on a natural high
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, just take a breath 'n' you will touch the sky
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, you know that oxygen puts me on a cloud
All lions need a lion 'n' god don't need a thing
I sing to the most masterfull, we slaves not kings
And I bring fire from the heaven if I could not ming, I'm like a shadow
U can lighten me to tend so many beings
I said send me 12 thousand, and ruben the same thing, Benjamen get to sayin'
We just gon take the shame, slain lambs on credus
Like pigs with no breakfast, kids with no destiny
Loyal to Christ excellent mathematics and excellence
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, that's what I do when I'm on that oxygen
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, it's just like heaven it puts me on a natural high
Take a breath 'n' breeth it, just take a breath 'n' you will touch the sky

Tellin' me to be careful though so dangerous
I say let's change it
Put on your coat and call up the chauffeur
Oh, gotta leave the babies
Face to face it's goin' down
Baby lace it with some basement as (just a little)
Just a little temptation, and bury it underground
And make ya nigga feel famous and say ""Hey, fuck the pages""
Off to the freeway, anxious to play
(Damn) Baby protect my health and yourself and everyone else
And lady respect my patience from temptations
Let off all that frustration, all is well, hell, what are you waiting for?
Basic relations waitin', wakin' up in the storm
(Bizzy:8x)
Roll with me
Roll, can' t you come over?

Have you ever made love, on the freeway, the freeway?
Have you ever met your lover on the highway? Ah, ah, ah, ah

When I put you in my car (zoom, zoom) move far
We choose to lose time and, my, why there you are
When I saw that night, I had to call
It's gotta be right, it couldn't be wrong
Lookin' in far fallen and gone, lookin' at the stars, all of them, long
And on the freeway, baby believe me, gotta take it easy
Yet appeasin' to please 'em
Oh, Jesus, she's breathin' on me!
But I ain't that weak to put her to sleep
So respectful, respect your temple, subliminal
Probably pause in the distance, reminisce visual, member my car

Friday evenin' clear through the weekend we're peakin' each others secrets
No speakin', just heavy breathin'
A quarter inch from your cleavage
The reason you got me
Teasin'--be gentle
Interested sexual in a room to touch you eventual, too much potential
Lookin' at you sensual
Let you go, roll, have your space
And I'll be paper chasin' up and down, straight ghetto face
And have you ever fell in love
Just as much that you forgot about everyone just for their touch?

Roll with me
Roll, can't you come over?

Roll, come on and roll with me

'Cause I will ride for you, even fly for you, even die for you
I'm right beside ya, 'side ya, 'side ya...
Been destituted through duty, and told you we're dead
I've been arrested, put in cuffs and given the blanket to bed
I've been surrounded by the spirits and the screams in my ears
So many tears, and so many fears, for so many years
So many years, as the numbers are revolvin
Problem solvin in this crack pot, the spirit's evolvin
Prophet don't ever leave me, we are stuck in this world
We can make it if we watch it while we castin our pearls
Like hands and knees, where the struggle we face
The struggle we taste, a waste of the love in this place
What a disgrace, beg the Lord forgiveness and salvation
Emancipation Proclamation, revelation for sure
In the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, amen
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen
Play it again Sam, play it again Sam...

Melody over felony, baby boy, I know it's spiritual
I forgive you 'cause I know that this was out of control
Out of your mind, out of your body, away from your soul
The tote baby is heavy, the level of your waters' maximum
Baby don't drown, it's so profound so be watchin your actions
Everybody's changin rearrangin they actin' strange
And I'ma keep it real life and not real trife, I don't even play no games
And, I remain with the spirit, pick it up to hear
Tell 'em to drink but don't be a drunk, you better be careful in here
So many tears, wishin I could help from the side
The spiritual cot, feelin' like you love me not
You'd love me to rot, pop snap crackle and drop
Give me the strength to stomach down the salami

Some say it's a miracle, some, don't wanna buy it
And some say it's imperial, baby don't even try it
Still cryin, and I'm feelin' like we constantly dyin'
Pick it up, the resurrection baby, my name's Bryon
Through the fire, through the wire, God almighty the Lord
Ain't no adultery, cerebrums keep your flame in the swords
Praise the Lord, Father God, Baby Jesus, His Son

It's one true God, we children and we come in as babes
And of course don't start {?} crazed and they're jealous and I feel abraised
Seized up, and are tazed, and they both get shaved
Feelin' the heart, of the soldier, child of God, made Jesus
Laid back, I'm anxious, and the danger it's around
Better be quiet, I gotta pay attention to when I hit that sound

Soldiers soldiers, represent the one, we represent the one
We are the soldiers soldiers, oh we represent the one
Under surveillance, am I paranoid?
Never, I never need duckin the enemy off in evil territory
So why they comin' off to bust on me
I got my homie out of the way, I think my lady got a crush on me
Somebody put the finger hush on me
Never put a plug in me, I'm a shake that dust off me
I got some mush on me, that was just that lust on me
But if you're, lovin' me it's just a, plus on me
I'm tellin' 'em only God judges me, Jesus Christ the savior
Bow down to the Lord, blow the trumpet on 'em major
Me no need no cell phone, me no need no pager
But we got some rules we gotta follow in the course of danger
But me no sign nothing unless it feel righteous
That's right just no pressure, play 'em, enlighten 'em
I'd rather have a palm tree, and a Long Island iced tea
And everyone can be happy and then, heheh
We are the solders soldiers
Oh we represent the one, we represent the one
We are the soldiers soldiers
And tell 'em the war has just begun
The war has just begun! Soldiers soldiers
Represent the one, we represent the one

Need to be reared out quickly, comin' out to the storm
And it's quickly I spit war, gettin' it calm now
Spittin' it war now, you ain't even seen no wild child
Get 'em up from the free seagull and fowl
And the flocks of birds of foul, I see 'em flyin around
And of course they take the wide path, homicide
Now who the motherfuckin soldier with the stubble now?
With the crowns now, beatin' 'em down, baby we gonna
And when we come around, we never gonna be beat
We deep in the streets, and Heavenly with the one
Yes we represent it, and the war has just begun

See it's the thug, thuggish ruggish, give me some bud
I'm out on the way to go get me some love
Stuck in the part where I put up the cup, don't
What about the slopes, tryin' a get dangerous
We're nothin' but crumbs, they gave me the tomb
And heavenly Father all over your son
The people are part of ya, never be found
But what was it for, tellin' my people to point to the guns
And what did the fools finally see who really be ridin'
Look at the war and here it come
I'm the beginning and the ending, what are we spending
Watch your paper, gospel gangstas walkin' in churches
Don't search us, they tyrin' to escape though
Monotony and a monopoly, gotta get ready to put us a chair
Rott there, get in the car, Day's of our Lives oh well
I'm from the best, the sick of the best
The sicker the test, will settle for less, so Bizzy the Kid
The best... let me get this, that we feelin' depressed
How many times we gather our rest, so why do they cuss
My lips are clear, Lord know's I'm not ugly
And how many times we gather our rest, so why do they cuss

No wonder why nigga, I'm a hard workin' horse
Keep my grammy on a mantle, fuck puttin' it in a source

And if rap was a study, you would need you a course
I'm a rap till my voice gone, probably till I lose it
But y'all can't do it, duplicate my music
Listen till they cruisin', haters be refusin'
They bitches want to listen to it
But they gotta be true with it
Get bucked knuckler, act a foo' with it

Feelin' the breeze, smokin' and chokin' that reefer dog
I'm needin' my trees (ha, ha--ha, ha)
Windows down, system on blast, feelin' the breeze
Eyes on my rearview, watch my back for the police
The homi's say watch my back for enemies
Touch your back, the hennesey stayin strass my remedy
Catch me dippin' through the streets
Givin' a fuck, runnin' them stoplights
Swerve it to the left, and I swing it to the right
I'm a hard switchin' lane, scrapin' bumpers and all
All eyes on me whenever I'm rotatin' white walls
And as soon as night falls
I let them hundred spokes crawl
Straight dippin' through the city
With my rider's and dogs
It's Mr. Criminal puttin' it down
With the homi's from Bone Thugs
And these hater's get flossed on
These bitches get no love

Goin' insane and It's rainin' bloody murder, murder
Chillin' in the gun range servin' on the corner, corner, chop, chop
Watch for the po po, drop top switches on the lo lo

Make more hot tips like off in Dodge City

And I'm sure to get my thug on, ho

Why they gotta stay and make me faint?
War paint, walk the plank
Fuck the bass smokin' hay
Me, I ain't no joke
And then some more dope then you'd ever know
E-I-L-O, hello
When I'm all by myself let it go, let it go, let it go
Rollin' with my posse your way, hell no
Draped in Versace got me on lock
Did they rock the bells and play
Straight from the glock, glock love block later tears away
And consequences got me drinkin' free, yes I'll pay
And that's a pain 'cause I was stuck in a rutt, you'd say
How do we stay in the war zone

Haven't you heard? Runnin' in 90s on one hundred and twenty third
T-Rock done got shot, and I got, to find a murderer with a double edge pump, a church killer don't worship and when the cops got bored
Fillin for baby boy showin up for the unsolved, deployed
Little Eazy leave me and Wally, damn, little Angel, she was so small
Grippin the bottle of gasoline and the alcohol was killin' Doti
Havin' a ball... but I'm still rollin' through the shore
Pray for redemption
Runaway slaves, you house nigga
Rollin' with plantations on full of a fraction, and grab your crouch nigga
I don't give a fuck (Nigga what you niggas wanna get fucked up?) nigga
We gettin' pumped in St. Luce, forgettin my thugs now who do you trust? (God)
Ante up and bust my gun
Thuggin' and bum rush the punks
Runnin' a muck from dusk to dawn
Money for blood, stop, till they pump
But it walkin' off, slow
It show us I got nuts
Come to the light, then to the darkness
Glance at BB, baby

Literally possessed, I got veins poppin' out my neck
With original thugs and a Lexus checklist
Got 'em all breathless
Than I suggest you'd ask magic
For The Rabbit's strategy, tragic when they capture me
When the cops search the auto anyone cop pleas, indeed
Hit 'em with blasphemy and they cashin in on his tragedy
You see, I'm sorta like Dorothy, but I'm a soldier, the wickedest witch in the west can't have me
Fuck the shoe, look barefoot, roll over Todo, there put
Put a stick in the mouth, and I might go quiet as a mouse
Never did lie, ready and green
Never so loud, quiet indeed
Remember the man be attend by the Ouijia
Yellow Brick Road was greetin the king
Gotta take chances
What?!? I'm back in Kansas

Now I clack back my heels and the d-low, he-he-he seein things (Seein things)

Better than God devise realize you can end up bigger
But my niggas in the middle ballin and we won't stop
The foul sinnin the killin' now
And then nobody gets in the middle together
And they tell the nigga it good to be back
From prison but don't nobody feel him but them niggas around the globe
And the mission was money was gold
Everyone nutty when money because he was out of the gully
With nothin' but ugly souls better make us and touch
No one will touch me one wait till they ruff enough
Got him at last but I just corrupt
I don't even erupt
Creep on ah come up, what up
Trapped in a rapture the trumpets pumpin tellin' me somethin'
Snatch you we havin' a blast you tatterd like cattle
And medalion diamonds in the gallo

Out of the battlefield...

Straight veryly, and in the spiritual form, only God split so, and the spirit reborn
But baby still dancin
I see the bitches tryin' to stop me, never roll with a plan, can't copy, gimme

105,So What Cha' Sayin',2006,The Story (2006),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"Man I could never be anti any-fuckin-thing man
I ain't even gon' lie to you man
Live and direct from the motherfuckin battle station
I mean, how in the fuck, you gon' see somethin' beautiful
Youknowmsayin, to the eye to the heart to the mind to the soul
And I really understand what you lookin' at
Praise God for ev-erything
There is only one true God
And you need to get those wicked members up off of him...
(Come to us, tell me what'cha say love, tell me what'cha sayin')
Only him to come to us, come to us
Tell me what'cha sayin' love, tell me what'cha sayin'
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what, tell me what
Come to us, come to us
Tell me what'cha sayin' love, tell me what'cha sayin'
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what, tell me what
When you come to us, come to us, tell me what'cha sayin' love
Tell me what'cha sayin', tell me what, tell me what, tell me what'cha sayin'
Come to us, come to us, tell me what'cha sayin' love
Tell me what'cha sayin', tell me what, tell me what, tell me what
Tell me what, just come to us
Walk through the valley, of the shadow of death, flesh and blood
Evil keep questionin us, we bust, lay back in the cut
Sinister minded blinded, soon as they find it tossed in diamonds
Nibble that tree of science and they think that they laughin' at Bryon
Better know that they gon' keep on tryin'
And whatever they think that they sellin there won't be no buyin
From Earth, to planet Orion
From birth, I twist in the stomach from hella spices like cheyenne
Quick, hit 'em with trifectas, the fruit of bad nectars dyin'
'Cause I am, what I am changed, switch it up like OutKast
Everybody thought that Andre was crazy, he get a bypass?
Time trickle like hourglass, who ready to ride?
What? Quit snitchin, I know that it's cold outside
And whether we're cold or not, killin' though we bold outside
I'd rather not take a bath, if feelin' all dirty inside
But it's pretty inside, look at all them girlies inside
So what, we here in a mission and our mission ain't blind
For all of that wicked wisdom they put in our minds
Go to Akron without a map, walk the streets, look for the rabbi
While sippin on this mai-tai
Talk to religious figures while lookin' in at the skyline
I worship no gravin image it's bye-bye
God go where he wanna go, let you know what he wants you to know
You know, how Jesus role, yo' heart, yo' mind, yo' soul
Talkin' to the scriptures where all of the saints will see to that
Weeded up, but of course my people, they don't believe in that
Leanin back, demons in a dream and holdin' my semen back
Salty like Sodom watchin Gamorra, check yo' almanac
Never had no friends and if I did will they left
They so scared, for who to be crucified, soon gon' lose yo' breath
Yep, get up get out since you got doubt, lumpy potatoes that's on the couch
Feelin' offended, speak your mouth (mouth)
They don't want none
In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit amen
In the name of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ amen
It's only one true God in full effect
That's how we do this shit, wreck shop
No adultery baby only one, only one
Togetherness, huh, huh
Only one, only one, only one
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no adultery watch yourself
They comin' at you, they comin' at you fast
That's the POLICE right there baby
They comin' at you fast
Only him to come to us, come to us
Tell me what'cha sayin' love, tell me what'cha sayin'
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what, tell me what
Come to us, come to us
Tell me what'cha sayin' love, tell me what'cha sayin'
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what, tell me what
When you come to us, come to us, tell me what'cha sayin' love
Tell me what'cha sayin', tell me what, tell me what, tell me what'cha sayin'
Come to us, come to us, tell me what'cha sayin' love
Tell me what'cha sayin', tell me what, tell me what, tell me what
Tell me what, just come to us"

Loyalty bring royalty and prison over in the coil

Sparkin off the highest flights
And project buildings blastin civilians
But skull-white from cycles of the psycho children
Millions in the revenue, what we seek in these avenues
Steady breakin down crumbs for the Royal Crown
Amongst animals, to the half of you
Understand the mindstate of the most official

Burnin up your whole block, lord forgive them they no not
Fuck a cop. with the blood clot, buck 'em till they holla

But when enough is enough, and it's tough
Throughout the roughest where the red wolves huff and they puff
Hey little Bizzy keep they head strong, cry now, can't even cuff
You understand it ain't no question, come up
What is the purpose of the physical lust? So the barricade can bust

Believe in the Lord, and the laws of the Lord
And when you ride for the cause, keep an eye on the cause
You ever lose sight, and you blind as a mole
We must decide if they rise, decide if they fall
Alive with the light, you can shine on 'em all
We all designed to be strong, sometimes we'll be right
And sometimes we'll be wrong, we must weather the storm
It's the design of it all, we'll never know it all
Just love one another and honor father and mother
When you kind you'll see it grow, with hate you'll never know
It's crawled up outta the gutter, the thoughts the spirit help us
When you find you're in a hole, you search you're inner soul
You search to get the truth, and you find you're way to go
It's the design of it all, you'll find what it means
A struggle to succeed when life is like a dream
That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry)
From the thunder and rain, just look into my eyes
That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry)
The world is a ghetto, we gots to stay alive

We're hoping for change and puffin' on some?
That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry)

So wipe the tears with a sleave, and just 'cause you believe
One day you gon have what you want, what you gonna be
When the winds don't blow, and God don't make mo'
Keep an eye on the stone, and oh, just remember
The world gets dark, and you carry your heart
Just open up your opens eyes, and insipre the whole art
From the birds to the bees, the snakes and the trees
The lakes and the sea, the brakes in the sea
And when the tide ship down, and nobodies around
Ain't nothing to be found, and uh... I don't make a sound
No nobody and no preasance and yes you're ? the essance
Of creation in the making and the patiance of the Satans
Ever blessings queen, message to a king, and a gift to a prince
Like a gift to a ring, for the love of a slave
Yes Adam and Eve, a slave that loved God before she bit the tree

From the thunder and rain, just look into my eyes
That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry)
The world is a ghetto, we gots to stay alive
That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry)
We're hoping for change and puffin' on some?
That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry)
Bizzy is back, only the strong survive
If you do then you ?, you don't then you?
You ever been in that situation without a plan?
And if you tried and you can't
Just get up out the streets, and hustle to get your money
And make sure that you be that
I go to church and see sin, get punched in the chin
And a brother saves his brother, you'll never do it again
And the child drinking Hen, and you're mad at his dad
I'm in the army just to keep this whole world in harmony
It ain't nothing like Shaq, whose dad walked out
Who never knew he'd grow and ride and make it out
It's like God and the sun, a flower and a bun
A tower and a plane, that never destroyed none
It's the design of it all, the time of it all
The crime of it all, and the life of it all
Pick up your eyes to the sky, and never ask why
You really know the answers and I
That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry)
From the thunder and rain, just look into my eyes
That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry)
The world is a ghetto, we gots to stay alive
That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry)
We're hoping for change and puffin' on some?
That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry)

And I don't blame nothin', surround as we're surrounded and trapped
Call up the police that's bullshit, it's pulpit in fact

Comin' up out that limo pockets swollen payin' attention to everything I say
Open up the mind with a prayer, as I worship the Lord Jesus

Verse One
Nigga we represent the planet get schizophrenic 'n' panic
Maybe the past would understand
If they'd get off there ass and mannage
How do you manage?
Paranoid, don't even trust my boyz
Watch for the plot and deploy envoys
Scopin like a dope fiend
But I'm smokin' in the alleyz
With these ghetto guns and erase my funds
Watts niggas in Cali take bullets to the brain
Still rowdy, Jesus really never died
You crucified mutual suicide, who am I?
Local with vocals going coast to coast
Heaven'll move me right fo sho
Deception weather my brethren
But sunny days when they parlay
Get killed when they get to steppin
Member the weapon's close
And the doctor said
I need time to myself on the ocean
Those frivolous thoughts
But I'm brought up of this independent
Caught up sever relentless
Evil intentions nobody knows him
Even the henchmen, warrior, poet,
Never did mention
I love my lady rebel
We can get this stroke on, we can get this stroke on,
And we can get this stroke on, and we can get this stroke on.
Verse Two
We keepin' the light on at Ruthless and
I ain't fuckin' the boss
Lookin' at me sexy
Take your clothes off
But my dick'll go soft!
Never mix business with your sickness
Enemy see me flipin in the picnic
With your lil' divide and conquer
But my sister was ready to bomb her!
Get off the dizznik and off my voice
Me and my boyz
Give us a choice
How could you ever tell Sony that I was the
Only one making noise
Ain't it a breech of trust
Look in the gutter, unh, never judge yo book
By it's cover word to the motherfucka
I... I didn't stutter but what if I lost it and
Came in the office and nobody noticed
With liquid explosive on top of Versace
Clothes give up the ghost
Krayzie's Picasso, lil' Layzie like Caesar,
Stacks like lil' Pesi N Casino and
Wish don't give a fuck! O
I'm Gambino -n- the walkin' dead
Woke up on the wrong side of the bed
Bible of survival, Triple six rivals, triple six rivals
Member you said I read but rode with
Killas, Niggas that'll bust in tha club you don't
Feels us strapped in the bed
Strapped pickin' up the kids in the realist,
The realist, the realist, the realist.
Verse Three
It'll make your body shake when it's too late soon as
You flipped off the safety baby this we all day
Don't tell me you crazy
Will they sell me? Hell Naw!
For the reason this weepin widow be the demon
So cheap and at least she go peepin go peep deep
Dead in yo pockets no sleep
Rollin' with my crucifix Lucifer usually uses
The rule of these wicked tricks in the school
Of these ghetto games and the fool of this bitch mist
I say shame, shame, shame.
Enemies attacking me
Actually I'm in the grain ask Mr. Majesty
These casualties well they're passin me by
But I hear death callin when it's so cold in the room
Who's stalling better come after me
We say fuck y'all
All in the battle we, battle we, battle we.

Evil never had no rhythm, man, the Devils can't dance
Got three pairs of pants

Whether chicken or ham, we gon' use the same grease
Each second is a struggle, beg, borrow or hustle
Yeah, scufflin' money just try to stay out of trouble

I'll sell 'em somethin' that'll get they heart to pumpin',
And help the youth!
Hangin' in the graveyard, everybody's playin' hard
Satan's on a mission to get us
I hope that nobody with us, and given us slave ways
Ruthless got us on fifty dollars a day
One hundred and ninety thousand I guess platinum don't pay
Can I please get some mo' money?
Somebody could buy my way cause shit the rent's due
Glad I got ghetto credit
Don't let the industry pimp you, pimp you, pimp you
As time keep passin' us by in my community
Wathcin' the children die
Bitch made police, and the brutality
Prozac and Ritalin, that ain't what we need
And wonder why our children keep smokin' weed
(Bizzy)
Babies born with AIDS, and with ???? they hording the vaccine
Black helicopter rain on em, I'm gainin' on em
Maintain the main thang on em, shame on em
But another victim died of vain for em, slain
Two hundred and fifty crashed in the plane
And the only thing that survived was the black box
They frame the black cops
Slang crack rock
Wannabe Hot Boyz, so he gon' make the block hot, block hot
They wanna see me sasquash
Pull out my glock, cocked, and pop pop!
Go to jail don't nobody send you mail
Hell, I'm ridin' till these wheels fall off
Or they can take it to the chop shop
Shut up, I'm shinnin' on you bustas!
What!?
Ready to hustle get your struggle on, no!
When you wanna double up, you keep fuckin' up!
Your mind's gone, time's gone, everybody's runnin' amuck
They say that lesbians is sick
But they just do wanna fuck
As time keep passin' us by in my community
Wathcin' the children die
Bitch made police, and the brutality
Prozac and Ritalin, that ain't what we need
And wonder why our children keep smokin' weed"

Better getcha paper, man
Don't try ta hustle meh
I ain't no dummy, man
Gonna getcha...
Gonna getcha...
Gonna getcha...
My inspiration enlights this vision, smokin' this purple
This sticky icky is the medicine that it didn't on commercials
The cyclical nature of niggaz gotten me by this oracle
Documented for planted a wagon
Draggin historical like morbital, suspended in space
Rappin' in circles
We ain't winnin' but we is as crazy as fuck
Upclose and personal, preminitions of the gloriest
Dated, we'll be victorious, so many different choices
These fake niggaz is poisonous
Damn I need ta kill the noises
Heaven's gonna rolls Royces
But the Posse is just so boisterous
And noises only the poisonous
Hollywood couples swingin' and the people you won't believe
Got woman that are weedin with women
And Adam is sleeping with Steve
It's complicated to me
If it's complicated to see and it's complicated to love
Then it's complicated to be, and if it's complicated to be
And they confiscated the key
When coke down in Columbia only costs you a 'G'
Cocksuckers...
Outta the Seven Sector conservativecy regime
Where the Panthers they don't have knowledge they needed to fully achieve
The prophet, he is giving me structures for Armaggedon 'cause it's coming
The Seven Signers are beside me, be runnin' to the war-drummin
The general was fully commmitted, without a reason they want me to preach the love
Are you crazy?
It's killin' season, I'm bleedin all over the speaker
My spirit is gettin' much stronger
Look, the enemy is gettin' much weaker
It's Bizzy the Kid, that's demonic
Revelations and horses, Double-X-Lin' the sources, Battlin the darker forces
They assinated my leader
And Lil Capo we need to kill in harmony from heaven

Deep in the ghetto, the Lord is in charge
Swords comin' out of my mouth, ready can't block the barrage
I'm still (dancin; on the side of the blanche)? of the road
On the rise like dough, it's fully approach the set for sure
I don't wan't no problems, problems, comin' at me fast as a bullet
Even a missile, right to the the grizzle, pain sizzlin' my mullet
God, do with it told, keepin' the fighting steady at minimum, for sure
I better listen to the granddad, baby, only God knows
Do what it do, look at the... as others would do to you
Do what it do,.. speech impedement, keepin' it true
Comin' with proof, automatic heat, with the static, gotta have it in the battle,
Trippin' in my boots, movin' in the roof, what I gotta do?
Pretty much what I told you, hey
One for the money, one for my dunny
I'm a move it like officer gunnin' on the block with Christ
Spit crack on these dummies, with the four winds tellin' me to do my thang, hunny
Keepin' it rockin', hoppin' out of the truck
And getcha bucks, and we stuck in this city, idiots signed with a touch
And a crime, with a rush, come up don't show your nuts
On a line full of souls and spirits, can't be too much
And to die for the kings you teach to be just
On the minds, gotta preach, divine and rugged rough
So we calm in the mountain, wanted the youth; no lust
Let me shine, annunciation, pronouciation for your love
Hoppin the fences, cuttin' my leg, goin' dutch, what
I'm a get a drink before I leave out in these cuffs, cuffs
I sit in the county, ready to bail me out, what, what
They still ain't paid the bounty, me and my lawyer gettin' crushed
It's lucky when they stopped me in Vegas, and then they come up
But I'm trusty, loyal, and faithful like angels in the dust
Tellin' em', love me and leave me, BB be headin' towards the shhh
Me and my body, on the the side, we ride, the tribe is up
Headed for destinations, peoples hallucinations in the nation
Gravity, and dimensions, comin' aboard the battle station
Facin' many adversities, horses, Kentucky Derbys
Herses and dead bodies, and worse when it comes early
Man, I'm dirty, made pretty through weakness, I'm tellin' you briefly
Hey, I don't want no beef, I pray; Allah, please keep me
To the people, feed me, secretly, in the G way
Leeway (sp?), rollin' on the freeway, leave me
Please me, take me to heaven, breathin' with Jesus
He quick, with telekinises, don't believe me? go breezy
Deem it- hey, hey, I don't know what to say
Huh, let's honour the lord, and that's the only way
Gotta go, flow, ready to gotta go to work for sure
Yo, hustle to be a pro, stack paper and get your flow
Whatever it takes...
You better go keep it strong
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Praise God"

My nigga, that's henessey!
Factions of my body leak into a piece
Turning demons to giggling
Get him some Remy
Now I'm tweaking, ecstacy'd out every weekend
Well why don't you try some PCP?
But the weed was still decent
Aww, shit he's just about seasoned
My liver won't give it up
Your blood stream is immune
Ate up an ounce of toxic mushrooms
Here you need some orange juice
OJ! I hate him (you what?)
But fuck that and pop you one of these valiums I could

Satan desciples, he's coming to get you very soon
He can come in the form of drugs

Hey rejoice!
I know where we can get some napalm
My sister's baby's daddy's getting the bomb first
Did you hit up my babies' moms?
Now roll up another L!
I love it when niggas go out with a bang
Throw my thangs!
Naw baby, blow out his fucking brains!
I lit up a cigarette, look innocent 'cause we're passing 4th District
Double glock, stick it out that window ready to start some shit!
Hit that, trippin' out flippin' out, getting off, getting out
Fuck em!
Baby calm down, the law's right behind you
I'm a buck em, stop the car!
Turn around and bust em, it didn't even stop 'em

Split personality, -ality, -ality. Split personality, -ality, -ality. I'm in reality. [Foward march.] Waitin' for warfare. Waitin' for warfare, warfare, warfare, warfare. My army, marchin' factions, regime takin' over my body it seems. Regime, regime. [Forward march.]
Bizzy:
Hear the eruption when I'm pumpin and bustin', gotta give a concussion. Lovin' the lust and plus to touch me, rush me, too much, you must be out of your mind. Trust me, I'm the nigga dumpin', tell 'em lovely. All the way from the Clair to the PO and down '71 we on to the C.O. and fuckin' with the B-O-N-E hit the floor and go, and again we hit the door.
Capo:
Ammo explode, rappin' in platinum, Capo ballin' out of control. Provoked
Emotions, devotion, capture bankroll, behold the unknown treasure. Cherish your soul precious as solid gold roses thrown over decomposed bodies froze, expose those who chose to impose sleep. Deceased, buried six feet deep beneath hollow stone, tragedy prolong memories, harmony, sing another sad song. Unsolved mysteries involve society. Only strong minds survive holocaust victims soft in our life die off. The broke caught slippin', steppin' in deep shit, broke busta off ignorance lost. Runnin' because the pussy wish he had some balls to brawl with me us heartless hennessy havin' a tendency to empy cartriges off on enemy targets .Regardless of felony charges still spittin' ammunition, till mission accomplished.

And don't deceive me, please, get up off your knees, I'm all about business, ask Animal. I ain't your victim and a witness to the sickness written. Did I piss you off? On a mission in the midst of the demons bankin' off my voice and makin' my choices. She don't even know me and I'm kickin' and screamin' tryin' to get out my dreams, at least to keep me breathin'. Even poisoned the noise, got me coverin' my ears, and save my tears for years, just for the joy. But I told ya boy, not today, I gotta get my paper.And will the rapist pull my plug and fuck the thug? Hell yeah, nigga, no love. I thought you knew and nigga don't shove 'cause I'm like, nigga what? I'll fuck you up you know the rules. Regime takin' over my bod
Y it seems. Waitin' for warfare. I can smell your wicked rigormortis a mile
From the morgue. The scorn in your soul may tell you to humiliate your enemies. Have not you read the Art of War? Absent-minded to the enduring. Pouring your cup of damnation in the midst of my world. You gotta be out of your monkey-ass mind. No more will the look of Medusa seduce the predecessors and entrepreneurs.
Capo:
Retaliation, I can taste temptation. Itchin', instigatin' allegations.
Undertakin' sacred assassinations. Dead presidents, weapons, and nations.
Independence foresaken. Revelations in the making. Bitch-made niggas breakin'. Separate by segregation. Hatred they motivation. No relation in this congregation. Load weapons [B, pass me a clip!] trigger detonations. Bullet penetrate, men break, strain. Pain and frustration. Abstain. Chain-reaction tribulations. Safe to say you can't escape disaster when messin' with a master. Unmask the Ripsta's little riddler, nigga gon' be killas.
Bizzy:
Gotta get you more money, come on my little brother. And I brung him. Thug on. I got him fuckin' with the revolution all on the retribution and execution. Shootin', let 'em, do 'em. Get gone, done made a bomb bond. None of y'all pinned my strategize. I heard Bizzy's fried, I heard Bizzy died, but the word from Bryon: Surprise, I'm still alive with a militant mind. Gotta hit it, will die in a minute, did he feel it? Well then get it. Rewind, you just trippin' on a nigga tryin' to shine, but I'm'a get mine and I ain't lyin'. Nigga every time I sign the dotted line it's for the riot. Nigga what you want to do and I ain't dyin' without you in the silence will kill ya, it's the quiet ones who that might peel ya. On the realer, on the lonely and I see that you're phoney, nobdy. Phone me
And surely I'm out the door and don't you come for me.And it's still fuck Paul McCartney for sure, let it go. I know and boy I will enjoy a little toe to toe, but no, you'd probably involve the po po and tell them that you went to jail with Bizzy Bone. It's on in the C.O."

Wanted to conquer the competent, never be pompous
Stay dominant, givin' 'em doves and
In the name of the Father, the Son
And the Holy Spirit, feelin' the love
And the beauty is real, beautiful field
Remember thou shalt not kill, the brother you're near
Whenever you need me I'm never exceeding
The beautiful blessings and beautiful lessings
I'm never gon' stress, I'm not here to impress 'em

Wont reimburse you, except wit shots that'll hurt you
Glocks that'll murk you, shoulda never crept after curfew

Sweakin like earl manigo baby its understandable
I'm droppin' techs, fresh out the joint and still on a short chain
Nigga when I'm off ima purchase a pound 'n' blow my brain

Addicted Pothead, consumin pounds of sticky, pass it around
Have the entire crowd lifted like cheech and chong
Up in smoke, blown away, gazin trippin' off shroomies
Hallucinatin amongst ??? settle for goofy ass
Ever since then drug substance straight blaze the weed
Contemplate money schemes, currency value increase
Gorillas get sorted when they see a brother flossin his brand new lexo land cruiser
And they still leasin a 2 door honda accord (oh lord)
Resident neighbours scared, terrorise the suburbs
Freaky parties in till 5 o clock in the mornin, early crack of dawn
Kick every bitch out my house, say pussy come pussy go
Spend quality time, faithful to mary jane
Lifted always stay high
Soon as my chronic supply run low
Back to the weed spot purchase sum mo, lets go
Get Money!, Pass the reefer smoke it too.
Its Lovely!, Wake up the 1st thing that I do.

Little child from the Nile, still a juvenile
And you know you love my motherfuckin style
I'd rather be alone then be a little {?} now
The crowd in a frenzy, the envious around
Before I pass out, I'm so profound (I don't fuck around)
(Bizzy Bone)
Give me the bump bump, baby let's get crunk
I run up in your spot, and fuck it up, you know
And you know it's how I feel, baby it's really real
Don't try to change my words, you know that this how I feel
And every need worked out, every need will kneel
Tell him to shut his fuckin' mouth, the don is in the field
God is the greatest, Jesus Christ I rise
Against the wicked demons of Cleveland, the Lord up top
(Bizzy Bone)
Bringin' it to the front, I don't mean to be blunt
I don't mean to be crass, I don't mean to be brass
I don't mean to beat ass, I don't mean to be fast
I don't mean to be last, and I don't mean to be a mess
Spontaneous, in the best way
Search for the heart, in a test way
This is the real deal Holyfield, baby feel, keep it real
How do you feel, how do I feel, precious metal of steel
One time"

135,What Have I Learned,2008,A Song For You (2008),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"Yeah, some people wonder, you know, well they say: ""what have you learned""?
And to your left, your right, your left, your right
It's to your left, your right, your left, your right
To your left, your right, your left, march with me!
It's to your left, your right, your left, your right (x4)
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms
What have I learned?
It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern
See the good in the ones that have burned
And you never got all that you've earned
Don't interrupt me, I speak to the lord
Heavenly choir, now we are in Church
In the temple, we cleaning the mental; the evil it lurks
Coming up off of on the corner, with dirtier thoughts
Here's thirty seconds to start
They slither like worms, they jealous of purity
Jealous of people in love;
They caught on a women, destroy the connection, they see that you happy
And here come the scrubs, I'm tellin' you bruh
They down with the serpent to get in their mind
Believe the people who witness the Christ
Look at my life, and now they blind
Nobody to find, they sellin' their souls without even knowing I catch em'
Without definitions, and give 'em reditions of scriptures and shit,
I keep walking knowin' is mine
I walk and I shine in the sublime, gotta ward of all the demons
Outta my thought, they caught, they gone I tell 'em sit back and wake em',
Literally thuggin', just come in and clog up their mind
What have I learned? What have I learned?
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms
What have I learned?
It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern
See the good in the ones that have burned
And you never got all that you've earned
Don't interrupt me, I speak to the lord
Heavenly choir, now we are in Church
With a bounty on my head, and the county holdin' my mind
Angels grippin' my spine, dear lord, these are scandalous times
We livin' in revelations, nation against nation
Blood in the hood on the boat like Haitians
Me and little brother, we are runnin' for salvation
Everyday, comin' and facing temptation
Casin' joints, with the base and the point, the place with a dutch
Little joy, little souljah boy, you better keep your boys with no noise, no voice, and? no choice
Runnin', we stop, you better watch the cops, you better get off the block
You mean to tell me that motherfuckers is still sellin' rocks?
And they mob with the glock, and they nod... Allah
Who do you think you are? Dead in the heart
Dead man walking, man don't even start
A tear for the above, but we thuggin' in the park
Another? on the porch with a sawed of shotgun, let it spark, on the multitude, is that all you got?
Trying to shock the dude, and give him... in his heart
And laugh at him fast like... and the ark
Rubbin' the eye, you better hold that stash
Weeded out, and baby, even now
A poor child in the hood, no hood, no doubt, no wood, no mort, no dream, no style
Ambulances, coroners, and some that never know no doors
Brain cartiledge up on that floor, it's one friend, please, let me tell you one more
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms
What have I learned?
It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern
See the good in the ones that have burned
And you never got all that you've earned
Don't interrupt me, I speak to the lord
Heavenly choir, now we are in Church
Grind in the days in a maze
Amazed with the phase in the plague of a homeboy blazed
Now the homeboy slayed in the streets, so crazed
Know that he prayed, that shit is played
It's ok, it's all right
Spirit will be better when you see that light
When you see that flight
And Allah provide, perfections, let's go take a ride
Loadin' up clips, hollow tips, ready for murder, swallow this
Follow this, model this; with death, you don't have to swallow shit
When it's bottled up and it tastes like piss
Ridin' on up...
... With the hurt and pain, but the hurt remains
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms
What have I learned?
It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern
See the good in the ones that have burned
And you never got all that you've earned
Don't interrupt me, I speak to the lord
Heavenly choir, now we are in Church"

Representing the one forever and ever and ever
We come to you from another dream
From another time, another station (it is only one true God)
Praise God in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit
(Could you tell meeeee)
(Chorus: Bizzy Bone)
Could you tell me what you see, you see, you see, you see
I can read yo' mind baby (I can read your mind) I can read your miiiiind
Hahaha; could you tell me where we'll be, we'll be, we'll be, we'll be
I can read yo' mind baby (I can read your mind)
I can read your, and I can read your mind (I can read your miiiiind)
(Bizzy Bone:)
Most immaculate, elegant, pick up a piece of paper
Put ya Pamper on; scamper run, militant get ya Panther on
The crooked of tryin' to pull a caper, 'cause they wanted a vision
Now it's honey-coated for the dumb shit; evil don't run shit
Wanna see the picture for flesh and desire sentencing
The essence to the fire and purge, deeper inside ya
Reaper be right behind ya, keep it movin be blessed
It's the test, only the best, beautiful love, yes!
Can't believe they wanna hold a brother back like this
God provide, ride through the pine without a dime
Baby think it's a crime, and she always get pissed
Get ya ego out the way, baby listen to this
I got a problem with racism, placism, hatorism
Gatorism, prejudice, demons all in the way
They don't even ask you for identification, what did he say?
Get ya money little homie, they'll never know you're okay
(Bizzy Bone:)
Listenin to bullshit, knockin' on wood
Praise God don't get it misunderstood
While I was rollin' through the hood
Boulevardio, you should +Let Me Love You+
Like you was listenin to Mario, it seems that I can't budge you
But those crooked thoughts they don't harm me though, shake that, shake that
Money-maker tryin' to get the paper blamin poppa for everything
Somebody tell me who put the food on the motherfuckin, table
Pumpin up because the fuckin' humans actin' able
Lamb, cram to understand plan, baby boy like Clark Gable
Gone with the wind, with a full confession like Conseco
Now all of the rest of the baseball players step up
Glory be the god of the name of our lord and savior - Jesus Christ
Ain't no weapon formed against us will prosper
Send the streets they needed medicine, and God'll send a doctor
Gon' break 'em off real proper
Even though they really don't want you to prosper
So now you judge me, and only God love me - ah!
(Bizzy Bone:)
It ain't a question or a notion, commotion it'll just happen
Words written but we freestyle rappin'
Keepin' it movin and we groovin in the spirit for show
Bringin' the light into a halt, and we caught, and it stop like whoa
Don't turn around, no rebirth in the salt, nigga let's roll
Baby don't turn around but she's persisted to go, mmm
Purified clean, write it in chalk, don't even talk
Let's concentrate on the mission little baby walk
Some say it's a weapon, the weapon of weapon of mass destruction
Of body combustin trust if it come outside
See it's real in the battlefield, plenty fuckin' battle scars
Switchin rides, switchin cars diggin E, peep the stars
Where we walk in the streets bad feet keep stallin
Bad wanna come me way, hey, he gon' keep talkin'
And they wonder who, who's tellin' 'em dodgin, God will provide the logic
Get the action in that you need through any ya problems, woo
Now if you accept it and you accepted just know that you're really respected
And the love that we have collected through the pressure of presence
See he's a present, and it's comin' from my heart in it's essence
These words we meshin together for further evidence of the lessons
Are you likin what you feelin'? Nah, I think I feel it
Not to be Marvin Gaye, but baby you need some +Healing+
So we take it to the tabernacle then pass that feelin'
Touch millions with the gifted that the father is willin'
Look at ya people with some movement as we bond lookin' improvin
That's the love you always enjoy to enlighten bein void
Gettin' noid stay poised it's comin', don't you feel it?
You got it? I know you got it, you got it, I see you chillin'
One love"

Ha ha ha ha, and it's on
Once again it's on, Bizzy the Kid
The Midwest Cowboy, in the place to be
Holla at your boy
When I see-ee, I see-ee, who I be (who I be)
Ain't no adultery-dultery-dultery
And it damn sure ain't gon' be no blasphemy man, holla at me
(Bizzy Bone)
The valley of death, go peak in the shadows
And gallop to gallow, the way that we ride
Probably think that it's over the other side
Baby divided go peek at the time
Reminded to open the people the blind, look at the duty
Don't think that I look at the booty
From everything that I was listenin
Rippin the tip of the dirty the mind
God, how could I know somethin'?
You know that they tellin' me I don't know nothin'
They wanted the confident, competent never be pompous
The drama they given 'em dozen
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
Feelin' the love and the beauty is real
The beautiful field, remember thou shalt not kill
Whenever you need me it's never exceedin
The beautiful lessons and beautiful blessings
And daily distressin, not here to impress 'em
I'm guessin the expression is plain as steel
Look at the metal, the metal, the metal
Now let me go grab it before we collide
The rhetoric, never be hesitant
Never my love, the Lord provides
(Chorus: Bizzy Bone)
I am what I am, no adultery
And who I be when I see-ee, I see-ee
I am what I am, what I am, what I
Now come in the light, up out of the darkness
When I see-ee, I see-ee, no adultery
Remember the judge is hard
Put up the cards no disregard
(Bizzy Bone)
Yeah, come in the light up out of the darkness
Fillin the void, and feelin' my noise
And feelin' the poise and feelin' my boys
And feelin' my voice and fillin my voids
Now come in the light, out of the darkness
Fillin the void and feelin' the noise
And feelin' the poise and feelin' my boys
Now look at the temple the Philly
Look at him grow, look at the heart the mind the soul
We lovin' the Lord, the Lord control
Get out of the knowledge
You know that the brain is just so slow
Plant the seeds, now all of the leaves
Remember the boss, remember believe
Remember the E, never no drugs
These liquid slugs, the love is from up above
No adultery callin me, baby we ain't fallin'
Ain't know motherfuckin time for that
Now don't you abandon the rules, the rules is quickly focus
Say - all in, y'all in, all in, y'all in, y'all in
It's never the time to question, be attentive of the kindness
Never the blindness, when they find us spiritually fallin', and pausin
And brawlin, the birds keep on flyin, they're soarin
Whether it's - Saturn or Earth, God please prepare 'em (heh)
(Chorus: Bizzy Bone)
I am what I am
Ain't no adultery-dultery-dultery
When I see-ee, I see-ee
I am what I am, what I am, what I am now
Ain't no adultery, when I see-ee, I see-ee
I am what I am

Now flow with the movement, shakin the dust
Now look at the world, now look at the lust
I'm praisin the Lord in the name of the Father
The Son and the Holy Spirit plus
Flow with the movement, shakin the dust
Look at the world, and look at the lust
Praise the Lord in the name of the Father
The Son and the Holy Spirit plus
All of his saints, remember the war pain, givin' the best we must
In the chastisement we must pay attention, that's what's up
So we tellin' 'em baby to realize, the supreme almighty one
In the name of the Father, the Son
And the Holy Spirit they feelin' the rush
They feelin' the drum, feelin' Cheribrums
Feelin' the love of the Lord is just, plush
And all of his workings and the twurkings of us
Remember the humbleness, of course we love to play putt-putt
And plantin the seeds in us, I'm finna sacrifice the love and the price
And the pipe, even the ice, up up, it's time to shine
Anytime, give me some wine, hahaha
What a collision, plowin the brain until it listen, no reminiscin
Of course I'm pissin I'm feelin' pissed, pull out the whip list
And I've been bitten to the crispiness, drippin in the (haha) blood
This is the way we do when we them thugs, now find some religious ones
(Chorus: Bizzy Bone)
And when I see-ee, I see-eeeeee
I am what I am, no adultery
When I see-ee, I see-eeeeee
I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
No adultery, when I see-ee
I see-ee
(Bizzy Bone)
It's like the covenant, Moses made
With the Lord, and valuable lessons
And valuable jewels and the valuable rules
Praise God for everything
Lean back chillin', everybody wheelin and dealin'
I don't have to work or make a million, million
Say, lean back chillin', everybody wheelin and dealin'
I don't have to work or make a million

Everybody better buckle up and get ready
Your nigga 'bout to bust like a nine
Nigga we can do whatever but never say never
You'll never know what'll happen when we get to cappin
Fully automatic is what I be packin
Now look at yo' reaction nigga - give me that bill"
141,Women Keep Watching Us,2009,Back With The Thugz (2009),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"Yeah, aight
See, what I want y'all to do
I want y'all to open up y'all Bacardi's
The way the women keep watchin us
Well gimme some will power, Bacardi

Better move ya body-ody, uh
We doin' it thug style, we in the party
Women are buck wild, turnin' around
Interior, show me what'chu workin with-workin with
You be on that erkin-jerkin, you be on that twerkin', quit it
You got to admit it, that'chu on a mission to have a good time
With a pocket full of paper, keepin' a pocket full of mine
Twenty fours, that's mine
Caught spinnin 'em blind
Came in the club off the bus and spent mine, divine
Gimme Kalu and I'll maneuver little Henny and wine
I stepped back in the rap game, passed my prime
Chain swingin' like the links, up in prison we shine
Like Katt said, ""Grind baby, one more time""
In the corner at the table, surrounded by glock babels
Get'cha gangsta endurance, and y'all just represent the label
And um, and um, and um
Better move ya-better move ya body-ody-ody
The way the women keep watchin us
Well gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this New World Order

Better move ya body-ody
Three step, two step, walk with it
Cha-cha, slide to the side, baby get it-get it
Square there, hit that, get back
Move kitten move! You can do you too when the mood's hittin
Baby you don't need no permission, get real close
No bullshittin, keep up the rhythm and make a choice
Now move with it, what shall I do with it
Through with it, you can act a fool with it, watch my toes
Oh, you did it
Sway to the side with a true fitted
Put it on, meet me at the table
That's where you sittin'
Mmm, give me attitude
Gratitude, peace, wait up
Before you flee's, may I buy you a drink please?
Class and I'll show you a glass
You can thug out in the corner with a flask
Watchin the cars pass me by
With my tipsy eyes, be at the club at the party
And my word the wise is
Better move ya body
Keep watchin us
Now gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this New World Order

Better move ya body-ody
Laughin' over bud, but feelin' lovely
If your women wanna touch me, then hand cuffs
Enough and bust playa smooth shit
Pass by then we outtie
Get rough with me, rowdy
She still gon' come around me
Fresh like Cool Water, flip collar, Downy
Khaki's freshly creased like I'm fresh out the county, howdy
Tell the truth, catch a candle, relief
Now it's me and you, so my dogs don't doubt me
Do what we do over drinks, club closin
Last call, last song, stay calm, now how do I know
I hit the dance floor, once we get on it, we on it
Shake hands at the party, keep a number and I'm goin' um
Better move ya-better move ya-better move ya body-ody
Better move ya-better move ya-better move ya body-ody
Better move ya-better move ya-better move ya body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody

142,Yes Yes Y'All,1998,Heaven'z Movie (1998),Midwest Rap|Hip Hop,Bizzy Bone,"(Verse 1-Bizzy Bone)
Now Gary really wants to sue me
Stressin out tellin' my groupies set it out
I already read it out usually thuggin' in my jacuzzi, with a uzi
Wet 'em all...
(Chorus-Bizzy Bone)
Yes y'all, yes y'all, yes yes yes y'all
Tune into the looney and boom
I come up out of my room
My goons comin' from the resume and doom
Yes y'all, yes y'all, yes yes yes y'all
(Verse 2-Bizzy Bone)
Yes yes get it raw
Buck at thre bullet-proof ghetto star
With a vest over my chest and there you are
(Nigga you flow too fast) Understand me
Society got me addicted to the inflicted so synthetic and wicked
Call up your family but they dyin'
Split up the sticky-sticky Bryon
Like grand daddy in the 70's said he just fled and his name was red
And I saw my father paralyzed
The other was locked down there he cried
Won't see me till Buck Rogers dead it was there he died
I don't care he lied
(Chorus-Bizzy Bone)
Yes y'all, yes y'all, yes yes yes y'all
Tune into the looney and boom
I come up out of my room
My goons comin' from the resume and doom
Yes y'all, yes y'all, yes yes yes y'all
Tune into the looney and boom
I come up out of my room
My goons comin' from the resume and doom"
