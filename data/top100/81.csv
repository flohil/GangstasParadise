2,A Nightmare On My Street,2002,Greatest Hits (2002),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot, outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street!
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right because the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
We saw Elm Street and man it was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!
It was burnin' in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a coke
Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You turned off David Letterman, now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin'""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said, ""Here's what we'll do.
We gotta lotta work here, me and you.
The souls of your friends you and I will claim.
You've got the body, and I've got the brain.""
I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong.
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work.
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""
I patted him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
Come on, man
Hello?
Jeff, this is Prince, man
Jeff, wake up,
Jeff, wake up
What do you want?
Jeff, wake up, man,
Listen to me, Jeff
It's three o'clock in the mornin', what do you want?
Jeff, Jeff, would you listen to me?
Listen, whatever you do, don't fall asleep
Man!
Jeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff
Look, look, I'll talk to you tomorrow, I'm going to bed"

Big Will and Tra-Knox
Yo yo yo yo jump

Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling

Yo watch 'cause we don't care how much time it's gonna take
Dance floor packed and it's lookin' like a lake

He said, ""Man after last weekend haven't you learned?""
Yo look here last week was a mistake
That mommy tryin' to dish out what she couldn't take
Come back me dancin' like wow like this thing is a game
One little move on her and she bust into flames (whoosh)
The whole club runnin' tryin' to ruin my night
I told her roll around little she'll be all right
Then everybody mad at me all up in my face
Somebody should've told that girl to stay in her place
You feel a little heat baby girl I'm behind ya
And hopefully your burnt guci dress will remind ya
Of how serious I am maybe it's crazy y'all
But if you wanna play hunny go get a baby doll

Foundation laid to the rock y'all
One time we out what"
4,Afro Angel,1999,Willennium (1999),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"(Ooh, Oh)
Here I stand before you - brown.
Color of the mountains
Colossal as the earth
Wrapped so deliciously within my own joy and misery
Feathers of my wings paralyzed by the distance of my mind
Here I stand before you, the color of the night
Frozen by the potential of me
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh) An Afro Angel
Afro Angel off your pedestal from perchin above
You on the prowl now, downtown, searchin for love
In all the wrong places, outside your radio stations
Hopin he with new hit single, is tryin' to mingle
Today, he is me in your town, puttin' it down
You in the car with your friends, followin my limo around
Puttin' a bug in my boy's ear, your ""S"" is for free
You'll do anything for Omar or Phil, bring you to me
And then me, hypnotized by the devil as well
Hold out my hand as an invitation into my hotel
No need to RSVP, place your hand in my palm
As all your girlfriends getting jealous, damn she landed the bomb
Willing to trade your spirit for some crass, whack wage
Something small, something simple as a pass back stage
But now I lay me, down to creep
And I - pray the Lord my soul to keep
Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved
Lil Bobby got a gun now, age fifteen
Destined to spend his life inside a cage it seems
Rage inside, pride, been denied respect
He can't take it though he gotta earn it
But he ain't learned that yet
Out on the town, reckless abandon he's been bullied before
But now he straps, so no more
Attitude high
Flexin on every guy that walk by
But don't start pal
Asif the gun came from the whiz, Cowardly Lion, got heart now
Let's pull it on a stranger
Ah, fun for the crew
Surprised when he realized, damn dude got one too
Smile's upside down now, games ain't so cute
Bobby's a deer in a headlights
Pumk, drop it or I'll shoot
Then like a sniper, cleanin his rifle, Bobby disobeys his commands
One shot rings out (gunshot) then only the stranger stands
Could of sworn Bobby's blood formed the shape of an angel's wings
But for what?
Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved
Back in high school, Tamika was the sweetest, the bomb
Hot to death, though in tenth grade a teenage mom
Knocked up by some thug named Russ in the drug game
But had the cutest kid you ever seen
Then off of pressure from her mom
She stepped to Russ
Said it's either them drugs or us
Either them thugs or us
The ultimatum, either continue bein a thug in the world
Or start lovin' your girl
And say God, bear me witness, no doubt, lovin' ya dear
But to go from 50 g's a week to 30 g's a year
That ain't happenin'
I guess he wasn't that strong
He came back the next week, and the whole family was gone
Yo they straight moved away, without as little as a word
Well, needless to say, Russ was a little perturbed
Then in a fury put the pressure on her girlfriend Shawn
And like a clumsy chef she spilled the beans on where they had gone
Upstate Schenectady,
Tamika answered the door
It was the last person she expected to be
They just stared
He said you love me for me?
You can do without the cars, vacations, and jewelry?
Down with me?
Period.
Through life's stress and strife
She said, Yeah, He said in that case
Would you please be my wife?
Then like a sign from the sky, the baby cried
Like an angel sings
I love y'all more than anything
Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved"

Big Will the high roller
Strolling through with an entoruage
Hard to camaflouge when you livin' this large
I be smooth like debarge with a five car garage
Out for the night with my squad and we be flossin' down the fifteen
My whole auroa gleamin'
Who that kid in the green v
Envy brother schemin'
I ain't thinkin' 'bout them
Racing chicks in the pink b.m.
With my speakers tweakin'
Freakin' off this weekend
In Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers
Money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight
And we gon' have some fun tonight
Now how we do it

Now how we doin' it

Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes lookin' at us
How bad they wanna be us (parlay)
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare havin' drinks at the bar
A round for everybody with these big willie cards
From civllians to stars they wanna know who we are
It's me big Will Nas Escobar J.L. Omar
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to exit
Verse 3: Left Eye
It's Left Eye with a tight crew
Representin' like it's ladies night
Comin' right through
Don't be spiteful
Plus an eyeful
Sportin' hot pink
Rocks in the link
In the drop with a mink
Like my ------ don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Sadamm
Blowing up spots then runnin' off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action
The main attraction
I'm in the fast lane passin'
Breakin' you down like fractions
While we be rappin' about things that really happen
Big willie style Philly style let's make it happen
With mademouselle from gezals to versace
With a sweet smell
This female leadin' the posse
Got jokes like Cosby
In the lots where the cars be
With no apologies it's Left Eye
Big Will let the champagne spill
Is it a man's thing for real
Can us girls roll wit y'all
What the deal
Well now it's lookin' like a car show
Convoys and whips on the strip
Pullin' up in the six makin' brothers sick
For real
Big Will household name
Entertainer
Gold handle cane and matchin' gators
Swervin' lane
In pole position rolling deep like a co-malition
In soul poisition and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene
My whole crew lookin' clean
Shine with a diamond gleam
Step above where the players be
Don't hate me
One is where they rate me
Lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V.I.P.
Eating grapes under the A.C.
Big willie style is how we do it
This one goes out to all the big willies"

7,Block Party,2002,Born to Reign (2002),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Yo yo
Forget the club today we're playin' the block
It's goin' down and it's blazin' hot
Jeff pop the new CD turntable joint
You just got to get the amps from Boogie get the fan from Rock
And then call up Bishgebibble Jims and Pats
And tell them we need cheesesteaks for like 300 cats
And yo, make sure it's hot or else I'm sendin' it back
And get my mic right if I get hyped I might rap
Then take the speakers, find a good spot
Subs on the bottom, tweeters up top
Yo you know where little John lives on the corner
The extension cord will run perfectly to his crib
And then tell officer Mike to barracade the block
Regardless of what car you got, leave it up top, hop
You want to come you got to come on your feet
Ain't nothin' like havin' a party when it's out in the street
Come on
9:00 I'm a call my crew
At 10:00 we're gonna roll on through
I don't know what you gonna do
But whatever you do hit the block party tonight
All the ladies rollin' up with friends
And don't be late or you won't get in
Party packed from beginning to end
Everybody tell a friend that the block party is tonight
It ain't nothin' like havin' a party on the block
When everybody knows everybody on the block
And everybody on the block
Come's to the party on the block
And when the sun drop, we don't stop
Funny how fast they travel the word
A dozen divas from Philly drove in when they heard
That there's a block party down in West Philly
Come block party with Jeff and Big Willie
Stand back
Everybody come to see the man rap
Jeff's got it *scratch* jam packed
Everybody hands in the air
Just get your hands in the air
Yo Philly (that's where the party's at)
D.C. y'all (that's where the party's at)
A-T-L (that's where the party's at)
West Side (that's where the party's at)
Midwest y'all (that's where the party's at)

And don't be late or you won't get in
Party packed from beginning to end
Everybody tell a friend that the block party is tonight
Yo and when the sun drops
Back in Philly that don't mean that the fun stops
All it means is that it's time to turn the lights on
All day long I've been plotting on this nights joint
10:00 now Jeff is tryin' to hype me
Would the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please
Hear the crowd cheer brought a little smile out
Mic check 1-2 I'm about to while out
I know he's old but maybe there's a slight chance
I can get my brother hype make him break dance
Naw maybe not let me get the crowd jumpin'
Let me hit them with the brand new funk or somethin'
I'm like Rob Base I wanna rock right now
Y'all know who rock the block right now
All we need is a mic and a beat
And a couple of speakers and some turntables out in the street
Come on
9:00 I'm a call my crew
At 10:00 we're gonna roll on through
I don't know what you gonna do
But whatever you do hit the block party tonight
All the ladies rollin' up with friends

Everybody tell a friend that the block party is tonight"
8,Born to Reign,2002,Born to Reign (2002),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"I believe in God
I believe in Destiny
Not Destiny in the sense of all of our Exerts being pre-determined
But Destiny in the Sense of our ability to choose
Our ability to choose who we are and who we are supposed to be
Yo Yo YoYo
I was Born to reign
Point Blank
My name to be ecthed in stone
My destiny Pre-ordaned
Tryin' to live richteous
Fightin for life, tis my life
That's why I liked on my vices
Tightnin the vices of truth on the roofless
This is rhyme and the crime and their minds is just useless
The path of the poison, the genesis of the genisi
YOu and your boyz tryin' to decide, what to write
But your hand is a sword and the blade has been forged
Young minds gettin' gorged Stakes have been altered
By lick or by weed and then hate gets exaltered
As art falls to greed, Choices is Made that's the voices is laid
On the track, contract, the soldier wage, did you see his new benz, but you're like a syringe now proud of your binge.
Got a lot of new friends, got a lot of new ends
Bought a house up in the hills frontin shouts to the pen
Givin' false accounts of your account's amounts
Amounts the fans treason stands to reason since your inception
Laced with deception and bred with false affection it must perish
From the Terrace I see the fire burnin the streets but I won't shield my eyes to the heat
Born to reign
I was Born to reign
I was Born to Reign"

11,Chasing Forever,1997,Big Willie Style (1997),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Early mornin' wake up
Gently with the caress on your hand
And that Kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan
Sunshine peekin through the venetian blinds
Four years, and like wine, you got fine over time
I got a question, if the Prada dressin and the Gucci
All got ghost, and the freeze on the Lucci
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?
Don't answer quick, think about it 'cause I'm askin for real
Gold diggers goin' to hear this song drivin' and crash at the wheel
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin' along fine
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw
No music I ever made, ain't nothin' I wanted more
We could deal with whatever together
Sunshine or that other weather, when we chasin forever
I wanna stay with you forever
I wanna spend all my life with only you
I wanna stay, lets stay together
Chasing forever, with only you
Chasin forever, a buck-wild endeavor it seems
Are we pursuin' somethin' real or just chasin a dream
Or casin' the scene
'Fore I die I plan
To see us holding eternity in the palm of our hands
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure
But I'm committed to growin' and coming at you mature
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good
But when we feelin' the hurt, if we willin' to work
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine
My mom said the linchpin of love is trust
An taught me monogamy is a monoga-must
A plus, for you dinner by candlelight
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right
It's a race to a strange place, most see never
It's a chase we gotsta make together, forever
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain
You searchin for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin'
Finally found a person, worthy of all
Instead of pushin me down, you wanna cushion my fall
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring
More carats than even Bugs could eat in a week
And the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek
I'll tell you what I see in the future
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad
Havin' more good times than JJ had
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it
Let no man sever, welcome to forever
Chorus to fade"
12,Could U Love Me,2005,Lost and Found (2005),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Yo, Big Will in the place to be, mic check... mic check...
Would you love me in the shack in a shanty town
Would you love me if my pants was hand me downs, huh?
Yo, yo,
Often times I hear a phrase when I'm out and about
8 to 80, all walks of life be shouting it out
Usually, when its time for a encore I hear it
Or when I did something hot, evoking the spirit
It's weird, it's like a double edge sword when y'all applaud
It's kinda wild, a peace sign, a smile
How do I respond to the phrase, ""I love you Will!""?
Kinda heavy when I hear it, I'd be like damn for real?
In a way it makes me wanna stay strong and moral
But history say I could be gone tomorrow
And though my future looks floral
I feel like I'm hoping for much pain
When people stop shouting my name
And doubting my game and liking others better than me
Writing letters to him instead of to me
A veteran 'B', I know the game, but do me this here,
In your heart be clear before you bless my ear
Come on...
Could you love me if I lived in a shanty town
Could you love me if my pants was hanging down
Could you love me if my wrist ain't bling
If I wasn't on TV & I ain't sing, huh?
Could you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted
Would my name be easier to forget it, huh?
Could you love me if wrist ain't bling
If I wasn't on TV & I ain't sing, huh?
I pray before I sit with a pen & a pad
A birth of a thought occurs and it calls me Dad
To the universe an idea released from me
Just a CD, nah man, a piece of me
What you can't see is when you be dancing 'B'
Is I asked you a question, that's how you answer me
So when you don't dance, it be like I'm choking from cancer
Like I wrote rancid rhymes, I can't survive
Sure, I rationalize like, oh, I see...
But if you don't like my cut, it's like you don't like me
Some stuff works, some works not so well
It's like you work so hard, still get hurt like hell
Yo, it could tear you apart
But don't let your wins go to your heard
Your losses go to your heart
And if we ever get the pleasure to meet
Be clever with it, measure what you yell in the street
Come on...
Whoo, would you...
Whoo, could you..."
13,Da Butta,1999,Willennium (1999),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"(Will Smith)
Uh, uh, uh
What?
Whoo! Ha-ha
Yeah mic check
Mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic

Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Bringing it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
What? What? What? What?
(Will Smith)
Here come the butter baby
Bringing it smooth and hot
Got the staff from K-B
Singing this groove a lot
So I got my spiral notebook
Drink and pen
And then abracadabra y'all, done it again
Married but I flirt a little
Siking the ladies
In the videos I be bringing it like Mike in the 80s
Level of success based on my level of risk
You've been yelling for the lyricist
Then reveling this
Old school hip-hop a beat and a rhyme
Some chapters and some verses, you seek and you find
Look no further here I go, Big Will, Johnny Inferno
Flame by hip-hop burns eternal
All aboard on my train to fame
Rappers hoping that it'd rain
Trying to stop the game
But rain can't stop me
I got a coat in the crib
Hey look y'all yellow bricks quit beefin' at the whiz, what?
(Lil' Kim) (Will)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Uh, bringing it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
What? What? What? What?
(Lil' Kim y'all what?)
(Lil' Kim)
Lil' Kim, Big Will give a damn how y'all feel
Hate, but on the real, Big Will is seven mill
If I wasn't on top I'd have a lot less ends
I'd most likely have a lot less friends
You know what I learned, let them keep talking
Uh-huh, pull up in an Azure and watch them keep walking
(Will Smith)
Kim haters be making me wanna flip and react
(Kim)
No-no-no, chill Will and let me do that (all right)
Huh, I gotta eat can't get with broke cats
You know the queen like to be where the money at
I'm the mother, y'all like adopted in this
Call us Mr. and Mrs. Papadapolis
When will y'all learn?
Y'all just interns
You gon' get what you earn, just wait your turn
I rock telephones with the TV screens
So I can have real phone sex
Know what I mean?
(Lil' Kim) (Will)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Bringing it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Yo I bring it smooth and hot)
What? What? What? What?
(Will Smith)
It's the fun king, I've been doing one thing
Running things for years, give me one swing
And it's out of here, crack!
Over the fence ladies and gents
Keeping rappers impressed but depressed by my current events
(Kim)
Yes Lord!
(Will)
Big Will swinging the best sword
What'cha flexing for, don't be testing me boy
Messing with me boy, you're stepping on the root of a daisy
I have you're girl saying
(Kim)
Will why you do that to my baby?
Yo Will, what they looking stupid in the face for?
What? I can't have rocks the size of a baseball
Trust me when I cop I make sure mine cut glass
Never spend my last, like a crack head for the blast
Y'all can kiss my ass acting like you know me
You ain't got a Rolley, take this one here you owe me
All in together now, wrists looking better now
Screw greyhound bound, I'm getting cheddar now
(Will)
Burrrr! When she step up in the scene!
Who! Ice gleam, y'all scream, 'Bow to the Queen!'
Ring on her finger mad phat
Leonardo DiCaprio saw it and caught a flashback
*Mouth noise*
All you rappers wanna snap, Jazzy Jeff got my back
*Mouth noise*
Lil' Kim bring it back, Lil' Kim press the rack
(Lil' Kim)
Yeah I'm short and sexy, my love's divine
My name is QB and I blow your mind with the
*Mouth noise*
When I step up in the spot, body lookin' hot
All the music just stop"
14,Don't Say Nothin',1997,Big Willie Style (1997),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Yo (let's talk about)
When I released my first single back in like '86
People was like oh you know that's popcorn and you know they weak
You know then I mess around I go world trade on them
Bangin' out them multi-plats they still got negativity to bring
My thing is you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing
Take your place allow me to flex a taste
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase
Face me the star of stage and TV
My face be seen in almost every country
Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee
Who he that's dressed jiggy straight from West Philly
Thought I was wack 'cause I wanted to act
Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that
The ill kid
Hundred million dollar bill kid
The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid
Don't try to act like this summer at the greek
You won't be bumpin the big Willie in your jeep
I know y'all still feel me
Really don't act silly
Thought I feel off just because I left Philly
Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers
I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Oprah
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up (hell naa)
While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa
I was at my crib in Barbados chillin' with Jada to date her
Vertex is me the magnanimous
Got you saying damn I've always been a fan of his
Y'all know how it is oh wait hold up y'all don't
Look here y'all don't say nothing then I won't
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')
Man I love being me ready to rock ya block
With some more hot top not ___ for you to cop
No more mr. nice guy
My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling
Jealousy swinging on me made his attack
(He soft he wack man that ain't real rap)
You believe that
It hurt me at first but it's cool
Took the insults fed 'em to my ego used it for fuel
Now everywhere I turn a dead end
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens
And they be screaming out
(Oh my lord)
Did you see it's that
(Brother from ID4)
Now can I please get
(A picture and your signature)
Sure you can miss
(Oh my god my girlfriends they ain't gonna believe this)
Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic
Hear my name don't nothing change but the accent
Bangkok to Madagascar they wanna see me
Princepe in Spain Japan I'm kota ishe
I like my steaks thick and my jets private
And my son to ride in the cockpit
I know hes only four taking lessons from the pilot
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip
Man who'd a thought my life would be such an interesting topic
Well y'all know how it is wait hold up y'all don't
Well look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')
Go ahead adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers
Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters
I'm about to show you how a man like me works
My shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper
Four five chromed out former two seaters
Fifty inch sony to watch Siskel and Ebert
'Cause I'm about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probably a couple
Of elbows
Cause yo I'm the man and the whole world knows
Rock film festivals and rap shows
All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers
My so called friends who been nothing but actors
You're way of character but now who's the bomb
It's Will from west Phil just slightly transformed
Y'all know what it is
Ah damn that's right y'all don't
But look here y'all don't say nothing then trust me I won't
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin')

Glancing the kid
Wishing they was dancing a jig
Here with this handsome kid
Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-cuba
I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it

Giving up jiggy make it feel like foreplay

Mad, 'cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders

Give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Wheezy
Cream to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psyche, kidding you thought I took a spill

Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon

19,Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble,2002,Greatest Hits (2002),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Listen homeboys don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away
Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said you're kind of cute I said yes I know
But by the way sweetheart what's your name
She said my friends like to call me exotic Elaine
I said my name is the Prince and she said why
I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy
But enough about me yo let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do
I popped some cash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me did I like her I said well kinda
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape
I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
I was arrested charged with agrivated assault
(Yo Clancy we got him)
But it wasn't my fault
Nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away
I was in a bar one Friday night
Cooling watching a Mike Tyson fight
I was maxin and relaxin sippin on Tequilla
When this girl walked up she said hi my name is Sheila
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said let's go
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said baby where are you
Her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin
And said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb
I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go
I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were on pants back on Sheila's book case
I was done sneezing and coughing
I hope this doesn't happen to often
But nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away
Jazzy: yo man you think they see your point
Prince: I don't know I don't think they really do
Jazzy: I think you should give 'em another example
Prince: awright give me a scratch let's make it funky right here
I got a ring on my phone May 5th last year
It was my girlfriend Betty I said hello dear
I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the Run DMC concert
(I'm wit it)
It's six o'clock now at eight will you be ready
(Yeah)
Aight fine see you then Betty
I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my la cox ????
Got to Betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until Betty's mon said Betty's not ready yet
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said I need a little longer to finish my hair
At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says let's go
Go where go to sleep I'm gone
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home
But it just goes to show
Not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme just remember my rhymes
Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away
Jazzy: man first your parents just don't understand then you having these crazy nightmares
Prince: I know why me man why me
Jazzy: what's next?
Prince: now these girls man you know how it is can't live wit 'em can't live wit'out 'em."

Thinkin' misinterest but I can tell you're lookin'
Face-to-face and eye-to-eye stance with me
I didn't even say nothin' I felt you wanna dance with me
You pushed me back a little when I kissed your hand
Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man
I put my finger up
Shhhh
Don't say nothin'
He ain't here is he?
We could play or somethin'
He at the crib? Oh

He can break dance and he can pop
He can rap, he can act
And if it comes down to it, he can scrap
Hey there... here comes Big Will again
Here I come y'all, here I come y'all
Watch yo' back y'all, here I come y'all
For years I been tryin' to rip rhymes and get mine
Spit lines, hot like lava this time
I don't got a sitcom to bother with
Or a time conflict with my sci-fi hits
I'm contemplating each statement's wit
And I'm concentrating on making hits
And I'm fittin' 'em line by line
Teeth I grit & I'm tryin' to find the perfect rhyme scheme
I'm dreamin' about y'all gleamin, doubt
""He's back from actin', he's screaming out
How he practiced rap and now he's devout
Every album track packs what he's about
In the past he passed with passion, old fashioned""
Boldly mashing, totally crashing
Words up in a disorderly fashion
But back to the lab and guess what happened, KABOOM!
(Ooh wee!) ""Dude's resilient!"" Fresh Prince was hot,
The movies killed him, wait, hold up, stop! You can rebuild him
Lock him back in hip hop while Dude's not filming
Shock by the film and the TV money, went from scenes with Uncle Phil
To scenes with Sonny, so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20
But its done, so come see the MC, honey!
Everytime he touch the mic, he closes his eyes and he hope to shine
Then like a streak of light, they'd show his name, they'd be like, Ah!
... Hey there, here comes Big Will again
...Here comes Big Will again
...Here comes Big Will again!"

I'm 'bout to bust, mami
And its glorious
I can't seem to stop my feet
You hear my heart beat, digga digga digga digga digga digga
Oh lord, I'ma 'bout to pass out
But when the night is over I'ma be the last out
Sweat pumpin' in my eyes
Vision a blur
But even though my eyes is closed I see visions of her

If all these people wasn't in here, flockin around
And how you in the middle of the floor, baby knockin' you down
The dude who be talkin' bout
When I walk in the house cameras like click click click, gizz gizz gizz
A damn shame
How you do the damn thang
Girl you off the damn chain
But you 'bout to be tamed
Look at you
Laughin' and grinnin' and dancin' and spinnin'
It wasn't my intention
But you got me cringin' my linen, come on
Call me a doctor
Give me a respirator
Look into my eyes
Mama, pressure is rapidly rising
All around my naked leg, all around my thigh
Feels like Ecs. when you next to me getting me high
Girl you dancin' honey, that's how I like to play
I be Patrick Swaze, you be Jennifer Gray
High heels stiletto
Sexy straight out the ghetto
She fire
It's like I'm dancin with the devil

People treating me mean
Why they be flippin' and trippin' on me
Chasin' me down
Grippin' on me
Racin' around
Disgracin' the sound
Got me on the run
Runnin' for havin' fun
They way they come and attack they act like I had a gun
Cops gimme room
Stop tryin' to gimme doom
They got me like roooooooooom

25,I Loved You,1997,Big Willie Style (1997),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"I thought you was the one hon yeah
When I met you at the Freak Nik'
Whoever thought you'd be the type to greet and keep secrets
My friends said don't sleep but I did so now I'm reapin'
Da seeds that I sowed I can't believe you so deceivin'
Sneakin' out on the weekends with Michelle
One of your freak friends from the east end she bad as hell
Half black and Indonesian the one that taught you treason
Cupid shoot me on my heart but damn why'd you leave it bleedin'
I gave you no reason to lie
But you choose to live untrue
Knowing how I feel inside
There's no telling what I might do
'Cause I gave you
All my mind
All my soul
From the very start
I gave you full control and you broke my heart
I tried to show you a better way of life
But I see that must be what you like
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build the future turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
It's so hard to keep my sanity
Now I can do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames yo
Why you playin' games yo
As I think back to the beginning we was together
We both loved sports, long walks, and autumn weather
Both wanted kids and a family a strong personality
I liked the way you handled me
Candles be lit mood set food set you ready yet?
That's what you said while you was massagin' my head
Now look here I could never leave you lonely
Cause the love you showed me had me feeling like you already had known me
'Member when you used to blindfold me till I don't see
Use your mind that's what you told me
Kissin' me slowly
Never was the loud type always on the low key
Pretty style but rugged
And damn I brother I loved it
The birds of a feather 'sposed to fly together
Guess that don't apply to birds of your kind
Cause you only wanted what you wanted like a poacher
Came to steal my heart and leave me to die
(I ain't going out like that though)"
26,I Wish I Made That/Swagga,2005,Lost and Found (2005),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Yo. Ain't no better man, for this hype track
Just the veteran taking the mic back
David Letterman, even said he like that track man
Even though he ain't a rap fan
Black radio, they won't play though
Ever since ""Summertime"" they ain't liked none of mine
Even though the fans went out and bought enough
I guess they think Will ain't hard enough
Maybe I should just have a shoot out
Run up in the bank, bust, grabbin' all the loot out
Whoop somebody ass, taking my boot out
Right on TV so y'all can see me
Just ignorant, attacking, actin' rough
I mean, then will I be black enough
Oh, wait maybe I'll jack a truck
Full of cigarettes, guns and drugs and stuff
Get back
I wish I would have made that
Lean back
I wish I would have made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to 'drop it like it hot'
Summer, Summer, Summertime
Seem like all I got
I always envied how y'all rock wit Dre and the Chronic
The way that Tupac, Biggie, 50 and Jigga got it
A lot like L.L., Chuck D, Slick and Dougie
I think y'all love me, but y'all place other rappers above me
And I don't know if you feel my flow
And be at my show and you'll see where I should go
On the charts of rhyme arts and thoughts in rap form
Damnit, I expanded the platform
Damnit, this Cat's on a rap song
Yeah, it ain't no braids or plats on
Ain't on stage wit no gats on
You know I'm afraid, gettin' my act on
It might have stunted my growth
But I wanted them both
And I hope that it would be less tougher
You do two things and then they both gonna suffer
I chose to act and it broke my heart not to rap
Prodigal son, clever, better than ever, back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got, I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
Yo, do you see that lil' bop in my step
Do you see the little drop to the left, huh, yo...
Baseball cap, Timbs when I walk
Do you see that lil' grin when I talk, huh, yo
Do you see me sorta glide when I slide
See lean to the side in my ride, huh, yo...
Do you see it's no ice on my wrist
Fish still bite just like this... right, right
Do you know what it mean when you see a dude's chick on TV gleamin', huh?
Know what it mean to be on the scene and in the audience ""Ali"", beamin', yo!
I must have a 'S' on my chest, I recovered from the Wild, Wild West, yes!
Yo, I been up the creek without a paddle, now I'm back on the saddle,
I got my swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
All you see that you see when you seeing me, you ain't seeing all to be seen
Cause there's more for you to see than when you see me on the scene in my
Media machine
I mean madness, sickness, sadness, swaggerless back in the day
Fat, ugly chicks in New York on the radio, saying I'm gay
I had a bonafide downside frown with the swagga not around in my life
Bank account found minimal amounts when countin' cause of my now ex-wife
I had the boar-thick wall and all that, endure pitfalls and all that, fallin'
Callin' for help
With no call back, where was y'all at, gimme the ball back
I got my swagga back"
27,I'm Comin',1999,Willennium (1999),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Uh, Uh, I'm Comin'
Watch ya back, I'm Comin'
Big Will bringin' Y2K
Feel the Earth tremble
See the skies turn red
Eclipses shootin' stars you turned your head
Volcanoes erupting, rage in the sea
Ain't the second comin' of Christ the first comin' of me.
They say if you damn with the Nile it would throw of the rotation of the
Earth, well messin' with me is worse.
Feel the rain, button up your overcoat
Watch the illidef badboy go quote for quote
We all want the best, well I'm right here,
Ya Lookin' for competition ain't no one near.
Y'all in the stands dissin' kickin dirt and missin'
My heavenly flows put emcees in hell's kitchen.
And I'm so, I'm so, hot, hot y'all burnin up, hot
I step in it's like a weddin between hope and Armageddon
The hip hop Moses to we headin y'all
I'm comin'
I'm comin'

You can't hold me back

You can't stop me
I'm comin'
I'm comin'
When I was born there was rainbow formed
With no sun, R.O.Y. G. B.I.V., markin a path for the chosen one
An angel, my grandma told me before she died, smart folks don't need to
Put no cursin in their rhymes.
So from CD to TV to movies back to rhymin'
My life stats made Jordan's six rings seem common
Y'all hate I retalliate just by being great
Big Will the enemy of your mental state.
With the same rhyme I used to burn your idol in a battle
To subdue you into sayin' look, I don't want to battle
MIBW3 my respect black stealth bomba roma radar can't detect that
I'm comin' is what I screamed as a teen armed with discipline
Faith in a dream, and as the smoke clears, after life's roller
Coasters, see who stands puttin' his mike into his holster.
I'm comin'
I'm comin'
You can't stop me
You can't stop me
I'm comin'
I'm comin'
You can't hold me back
I'm comin'
I'm comin'
You can't stop me
You can't stop me
I'm comin'
I'm comin'
Batton down the hatches and latch the doors
You wanna to try to match my wits with yours?
3 hits, I hit you, you hit the floor
This track is the third hit that's for sure
Beat thick, remenising of a bottecelli,
I'm like a cheetah hunting out on the Serengeti
I got my x-ray vision through all in my way,
No plan B, it disracts from plan A
Stage splittin in half earthquake style
Evacuate the premisis, the hard core nemisis
I never miss, my flow never flawed
Grab mikes and send electric shock through the cord
Quest for the rings, my only weapons intuition
My future position determined by past decisions
So young George Bush, I'm thinkin' about runnin'
Maybe not this time, but trust dude.
I'm comin'
I'm comin'
You can't stop me
You can't stop me
I'm comin'
I'm comin'
You can't hold me back

28,If U Can't Dance (Slide),2005,Lost and Found (2005),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Yo! If you can't dance, its cool to get up now
Yeah see usually, y'all stand off on the side, y'know you're a little embaressed or whatever, but this one of them joints for everybody so get on up but keep it simple. slide...
If you can't dance then this is your jam baby.
Left to right all night (slide) that's all you gotta do -
- You can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right all night (slide) that's all you gotta do
Now we all know the boy at the club, all liquored up,
Boy with the bub tryin' to pick 'em up, wack dancing,
'Wooking pa nub', shirt too bright, pants too tight
Boy settle down
Now I ain't just messing with you
I got better things to do
I'm trying to help, I got a lesson for you
I know you do the best you could do
Wanna get next to Boo, then the less you do the better
Cause women equate dance with sex
They gon' see you and be like, 'Next'!
But you gon' be like, 'hold up Ma' ('Next!')
But she gon' be like, 'uh uh, pa' ('Next!')
Now looka-here, rule #1, know ya name,
It ain't Usher, Justin, Hammer, then we can touch ya
Rule #2, never do a dance you can't do, why stupid?
You can't do it
So I'm up in my spot in Miami the other night, right
And this Dude's out on the floor OD-ing, just way 'over-dancing'
Y'know, so his Mommy wanna holla at me
She thought my name was Billy, I told her it was Willie
She said she watch my TV show and I was very silly
Told her I was from Phillie she looked at me said, 'Really?'
And judging from her t-shirt, I could tell that she was chilly
So I gave her my sweater, she said her name was Etta
She said she come from Cuba and she just had bought a Jetta
She said she was glad I met her, let's go somewhere together
She said she'd ride in my car 'cause she knew my car was better
The conversation cookin', attention getting' tookin'
My Spidey senses tinglin', I felt somebody lookin'
Now who this brotha lookin', and now he runnin', bookin'
I'm mad I'm like a fisherman, I almost had my hook in
I figured I should get up and quickly clear my head up,
Cause Etta got a man got me feelin' kinda set-up
Now Dude was really fed up and yo, he wouldn't let up
Homey if I hit you, you might never ever get up
Now he was not a dancer, plus he wasn't handsome
Comin' like Mel Gibson, like I had his girl for ransom
Pedro wanna go out side, yo amigo, tranquillo... slide
Now rule #3 is easy, please remember that you ain't on ""Beat Street""
Sweet feet, you ain't tryin' to win no TV, another dude did a move
No need to out do it
Rule #4, out on the floor, don't be doing moves that don't nobody do no more
Draw too much attention to be adventurous on the floor
There's a reason that don't nobody do 'em no more, you feel me?
This may be hilarious, but Rule #5 is serious, it's a shame to even have
To discuss
That there's no lip biting or pelvic thrusts
I mean you think that move will put the sting on her,
You too close, tryin' to put a ring on her?
You don't know that girl, don't cling on her and don't put your thing on
Her... cool?"
29,Intro,1997,Big Willie Style (1997),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Good evening Ladies and Gentleman
I'm Niah Pitson
I'm standing in front of the historic Manns Chinese theatre
Where thousands literally thousands of fans, journalists
And well wishers have gathered merely to catch a glimpse
Of the artists formerly known as fresh prince.
This album premiere marks Will Smith's return to the world of rap.
The long awaited album entitled Big Willie Style has broken sales records everywhere
From Bangkok to Madagaskar as we all anxiously await the arrival of the man himself.
Oh wait a minute judging from the stir of the crowd
Yes he's arrived Ladies and gentleman
Will Smith has arrived

And motivational tapes we practice what we preach here brother

'Cause I ain't never seen no Wu dancing wit no singing alien keep it real
Well brother I like to have a good time have fun with the music that I make
You know let people have fun
Fun in times like these anyway keep it real another question if I can move on.

Wait hold hold on hey charlie charlie why don't you escort

30,It's All Good,1997,Big Willie Style (1997),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"It's all good, pop the bubbly, life is lovely
All sun no rain
No strain, can't complain
Pass Hell pain, but no Coumbaya
Now I Boomshaka-laka-laka Boo-ah-ah
I got the good life, no strife, real nice
An I'm a papa my son Trey haha
An when I'm on tour, he be mad I'm gone
But then he smile an come runnin' screamin ""daddy's home""
Then he hold me, slightly tightly
Mom, your wish came true-I got one just like me
My life be so good, so good
Ka-chicka-chicka Ka-chicka-chicka-good
Things come to those who wait
But too late my life's to great to wait
I wanna, celebrate good times, c'mon
Livin' lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin' lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good

I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin' lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
I wake up every morning in the canopy bed
Slip a kiss to the Miss, you the man she says
Mirror, mirror, need I call?
You know, uno, bad breath an all
Times I been fed up, still didn't let up
'Stead a doin' dirt, did work and kept my head up
Set up
For the future, much love to my girl
North Pole got my butt cold (sittin' on top of the world)
An I'm feelin' (so high)
Touch the ceiling (the sky)
You say I smile 'cause I'm on top of the pie
But yo, the cream can only finance the smile for a little while
My grin got longevity, got family backin me
That's why I'm livin' happily
Ever after, love and laughter
Hussle 'cause I wants to, not 'cause I have to
Ask yourself, who made the polar caps melt?
FP, the phenomenon, true Don Juan, Jon Blaze
The Fonz ain't seen my Happy Days
The track plays, I'm in the shades, singin' a phrase
They say the clothes don't make the man
Take my hand
Watch me freak this
Ah-mommy's tryin' ta creep this
Tryin' to entice me to let it off
But nah, (why not?) c'mon baby, you saw Set It Off
Proposition by trio, in Rio
Menage Trois, down at the Marde Gras
But nah, my clothes by Versace
My attitude cocky, the sym- it's Imanyaki
Like a felon, no tellin' what I do next
I don't front 'cause I'm paid, but I do flex
Southwestern, crib like a villa
Vacation on a mountain in Manilla
Rhyme spilla, real thrilla
An it's real clear
Y'all talkin' East and West, I'm talkin' hemispheres
My papa raised no fool
So many zeros on my check it's like, ooh
Chorus to fade"

Hot like nitro
Cool as ice though
That type of docodimy

Who else could it be but me?
Rub your eyes, but hold the big Billy
It's dream supreme bean straight from Philly
It's the eclectic female attractor rapper slash actor
Right back at ya
And to the next millennium many come but few are chosen
See me servin' like the U.S. Open
Another type of hustler listed at Blockbuster
Go and ask a movie usher
Who is he, he or she
SFP, movies CD's, and TV's, but uh uh
'Cause the day I take a break from that
As I roll where a tank of gas will take me at
I used to rock these
Red, I rock Z's
Now I rock the MB's
With twelves and V's
Today sun up high
In the sky
From NY
La la me to MI

Flossin' ninety degrees

What up, cutie, what sure sure is cooking now
Yo I know

Pop CD's, B-I-G's and Tupac's
While cruisin' on the blocks
Hittin' the hot spots
Got my celly on O-F-F
Golden arches got my belly goin' oh yes yes
So let's just ease on down ease on down the road
No pager roll my hip

Must say I've had the best day I
Tryin' to find an exit
A place to chill, not too hectic
So I can spend some time with Will
Let the sun shine to the moonlight clearin' my mind
Soul search, see what I find
If I'm being the best lover and friend
Am I being the best daddy I can
I pray I am
And I feel good today
Reminisce as I'm cruisin' around the way
Roll tight passed the park where I used to play
Can't think of a better way to spend my day
Uh, still findin' my way
Still growin'
Petrol lowin'
Moon soon showin'
Gots to get goin' losing the light
And the freaks come out at night

From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough?
Against wrong, choose right and be standin' up
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People drivin' all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
'Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
Five years old, bringin' comedy
Every time I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me
Wait an see gonna be tall
Makes me laugh 'cause you got your dad's ears and all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A General, a Doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true dat
Uh-uh-uh why you do dat?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin' me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do

Show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an
An I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame it it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove
You was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin' times
101 Dalmatians on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm
Tryin' to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin' promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case
It's my place
To impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you

An I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame it it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove
You was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin' times
101 Dalmatians on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm
Tryin' to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin' promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case
It's my place
To impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky

If I approach you correctly
And step up to you respectfully
Will you please ma'am bless me with the next dance?
I don't intend to offend you
I only intend to befriend you
But you're willing me, thrilling me, killing me
With them hot pants, not a chance
I'mma let you go without saying something
A little hotter lombada mama that's all that I'm wanting
No frontin' if it was illegal for you to be that fine
I be McGruff mama taking a bite out of crime
Literally, first it'll be dancing with me
Then it'll be dinner with me
Then it'll be back to my crib
Hold up, I'm about to get ahead of myself
And I'm playing myself
The type of brother that when I'm thinking of stuff
I'm saying the stuff
My bad, back it up let's start with a dance
On good behavior, maybe later
Maybe your apartment, your pad
Sike, joke, walking a tight rope
My foot in my mouth
Look, I hope is that you'll dance with me
What's up?
Repeat 1
She was smiling I was kind wiling
Thinking I'm dialin' in
She gave me the impression that she was getting my message
So I'm testing
I threw it out there 'Let me buy you a drink'
'Cause when I buy you I think it would be fly if we link
What'cha think?
She responded with a grin and a glance
Then my eyes tried to seduce her to the forbidden dance
The body of a Latin goddess, sexy but modest
The hottest mami chula from Cuba, a cutie with promise
The other night I seen her dancing
Duty was over
She did a split into a spin
And put her leg on his shoulder
And he was over
If that was me and I was he
We'd probably still be dancing
Mami can you feel me?
Still she said nothing
Why she be fronting?
Never seen another mami move like you
Groove like you
I'm saying I wanna dance with you
What's up?
Repeat 1
To me when I'm dancing it's aphrodisiatic
It's automatic that I look in your eyes to help emphasize
Some people dance socially not emotionally
Closer to me, come on close as you can be
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama cut me no slack
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama forward and back
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama as hard as you can
It's part of the plan
It happens when you start with the man
On your mark, ready set, baby let's go
Baby let's flow, baby let go
Baby no, no, gotta a lot more
Lettin' it rip, gimme some of that
*Girl yells*
Yeah that's it
Sweatin' with me, getting it wetter with me
It's better with me
Gain it, other girls I've dated ain't famous
So take it or leave it
Just the way that I eat it
I bring, I swing it
So you like that?
Tell me what's up

39,Loretta,2005,Lost and Found (2005),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"(This is a true story)
Loretta, wrote a love letter to a stranger thought that he would change her life
Thought she would be his wife OH Loretta
Never ever meant him no danger, her love for his sustained her
Thought that he would change her life
Miss Loretta, a young girl, I never really met her,
A fun girl, a real go-getter, I heard a gold Jetta
A full with books and herb or so I'm told, hooked on my every word
Oh so bold, a love letter cleverly worded in a jacket pocket
Wrapped inside a platinum locket
In the shape of a heart with pictures of me
Had it inscribed, ""no us, no him then no me
She fell in love with the Prince of Bel-Air
Fantasy was to see me and to be with me there
So she wrote a love letter to me and then she signed it Loretta
Said, ""I gotta go get him, Will is my Soulmate""
We gotta be together how could we not be together
But wait if I send the letter I mean how will I be sure if they give it to him
What if they don't give it to him, that would ruin everything
I gotta take it to him myself
She packed all that she owned into the back of her Jetta,
Her backpack, her cellphone & a love letter
Most of her stuff was done up with pictures of me on it with a phrase ""It's gonna be"" on it
Her mother begging her please come home and then Loretta resenting her
Leave me alone Ma! I won't leave my destiny unfulfilled
""You're just jealous be cause Daddy ain't as sweet as my Will"",(click)
To the front gate at NBC, in June and July, backstage at MTV,
She would drive anyplace that they'd mention I'd be
Told herself, ""strive for love and God eventually
He would give me to her and her to me, this was meant to be
14 months outside every event that I'd be at, she'd still keep missing me
And now she's getting high with more frequency now
Rage rumbling inside got to be with me now
Then she heard I married Jada, she took her love letter out and wrote down,
""PS - I hate her.""
Kodak Center, where the Oscars is at, she's sleep getting woke up by the cops in the back
By a dumpster didn't even greet 'em with fear, grinning ear to ear, said ""my husband meeting me here""
""You know him, he's nominated for his flick 'Ali' and it'll be hell to pay if you pick on me!""
""Don't put that stick on me!"", ""Hell no I'm not leaving, get your hands
Off me. Don't make those things click on me""
Kicking and screaming, ""You intervening, this is fate. Mister. What you mean that I ain't?""
""What you mean it seems like I ain't""
""Ooh, you're like my Mom and our love is gonna survive y'all hate. God gon' take me to my destiny.""
""Y'all only seeing one side of me, Will gon' see the rest of me, he gon' see the best of me.""
'If I could only get him next to me, he gon' bring my blessings to me, I know it."""

Why should I try to sound like y'all sound
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man, it's like a circus wit a bunch of clowns
Wit a bunch of clicks I'll probably rap circles around
I spit heatrock and I ain't talking rollin'
Soon as the beat knock I'm crowd controlling
When I hear y'all that a awful sound
I don't ride beats I take them off the ground
Land them somewhere show them the town
Even on foreign ground I let them know I'm around
I don't follow everybody when it's time to rap
At one time everybody thought the world was flat
Sounds like you that was my intention
I paid dues now dudes pay attention
I live for it even though the flicks is hittin'
Cribs sick you can see the booth from the kitchen
Speak on it 'cause I saw it happen

Man you couldn't check a mic for me
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound

But you don't even believe what you say no more

And the pain you sustain it can change a life
LOST

While sure you're free to do it
But what it mean to do it
Did you mean to do it
Did you need to do it
Did you take time to think about the seeds you ruined

Yo ma we got this thing right
It's like makin' me think like
It's like fillin' my heart up
Not makin' me hazy
Just fillin' my mind up with all of these maybes
I'm tryin' to figure exactly the thing
It's like got me rackin' my brain
It's like tryin' to put words to a smile
Or like tryin' to figure out... forget it look
It's really kinda hard to explain how your smile been burnt in my brain
And how your perfume sing a sexy song to my nose
And how your finger tips gentle like the petals of roses
Maybe it's the way you comb your hair
Or maybe it's them stylish clothes you wear
Or maybe it's them little things you do
Or maybe it's just you
I don't know
Maybe it's your attitude
Maybe it's your point of view
Maybe it's the time we spend together
Maybe we could do this thing forever
Maybe it's your soldier ways
Maybe it's your golden gaze
Maybe it's the way we blend together
Maybe we should do this thing forever

Remember we met with shakin' (?) that first night
That was the worst night right
Well, I mean we had fun and all
Yeah, that's true but
You had somebody else and I did to
So it felt like karma and fate had formed a team
To keep me from the girl of my dreams
But in the end I made friends with hope and destiny
And then well the rest is history
But yo it wasn't easy though trust
I mean, tryin' to turn you and me into us
You my homie my lover my best friend
The white house to the ghetto you blend right in and I dig that
I could never imagine this passion I feel
I mean couldn't imagine how we could last what I feel
But if someone do somethin' to you
Shoot girl I might just...
Maybe it's your attitude
Maybe it's your point of view

Maybe it's your golden gaze
Maybe it's the way we blend together

Maybe you're my soul mate
Maybe my best friend
You make me and mold me a better man

46,Momma Knows,2002,Born to Reign (2002),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Yo
At 17 years old I startin' runnin' the streets
Man I had some fun in the streets
11, 12, sometimes 1 in the streets
By 18 I started seein' the sun in the streets
My mom started trippin' on me like ""Will you gotta choose your friends carefully"" like
I trust you but please call me
And when you have kids of your own you'll see
I'm a be here when all your friends won't
But I was busy hollerin' parents just don't understand
Now here I am with the family runnin' the lines she ran on me
We ain't always see eye to eye but Ma on your principles now I rely
You got me tastin' my toes
I didn't know
When my Momma told me don't go down that road (don't go down that road)
But I gotta go where I gotta go
So thank you for not tellin' me I told you so
I used to roll hard with this dude named Chuck
Rollin' in my car with this dude named Chuck
My mommy really liked this dude named Chuck
She thought that he was really impolite
Chuck and me used to roll out faithfully
Ineviatably you see Chuck you gonna see me
Like we on TV the buzzomest of buddies
Share full clothes and money
And hunnies flocked like we was players from the NBA
Still hurts to recall the day I heard him say
To this girl named Maya
I was datin'
He told her I was a lier
Joker hatin'
He told her I be cheatin' on women breakin' hearts and grinnin'
He told her her life would be better without him in it
That's the friend I chose
I didn't know
When my Momma told me don't go down that road (don't go down that road)
But I gotta go where I gotta go
So thank you for not tellin' me I told you so
Momma used to say take your time young man
I ain't gonna always be there holdin' your hand
But you'll always know exactly where I am
And when I'm not there in my place the lord will stand
Will study the world only the wise succeed
And when your eyes tell lies your heart should leave
You gonna do dirt we all gonna sin but when you realize and apologize and never do it again
Ma told me don't rush to get old
If you got youth the truth clutched in your hold
It's like possibilities too much to behold an emotional shield from life's blustery cold
Ma all the stuff was hard you said was hard
Childish disregard because my head was hard
Now no question to pose
I didn't know
When my Momma told me don't go down that road (don't go down that road) but
But I gotta go where I gotta go
So thank you for not tellin' me I told you so"

48,Ms. Holy Roller,2005,Lost and Found (2005),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Mic check 1, 2... this is dedicated to an old friend of mine, Michelle... She a Holy Roller now, turned over a new leaf. Now everythin' old gon' burn.
Ms. Holy Roller, new angel, got ya Bible out shoutin' and you're ringing a bell
Mid-life, reborn, can't wait to tell, if I don't believe what you believe,
I'm going to hell...
I've been down with Jesus since Sunday school and Easter speeches
The Bible was survival, that's what my grandma would teach us
Since I was 5, I've been dying and trying to read it When I did I did, it redefined it
Now you was 34 when you found Jesus after your life fell to pieces
Wife two times, with two guys, now enlightened in speeches
Seemed to flow out your mouth with the hype of a preacher
Took your whole life to reach you, now I'm a trifling creature
Come on, if I die right this second, I reckon that God would simply check
Into my life and times, dissecting my rhymes, he'll see how I've been leading his troops
You can't do dirt your whole life then say ""oops'!
Now where was Jesus, when you life then you was cheatin', when you was deceiving me?
Where was Jesus when you greedy, your lawyers was bleeding me?
Where was Jesus when every weekend, a new man living with you?
Oh, wait he was with me, trying to keep me from killing you?
Now, where was Jesus when you was lying and you was betraying me?
When I was trying to make it, you was hatin' delayin' me, huh?
Where was Jesus when the ice was thrilling you,
Oh, he was he with me trying to keep me from killing you!
If I ain't know Jesus, ain't no telling where I would be
It's been nights I felt like feces; I needed to fight to release it
I'm in the limelight, it's hot and the heat is ceaseless,
Holding my tongue while little bums cut me to pieces
The only reason's 'cause I studied the life of Jesus &
Venting with my pen, intending to write and release it
But when an ex-friend would slight me or slam me with venom
I hate it, I can't stand it, damnit, I really resent it
I always strive to be righteous, my version of God
The reason why I never write verses with curses inside
The reason I never purposely hurt persons,
I've applied many teaching of God,
Searching the reaches of God
Pondered the mysteries of why you be dissing me,
I adore you all I hope for you is freedom from misery
You made mistakes and blunders, you breaking from under
But yo, If I'm going to hell, it's making me wonder.
The greatest atrocities ever committed on this planet have been in the
Name of God
This country was founded by Puritans, for the expressed purpose of
Oppression-free worship
Your attitude is the same arrogant, fearful fundamentalism that fueled the
Hatred of the Crusades
And the attacks on 9/11.
If we are not allowed to worship God as groups and individuals free from
Persecution, in respectful
Tolerance, there's only one outcome..."
49,No More,1999,Willennium (1999),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Damn
Womens voice:
Hey this is me, I'm not in right now, but if you leave your name
And your number, I'll just might think about calling you back.
Have a pleasant day.
Pick up the phone girl, I know that you home
Please don't leave me all alone with the sound of this tone.
Come on pick up, pick up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
I know I don't deserve it 'cause of how I messed up
But all right cool, sit and listen
I'm missing your kiss and now a tear drop glistens
I had a bit to drink, kinda threw me
Things just happened, she didn't mean nothin' to me
You know me baby, I'm still that same man
That asked for your hand, and still the same plan
Another brother falls by the wayside
Another brother falls by the play side
I knew ever since I was a kid
That I was going to pay the piper for the things I did
But now there's no more us, no more we
No more nothin', girl, damn and it's all 'cause of me
No more late nights watching TV
No more talks on the phone till three
No more playing in the leaves in the fall
No more piggy back rides in the mall
No more ice cream cones to share
No more sittin' just playin' in your hair
No more picnics out by the sea
There ain't no more nothin' and it's all 'cause of me
Damn, some brothers yeah we huff and we puff
'Cause when we're hurtin' inside, we gots to front like we tuff
But that's dangerous, to cover hurt with hard
Because you still get scared through that feeble facade
Then the bonds of your ego, when the shackles of manhood
Makes you lose something that's damn good
A picture in my mind of us hand and hand walking
So alive, now I'm a dead man talking
Why can't you just pick it up so we can sit and just talk
Why can't I meet you somewhere so we can go take a walk
I can't hide, air, land, or sea. 'cause everytme I turn around, there I be
When I was with u I felt free, now I'm in a cage called me
Now I see, no more us, no more we
No more nothin' girl damn, and it's all 'cause of me

52,Parents Just Don't Understand,2002,Greatest Hits (2002),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"You know parents are the same no matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
So to you, all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand
I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
MY mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, ""What's wrong? This shirt cost $20""
I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!""
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep""
She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet""
I said, ""Mom, let's put these clothes back, please""
She said ""no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show""
I said, ""This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks""
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it""
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, ""If they were laughing you don't need them
'Cause they're not good friends""
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand
Oh-kay, here's the situation
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't
Yeah, of course I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, ""Was that for me?""
I said, ""Yeah""
She said, ""Why?""
I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy""
She said, ""How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic""
I said, ""C'mon toots - my name is the Prince =
Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on""
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sun roof was open, the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, ""I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer""
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?""
They didn't speak - I said, ""I want to plead my case""
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you all the kids all across the land
Take it from me, parents just don't understand"

You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we could dance all night to the early mornin'
Oh! I'm the Party Starter,
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we could dance all night to the early mornin'
Dance, an aphrodisiac
Women gyrating, simulating sensual acts
To stimulating musical tracks
I thought I was just gon' come out tonight and get a brew and relax
But no! Uh uh, when you're the party starter
It's like you're on call, you're what the doctor ordered
It's like you gotta block the border to the door
And shock 'em when it's boring...
Git on the floor!
Ughh, it's the groovicide bomber, mic in my vest
Tight, strapped to my chest
Like, I'ma run up in the party hollerin'
And be like ""Oh!"", fulfillin' my callin'
Big! (Big), Will! (Will), that's my name, whoop!
Writin' rhymes, that's my game, whoop!
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same, whoop!
Just write ya number down right next to ya name, girl
He was raised in the days when the roof was raised
Every rap occasion, new and amazing
The back of the stage amazed and gazin'
Prayin' for the day they would one day praise him
Studied the ways of the game and made it
Came through the maze and the haze and played it perfect
Days any person hated and cursed him, he was unfazed
He waited, it was worth it, he never retaliated
He saved it, slavin', on the road blazin'
Days when he was low, nothin' could raise him
He came to the show and somethin' uncaged in him
Like the pope, but its party crusade, I'm like braids that's never gon'
Fade (ya heard)
I'm like, 23's on an Escalade, throw me into the rave
Like you threw a grenade - BOOM!
I call for the days of the unadulterated
When the artistry was cultivated
You know, back when rap was smart and multilayered
We could rap without A&Rs& ultimatums (damn)
Now today I could say I long for the days when the party was all about
Partyin'
I was a mini-party starter then
My mind bends when I call my pen
The big question should I run the mind a vittle
Food for thought or dumb the rhyme a little
But Will ""if you come to high that'll alienate folks and they won't buy
It""(yo),
Look, people getting trapped in the track
And they be clappin', even when the rappin' is wack
Yo, what happened, when did we get happy wit that?
He's old-fashioned (yup), but let's be happy he's back

Slow that thing down, pump ya brakes kid
Why you gotta be all up in her face kid?
The ABS will get you numbers and the name kid
I mean really, houndin' ol' girl, was that really necessary
See your itinerary is all off
You need to be hauled off
She start flippin', she ain't trippin' it's your loss.
This is a simple case of an anti-brake pumper
You don't have to talk to women bumper to bumper
That mighta got you a couple of numbers when you were younger
But dude switch your whole approach, that ain't proper
Be a gentleman& try to be gentle man
The essence of stimulation mental man
But if your acting like you just got out the kennel man
Put your foot on the pedal and pump
(Chorus - snoop dogg)
If your girl's in ya face and she's outta place
What you need to tell her is... PUMP YA BRAKES
If you're out with your girls and he's pressin' you hard
What you need to tell him is... PUMP YA BRAKES
Now if you're underage and you're actin' all grown
What you need to do is PUMP YA BRAKES
If you're offended by this record, then you know that's you
What you need to do is... PUMP YA BRAKES
Outside the restaurant Girl sees Boy, Girl likes Boy
Girl meets Boy, Boy doesn't know that Girl thinks he's fly
Boy's a nice guy, so Boy says 'Hi'
Boy's Girlfriend returns from going to park
She sees them together this ignites a spark
Boy's girlfriend has a real loud bark
Now this is where the pumpin' of the brakes should start
Girlfriend thinks that something's going on
Girl tells Girlfriend nothings going on
Boy's in the middle of the commotion beginning
Girlfriend's mad cause Boy keeps grinning
Now, why is he grinning but that's beside the point
Girlfriend should chill before they roll up in the joint
Jumping to conclusions gets you no where honey
Pump ya brakes or be a crash test dummy
Dummy

Rule #1, is just like 2 the who do's and what nots and what you should dizz-ooh
No loud talking, no back talking, If you do either, believe it, you're
Back walking
I hate to sound rude but then again, I have to
My rap thang and my mack game, It'll smack you, click clack you, spit at you
I don't do it 'cause I want to, I do it 'cause I got to
I got a question to ask you, would you fall, stand tall, ball, or let em
Smash you
If I was you and you was I, would you keep it G or would you stay fly
If you was rich in a ditch, living low, would you push the button,
Keep it cuttin' or would you just let it go

Daddy can you tell me a story?
Will
Oh you wanna hear a story? What kind of story you wanna hear baby?
Willow
A scary story
Oh, ok
Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin' more than to rhyme
Almost like he was born in the rhyme
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time
And he fought with his mom
His school getting caught with his rhyme book
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place
At least he shouldn't of been sittin' lookin' there in her face with it
Teacher told him get it out of her class
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why you won't pass
Now if you shy you won't last but you're new
So underneath his breath before he left he said I'm a be richer then you
What you say? She said.
What you mean? He said.
Boy don't you play, she said.
What you mean? He said. Damnit.
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son.
You testing me? You messin up again
You done boy.
This is just a story about a young man comin' up in the rap game
A real scary story
Went from rags to riches it has goblins in it haters and witches. Uh.
First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money.
He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey.
The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny.
But they gave him the money so they played the record company.
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal
But for real it wasn't like that then.
As you could imagine when he started risin' to fame and fortune he was
Havin' Started antagonizing the guy's he was with
At the same time he started realizing
The deal he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits
He called a meeting to find a solution.
He said I'm gettin' beat out of my loot
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution
The dude's said we found a solution it's this .44
He ran for the door a little shaken
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter 'cause I like you
Just do me a favor
Get your life in order"

Made*
Divide the men, cops were sent inside of him
And seeing the good he had within him, let him out again
The life no longer for a big time baller, vic

Time to sit back and unwind
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the base and let the alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
A back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressing less
And checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sitting on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
Honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beeping at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodesiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
'Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
'Cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4
Sitting with your friends 'cause y'all reminisce
About the days growing up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playing out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wiping your car down
It's time to cruise so you head to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't spead through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

61,Tell Me Why,2005,Lost and Found (2005),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"(INTRO) - Why, why, why, why, why. Why
I really wish I could explain it baby (why),
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby (why),
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby (why),
Don't cry, dry your eyes
September 11th, I woke up about 7am, west coast time, French toast and my
Turkey bacon, taking my time, awakin', turning my TV on
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw
Me and my children, images were chillin'
My son said, ""Daddy were there people in that building?""
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say ""Yes"" to him
That night at my son's side, he cried and prayed
For the one's who died in the World Trade
His palms to God, seeds and qualms with God
He just kept on pressin' me, wanna know why
Then one week later our bombs were dropped
We seein' them on CNN, they just won't stop
The infrared images of brutal attack
He said, ""Daddy now we killin' 'em back""; (right, right)
(BRIDGE - Mary J. Blige:)
Mmmmm, souls are captured
Dreams are stolen, hearts are broken
Evil blatantly rewarded
Hate surrenders, Love exalted
Hope elated, negativity is shorted
Why is the bomb always getting the last word
And why did her uncle have to molest her
And why did all them cops have to be shootin' to kill
And why did all them priests have to act so ill
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched
Tell me why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us
Tell me why did that sniper make the little boy shoot
And why is human life always denied for loot
Tell me why did Mandela have to live in a cage
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate
And why the f*@k can't love seem to defeat hate
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat
Why did Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way
Please what am I supposed to say to my kids when they say 'Why?'
Can't explain it baby, life is just really crazy
I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby
We got more stores than they got rice under Buddha lazy
You live four scores and still it be driving you crazy
But for me I try to see the bright side
Sometimes it'd be like the goodness be tryin' to hide
Then try to flee, but it can't it's deep inside
Sweetie, you be the light for the others, make 'em believe in God

62,The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air,2002,Greatest Hits (2002),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Now this is the story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In west Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys, who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said ""You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air!""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it!""
First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like?
Hmm 
This might be alright!
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
Well, uh
The plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything, I can say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo Holmes, to Bel-Air!""
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie ""Yo Holmes, smell ya later!""
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air"
63,The Rain,1999,Willennium (1999),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"(Chorus: Jill Scott)
The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel like, feel like
Feel like coming over me
(Will Smith)
The rain gon' come through the window, pain will come
Black, white, rich, poor, it's the same old drum
Rainy days like the war, use wisdom as a weapon
Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin'
Let the children feel the rain, 'cause if they feel the rain
From the wetness, they stand to gain
I came into the game, it felt like the middle of June
Music was warm, artists, like flowers, they bloom
Then boom, I shook the room, many felt the thunder
My time to shine, did it like summer
I wondered if the sun would shine forever
Pops said ""rain gon' come"", to him I said ""never""
Chedder in the genes, face on screens
Got a benz wit' the sheen, but what did it all mean
I earned money and burned money, credit cards smokin'
Platinumn, grammys, famous, but still broke and
Not having cash put me in check
Yo, the road to the riches is slippery when wet
Amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself
Ever since then, the rain I never felt
Deal wit' it
(Will Smith)
At age seventeen, the worst pain, a hurrcaine
Her first name still conjuers the rain
Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet
Lest we forget, love is a four season concept
Many say the rain they can't stand
Never let the weather determine the man
God has a plan, from it I never ran
Follow my heart through the storm, my umbrella in hand
I'm Noah, life's my arc
Forty days and forty nights, still can't take my heart
Seen the fallen man
To dope and liquor brands
The devil'll dance to make it rain
Bringing the pain
Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets
Soakin' wet, but mastered the art of peace
Through grey skies, I grew wise, on bended knees I knelt
Since then, the rain I never felt
What's wit' it
(Will Smith)
Sometimes I sit in my room, stuff on my mind
Stress, can't rest, so I open the blinds
See kids in the streets, runnin' around
It wasn't touchin' 'em, but the rain was comin' down
I wondered how, with my mouth wide
Reminisce of the key, said I wanna go outside
In the rain, to see if the same would happen to me
'Bout that time, God started rappin' to me
He said ""pain is the mother of change, the rain must flow
So the seeds of joy might grow
Don't be afraid, find shelter in me
The road to greatness, through the valley of adversity""
I felt the light as He proceeded to drop the gem
These little children, the world we must receive like them
I just smiled, and thanked Him for the cards He delt
And since then, the rain I never felt
Was wit' it"

(Uuh)
Can you feel it baby?
(Take me away)
Flow crazy
Make em' say
(Uuh)
Make It hot, uh
(Take me away)
Flow crazy
Make em' say
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)
(Will Smith)
Been to the mountain top
Down to the valley
Philedelph to Cali
Y'all feel me like Harry felt Sally
Clothes exotic, flows erotic
No jewels that's for them fools who ain't got it
Rap to my own sitcom
Now I just sit calm
Watching y'all respond to my July 4th bomb (boom!)
Yeah I'm a nice kid
But here's some advice kid
Don't get me hyped
I'll set it off like my wife did
Playing down a path like Sajak
Wheel of a Fortune away
Price ain't right I don't play
Find yourself in Jeopardy
The first clue
What is Will Smith?
Hot to death not you
I'm like a Porsche, you a pinto
You like a tiny figurine, I'm monumental
You're like a small get together
On your neighbor's back porch
You know just a couple of y'all
I'm a million man march
Attack of the man in black
Like Jordan playing on a train
Yo my game on track
Mad ice for my wife
No care for what it costed
Had to ease up though
Her wrist got frost bit
My style, flava, delivery, my diction
Gettin' medieval like dude in Pulp Fiction
You want some bring it
Come one, come all, come in
Watch me take they heart away like Penny
I could take 12 rappers and put em' in line
Then 12 emcees that think they can rhyme
Then 12 more brothers that still ain't signed
Then don't do nothing just watch 'em decline
Gangsta hardcore, menace to society
Raps all the same
My pen spits variety
Eclecticism is a virtue
It may not be a word
But it's definitely a virtue
Rappers approaching me all across America
Believe me you don't wanna battle like Erykah
I was in the game before publishing was an issue
You're platinum now but next year I'm gonna miss you
Mad rappers like bad actors should have no parts
Wanna be mad check the charts any of them
Oh you don't see my name
You don't see my spot
Here's a hint
Look closer to the top
(Kel Spencer)
(Uuh)
Can you feel it baby?
(Take me away)
Flow crazy
Make em' say
(Uuh)
Make It hot, uh
(Take me away)

Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)
(Kel Spencer)
Uh, love and loyalty yo
Yo the flow spray, Vito say
I'm tryin' to live
And if I catch you out of bounds
It's cheap shots to the ribs
Love and loyalty dawg
Do it how Pac and Big did it
It's the Wild Wild East
And me keepin' me jig with it
Play no games
Thirst to heat the rhyme
Motivation cause procrastination is the thief of time
Holding a torch
I was programmed to scorch
Can't run with the big dawgs?
Then stay on the porch
These cats is craftmatic
Hand on the steering wheel
Rocks from the road dodging oncoming traffic
Man-handle rappers, dismantle rappers
Y'all lukewarm slash sweet-scented candle rappers
Any team posing a threat we defeat those
The wealthy man is the man that knows how to keep dough
As long as y'all play foul I'mma keep hittin' free throws
Crush Spanish mamis calling me Kellito
Remember Lego blocks?
All about the paper now
I use writers block to build sky scraper style
Catch rappers using the same flows everyday 'cause they lame
True players gotta change their uniform after the game
Y'all seen the flow
Like y'all never seen before
Don't stop for the door
Why do you think green mean gold?
Baby learn life's lessons
Scratch regression
Kel Spence the truth, the answer to all questions
Come on (Uuh)
(Will Smith)
Damn Kel, you kind of good"
65,Wave Em Off,2005,Lost and Found (2005),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"From a distance, you can witness the glow from my entourage
Gravitate towards the ambiance
See me and my men on CNN, then the birth of the inevitable hate begin
Cause hate is the chld to greatness
The glue between Neo and the Smiths in the matrix, yin to the yang
It just must be, ask anybody with a Grammy or an MVP
(B section)
I said stop, get out, I don't need this hate around me
All your negativity might drown me I just try to go hard, doing my job
Stop, get out - the whole world loves me 'cause I do what I do
And I don't like the energy coming from you Trying to play me soft, wave 'em off
(I just wave 'em off, yeah) I ain't concerned with your hatin' that don't slow down my paper makin'
(Wave 'em off, yeah) While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes
(Wave 'em off yeah) Love me, I paved the way, boys we can't behave this way come on
(Wave 'em off, yeah) While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes
Coming of age I invaded nations, on stage, I seen Haitian and Asian faces
No vacations just more locations, I go places, so chasing my vocation
So demonstrating the way to be patient with life's test, through my IRS situations
My guess is my dedication don't phase ya, a public sensation, in private you hatin'
Why? That's so last year, that's so not sexy, but I shall not let the hate stress me
I got bigger fish to fry & I could stand on my wallet, probably kiss the sky
When I close my eyes, I wish that I could change how you get pissed when I do things you can't deny
Truth is, Great do need Hate to survive, so I...
Block 'em out, ignore 'em (wave 'em off)
Don't pay these jokers no mind (wave 'em off)
They just all mad 'cause they in the coat section of the hate train and they can't get off
Still flaming boy, stand clear of the hatin' is the best defense Tryin' to exceed excellence
Same way hope comes with fear, yo,
Greatness lives here, then 'hateness' lives here, Trust!"
66,Who Am I,1999,Willennium (1999),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"(Rodney Jerkins)
Darkchild, Big Will, 2000
Bust out, shake it up now
Come on, come on
And shake it up now
Who am I?
You know, you know
Big Will, ya ready?
Come on
(Will Smith)
When I was a lad I used to dream that (one day)
I'd earned the cream that make phat rocks gleam
Phat rhymes to make it seem that I was like Bill Gates
Writing lines, seal fates
Power to change the whole set
For exposure or forfeit
And with the wicked sense on how to get the picket fence
Envisioned a hot life, hot wife
Wanted a crib, well a palace like South Fork on Dallas
With lights simmer trees for the ambiance
I been up and down and high and low
Fly with dough, broke looking grimy yo
My shiny glow definitely ain't cause of my Bentley
It's something that my fam put in me
Who am I? You ask
The guy with the razzmatazz with ten duffel bags packed with pazazz
In the past cut twice by the ladies of my life
(And the wounds) stitched up by my wife
Who am I?
It's suffice to say found gold in my heart
Put the ice away
Nicer day, live foul homie it's a price to pay
Even when it's rainy still I say it's nice to day
Who am I?
That brother with the platinum plaque
With the strength to stand and say gangsta rap was whack
The fact is that when that brother rap or act
Hold position, front of the pack
Who am I?
(Tatyana Ali)
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
Baby if you really wanna know about me
I'll tell you who I am
I'll tell you I be not the one for games
But if you're right with me
I know I'll do the same
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it

(L-Y-T-E)
(MC Lyte)
Who am I?
You dare to ask
The same female that hailed from Brooklyn and wailed on that ass
I'm your worst nightmare, you're best wet dream
Break the bank papi 'cause we're coming for the cream
And while I'm in the world ain't none of y'all safe
Hold face, sell a million and you still won't equate
So who am I? It ain't hard to tell
Like staying on track cause you thinking I fell
See a lot know my face but a few know me well
Just who I am is the one to make ya gel
Who am I? The chick that keeps spittin'
Taking back all my snip that was bitten
Rewritten dangerous laison
With the shades on
Making sure the track stays on
Days on end I'll be that one true friend
That will always be around when the world falls down
I'm honest to the bone
No question, suggest
You don't wanna know
I give the truth, nothing less than
I'm sweet with a heart to fit
Smart as a whip
You feed me well but I'm still hard to get
I'm like a calculus problem hard to solve
Study me well if you wanna get involved
And even after that I'm still unpredictable
Now who am I? I'm unforgettable
(Tatyana Ali)
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with

She's got me goin' out of my mind (playin' all the time)
I saw another man hold her
Just a friendly hello
I know it was nothing (nothing) but he took to long to let go (I think you better let her go)
Ow
Let my girl (girl) - girl (girl) go (go)
I try to be tough though (so strong)
Sometimes she makes me so mad (so mad)
Her eyes like diamonds (diamonds) make me forget she's so bad (she's so bad)
She's my angel (angel)
This world she's not of
Sent from the upstairs (upstairs)
Taught me that new kind of love (love love love)
I can't tell y'all (don't understand) what she means in my life (the world to me)
What make it so crazy (crazy), I met her through my wife
She got me locked up
Got me locked - locked up
Willow is a player
She's got me goin' crazy (crazy)
She's got me wrapped around her finger
She's got me goin' out of my mind (playin' all the time)
Willow is a player
She's got me goin' crazy (crazy)
She's got me wrapped around her finger
She's got me goin' out of my mind (playin' all the time) ."
72,Y'all Know,1997,Big Willie Style (1997),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Uh there we go
Let me go and jig this thing on out
Go ahead baby you got it
Big Will raising the roof raising the roof
Show him how to do it Will
Observe the high roller
Mic controller
Number one hip hop son
Call me solar
Why 'cause I shine
Praise the Big Willie I'm
Raised in Philly I daze and thrillin' ya
Don't be silly ya can't see me
Again I'm killin' ya on MTV
Just get with it my friend (Damn another award)
That kid done did it again (Oh my Lord)
The fantastic
Boombastic
Getting ten times hotter than any you other cats get
Practice
You lack this
I'm the real McCoy
First with Jeff I was startin
Then with Martin I'm a Badboy
See more green than David Bantha
More juice than Tropicana
You hawking me like Atlanta
Emcees just flee they rightfully concerned
Big Will wants the mic back it's my turn to burn
Verse two verse two (blaze 'em one)
I'm back attacking the mic
Hype like a Viking
Striking like a python
Blaze like Jon
A hip-hop icon emcee radical
Back on track from my rap act sabbatical
Nine point six on the ricter
Kicked her, ears so slickta
Chicks quickta flip the
Bright glance and the tight pants for the slight chance
Big Willie can we get one dance
Why yes you may and I'm just saying
That dress you playing is a okay an
This is your chance for at least it could be
For you an you girlfriend on the dance floor menage boogie
On the scene I fronts and dashing fashion
Lost my cream once, now I'm stashin cashin
Countries and currencies like a true Don
It's a new time and its mine watch me shine
The way I blaze through the days and nights
How I deal with the craze my momma raised me right
Whether I'm on stage or in the studio booth
A hundred proof raisin the roof raisin the roof
(And Y'all know)
Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She knows)
Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He knows)
Can't nobody get it hot like me
(You know)
Y'all need to stop cause ya can't see me
(Y'all know)
Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(E knows)
Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(She knows)
Can't nobody get it hot like me
(Y'all know)
Y'all need to stop cause ya can't see me
(Blaze 'em y'all)
Seven continents I bruise all cruise
Adidas, kilts, or bamboos and no shoes
Eskimos to Aborigines
I'll test the flows of the world's emcees
I'll hit you out the ball park
You just all talk
Don't be looking at my script, you can't play my part
See I'm a rapper that's an actor
You act rap with no heart
The way that I compose those flows like Mozart
Gets something like a symphony, when I'm orchestrating em
Ever since the days of me and Jeff at the Paladium
All my life I've been the cream of the crop
Shopping a dream now I got a crop full of cream
I raise mics for the flow of it, you know the show of it
Not the Benz 600 four door of it (keep it real yo)
I'm a rhyme regardless of earning
Long as my heart keeps yearning
I gots ta keep burning
(Y'all know)
Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She knows)
Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He knows)
Can't nobody get it hot like me
(You know)
Y'all need to stop cause ya can't see me

73,Yes Yes Y'all,1997,Big Willie Style (1997),Hip Hop,Will Smith,"Intro: Sonny Cheba
Yes
At the start of the new jiggyness
With the Trackmasters
Camp Lo and
Willie
Gon' give it to ya
Know what I mean
Lot of macoronis here
Check it out for all the
Tenderonis
Ah ha ha
Like Chachi and Joanie
Lights camera action
The hip-hop attraction
Fresh Priggy
John Bliggy
Player haters been hatin' all my playin' for years
Now they seein' they worst fears as I bathe in cheers
Parades and accolades
All shades and ages
It's me the outrageous
My zeal contagious
The smile inspirator
Aspen to Grenada
One of the only MC's to say cheese with Schwarzenegger
Everywhere I go they know me
Planet Hollywood in Paris accidentally spilt a drink upon Naomi
Truth of the matter I've been loungin'
Livin' it up givin' it up
In opulent surroundings
Been around the world and I-yi-ya
Ain't seen another this fly-yi-ya
My attitude pervasive
My effervescence
Bringing you back to the essence
With the...
Chorus: Will Smith and Camp Lo
Yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Mic check y'all
And ya don't quit
Repeat 2X
Verse two
'Bout to slay you worst than the first verse
Packin' my purse but yo without one curse
I survive in rarefied air where only few can live
Thoughts in my brain like that train in the fugitive
I pledge allegiance to the soul of the game
Stepped away as Fresh Prince came back with my real name
A rose by any other still beautifies the room
So don't get consumed when a brother's nom de plume
It's semantics, but yo it's really good to be back
Never racing the rap just lacing the track
Not serendipity with me it was a Plan B
Gots to have an Oscar standin' next to my grammiesss
Plural, mucho, no need to talk though
I'm a just do so
I'm comin' at ya with the smoothest slickness
Behold the style lick of this kickin'...
A GQ cover twice
This brother's nice
Vanity fair you saw me there
I discovered life
Outside of rap got the cream and all that
But kinda left a void in me
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
Said my mic
Aight
Pump your radio you could record
As they place my welcome mat at the music awards
Coming through America tinted in high beams
Rose petals at my feet like I'm Prince Akeem
So to all you player haters while y'all sayin' y'all rhyme
Please stop sayin' Jada cause that name's mine
I rocked the Philly fade with the divin' waves
Yes yallin' till I'm bald like Issac Hayes
Bad eyes or greys
Back pain or bad legs
I'm a get better with age, trust"
