I just gotta bring it to they attention Dirty, that's all
You better watch who you talkin' 'bout
Runnin' yo mouth like you know me
You gonna fuck around and choke
Why the show nigga' carnies
Show me
While one on one you can't hold me if your last name was hand
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on ya pants
No resident of France
But you swear I'm from Paris
Hundered 6 karats
Total?, naw that's per wrist
Tryin' to compare this
My chains to yo chains
I'm like Sprint or Motorola, no service, outta ya range
You're outta ya brains, thinkin' I'm a shout out ya name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to get ya fame
All this pressure you applyin, it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blind side
Takin' your sleeves off
As much as we floss
Still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin', bitchin' and cryin', suck it up as a loss
'Cause yo acts is wack
Yo whole label is wack
And matter of fact eh eh-eh eh eh
Hold that
I am number one
No matter if you like it here take it sit down and write it

Eh eh eh eh eh eh! now let me ask ya man...
What does it take to be number one?

Or some internet access
Or some website chat line
Mad 'cause I got mine

Oh if my uncle could see me now
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the down down
Can't leave out the store now
Betta wait till the calm down
I got hella shorties
Come and askin yo where the party
Oh lordy, will I continue to act naughty
Mixin' Cris' and Bacardi

Yo I'm tired of people judgin what's real hip hop
Half the time you be the niggas who's fuckin' album flop
You know, boat done sank and it ain't left the dock
Mad 'cause I'm hot, he just mad 'cause he not
You ain't gotta give me my props
Just give me tha yachts
Give me my rocks
And keep my fans comin' in flocks
Till you top the Super Bowl
Keep your mouf on lock (shhhh, I'm awake haha)
I'm cocky on the mic
But I'm humble in real life
Take nothin' for granted
Blessing everything on my life
Trying to see a new light
At the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel
But I speak the truth
I heat the booth
Nelly acting so uncooth (so crazy)
Top down shirt off
In the coupe
Spreadin the loot
With my - family and friends
And my - Closest to kin
And I - Do it again
If it means I'ma win

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
You can find me, in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puffs
Sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because 'ccumulated enough stretch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector 
 so feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud 
 I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm ""Born to Mack"" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic, it's ironic, slammin' niggaz like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die

Fuck you with an uppercut, baby that won't take a lot

When it's reppin time, whe- when it's reppin time
Told her I take her shoppin' after we fuck
Soon after we fuck I had to tell her never mind
You wouldn't know swag if it slapped you in the face
This that macaroni tony A1 on the steak
And designer shoe laces, gold on the bracelets
Got her in the back seat balls on her braces
Photo grails full of money stacks
You a blocker and nigga I got a hundred sacks
Ya, this the luxury distribution
Up so early got me arguing with the rooster
Tru university is my institution
Niggas couldn't graduate if you had tutor
One thing for sure, two things for certain
My crib got blinds, my car got curtains
I am so faded, might put fifty on the ladies

I'm so faded, might put fifty on the ladies

Big boy
Big boy
(I said) give me two pair
('Cause) I need two pair
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
(Big boy) stompin' in my Air Force Ones
I like the all-white, high-top, strapped with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, they're dirty, that's why I got 'em
I leave them strapped and laced, they come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em, I damn near shot 'em
Now if you look and see lime green Forces, it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop, my niggas flip-flop
Yeah my Force Ones in tip-top now form a flip-flops
I like the limited edition, the khaki, and army green
Patent leather, pin stripes, you should see how I do the strings
Size 12 with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depends on when and where I'm at
Don't get me wrong, man: Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
'Cause if the shoe is on the shelf you should have some, man
You cannot sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You might not have three or four but you got one, man

We up in Foot Locker, I'm looking like I need those
10 1/2, and if you got 'em, give me two of those
I can tell she's never seen Murphy Lee befo'
'Cause she just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, ""Excuse me, miss, I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you, Murph, especially in the white and blue""
I said, ""The white and blue? Sounds nice, make it twice""
Then I signed an autograph, ""Thanks for the advice""
Yo, I keep it real dirty, dirty, you know how I do
Purple and gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like floppy with ankle socks, lows, mids, and high-tops
With the clear sole but it's Tims and fat laces when is cold
But when the winter go (brr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all-purpose with them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stoppin' this dough that I'm spendin' fo sho'
On them Nike Air Force N-E behind the O
Ok, Lee, I treat my shoes like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and the wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh with electric roof
Plus I put a kit on the sole, now I got a wider shoe (ooh)
You see that low misk with the purple coop, I'm driving them
(
)
10 is my size in them, and no point in tyin' them
Ain't no point of trying these on, they know I'm buying them
Now, don't nothing get the hype on first sight like white on whites
Them 3 quarters, the lows, they all tight
The only problem, they only good for one night
'Cause once you scuff 'em, you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis, the looks on store owners' faces

While Ali on the Kawasaki, two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wilin') fish bowl in the mall
(I got some 15's) security buying shoes and all
Listen, sometimes I get 'em free and sometimes I gotta pay
Walk in the mall, and they know what I'm 'bout say
Gimme the black, and the platinum, and leather gray
The ones in the back and the pair you got on display
Now, in the boxes is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should keep buyin' (keep buyin'), once or twice but never 3 times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell-toes

I like the all-white, high-top, strapped with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, they're dirty, that's why I got 'em
I leave them strapped and laced, they come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em, I damn near shot 'em
Now if you look and see lime green Forces, it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop, my niggas flip-flop
Yeah my Force Ones in tip-top now form a flip-flops
I like the limited edition, the khaki, and army green
Patent leather, pin stripes, you should see how I do the strings
Size 12 with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depends on when and where I'm at
Don't get me wrong, man: Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
'Cause if the shoe is on the shelf you should have some, man
You cannot sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You might not have three or four but you got one, man

We up in Foot Locker, I'm looking like I need those
10 1/2, and if you got 'em, give me two of those
I can tell she's never seen Murphy Lee befo'
'Cause she just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, ""Excuse me, miss, I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you, Murph, especially in the white and blue""
I said, ""The white and blue? Sounds nice, make it twice""
Then I signed an autograph, ""Thanks for the advice""
Yo, I keep it real dirty, dirty, you know how I do
Purple and gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like floppy with ankle socks, lows, mids, and high-tops
With the clear sole but it's Tims and fat laces when is cold
But when the winter go (brr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all-purpose with them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stoppin' this dough that I'm spendin' fo sho'
On them Nike Air Force N-E behind the O
Ok, Lee, I treat my shoes like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and the wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh with electric roof
Plus I put a kit on the sole, now I got a wider shoe (ooh)
You see that low misk with the purple coop, I'm driving them
(
)
10 is my size in them, and no point in tyin' them
Ain't no point of trying these on, they know I'm buying them
Now, don't nothing get the hype on first sight like white on whites
Them 3 quarters, the lows, they all tight
The only problem, they only good for one night
'Cause once you scuff 'em, you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis, the looks on store owners' faces
This kid is outrageous, he buying 'em by the cases
'Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces

Yo it be I man, fuckin' it up for errbody
I can't lie man, they thought I was just gettin' started
Peep the pie man, it's the American dream
I'm just participatin, my participation is game
(Nelly)
I'm makin' this one for the hotel, motel, Holiday Inns
Super 8, Red and the Ritz Carltons
All my niggaz that tryin' to ball, my niggaz ballin
All my soldiers and generals, errbody fall in
Stop stallin, pick up the phone and call in
Tell your boss you ain't gon make it to work in the mornin
And while you explainin go head and throw a cough in
And kindly explain that this won't happen often
But I'm long and I'm amazed, I'm be willin' then dazed
I rage that niggaz think that derrty don't need a cage
I should be put on display, for the display I'm displayin
Half you niggaz is dyin' and all the rest are decayin
I'm doin' tracks in hotels steady rockin' girls bells
Kinda like a young L residin in Nellyville
I never squeal, not the type to kiss and tell
But if I catch ya in the shower I might kiss ya tail
(Hook x2: Nelly)
Yo it be I man, fuckin' it up for errbody

Peep the pie man, it's the American dream
I'm just participatin, my participation is game
(Ali)
Now as I bounced off, Kyweezy writin movies
Slo done took that mask off
Mo's the leader what do ya know, Murph run his ass off
I got every whip, derrty even got a Nascar
And you know we fucked up at his house
Ayo my rain on weed, naps and Japanese
Clap at g's, smack 'em back on they knees
Drop on wack, simple facts that rap needs
And it's always Christ-a-mas and wrap trees
And I got my game, I said I got my game from the OG's
Smokin' reefer, moonshine pumpin OD's
Bought a old plain chain, yeah you know me
Shipped in from Cali got it home, cops'll know these
Yo we smashed the summer
We oughta recoup, call NASA to do the numbers
All the friendship on the vocals started fire in the booth
Got more whips and chains than amastad and russe
(Kyjuan)
Ali I'm sicka ballin, unnecessary phone callin
Man down, pimp in distress I think I'm fallin'
For anything but the okey doke
I'm old school like her and bones and nooky ropes
I can't stand no groupie folks
They want me to turn around like this is hokey poke
They wanna bring me down like Irv before I choked
I'm not a joke at all, I'm Quick-Draw-McGraw
And number 20 on the Lakers couldn't hold me y'all
I'm climbin over y'all, I'm still scorin
85 percenta y'all awake but still snorin
Got knowledge of self and now my style is much older now
We Derrty Ent., We all we got we hold it down
I'm feelin' cooler than cool, my wrist cold and wild
If there's a fashion king then I deserve the crown
I'm U-City, you dressin up I'm dressin down
And you keep messin up, me and your girl gon be messin
Around

From the Lou with a Grammy in my resi'
Nelly bought me a presi' with a diamond in the besi'
Tics taught me how to walk so when I run I be ready
Female fans sayin' that I'm they baby daddy
Whoa more attention than Justin and Janet
How I Midwest Swang and how I St. Louis Ram it
Derrty Ent. damnit, got more bread than a samich
And my wrist got more Nuggets than Carmelo and Camby
Look, I'm from the Lou and I'm important like the Arch
So tourists look for me like an important part shoot
Find your talent, use your talent get your money
Or don't find your talent and don't use it and stay bummy
But that ain't on me 'cause we built it from scratch
My neck shit is a house witha house in the back
Man I been wild since middle school, I was that little dude
That been around more waist lines than hula hoops"

My urrs and in my nose, my fingers and my toes
Translated into flows, man rap gon' need a facelift

Imagine me up in the sto', somewhere behind the counter
Pushin buttons on the drawer, like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind

Yo, know what I'm feelin'?
Check it...
I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
(Since we came down wit mo' sho' than the first time
I thought I'd go trade the Rover in for a six fo' this time)
A lil' mo' sho', listen to the switches go
Zoop, zoop... zoop zoop zoop
Zoop, zoop... zoop zoop zoop
I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
A lil' mo' doe, listen to the switches go
Zoop, zoop... zoop zoop zoop
Zoop, zoop... zoop zoop zoop
(Verse: Nelly)
You can find me, same city, same state
Carryin' more weight, fishin' wit more bait
More license plates than your DMV
Takin' more total request than your MTV
Errry, gaga, they call me Dada
The rookie wanna signin' bonus for that pu nada
But my, salary cap won't allow me to give a nada
I guess she be a free agent until she find anotha'
Call it fresh, for the D's on my ATVs
And if I squeeze niggas fallin' like they last name Keys
Dirties please, watch me as I switch my steez
First name GMC, last name Denali
Why the change? Yu-kon not fuck wit me
Eight batteries, four pumps where the trunk should be
I hear the conversations, about Nelly he overrated
I'm feelin' like Chris, slightly a little violated
(Verse: Ali)
Now what you lease I pay cash for, lit up like the dashboard
Went from the PJ's to livin' out past Ford
What the cash for? me to spend
Like the rims on the Benz while you pretend to got
I fuck twins from the back end
Back to the club and backed in
Went to the back end gotta announce we back in
The place where my crew go, iced out Jesus face and Parasucco
Bread sick I need your Pluto
Black Menudo, in the candy black two-door
BMW Sport, check the Ra Report
What you thought it was a widle? yeah, them seats swivel
Cats be killin' me talkin' ballin' and can't dribble
Bits in the Kibble, mnage trois was civil
Crystal y'all, head from all, 18 ta' 80 bar
Hit the mall nigga, and shop till we fall
And the bitches y'all be lovin' won't even bother to call
I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
A lil' mo' doe, listen to the switches go
Zoop, zoop... zoop zoop zoop
Zoop, zoop... zoop zoop zoop
(Verse: Kyjuan)
I'm comin' down down, baby, duck when you see me
When Kyjuan comin' the spray, yo it ain't graffiti
No I don't eat bullets, but I'll feed the needy
Throwup a L, but I won't smoke a L at the city
Truck is big, tires is meaty, yes indeedy
Excursion, lime-green so I know that you'll see me
Ky-Weeze done brought them cars out
No doubt, like numba' 3 on Free City CD
It not a game, I went from a GS to a LS
And LS don't mean low self-esteem
So clean, cats think I sip Ajax suit Vokal
Nights mis-match, hard from Zat
I smoke herb, but what's the harm in that?
Hey Mr. Officer, where Clarence Harmen at?
Only got caught once, where my warnin' at?
Been in St. Louis all my life, ain't seen a farmer yet
(Verse: Murphy Lee)
(Back in 1993) Was when a school boy decided to be an MC
(See some said no, others said fa' sho)
And now we comin' back down, this time in a six fo'
Zoop zoop, open ya mind up for this lineup
No, we don't pitch but rich is how we wind up
Situations, entrepreneurs get dollars and new toys
(Wait till they get a load of my Impala!)
We back back, matter fact goin' down down
You people need to calm down, Spreewells only goin' round
Actin' like you neva' seen a car dance befo'
They be askin' how does it feel like D' Angelo (how does it feel)
Picture wakin' up, all weed, bomb weed
Palm trees, no kickin' it on the beach
Have to work all day, dirty, 3 P.M. to 3
But at your local ATM you can find Murphy Lee
I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
A lil' mo' doe, listen to the switches go

Yo...
Aiyyo stand at attention, raise your right arm, salute
Roll the carpet out, watch all the Bloods ""woot-woot""
Watch the Crips loc' it up, we back, we got our focus up
St. Lunatics, nigga know that, know that
Supreme team, if we lose you open your minds
Start readin some things, we got it, holla at us, c'mon
Easy with that murder murder murder, kill kill
We did that back when I was born, Bill Bill
But I still do the knowledge, let me give you the math
I rock a 7-and-a-half for my 7-and-a-half
I be with Moses and Kane and Abel puttin' in work
I slap a nun, beat the reverend up, spit in his church
My Derrty niggaz come through, we turn the heat up in June
We at the party mackin, even throw a bitch in the room
Menage-a-trois, Murph' is {?}, me and Law
'Cause we the baddest muh'fuckers that you seen thus far, so
(Chorus 2X: Ali)
Nigga chill (chill) calm down (calm down)
Watch your words (watch your words) don't let your mouth get ahead of ya
You really talkin' wreckless right now (right now)
And we know you ain't built for that (nope)

Look, learn, listen, check it
Start your cars up, trick your broads out
Pump your hard up, homie now put your guard up
You throw that one-two but, look how I jab you
No need you run in the derrty, homie I had to
You was doin' a lot of talkin' (yup) a lot of barkin
But your bite was nothin', guess you mighta been frontin
Yo ain't no mic to it, City see right through it
I was born to be the shit like I was Mike Hewitt{?}
Don't, test me though, homie I might do it
Check my track record, the feelin' go right to it
It was easy for me, I was born to win
You was born to hate me, you should be born again
You with Mike and Kevin, we with Law and them
You cop American cars, we cop foreign 'em
Take a look at us derrty, we put the star in them
No slow stray bullets nigga, we Brett Favre'n them
(Kyjuan)
You gots to chill, and let your conscience be free
Lil' boy, obviously y'all ain't fuckin' with Ky'
You see I stays real high, but I be's low-key
I'm so allergic to the line e'rybody know me
You know what? (What?) Why shouldn't y'all hate?
Cause y'all so half decent, we Frosted Flakes great
And these ain't came out yet, I know y'all so late
I smoke zips, you pop 8's, damn what a waste
My lady is so happy, yours masturbates
You wash up in a sink, nigga I bathe in a lake
The way y'all copy our style ASCAP should make y'all pay
But they don't, so I'ma smoke a joint and get to the point
The muh'fuckin' point is keep my name out your mouth
Unless you sayin' how we repped the Lou, since we came out
We've been winners since we came out, yo' mouth keep my name out
You don't wanna see thirty cardinal birds with they thangs out

Murphy Lee God-body (like) take shit from nobody (nope)
Nelly bought it for me so that's my Maserati (yup)
Y'all know about me, I'm so far from sloppy (dirty)
You not a female nigga, so how can you top me?
My style can't be copied people trust me (trust me)
Even though you look like me, your flow musty (musty)
That means you stinkin, what you think's extinct
Been gone too long to even dig up the bones
I'm on my new-new, upgrade the kush from the doo-doo
That's a big step, but that's how niggaz from the Lou do
Last rap was too cool, but this one is too damn hot
You wack rappers think you hot when you not (this is why I'm hot)
All this I talk slick shit as if you really did shit
Thinkin' you deserve my spot, well thurr it is then
Gave niggaz time but now I'm back with a few of my friends
Lunatics 'bout to do this again, oh
(Nelly)
Uh, tell you somethin'...
You should see their faces when I walk in the facility
Mean mug, what's the purpose of you ice-grillin me?
You're killin' me but really B, you ain't on my radar
Always used the right amount of strokes, that's why I stayed par
I ain't no killer lil' silly nigga but they are
You got the same ride as me but that's just my day car
My decor, might be Levi's and a A-R
15 G's in my pocket just to play cards
So meet me in the casino, way in the back
Me and her fleein the scene, away in the 'Llac
She say she feelin' her bean, a green of a stack
She say she like it obscene, I'm way in the knack{?}
In fact, you niggaz ain't like me, you salty (nah)
Me, I'm like pepper 'cause I spice shit up

More up close and personal, it's just gon get worser now
From Prada to Vokal, the Tics are too versatile
Can't worry bout certain sounds, that come out these haters mouths
I realize they can't help it, just stay where you bow'n down

Might look like the type that be rob'n them purses
But I ain't I'm the yung dude I be rhyme'n them verses
Worked hard since '93 that's how I got signed to Universal
Now the girlies take they thongs off
And it be crazy in the club when that Lunatic song go off
I be that pull up right beside you beat'n bad type of Tic
I'm a hold up traffic to touch her ass type of Tic
Lunatic, that's what I am that's what I said I am
I'm try'n to be a millionaire I bet I am, I bet I am
(Verse 3: Kyjuan)
It's dem boyz on dem porches in Air Forces read'n Sources
My choice is ol' school's over dem Rolls Royce's
Of course this Tic shit live like EA Sports is
Dribble in the club I lay up wit two draft choices
Hit the center touch the point guard, she hit the joint hard
Oh wee oh Lord, she don't want no more
Cutlass is four door, stash for the 4.4
Smokes 1 44, what dem o's go for (Like oh)
350 1 more, 350 stick'n the floor brand new bizarre
Smashes, g 's and c's all in my glasses
Tics fantastic we get booked more than matches
Imagine, me without those two headbands
Them Vokal t-shirts with some 8 class pants
Feel'n dapper like Dan yes fresh like Mannie
Cutlass candies sit down you know you can't stand me
(Verse 4: Ali)
Band-aid, braids, bald head, fades, locks, stripy stocks,
Rocks in the watch
Big shorts, headband to a cross-jersey back Ross
That's that Mid-West talk, I think yo bitch'll bark, Batter Up
Naw cough, electric doors, Caprice Classic on these hoes
Ver big shows tell her best be on they toes
5 country grammar boys in bandana platinum no gold like (Oh)
That's what they say when I pull up on d's in that old Dr.J
Whole Aviat, fat laces this world is rat races
Head'n back places but it still seem racist
Got locations so I haul off the wall off if you could fall off
Got a room at the Wada wit a saw that'll take the wall off
Hit the mall off wit a sag hockey jersey du-rag
Fitted still switch'n two different shoes starchy wit tags"

I remember feburary 27 1994
Tryin' to make it to the hospital through 3 inches of snow
Somethings goin' wrong I can tell but I don't know
I got this feelin' in my gut this ain't how it supposed to go
3 pounds 2 ounces and 2 months premature
Straight to the incubator, is she gon make it? they ain't sure
Automatically, I placed the blame on my health
Hell I'm a father man, I placed the blame on myself
Was it somethin' that I smoked, did I eat, or did I drink it
Or was it somethin' I was doin' that I did or did not think it
Watchin her breathe through a hose in her nose
What's this EKG machine, what's this shit on her toes
It's 94 I'm 85 so I'm spooked as can be
I'm prayin' and I'm askin why he do this to me
See, I used to hold you in the palm of my hand
And jus to see you pull through, shit I knew you'd pull through
You, dontcha know I'd die for ya
I layd out my life for ya (I would, die for)
You, dontcha know I'd die for ya
I layd out my life for ya (I would, die for, you)
March the 2nd, 1999
The yurrr and the date I got my lil man
I guess I felt how my father felt and his father felt
And his father must have felt to see hiself
It's like a lil me in the flesh
He got my blood and my heart in his chest
Needless to say man I love him to death
Teach him never he disrespect me I'mma love him till death
Left to go outta town right after he was born
Got a record deal, 3 months later daddy was gone
It's like I'm tryna raise him over the phone
He barely know my face when he see it but he know my tone
I'm up at night like do he know who his daddy is
I'm real close to sayin' fuck the showbiz
But when I hurr him call his daddy now
And when I hurr him tell his friends I wanna be juss like my daddy now
Hope he forgive me for the sacrifice
So he can have a better life, than I had
You, dontcha know I'd die for ya
I layd out my life for ya (I would, die for)
You, dontcha know I'd die for ya
I layd out my life for ya (I would, die for)
You, dontcha know I'd die for ya
I layd out my life for ya (I would, die for)
You, dontcha know I'd die for ya

Free City
This is a shout out to every young brother ya know
That's doin' his thing right now
Keep ya head up...
He's walkin' the yard wishin he had wings
Ya know so he could fly up out that joint
Man
If I could, fly away
Ooh and I wouldn't come back no more
I, I'd turn around,
Just to see you for the last time,
See, now I know
Hey, that it won't be easy
I done fought in a battle, and I done made it this far
I gotta few more feet, but its still the longest yard
Man, it's the longest yard I ever had to get in my life
And see my life ain't right, if my wife don't write
My niggas can't eat if the fish don't bite
My raise the gross sales, like Mike and Ike
Now big brother almighty
I keep a gamma ray, I'ma G-5 G
Take a G-5 jeep, G-5 deep
Too some of their bare feet
And that jeep don't speak
Listen mayne they lock it down round herre
See body bag and gag and your found round herre
This as serious as it sound round herre
The guards guard the ground, 4 pounds round herre
And they ain't playin', they're just lettin you know
That anything they want to happen, nigga happen real slow
Get the word from upstairs, put you in that hole
I can't take it, I'm just ready to go
If I could, fly away
Ooh and I wouldn't come back no more
I, I'd turn around,
Just to see you for the last time,
See, now I know
Hey, that it won't be easy
I done fought in a battle, and I done made it this far
I gotta few more feet, but its still the longest yard
Yeah yeah, its still the longest yard
Uh uh, its still the longest yard
Um um, its still the longest yard
I done fought in a battle and I done made it this far
I'm in my cell 20 hours a day
And doin' push-ups ever hour a day
'Cause I'm tryin' to keep the cowards away
That's why I'm markin off the calendar days
Tryin' to get it out of the way
And I'm just tryin' to keep a piece of mine
And I'm gon shame a motherfucker with a piece of mine
'Cause he tryin' to take a piece of mine
So I'm gon slice his ass a piece at a time
But now that they close the door
Lock me in and cell 30 deep but its built for 10
Tell me what kind of world they got you in
With the barbed wire fences, box you in
From now, till they turn off the lights
I'ma read anything in sight
Its kinda hard tryin' to read at night
But I'ma change my life
And hope another brother take this flight
(Ooh no) I gotta make it out this place some how
(Ooh no) Man I really believe that I done turned it around
(Ooh no) You see, all I need is that second chance to show,
Since incarceration, my obligation to rehabilitation
(Ooh no) They can punch me high, and they can kick me low
(Ooh no) But I mean it's gonna take more than that for them to break my soul
(Ooh no) Man its hard for people to understand what it's like to be,
Gated, incarcerated, I just can't take it, but I'ma make it man to see better days
If I could fly away,
If I could I turn around,
If I could fly away"

Yo, uh, you didn't see this one comin' did ya
All the way from the N.O. to S.T.L... Nelly-Nel and Lil' Wayne

You know it and these cats hate it... I got nothing out dated
If it is it's up graded... S-class wit everything voice-activated
Chrome rim three, bladed, factory custom made it
Paid wit big faces; if it's broke then replace it
Now it's like that; Purple Haze and Cogniac
On tha beach in L.A. with dime bitches right gimme that
(Lil' Wayne)
I represent them street niggas
When it get hot carry that heat niggas
Them sweep niggas off they feet niggas
You livin' on the edge leap nigga
That's why my clique we do or die and roll deep nigga
Ain't nothing sweet nigga, recognize the bloody clothes
Ready to represent the Grove wit two calicoes
I carry 4's in my side pocket
While your's cockin, nigga mine's poppin'
Walk through you house wit my iron knockin'
Chorus: Nelly (repeat 2X) This is for my nigaaaaaz
Who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night

And for you niggas out there who be jacking the whips
Got a new group for ya, Nina Ross and the Clips
And from the hip I shoot, if you wanna get loose
But ta tell ya the truth ...I'm more focused upon my loot.
(Lil' Wayne)...I ain't no busta nigga
Came up out that Hollygrove dungeon nigga
Flame up and toast somethin' that'll get it sparking up in here

Slip me on a mask hit the Benz wit three choppers
Wheezy-wee potna

Six wrap the wrist, check the belt buckle Leave them wit it look
Like Nelly I didn't know
If you was the Jackie Frost then why didn't you say so
Somebody gotta shine my nigga why not me
Even my dentist told me floss 7 days a week
Freeza burnt out the piece Gucci and hat sweet
Butter soft leather seats for transporting freaks

I'm on my way to my show, uh, shirt Polo
Gortex figaro, jeans Hilfiger though
Starched up, hit the Amoco
Bought a Philly, sparked up
Lunatics'll blow the park up
Ooh this herb, got me geekin like a nerd
F what you heard, federal like a bird
You were, actin' funny when you first saw me
Now, I'm makin' jams have you be like ""go Lee""
Hell nah trick, I'm picky now
I'm spiffy now, smoke sticky now
Hit the door at the club yellin' ""grip and love""
Met me with a dub, was it fire playa, what
Straight to the bar, got a Henny and Coke
Ain't been here five minutes, rats sendin me notes
Could it be the way I get down, the way I throw down
I don't know, but it's one thing I know for sure
And that's...
Some of y'all been tryin' to write rhymes for years
Till we got theirs
Here a take my ends
Is this the best that you can make?
But if not, and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long
'Cause I'm a move on the dance floor
When they put somethin' smooth on
Turn up the bass, it's better when its loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd
(Ali)
Like my homie Jo Day
Burgundy six straight
I'm lookin' swoll day
You fools know me
No way, am I goin' out like a busta
What's I been? last long like a wrestla
Givin' out degrees for dat p-h
Raised on the n-o-r-t-h side of this be-aitch
Re-ach real son, huh, like soon as you hear it
Push that bun out?, break and leave the room
Get you own cop, peace of doom?
Bulletproofin' pac, my hit gon baloon
Position is assumed, lunatic platoon
Leavin' 'em all like a typhoon, ghetto tycoon
Cats waist deep, they don't take how we think
Actin' hard like they shit don't stink
Knowin' they strange like the rink
True color be pink, rinky dink
Big Lee need a shrink
'Cause I'm startin' to think...
(Nelly)
In my spare time unwind and grind fools like coffee
Softly is how I speak to them punks who come actin' salty
Then Ali, I let this thing go (booyaah!), back on the farm
I heard you was on my tail now you yellin' ""nelly, you lost 'em""
Fool, my click is off the hook like O.J
Fool, there ain't no way, that we could ever be deep in four-play
Run and ask your lady
Smokin' hay-hay-hay
I bust a rhyme, and a line off them draws, my sign for all a y'all
Be that F on the top of skyscrapers, my lyrics rape ya
Tape your mouth like a hostage, 'cause you be talkin' garbage
Makin' my stomach nauseous with that shhh, straight up
Tryna' compare your click to mine, you need to hide and catch up
Only that Duff? know I'm a liar, makin' you fools transpire
To sweatshirts like Champion attire, so why you try-ah
Lunatic for hirrrrrrre (hahahahaha)
I'm startin to think that..."

It's like hate taking over the whole world, what is it over?
Suicide, man, that's the devil trying to control us, they told us
But we didn't notice the pain was sitting on they shoulders
The world was just a polar, the rather live in the solar
System got us hopeless, and focused on forclosures
Wake up and smell the folgers... oh momma and bring home the soldiers
Osama, you owe us, the 9 11 was bogus, now we right back at him
Say the war is our motive
Wake up early in the streets of the block, streets of the block
He posted up on the corner like a soldier in the drill but he wouldn't stop
Living life in the battlefield, battlefield, trying to survive every day and every night
It's the same deal
Lifes strange lifes strange, times change times change, but karma always finds the way
Stay strong, stay strong, hold on, hold on
Don't let all your dreams fade away
Yeah life can beat you down, what goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground, it's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going, till it feels like I'm giving my life away
Gets hard, and harder, happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way
Cause on my own is a better way
A lot of mothers they just don't understand, they just don't understand
They think we're hard on our sons but we gotta teach our boys how to be a man
They only know when they walk out the door, when they walk out the door
See we can show 'em how to fire but they gotta teach themselves how to reload
Cause unenployment is harder than its ever been, sometimes it feels like I can't win
And even through all the rules keep changing, I'm stronger now than I was when I came in
Yeah life can beat you down, what goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground, it's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going, to feel like I'm giving my life away
Gets hard, and harder, happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way
Cause on my own is a better way
Hey, hey, going through the back streets like I got beef
Carnival for carnivores with the sharp teeth
Animalistic it's why we call the cops beast
We're on the hunt, 'cause they're hungry for the dark meat
I'm rapping through my heart beat, brain is the base, my heart is the drum
Give the drum some, promis of a better life is all I got to give
I ain't just trying to survive, I'm trying to live
Cause all I want is a better way
Hey, if you're not prepared the world can be so cold
All that you can do is your best and just hope
In time the truth will show, just stick to what you know
Get a grip on something real and never let it go
And go, keep going, to feel like I'm giving my life away
Gets harder, and harder, happiness is worth the wait

I see you niggaz ain't rentin and leasin these cars
Frontin like you buy and buy and buy and buy 'em
Claimin that you makin' so much paper but I know
That I know that you a liar liar liar liar
Let a grand hang out, let a grand hang out
Dip deep into your pockets, let a grand hang out
Let a grand hang out, let a grand hang out
If you ballin then quit the stallin, let a grand hang out
(Nelly)
Uh, uh, uh, c'mon!
Hey yo, I pull up so aggressive nigga, hoppin out the thang
Ice drippin wet like I just hopped up out the rain
My picture perfect pose like I hopped up out a frame
Ain't a coach on the planet that can take me out the game
My heart beats forever like my name was Eddie King
A Midwest rider like my derrty Jesse James
The CEO of Derrty and he go by Cornell Haynes
Mean-muggin all you niggaz like I hopped up out your dame
I'm like uh-oh, there he go-oh
A hundred and twenty up Natural Bridge in that Mo-Mo
Slippin and slidin, look how he ridin' pass the po-po
He blazin' that fire behind the {?} they don't know-oh
Whoo! I'm really thinkin' of changin my name to Krispy Kreme
I'm do-nuts nigga, let me tell you what I mean
I'm paper chasin, chasin the paper, you chasin dreams
My money gettin' stronger like it's takin' Creatine
(Nelly) Uh, uh, uh
(Young Tru)
My pockets like Wyclef Jean, the +Fu-gees+
We them locksmith boys, we keep a few ki's
Caterpillar pimp, that butterfly whores
Lamborghini spreewells, butterfly doors
Some'n like McDonald's when I move in packs
Quarter-Pound Supersized bullets and Big Mac's
House longer than I-70, arise ten stories
And I still +Rob+ niggaz just like Horry
Everybody hate on Young Tru boy
'Cause they know that the nigga on fire fire fire fire
Rap phenomenon - soon as the album drop
Artists don't eat like the month of Ramadan
Derrty this, Derrty that, guess I'm a Derrty cat
Sellin niggaz some chickens, rob 'em get the birdies back
Plumber of the game, that flood the state
In a stretch Phantom, with more Windows than Bill Gates {*echoes*}
(Nelly) Uh, uh, Joey Crack!
(Fat Joe)
Yeah... they lease and we buy 'em, we peace and they crime
They dyin' 'cause we street, keep heat, and keep firin
Y'all know, top of the world's my motto (uh)
Anna Kournikovia, baby girl's my model (uh)
All I wanted in life is to be a soldier
Now you can find me with chicks just doin' yoga
Meditation that Marley, the hydraulicals
You heard Big, go check the Brown, they might hire you
High definition to any form of telecast
Me and young derrty got plenty hoes and hella cash
All I need is a minute to ""Shatter Your Dreams""
And we about to sell more than Avril Lavigne (biatch!)
And all I do is rep the hood where the jugs be
Can't help it if the folks at MTV love me
Y'all see the T.S. we shinin, come to the B-X we grindin
Y'all wanna be us keep tryin', we buyin, he's lyin'
(Nelly) Uh... uh, ladies!

We like, fuck, that; I need a stack
And like, forty-nine to go with that
I'm quick to, tell a hoe her flow is wack
The type to, cop the jersey, throw it back
See I can stunt and tell a chick ""Yo let your man hang out""
Since he frontin like it's nothin', let a grand hang out
Fuck a handout, I been gettin' {?} since way back
Can't wait to see they faces when I drop the Maybach
You lyin', you claim you buyin but you rentin and leasin
If you pimpin' and niggaz spendin, where's the paper you seein?
Stop stallin, I'm ballin, call me Sheryl Swoops
Can't stand the backseat driver, that's why I cop the Coupe
Yeah, I been testin law with the darkest tints

Fuck the game, don't let the game fuck you

I - opened up shop at 13
Dimes, dubs, quarter sacks and O-Z's
From hand-held, digital to triple-beam
Now my pa-ger's an e-mail flip screen
Expanded my game off into amphetamines
Looked around and had a small wall green
But tha word out on tha street is that you fucked wit my fiends
Them niggas around tha corner then let tha thing beam
Now they done let it burn out, phone a ching ching
Just another - hustle to add to my schemes
Just another piece of the puzzle to my dreams
'Cause the house, the cars, and the coffee take green
I might ride tha range wit tha Roley on the rocks
Or push a candy colored cutless wit a matchin' T-shirt
When the - spot get hot don't stop, move shop
Find another block restock and take it from the top now

And hoes ignored me, now they blow me
Them niggas that loaned me now they owe me
Oh me Oh my I can see tha greed and tha envy in yo eyes
Now call me a lie
While you five stand by I stand by tha captain
Hoe play now did somebody page Samson
I stay cheefin' higha than a hooker on the weekends
Seven days a weekend man, I walk in yo church reekin
Now Lester called me a heathen old fish eyed fool
Bitch had the nerve to repeat old fish eyed fool

What tha hell y'all fuckin' wit me fo?

""Oh you a smart ass ha?"" Nah that's my lil joke
""How bout I tow yo truck in?"" Ain't no need to be provoked
Besides everything up in here done been smoked
I ain't got nuttin but tapes and CDs
Pocket full of G's and two tickets across seas
So me and my boo can lay under the palm trees
Ain't no more questions then hand me my ID
You could tell he was pissed
'Cause the black man in the black range
Doin' black things wit his black change
Doin' the right thing, drivin' his ass insane
And if I wasn't in his face he probably be callin me names"

I'm like Magic to Kareem, mayne you tell me I ain't Worthy
I ain't speakin' 'bout a jersey, I'm speakin' 'bout income
Did you hear that elizabeth? here come the big one!
I put mo' money in the community than you got in yo' budget
I wipe my ass with yo' advance to the toilet then flush it
My last stance be a stance of a General Custard
I hot dog 'cause I can, I got the cheese and mustard
I got the stats of a hall of famer - in just two records
That's why I'm back up at the Superbowl - with Julius Peppers
I got that cain't stop, won't stop, in my veins
That's why they cain't stop, won't stop, screamin the name
NELLY! NELLY! Go tell a friend to tell a friend
I'ma keep the same grin whether I, lose or win

Ain't no way they can stop me now Nelly
'Cause I'm on my way, I can feel my ring comin'
It's the blood of a champion, pumpin
Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be runnin'
I'ma get what I can and more, even if
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothin'
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me)
(It's the heart of a..) in me
:
I'm the first pick, the first round, signin bonus profound
Playin' for his hometown, reppin for the home ground
And gettin' buffer like Michael Riggs, tell 'em again
I gets buffer like Michael Riggs, heard what I said?
The MV-P of the game, intensity still the same
I'm shootin out from my reign, with Peyton Manning type aim
Can't stop me from scorin so they results are just hackin
So there's, three of us now - me, A.I. and Shaq'n
From the look to the as I say
Hover man with more heart than Hallmark on Valentine's Day
I'm the one that you've been Raven about, like Ray Lewis
I think it hard to go and change your route
Cause you don't know if I'm blitzin or if I'm sittin' and readin
Waitin for you to go and trip, drop back and throw up a brick, man
Ain't no way they can - blow, ain't no way they can - blow
Ain't no way they can - blow, ain't no way they can - blow
:
It's like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it
If hard work pays off then easy work is worthless
My work habit ain't no habit man, I do it on purpose
I push myself to the limit so my talent'll surface
So now it's, curtains and drapes, on anybody who hates
Dislikin what I'm recitin, bitin what I've been writin
I've been dogfightin, scratchin and clawin on every height
Tryin' to make you remember me like you +Remember the Titans+
'Cause I'm a WARR-IOR, my daddy was a soldier
A Vietnam vet, lil' derrty I thought I told ya
I'm supposed ta, whip up your town in Testarossas
Heatin like Folgers mayne, I'm young black and rich
As good as it gets, and givin' your point guard fits

I just gotta bring it to they attention dirty
That's all...
You better watch who you talking bout
Runnin' your mouth
Like you know me
You gonn fuck around and check
Why they surely
They call me ""show me""
Why one-on-one you can't hold me
If your last name was Haynes
Only way you wear me out
Is stretch my name on your pen
No resident of France
But you swear I'm from Paris
106 Karats
Told 'em ""Naw that's pure rich""
Trying to compurr (compare) this
My chain to your chain
I'm like sprint and Motorola
No service, out of your range
Your out of your brains
Thinking I'ma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways
Than that
To catch your fame
Only pressure you applying
Is time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blind side
Taking your sleeves off
As much as we's lost
Still hard to please boss
Don't be lying
And crying
Sucking the bezel loss
Cause your
Ass is wack
Your whole
Lable is wack
And matter fact
Eh eh eh eh eh hear that
I-Am-number one
No matter if you like it
Ready take this sit down and write it
I-Am-number one
Hey hey hey hey hey hey
Now let me ask you man...
What does it take to be number one?
Two is not a winner
And 3 nobody remembers (hey)
What does it take to be number one?
Hey hey hey hey
Do you like it when I shake it for ya?
Daddy? Move it all around?
Let you get a peep before it touches the ground?
(Nelly)
Hell yeah
Ma I'm in a girl that's willing to learn
Willing to get in the driver's seat
Willing to turn
And not concerned about that
He say, she say, did he say, what I think he said?
Squash that
He probably got that off E-bay
Or some Internet access
Some website chat line
Mad 'cause I got mine
Ooh don't wind up on the flatline
Oh if my uncle could see me know
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulating my style
Right to the ""down down""
Can he bout to score now
Better wait till they calm down
I got hella shorty's
Coming askin me ""Yo where the party?""
Oh lordy till I continue to act naughty
Mixing cris at the party
Got me banging fo sho
I'm not a man of many words
But there's one thing I know
Pimp-
Hey yo I'm tired of people judging what's real Hip-Hop
Half the time you be them niggas who's fuckin' album flop
(You know) Boat done sank and it ain't left the dock
(C'mon!) Mad 'cause I'm hot
(He just) Mad 'cause he not
You ain't gotta gimme my props
Just gimme the yachts
Gimme my rocks
Keep my fans coming in flocks
Till you top the Superbowl
Keep your mouth on lock
Shhhhh I'm awake ha ha
I'm cocky on the mic
But I'm humble in real life
Taking nothing for granted
Blessing errthing on my life
Trying to see a new light
At the top of the roof
Baby ain't not single
But I speak the truth
I heat the booth
Nelly acting so uncouth
Top down shirt off
In the coupe
Spreadin the loot
With my
Family and friends
And my
Closest to kin
And I
Do it again
If it means I'ma win
Dirty I am

I got a whole heard of cows ta die for my 6'
Hockey players pagin' me to practice on my wrist
20 inch Aqua treads so my whip don't slip
Pullin' up bringin' joy (Joi) like my nigga Big Gipp
If I go on a rampage then watch my mo' flip
Draw from both hips, emptyin' both clips
Got a whole lotta niggas wanna ride wit' me
Now that a niggas so hot, can strike fire from me
Thinkin' Nelly 'posed to take 'em outta poverty
But when I tell 'em no, they think of robbin' me
Son ain't no stoppin' me, some are home at Iceland
Hang with penguins, like that's my reason (that's my reason)
Like Earth, Wind and Fire, my parts that's freezin
Last time you seen Nelly, snowin' in June
You ever had a bicoastal orgy happen off in yo' room
But what happen's in Cancun, stay's in Cancun
(Chorus-2x) (Nelly)
Icey that, icey this
Icey neck, icey wrist
Icey cris, I see miss
Icey 6 tha sea six
Icey fits on five, icey tips

I live the nice way, I store my jewels in an ice-tray
How you want it, the man or the mice way?
Take two of the karats, call me in the mornin have an ice-day
I stay in more leather than Andrew Dice Clay
You might say I'm arrogant, just because I ain't sharin' it
If the check ain't seven digits, I'm tearin' it
If the 'Tics can't fit in my whip, then I ain't steerin' it
Bombed Antartica, now a nigga wearin' it
Catch me on my set wit' an iced out chain
An iced out rapper wit' a iced out name
A cold hand shake because of my pinky rang
Iced-out Cartier's with a iced-out frame
Catch me in an iced-out Range wit' icey dames
Puffin', bling-bling, while she do tha damn thang
I'm spendin' half my changes on clockin' thangs
And I got a icey game like hockey man
(Ali)
I gave knowledge to scientists who brains was locked
They didn't know that Iceland was just my jewelry box
And then the South Pole, that's when I used to slang O's
And moved to keys and bought diamonds outta control
My poppa, Snow Man, momma, Eskimo
So many rats that I need pest control
Would cop from Jacob, but I don't know where he at
So till I found that cat I guess I'll roll wit' Zach
And puff sacks in the hydraulic-dancin' cars
Gotta a caulus on my hand for poppin' Branson jaws
Bitches be prancin' hard 'cause they know we maintain
With enough ice to freeze rain in a woodgrain Range
Dual exaust playa, I keep some soft
It's da gloss-boss, the floss-frost across the Randy Moss
Until we meet again, y'all keep on servin' 'em out
Nicky Sach, AKA, George Durban, what?
(Murphy Lee)
Young dude 'bout to do this like a veteran
Long shorts, tall Timberland's
Flossin' in my icey Vokal, Varsity letterman
Icey headband to hold my baby-dreads in
That's what it is and what it's betta been
'Cause when I get cold I freeze, when I'm hot, I'm water
On ice at all times, hittin' hockey player's daughters
I'm like Ralph and the Honeymooners (Why I oughta!)
Put ice on the S-T-L and my role model for startas
I'm like icey as frozen foods with frostbit friends
Who all like 'em thin with icey rear-ends, nine outta ten get hit
Seven outta nine givin' icey head in the icey whip
School boy keep a icey fit for icey mits
Who like icey that and icey this
Smoke a icey spliff gettin' icey lit
By these Pizza Hut delivery chicks who love tips
(City Spud)
Aiyyo, I'm icey when you say Lunatics gon' ride
Love when ya call me to make yo C.D. hot
Niggas mad sayin', ""How you go from bottom to top?""
Juan B behind me when I do TV slots
Now I'm at the bar floatin' from the icey jaw
Know who we are when I pull up in tha icey car
I ice the chain 'cause niggas got twice the change
I ice the ring and niggas go to sortin' the game
So if I'm hot, I'm hot, if you not, you not
And if I'm clockin' dough, let me tick and tock
And if love ready to rock, yo I'm hot to trot
Courtney B. ready to rock, I'm hot to trot
Yellow Mack ready to rock, I'm hot to trot
Cuda Love say I'm hot then I'm buyin' a yacht
And a drop to shock these niggas who jock D's

See every other day is like she throwing new shit at me
A constant petty complain about every single thing,
Hard to swagga maintain Shorty driving me insane
And in the beginning I'll Admit it, if you said it I was on it
And even if I thought you did me wrong Girl I was coping
I guess a nigger was hoping thinkin' bout eloping
See I just call it focus, but some might call it open
It's like I'm compromising everything I stood for
I'm breaking rules that every nigger in the hood know
One, weigh it yourself, two, never play yourself, three, it don't matter girl
I throw 'em out the window cause for you
I bend over backwards, I'd do anything you say
I'm here for you baby, don't have to worry about me
A litile bit goes a long way
If I give you one, would you want two, if I give you two
Would you want three
They say A litile bit goes a long way,
If I give you one, would you want two, if I give you two
Would you want three
Somebody say relationships should be like 50-50
How come I feel I'm giving mine but not receiving any
Why must you make it so hard to play the part
I put you in the light but yet you leave me in the dark
And every time I think of you before, you go back
And every time I think our train is straight you jump track
What the fuck was that?
You always doing that, let me turn the shit on you
And let mesee how you react
It's like I'm compromising everything I stood for
I'm breaking rules that every nigga in the hood knows
One, weigh it yourself, two, never play yourself, three, it don't matter girl
I throw 'em out the window all for you
I bend over backwards, I'd do anything you say
I'm here for you baby, don't have to worry about me
A litile bit ... goes a long way
If give you one, would you want two, if I give you two,
Would you want three X 2
If I gave in inch, would you want a foot
If I gave that foot, would you want a yard
If I gave that yard, would you want a mile
If I gave that mile, would you want the town?
I wanna give everything you want
I wanna be everything you need
I'm right here for you baby girl
Don't have you worry about anything
Id bend over backwards, I'd do anything you say
I'm here for you baby, don't have to worry about me
A litile bit ... goes a long way

Now I'm tryin' to do some things that'll make you proud
Instead of every time I call it's to bail me out
Oh why didn't I listen to things you used to tell me
Knowin' that everything that you said would never fail me
Like 'they got plans for ya
Ain't nothin' I can do when them laws get they hands on ya'
But I ain't listenin, even payin' attention
I'm just tryna get mine
Takin' advantage, you would get two jobs at the same time
Ungrateful, complainin about Nike and Polo signs
But you always come through, and what do I do
I wreck both ya cars, stole money from ya drawers
Sold dope out ya yard, stayed into with them laws
Tryin' to pay you back for all the stress that I caused
And always be there to give you whatever you want
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)

I send ya props 'cause you the only one that stuck through
When I'm upset and stressed you give me back rubs
When I'm depressed you give me head off in the bathtub, E-I!
On ya P's and Q's, on ya Q's and P's
You hear my beeper goin' off and you just throw me my keys
Ain't even askin me yo is it coochie or G's
And for that reason now you can ask me for anything
Not a for real smoker but you choke with me
Not too hot about the drinkin' but you toast with me
Livin' at ya granny house you kept the dope for me
And wouldn't hesitate to go to court for me
Need money, my boo'll go and work the avenue
My boo'll fuck you up if I ask her to
That's why I do the things I do
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want

How long he gone? oh, dat long
How the hell he get time like that
3 strikes for possession aww he ain't coming back
He left you with two kids and bills all around
Plus you found out he had another chick cross town
It's always the darkest right before the sun rises
And you gotta stay strong for the kids in they eyes'n
Please don't despise and go against all brothers
And have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another
I hate to sound 2pac-ish li'l mama keep your head up

With a sign...'will work for food, clothes or cash'

Clean the windsheild and throw out the trash so I let him
Hey, I even asked a brother his name
Where he was from, got kids man and what's they ages
He kinda stared for a second, he kinda looked surprised
That anyone would even take an interest in his life
He said, ""young brother them the only words I've heard in the last year
Wasn't no or get the fuck away from herrrr""
How could something so simple as general conversation
Mean much more than general conversation

Then in any natural disaster, disease or gang wars
Before guns they was swords and they was killin' each other

I took the Phantom to the Opera, same van roll through the ghetto
Can we leave hurr? Shorty need to make up her mind
I seen them niggaz over there, but they ain't takin' my shine
Got 7 niggaz tryin' to be me, out here breakin they spine
But they got 7 different levels for they minions to mind
I want you both shorty (oh) go get it crunk shorty (oh)
I see your A-T-L stamp and go' head and stomp shorty (oh)
I got that shake now, and don't be scared now

I even got a little swagger in my limp for it
I done had, sex in the city plus sex in the country
You know - sex in the zoo di-rectly behind the monkeys
Hold up! Don't get me wrong, I'm lookin' for Ms. Right
But tonight ain't the time, I'm lookin' for right now
It's two-thousand-fo', I'm in a new home
Threw out the Bentley bought a Double R {?}
It's like I'm holdin' on to permanent mistletoe, I think you been sittin' low
I got a driver dirty, he come when the whistle blow

(Na-nana-na) I'm smoother than you know

I'm throwin' nuggets out the fellow I push to Carmello
Yellow on yellow flooded the band and the bezel
Hear me now! Oh, no, did you see the hue?
I took the Phantom to the Opera, same van roll through the ghetto
Can we leave hurr? Shorty need to make up her mind
I seen them niggaz over there, but they ain't takin' my shine
Got 7 niggaz tryin' to be me, out here breakin they spine
But they got 7 different levels for they minions to mind
I want you both shorty (oh) go get it crunk shorty (oh)
I see your A-T-L stamp and go' head and stomp shorty (oh)
I got that shake now, and don't be scared now
'Cause we can come from the kitchen up to that bed now
Shit it ain't nuttin to a boss, I heat you like air off
It ain't nuttin, they ain't cuttin', they frontin, that's they loss
Cause the, 'Tics is good, and the van is paid off
And I done got so damn cocky I took that Band-Aid off

Uh, picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Third album, same focus, my intent is to get richer
I'm with my dirty Jazze Phizzle, he yieldin that instrumental
Youse a cold-ass nigga on the track (SHO' NUFF!)
Man - I'm tired of poppin' these bottles, tired of fuckin' these models
I'm tired of these menage-a nights - yeah right (PSYCH!)
I was built for it, I got hip for it
I even got a little swagger in my limp for it
I done had, sex in the city plus sex in the country
You know - sex in the zoo di-rectly behind the monkeys
Hold up! Don't get me wrong, I'm lookin' for Ms. Right
But tonight ain't the time, I'm lookin' for right now
It's two-thousand-fo', I'm in a new home
Threw out the Bentley bought a Double R {?}
It's like I'm holdin' on to permanent mistletoe, I think you been sittin' low
I got a driver dirty, he come when the whistle blow
(Nelly)
(Na-nana-na) I'm smoother than you know
(Na-nana-na) Cadillac do's and bank rolls
(Na-nana-na) I simply go places you can't go
Ain't see me in no Linc', but you know that derrty in Brougham

Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past fo'
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin' home, tomorrow
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O. (hey)
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryin' to wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, ""You know what you do to me""
She starts off, ""But I don't usually"" (let's go)
Then I, whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South (aoowww)
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked - it all work

97,Nellyville,2002,Nellyville (2002),Hip Hop|Pop|R&B,Nelly,"Welcome to Nellyville where all newborns get a half-a-mill'
Sons get the tan DeVille soon as they can reach the wheel
And daughters get diamonds the size of their age, help me out now
One year get one carat, two years get two carats
Three years get three carats, and so on into marriage
Nobody livin' average, everybody jang-a-lang
Nobody livin' savage, e'rybody got change
Even the paperboy deliver out the back of a Range
It's not a game, it's a beautiful thang
Imagine blocks and blocks of no cocaine, blocks with no gunplay
Ain't nobody shot, so ain't no news that day
Ain't nobody snitchin', they refuse to say
Every month we take a vote on what the weather should be
And if we voted rain, vote how wet we want it to be
And if we voted snow, vote how deep we want it to get
But the sun gon' shine ninety-nine percent in Nellyville
There's no way, there's no way, no way, no way
I (I) I could explain
The way I feel right now
There's no way, there's no way, no way, no way
I (I) I could explain
The way I feel about livin' in Nellyville
I got that good at e'ry gas station, pull on up
Give me a half a ounce of that shit, fill it up
We got straws for the bottles, outlaw the cups
And we gon' make it happen, ain't no need for no luck
Ain't no lotteries, no pick 3's or pick 2's
Keep the money in your family, gamble amongst your crew
Cause the dice gon' do what the dice gon' do
And if you take a life, you gon' lose yours too
Ain't no trials, it's automatic, you drop 'em right where it happen
You do unto others, if you don't want it, don't do the cappin'
Think that's cool, forty acres and a mule
Fuck that, Nellyville: forty acres and a pool
Six bedrooms, full bath with a jacuzz
Six-car garage, pavement smooth
Both front and back deck, 'nough room to land a jet
And you ain't reached the city, that's just the projects
There's no way, there's no way, no way, no way
I (I) I could explain
(I could explain, I could explain)
The way I feel right now
There's no way, there's no way, no way, no way

The way I feel about livin' in Nellyville
(Everybody, uh, now everybody say)
Well I want to go, please let me go
I need to go down to Nellyville
I need to see what I can see
Won't you and me go to Nellyville
I want to go so bad
I just want to go and look
Won't you please take me on in
I just know I gotta be there
No unexpectancy like teenage pregnancy
And physical mental attraction your only ecstasy
Your own destiny, create your own recipe
If you ain't livin' accordin' to dirty, then you stressin me
(And who are you) Who me, I'm the mayor
(Oh) And any problems you got, I live up thurr
(Where's that) The house on the hill, welcome mat of fur
When you pass by that thang, be polite and don't sturr
There's no way, there's no way, no way, no way

The way I feel right now
There's no way, there's no way, no way, no way

I was forced to live the crazy life
Y'all niggas don't understand what a day be like
But a son know my Pop's didn't raise me right
When Hennedy don't pay me right
No Baby wipes
Keep the 3-80 tight
The Mercedes dyke
On a shady night
Y'all niggas is lady like
Blow for niggas that'll watch your arm
Run in your crib pop your Mom
Like bitch with stocks and bonds
In the studio a thug wanna lock your calm
Tell a nigga I'm like flex I drop the bomb
You come to war with a switch blade
Get laid
Nigga Imma spit the gauge at your rib cage
We thugged out
Y'all niggas is bitch made
You pick Jay they North white the shit grade
Yor cousin looks mad ready to let the clips spray
Out of a week I stay in a lab for 6 days
I run my right guard incase my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
I turn it up a degree
Your secrets still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat
(Teamsters)
I'm second to none nigga
Yo I'm lettin my gun
Pull this trigger shit off the window
Through the head of your son
I've been runnin' like 20 miles
I ain't sweatin' for fun
Yo it's hard to be a team when the second is one
'Cause I follow very
Wanna wife like Halle Berry
Yeah I ain't tryna be locked up under consolitary
Like it don't stop
Nigga I stop for food
How you gonna pop a nigga that pop for you
Hushed out in the drop top
Aqua blue
Get the bitch screamin' ""Please, Please, not my boo""
My revolver shook like I deal with smart crook
You know the name
Switch up the game like Garth Brooks
Like ten cars with tire, hoes and and winstars
I been hard through hell better sing God
Diminish, I'm a bull dog, breathing British
You ain't site cause your night show is all about your image

I've seen on the bricks of the little front
At colorses, check the ashtrey that hold the blunts
We hustling, I do the push ups and the sit ups nigga
Get muscular
Just incase you let your lips slip up
I'm bustin' ya
Never let 'em see you sweat
Yeah that's my motto
Catch 'em in the club get wrecked
With the bottle
The silencer behind his neck
The others follow
Show them you ain't bullshittin
And you ain't hollow
I saw you talkin' to that chick
Up over there
I heard you ask her why she on my dick
Yeah, yeah
I heard it all before ya dig
Next thing y'all tellin' me none of y'all put that on my fuckin' kid
What you think this is
I'm the reason they invented the whole navigational system
So niggas can't find they trucks and they women when I'm with em
Like I catch 'em in linen
And then I flip 'em and run up in em
Send her back to him
And go to his house and blow him with her
Never let 'em see you sweat

If what you spittin' ain't hittin then - check your aim
Your record sales start to slip and then - Nelly to blame
Now who you know come through first time on the scene
No set-ups, no guest appearances in between
Fire like a nigga drinkin' gasoline
I keep it hot, like my dirty down in New Orleans
The Rams won the Superbowl, bought myself a ring
Whether you sparkle or you bling, don't matter same thing
Thug wearin ice like Don the King
I'm gettin' pissy, with Tissy, Missy and Irene
Real close friends that like to try things
Me and my dirties we like to buy things
Fuck around and give me a license to fly things
Look up in the sky and have a Nelly sighting, like

Oh, congratulations on that anyway too, so
But, for a long time it's been somethin' I need to tell you
Uh, uh, uh - listen
(Singing: Nelly)
You see we been knowin' each other since we were about this high
Same elementary, shared the same bus stop
Even as a youngster I knew you was so fly
Even back then I knew you were the one
I watched you grow, I watched your transformation
Right through school to your current occupation
It took this long for me to man up and have this conversation
But xxxx it, here it go
(Chorus: Nelly)
I want you, to want me
Girl I need to know that, I can be your one and only
I need you, to need me
See you were my worst mistake girl, and that's why
It's hard to keep my cool when I see you with him
'Cause I really wish that you were right here
Tell me what's it take to win just a - piece of your heart
My only kryptonite is you, that's why anything you say I'll do
So let me stop for a minute, take a second to say
Girl you take my breath away, away
Girl you take my breath away (away)
You take my breath away, you take my breath away, yeah

Uh, uh, it's like I die a little every time I see you with this guy
Thinkin' to myself, ""now why the hell she with that guy""
While she ain't by my side, we would be so fly
We would live that life
The life you used to dream is all about rapp-in
Back when I used to pull my bmx up alongside of your schwinn
See, and here we are again
Funny how fate brought my phantom up alongside of your benz
And still

You seen me go through, I seen you go through

Just waitin right thurr
Waitin for my perfect chance so I can spit out my word
I think she openly, is scopin me
Damn I hope she notice me
Hopefully she go for me
And so she on the boat with me
And imma take her places she can never imagine
Like water skiiing in costa rica, snow mobiling in aspen
She prefer to go, to winter snow, or do she like it tropical
Am I dreamin', let me know
And tell me is it possible, that I can be the one to end her search for a man
And she could be my one to end my search for romance
No time to slack now, act now
Oh I'm about to crack now, I put my rap down, mack down
Ain't no turnin' back now, I got this feelin' that she feelin' the same

I said that's good to know, say no more
I'll be there around 4
Around 4, that 4 door, standin at ur front door
And we can take it for a ride, kick it and conversate
U baited this fate,
Dinner reservations at 8
And after dinner, champaigne
Walks along the beaches, while that moonlight
Shines on ur features,
And i, can't create the words to explain my sudden urge
The temptation to feel ur body
Temptation to kiss the curves
It started one kiss, two kiss
She all on my neck now
Gimmie that three kiss, four kiss
I'm all on her neck
Now da temperatures risin'
Hips and thighs, got me
Hypnotize me, I don't wanna stop

Just one for the house... c'mon
Pimp juice - ooh
I think I need to let her loose (might think I need to let her loose)
Let her loose, let her loooooose
She only want me for my pimp juice (that's all she want me for f'real)
Not my pimp juice, I'm talkin' her pimp juice
I think I need to cut her loose (it's time for homegirl to recognize)
Yes I do, yes I doooooo-hoo
(Nelly)
I'm in that, seventy-four, Coupe DeVille
With the, power seats, leather, wood on my wheel
One-touch sunroof BUT leave it alone
Hoes see it can't believe it - ""It's goin' back on it's own""
Ooh, shit, that's how we do it baby
""Every day like this?"" Seven day-ayyys
... I tell you three-sixty-five
Winter spring and fall, in the summer we ride
You actin' like you never seen it befo'
Like them country boys ain't got no dough
Bitch please - GET IN - but don't you slam that do'
DUST YOUR SHOES OFF - befo' you touch that flo'
Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You're in a hurry - SLOW DOWN - and I might letcha touch it
You ain't from Russia, so bitch why you rushin'?
(Chorus) w/ minor variations
(Nelly)
Now I'm - clean as a whistle (yeah) sharp as a razor (uh-huh)
In anythang from Timberland to Gaines
Now listen - I play the haters (ooh) like they should be played
And uh - I love the ladies (ooh) like they should get laid
That's why I - I got my fade everybody had braids
And now they - switch to fades and I'm thinkin' 'bout braids
Just an example of hoochieless jackin
If we were hoopin, I'd be yellin' ""They hackin""
I see you momma, in my Dolce Gabbana
Gucci and Prada baby I gotta lotta
The lucciana ain't a problem for poppa
That's all you want then baby girl I'ma holla
Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You're in a hurry - SLOW DOWN - I don't like how you actin'
Treat you like you're from Milwaukee, send you Green Bay Packin
(Chorus) w/ minor variations
(I think I just...
Need to take this time and explain to 'em exactly...
What the pimp juice is)
Uh, hear me out now
Now your pimp juice is anything, attract the opposite sex
It could be money, fame, or straight intellect
It don't MATTER! Bitches got the pimp juice too
Come to think about it - dirty, they got more than we do
They got mo' - juice in they talk, got mo' juice in they walk
They got mo' - juice in they pants, Ooh GOD DAMN!
I tell you man it's a cryin shame...
... How people use, the juice in vain - you hear me mayne
Pimp juice is color blind
You find it work on all color creeds and kinds
From ages 50 right down to 9
The Mayor of Nellyville and I won't resign, watch me recline
Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You're in a hurry - SLOW DOWN - bitch I got all night
Matter fact, stand on my left boo - I know you ain't right

She hittin them {?} gettin' ate out
I know I'm spaced out (yeah) but the shit sound way out
So I had to take a playa out, switch up my whereabouts
'Cause she was tryin' to turn a playa out
And plus she know a nigga blazed out
And lil' mama gon' crack a window, let the haze out
She said she loves that stroke
Keep on her heels and her coat
Then she say she loves my moves
And the way I do, what I do
She got that ba-da-buh-da
Gotta make, sure, I don't get attached
That ba-da-buh-da
But it keeps, on, bringin' me back

The Sun sick a triflin, so sick he have ya snifflin
Plus the chains like the nigga Slick Rick an' them
We had pick of them, strictly all dimensions and
Not to mentionin the Benjamins is thickenin
And now it's like a odyssey when she sayin' hi to me
She eat the dick, then she cry when she gotta leave
Bye, bye, you gotta go now (yeah)

She said she loves that stroke
Keep on her heels and her coat
Then she say she loves my moves

Just have your story right, and don't never forget
You need your story right, 'cause she'll be upset
Her inner feelings'll be disrespect, but

Jealousy in the air, other girls wanna be her

But if I can dance with Cindy, I can dance with Shaquita
'Cause I know I can, I shall, I will

The story I'm about to tell you
Is all true
The names may have been changed to protect some of those close to me
Uh uh true story but if not
They say money is the root of all evil
And I'm really starting to see what it do to people
Check it
More money more problem
Well er'body got problems
But they expect me to solve em
And I can barely solve my own
Got me lookin' at 'em like
You's supposed to be grown
And I done said shit in four different tones?
To their face emails ringing over the phone
I done said that you'd call
I done said that you'd lie
I done pull it to the side
I done try to sit 'em down
But some just don't get it
'Cause they mind only focus on
What I got
And what they ain't got
And what they can't get
Got me lookin' at my albums like
Who wrote this shit?
Believe me mani hope this get
A tad bit better but I doubt that shit
It's like hey I can hear these people say
Dam that boy done changed
But they don't understand
The pressures I'm going through
Oh how I wish there was a way
To change places for a day
Just so they see what it's like
To walk a mile in my shoes
I love dave chapelle
But I don't know too many turn down fifty mill
See that's talk for real
Beside you know what I had to go through to get this deal?
How many brothers I done seen get killed
For 50 bucks and a few of them pills
Y'all don't feel me
Dam right I sing all these songs
So I can buy my pops a car
And my mama a home
So she can sit up on the phone
With her best friend joan
Talkn like on and on
How her baby done grown
How my baby made his own
Through the microphone
And how my baby been my baby since my baby was born
But uh I ain't seen a man that's all about the money
But let's face it you can't make a record for free
I'll be dam if I watch them make a mill off me
I can sit back and take it for minimum wage
I done gave 'em er'thing
But my D an my A
That's what the contract say
They make it seem like you can't get away
It's like you owe these people? three more days
Y'all don't feel me
It's like hey I can hear people say
Dam that boy done changed
But they don't understand
The pressures I'm going through
Oh how I wish there was a way
To change places for a day
Just so they see what it's like
To walk a mile in my shoes"

Where they at? Where they at?

Where they at? Come on, now
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We three-wheelin' in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I love this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benzy
Oh, why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
In the club on the late night, feelin' right
Lookin' tryin' to spot somethin' real nice
Lookin' for a little shorty hot and horny so that I can take home
I can take home
She can be 18, 18 with an attitude
Or 19 kinda snotty actin' real rude
Boo, as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl, you know that it's on
You know that it's on
I peepin' somethin' comin' towards me up the dance flo'
Sexy and real slow, hey
Sayin' she was peepin' and, ""I dig the last video""
""So when, Nelly, can we go?""
How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34
Yellin' I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear

Without no vouchers or no boozers, she's bringin' nuttin' back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that, 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Makin' a livin' off my brain instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my mama put the whip in my own name now
Damn, shit done changed now
Runnin' credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the man now, in and out my own town
I'm gettin' pages out of New Jersey, from Courtney B
Tellin' me about a party up in NYC
Can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Payin' cash, first class, sittin' next to Vanna White (come on)

Hustlin got me bigger like weight gainer (gainer)
Always remain a, St. Louis entertainer
My women love me later, how could a hater blame her?
Shoot, I'm just that dude that kick bars for a livin'
Get rich and trick, collect cars for a livin'
Houses on hills, with Great Lakes in the back
Bowlin alleys in basements, beds bigger than Shaq's
Damn, look at the leather in that old school 'Llac
They be doo-doo green, I wonder who would do that
The original rude dude, considered too cool
Probably know me from touchin yo' booty at school

You know we hadda do a remix right?
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
All you Young Gunnerz!
Hey Just, this the one right here baby!
I told you dawg!
Its B Sig in the place with State P
And we got what it takes to rock the mic right Yeah!
Still watch what you say to B. Sig
'Cause I still will knock your ass the fuck out
(Verse 1 - Beanie (Freeway))
I bring the hood when I'm travelin
Scrap backwoods unravelin
Scrap smoke good when we travelin
Forget the Mac's cause the K's fit good in the Caravan
I clap up your hood like the hammer man
Bring your gat, better bust it if you get that close
Scared to clap better strap your folks (strap... your... folks)
Who want beef with State P...
Enemies try to speak to me
Negative they don't get that close
(Verse 2 - Freeway (Beanie))
Its Free, listen
Blow trees with Mac Mittens
(No we didn't) Yes we did!
(Switch beginnings) Smith and Wesson precision
Bring the broads down with ribbons
(Leave a mess in your crib)
Not a brave nigga?
(Suckin with some made niggas)
Hit him with the AK nigga
(Free no you didn't)
Yes I did
Overpayed shit? Wait a minute...
When this fakin, snatch the cake up out his crib
(Then slide, uh)
I'm like the baker with your pies
(Then rise)
Set up shop and distribute where you live
It's Freeway in the place with my squad
And we got what it takes to DUMP the K
FLIP your ride!
(Chrous 1 - Beanie)
Its B Sig in the place with State P
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right Yeah!
Still watch what you say to Young Free
Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out
(Chorus 2 - Freeway)
Its Freeway in the place with State P
And we got what it takes to the rock the mic right Yeah!
Still watch what you say to B Sig
'Cause we got what it takes to dump the D-E
(Chorus 3 - Nelly)
Its Nelly in the place with Murph Lee
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right Yeah!

Cause there's somethin' on my waste to make the whole place blur
(Chorus 4 - Murphey Lee)
Its Murph dirt' in the place with Nelly
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right Yeah!
You better watch what you say to my face
'Cause I got what it takes to shake the whole place
(Verse 3 - Murphey Lee)
Murphy Lee's eighteen entertainin 'em
Twenty-one when I'm clubbin it
Fake ID for the fuck of it
I'm just a school boy, somewhat new boy
If you can't get Nelly you'a settle for who boy?
Two toy carrier, two stashes
One truck that seats six asseses
Swing through to refuse the masses
Remove glasses, blow smoke up in my ashes
I used to drive my mama stuff
Now the school boy puttin' twenties on the Bomb Pop truck
I make rappers go back to the block
They be like ""maybe I was better off selling rocks""
I'm Murphey Lee in the place to be punk
And I got enough skunk to fill the whole blunt
I take trips with chumps up in my trunk
And I take 'em real far to a safe place to dump
(Verse 4 - Nelly)
I'm Mr. Down down, I'm witcha dirty go head and lay down
Finance a pay-down, heard what I said now?
See how I procede with caution
My whip crack fast all you niggas is horses
Randy Moss', I play when I wanna
Nut check, gut check, 'cause I say what I wanna
Around six in the six with the throwback
Sixers, number six Julius Irv'
Cris and the herb, make it hard to swirve
Throw your hands up; if you didn't bang your rim on the curb
You couldn't hit while you was makin' a turn
I strike a nerve and old MC's wantin a comeback
I got repsect but it's lost and that's a fact
Like K - ""Know"" one here even said your name
R - You really feelin' guilty bout somethin' mayn
S - Sad to see you really just want just
One - more hit please please!
You the first old man who should get a rapper's pension
No hits since the cordless mic invention
Snitchin? Matter fact stay the fuck out the kitchen
Nelly cookin with too many dimensions
Mid west, and we aim about mid chest
Duked on my side, too many in my tribe
Coupe outside who the fuck want a ride?
(Outro - Freeway (to fade))
All a y'all need to one yo self
Go get the burner nigga bang yo-self!
All a y'all need to one yo self
Go get the burner nigga bang yo-self!
Yeah! It's the, it's the Roc nigga
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

(Look out!)
Gun shots rang out over the city
And had everybody duckin' and runnin', checkin' for any
Kinda shelter cause them peoples man they at it again
If you ain't heard or seen it then you better pretend
Ain't got no time for stoppin', ain't no catchin' your wind, ya
Baby mammas on the porch tellin' their daughters ""Come in!""
Got fathers grabbin' sons ""Where the hell have you been boy?""
And y'all they startin young I'm talkin' 13 and 10
They started trainin' in the streets some type of ghetto battles
But they ain't hoopin in no gym they hoop on crates in the alleys
Where else can you shoot a jump shot
Sling a rock all from the same spot?
Got one gang on this half the other gang
On the other half of the same block
Gunplay on Monday
Sundays a fun day
When will it stop?
One day?
Hell, I can't call it
No way.
When your gettin' started everybody wanna help and get you off
But turn around then the first motherfuckers wanna see you fall
Say now (say now)

Feel like I'm runnin' towards the daylight
Tryin' ta get my mind right
And just before I grab it, somebody be tryin'a snatch it from me (I'm talkin')
Say now
Can you hoes come out to play now?
(Nelly)
(Yeah... Uh uh uh uhuh oh, Hear me out now. Uh uh check it uh uh uh)
Tryin' ta put my city on the map and they mad at me
The same city some of them live in and they mad at me
When I come down to state dirty why you mad at me?
Is it cause the old school freaked out niggas from A to Z?
Eight CD's, TV's, I aim to please
They mean the same to me like Biggie to C's
Like Easy to E's, Tupac to overseas
And I done seen more Aaliyah fans fall cry to their knees
I tell ya, I ain't been livin' this life for too long
And I can't count how many times someone has asked me what's wrong
Why my mother was gone
Why my dady wasn't home
And the same shit they told me I find myself tellin' my own
Now its good-bye bad nights
Hello good times
There ain't no way Ill let no niggas step on my shine
Keep tryin' (keep tryin')
There's bound ta be somethin' G
As long as I'm an S.T.L.U.N.A.T.I.C
I'll tell ya

Peanut butter inside and out jelly
I push it straight down the block, I made a left at the curb
I had my windows cracked 'cause I was smoking some herb
I saw the Shawty I knew so I started to swerve
I pulled right up beside her and I started to serve
I said hold up, Shawty get it
Boy that's soft like the seat that you be sit in
How bout we ride somewhere where I can get it
She ain't want it at all but she was with it
Like a 50 amaro she was ready to follow
Like a coke bottle with a walk in the bottle
She was sippin muscato with a skinny malato
The only thing that I did in here was hit her lock
Shawty it could be real
Hell it could be a headshot
I got a couple bills
Tryna put 'em in yo stash box
Your sexy ass gon get it
Got band in hand, come get it
That pinch is a herb - it's my method
Just shake whatever that is behind you
I like 'em big, I like 'em small
I like 'em thin, I like 'em tall
I like 'em round, I like 'em both
But on the real, I like 'em all
Now I done swoop off your pants, they're worth we're buying the same
Now I did most of the layin like only offer it came
Ali came with demands, I became the man
Then came in the bands, then they came in the Benz
I'm like oh, Shawty works it
Put that ass in the air, don't twerk it
Swing around that pole, go and murk it
You see a nigga behind, you know I'm lurkin
I like a girl with a bottom, I like a girl on the top
I like a girl when I roll, I like a girl when I rock
I like a girl when I sing, I like a girl when I rap
'Cause when I'm doin' my thing I want that ass to clap
Shawty it could be real
Hell it could be a headshot
I got a couple bills
Tryna put 'em in yo stash box
Your sexy ass gon get it
Got band in hand, come get it
That pinch is a herb - it's my method
Just shake whatever that is behind you
I've got what you want but baby
This ain't love, could drive you crazy
If you want it go on and say that
Say that, say that
I've got what you want but baby
This ain't love, could drive you crazy
If you want it go on and say that
Say that, say that
Shawty it could be real
Hell it could be a headshot

137,She's So Fly,2010,5.0 (2010),Hip Hop|Pop|R&B,Nelly,"(Intro: T.I. (Nelly))
Say Mo (yeah bruh)
You remember them broads on the strip out in Vegas?
(Uh-huh, what about 'em?) Well
I don't know if I told you or not but (hmm?)
Lil' shawty I was in the back seat with man, you know uh (uh, Naomi)
I ran into her on Rodeo Drive in L.A., and I was like
(Chorus: Nelly)
(She's so fly) She's outrageous, I met her out in Vegas
She fresh off the pages of a magazine, I said
(She's so fly) She like eye candy, I can't stop starin'
I'm like goddamn, I got to have you girl, because
(She's so, fly)
(T.I.)
Look at shorty hoppin out that Maserati
In them Giuseppe Zanotti's and that bangin' ass body
In them low cut Frankie B.'s with the panties peekin out 'em
With a booty that big, and her stomach rock solid
On Rodeo Drive, walkin' in her Roberto Cavalli
I should probably walk up to the register and say ""I got it""
Go and pick up what you like, it's nothin' ma, don't worry about it
That bag should be carried by somebody so exotic
And that dress should be worn when there's nothin' else up under
Just in case I run into you I can pull up to your bumper
She politely declined when I offered her my number
Then I asked her what's her name, said she'd rather make me wonder
So I paid and she laughed, carried out her bags outside
And I couldn't get her ass, I tried
As I watch her leave out the store
How one man wanted shorty ass and more, for sure
(Nelly)
Shorty harder than Cialis
See my hand, got the money countin' careless
Couldn't find a bigger star than in Dallas
And the Pistons ain't the only one with rings in (The Palace)
Do your research, tell me your analysis
Take a jet and make you (Wonder) where you (Land) like Alice
... Tell me shorty ain't the baddest
Tell me shorty don't deserve to walk the runway in Paris
(Woo!) She deserve it all
I don't do the mall, I do it by catalog
La Perla panties and bras, fuck buyin at the bar
I fuck around and buy this whole club by tomorrow
? See, she's so nice
She can get whatever she likes
Don't let the price make you mad
I live a Fabolous life shorty, (Throw It in the Bag)
(T.I.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, go
(She's so fly)
What? Ha, yeah, yeah
(She's so fly to me)
Look at her
(Nelly (T.I.))
Uh, hoppin out that Rover (hey)
In them Louie loafers (hey)
I just wanna hold her (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
{Closer to me ? closer to meeeeee}
(T.I.)
Ay, we in Vegas on the strip and seein vision and precision lookin' like a straight star
With the buttons undone, showin off her lace bra
My partner in the back, till the smoke hop in they car
Okay, broad{?} in L.A., she say I got her to the mall, ha
(Nelly)
So, we hopped in the Land and we rolled out, yeah
Walked on the end and we showed out, yeah
It's the King and the One with the dough out hurr
We can blow out hurr ? 'cause she's so fly

Yes it was, yes it was
Okay, I was
Sittin' on the hill
Countin' my DOUGH
One milllion, two million, three million, four
Five million, six million, seven million more
Then I heard a knock knock, who's there?
It's yo' friendly neighborhood Cad leanin and M.O. beamin Spida Man
So bewurr
Come take a look up in the sky, you can't lie
I know you feel it when it
I used to live in cellars, I used to coke a sellah
Two hundred million fella, call me a fo'tune tella
Tryin' to get over Eazy, like they was Jerry Heller
I never want to jail-ah, 'cause I'm too slick a fella
Seen me on wheels befo', man you should see me now
It might be hard though, because I sit too high
I sit up on the hill, but I'm still down to earth
I'm like the Rams man I'm at the best when on my turf
You watch your girl flirt, you watch your girl tease
You think your girl gon' cheat? Then check your girl needs
You need to check her needs, befo' I check 'em for ya
Cause once I check her needs, she won't be checkin' for ya
You hear a KNOCK KNOCK, who is it that's payin' a visit
She's, goin' ballistic while he's sippin on her Mystic
Whoa, it's the exquisite one named Mo, or short for Moses
I think I'll go back to countin' my money now
Sittin' on the hill
Countin' my DOUGH

Five million, six million, seven million more

I know you feel it when it
Say I don't come to the hood, what do the fuck they know?
Who else drivin' that Bentley, out there in front of Wo's
Sittin' out in front of Tandy, I got my phone handy
Give me the numbers I'ma call 'em, you been misinformed
I'm buyin bikes for tykes, there'll be some uniforms
While they just rap about we fo' sho' fo' kids and show 'em
At elementary schools, the day of show and tell
We didn't come to show, mo' like we came to tell
Tell 'em how to keep it strong, on how to keep it tight
To tell they right from wrong, to turn your wrong right
Watch all they words and actions, thoughts companies and habits
Leave them tricks for rabbits, that greed for the savage
And you can make it happen, if you just don't give up
I guarantee that you can be that anything you want
Give 'em that real talk, show 'em that real walk
And maybe one day you can be like me, somewhurr
Sittin' on the hill
Countin' my DOUGH
One milllion, two million, three million, four
Five million, six million, seven million more

Others just smoke and fuck all day.
I'm from the home of the Red Fox, Ced the Entertainer
Jettin' off with Brian Cox, I'll see ya later
Maybe not 'cause I got somethin' hot
In the Navigator waitin' in the parkin' lot
A Bad Boy and I Ryde Rougher than The LOX
I keep 'em both cocked, need her ass to bring it
Now tell me boss have you seen her
Have you seen her, 9 millimeter
Makin' niggas believer
Hop out the 2 seater, now Vokal wife beater
Levi's fresh from the cleaners
Heavy starch with the cuff
Like fuck it leave it to beaver
Catch me in the galleria, plaza, Chesterfield
Rollin' down holly hills
In a black Sedan Deville
I used to love they when hit me for a rocker
Maybe a bopper, I kept it proper
A non-stopper, around the clocker
Now it's cool pull up the benz and helicopter.

Check the background, St. Louis clown from the U-Town
Fourteen, pimp of the year like Dru Down
Same crew now, it's too damn quiet but too loud
Hoes be pretendin always sayin' they too proud
If I ruled the world, I do now
Me and the 'Tics 'bout to rack 'em and move the crowd

Lunatics about to steal the show

From the S-T-L, M-O, 3-1-4

Talkin' trash 'bout whoopin my ass
I never let a nigga do that, who that
Get his brains blew back with a new gat
Yellin' ""true that"", hollowtips is goin' cleeeeean through that
And I didn't have to get my whole team just to do that
In a blue hat, with a black baggy Karl Kani
An iced out ring just to score on your eye
Hard to die, like Bruce, Lee get a victory
Cats is sick like H-I-V if they feelin' weak
We be Nicki ???, Jackie Frost, ??? ???

'Tics in fifty states, might as well blaze the cake

Drugs for papes, now I'm sellin CDs and tapes
Funerals and wakes caused by greed and hate
A snake is still a snake no matter the size or shape
Those that hate, anchored with weights, found in the lake
Come off the chain my main, you tied to the gate
First you caught a case, second you caught the babes
Third, you caught me with your date, that was no mistake
Good things come to those who wait
So if you waitin on them 'Tics, huh, they gon' be late
In your house with your spouse I'm doin' the nasty
I'm a felon, ask Jay, I rob industries and ashtrays
Branson and hashy, ??? ??? and wrap somethin'
And burn the place, ya heard me

Watch me load up the ammo, cock it back slow
In the back door, infrared low
Tell me somethin' that I don't already know

Got three little problems I just thought you should know
Peep, I'm addicted to 'yes' and I'm allergic to 'no'
I'm obsessed with dough, money makin' and the hoes
Anything other than satisfaction gon' blow
Heard through the grapevine you lookin' for me
Couldn't be, 'cause if it was you would be bookin from me
Shook when ya see Nelly rollin' in the GS-3
Hangin' out the sunroof like ""bing, bing, bing""
Back the car up, pop the trunk now
Can ya hold ya breath 'cause I'ma flood this town
That ass scream ""nine-second-five right here""

I'm makin' ones with them niggas see my ass in the club
Puffin the bud, and spendin a hundred for every dub
What he got in his hand, I'm at it again
I don't think really can't stand, a lunatic plan - work it

But probly wrist bands, mo denim starched jeans
Diablo boots with the posher string
I'll take a cream-a-team shirt with the bentley sleeves
Four-door swoosh, made by nike
Drop-top jumpan suit by mike e
Got to like my playa, I'm in it for the dough
I'm in it for show, matter fact I'm in it to blow
When I wake up in the mornin, I'll be in it some mo
Garunteed anytime, dial 3-1-4
Do any escargo, gotta S car the go
0 to 60 dirty in four point 0
Second ranking niggas every where dat I go
I got this saying, gotta have it, gotta have it for show - c'mon

Now for real, I be the break 'em off, ho hopper
Trick knocker, nobody does it like we do, we's proper
Biggie like Papa when I dropper
Lying on that ass now we fucking till the beat don't stopper
Could it be I move too smooth?
Grooves that will make the whole party move
Spots, I keep it hot, so honies be out to trot
Yo, I got this game on lock when I pull up on the lot
So watch me now
Niggas wonder how
I'm spiffy now
So the bitches pick me now
See watch me now

Now everybody wanna try and stop this dude
Pop this dude, drop this dude
Try and top this dude, plus test my cool
Watch me drop a jewel while they jock this dude
But why every time I around we's cool? Watch them act a fool
When I leave swiftly, sixty when I cruise
My dues been paid, rats been laid
Many gats been sprayed
Plus tracks been made like yellow dude face
See me through your shades, blow up like grenades
Try and fade this team, you know what that mean
Head full of dreams
Go on watch us hit the seams with this million dollar team
Shining like rings, taking over everything with this lyrical scheme
We be like fiends when it comes to the money
Be are end for hurt and them

What you know about this?
Nothing at all, 'cause my shits gall like these hos on my balls
I be that, ""Hit 'em once see you later"", I holler
No need to bother little Torii about a dollar
Ask Ali Baba and he'll tell y'all
""A post office ho's about to get you for your L dawg""
Tell those low-down dirty gold diggers
Torii ""Murphy Lee"" ain't your average rich nigga
Saint Louis representer and I remember
Hos can give a fuck about my beater in December
But now it's a holiday and follow me
Up North like Hollany, booty call like Bellamy
Nag, what you telling me?
Now it's all-good
You's a star spelled backwards
Go on back to your hood
Now it goes hos and niggas, sit back and relax Friday and Sat
Pay attention as I drop this shit on y'ass
Thinking I wanna smoke a blunt, got them tricks down on their knees
You cats that wanna be down you just get ready for your lead
Now I know niggas trying to say that Lunatics' East Coast
'Cause my lyrics boasts with flavor but fool I'm just your neighbor
One of Saint Louis' finest, just keep a cover like Linus
Stop your ass like sinus, congestion till you learn your lesson
Confessin' in a danker cruiser supposedly with no future
Mammas call me a loser, huh, but watch me prove
I can Buckeye like Ohio, keeping Pace like Orlando
I'm running out from the 5 O's cause all I herr is ""Book 'em Dano""
Practice 'cause I can't be touched, I'm just too much
I'm packed like lunch with more skills than such and such
I'm plus, never a minus, bumping Johnny Unitas
Out that Hall of Fame, lyrics ride tracks better than trains
Coming flier than planes, crossing niggas like lanes
Backstabbing, but peep out my game as I explain
Everybody shake your hand, ain't your partner fool
Just because I give you dapper that don't mean we cool
Clearer than ice water, see your whole plan's to shake me up
Let up before I wet up your whole fucking getup
Spit up a lung, you done got that wind knocked out
Who get the clout? Ain't no doubt, lunatics run the house

Murphy Lee-
So basically I'm a joke right?
Look me in my eyes and tell me if you don't lie
When are you that shoes untied before you know it method
First step we getting naked, pants gone in 20 seconds
It's gettin' hectic
Reckage is likea hoopty with insurance
But it seems I'm behind schedule with bra troubles twistin
And pullin
I'm like shorty help me (come on)
Help me (pretty please) don't blow my high, 'cause I'm too horny
She giggles and gives a horny smile...
So I take advantage
Kissing in gentle places tryin' to get myself established
I'm comfortable, wanna be in that moe
With no control
Concentrating on my every lick her every blow
Yep I'm still cold
But cooler than 2 below
And now I got that wrong in the past You'll never know
It's on
Put my penis in accurate
Just relaxing it
Now it's my time to party like the lunatics at a national
Ali-
Now comes first like the front porch and the polo sports shirts
Skirts there they are that's the one 'cause I'm far
From Average Lane with that ""What's your name?"" game
I'm stormin on your brain like a surgeon in the rain
Take the fame if you can
Watch me wrap like saran
All up in these sheets
Now you on me like a tan
Keeping me like a van
In reverse that's the worst
Playa curse put up on me now
We spreadin on my hommies like a germ
Watch me turn into captain kill a hoe
Fill a hoe strong
Watch me last long like a penny broke many motels
I got a rich coupon
I'm doing dismounts on foutons
Comin' out like Key won
I feel like ceramic in a hammoc
God damn it
That's my words
Oohs and Aahs Slurred like a verb
Someone acting like an ass like a metaphor
Now I'm headed for the highways
75 southways
Selling shit out to they ears
Hot tones and telephones
Just to get they bezzle home
Gonna watch my bedrock like flinstones
Son too strong
Try to smoke your sack is fatty sonic
Drive me nuts like planters
Harpin a nigga like offalana (swish)
I ban ya from the smoke house church
Who you think you fuckin' with?
Trying to play me like Jim Carrey
Pull some dumber and dumber shit
Stomp me like a step show (grab ho)
Then I let go (throw) split
That ass like g-strings up on these rat hoes
I pose as a threat
To hit any one of these niggas rats
Split some game and get them burnt
Gonna watch this tag team like free bird
Say the word
I be at rats with all my partners
Straight loungin with a pocket full of rubbers and have it
Bouncin'
Go make the announcment
Smoke like dynamite the good times
Want both girls like prime time
Want real highs and thick thighs take pride in my stylin
Head bustin' you be drivin'
Got 'em bangin' the walls so hard te neighbors callin
Asking you what's

Going on over there
Sounds like you guys are going CRAZY
Going going gone"

Pushin a five hundred S-L

A baby momma and a bow-wow
My nigga know you need to calm down
F-for County run up in your house
But you don't wanna hear that though, it's too late
Now the feds knocking at your door, you took the bait
They got taps on your mobile phone
They do surveillance all around your home
Now ya pawnin' everything ya own
Calling on your partners for a loan
No more slip and sliding on the chrome
Your good days have come and gone
I tried to tell you

Now baby girl what's your name?
And tell me what's your claim to fame
Oh I can tell you do your thing
Just by checking out your diamond ring
I see you at the mall every day
Buying Chanelle, Fendi, Donna K'
Plus I heard they took your job away
Ya got ya kids' shit on lay away
You got a 4-5 Infinity (You livin' large)
Like your last name was Kennedy or El DeBarge
Oh I just can't believe, that you made that money righteously
The kids asking what they mommy do
And why she lock us in the bedroom
I think mommy getting paid to screw
Cause every night it's a different dude (damn)
I tried to tell

Little man how old are you (you can tell me)
And what you doin' skippin school?
I see you running with your lil' crew
Out here fightin over red and blue
So now you wanna claim gangs
Even heard you bought a thumper mayn - and that ain't it
You started out with chronic on the brain
Now you're smokin' meth amphetamines
I ain't tryin' to sell your dreams
Just trying to show you, that's it's other ways to make cream
(Take it from me) Just go to school and make somethin' of
Tour young life and watch it blow up
And you ain't gotta stop bein cool
And you ain't even gotta stop flossin fancy jewels (and fast cars)
Just keep it real with your game son
And don't forget were you came from
I'm tryin' to tell ya

Ou're a warrior fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above and brought down the world below
You're the son of his majesty
Remember how it used to be
In the light of day it's easy to see
Now it's nighttime
You had to leave
Separated from the king
Now the water's rushing and you keep trying to swim against the stream
And it seems, like your not moving the many water's gushing you gasp for air
Almost drowning ears ringing, once upon a time we were singing
One day the trees will stand and clap hands
Stream of thought getting caught in the klipa, this place is just a shell, external
Egos swell, that one'll burn ya, we fell a long way down, that eternal frown'll get you
You look vexed it's the dregs, the yetzer hara's lurking
Trying to make you forget we got a job to do
You're a priest and a prince and you can't be moved
You're a warrior, fighting for your soul
Taken from a world above, and brought down to a world below
Re-united, re-united return the princess to the king,
Re-united, re-united, she's been taken for so long
Re-united, re-united and then she'll be filled with joy
Re-united, re-united like the days of her youth
Descended to the pit
What's this feeling can't get rid of it
Soul sick
Can't seem to shake it
When one retires at night weeping, joy will come in the morning
You made my mountain stand strong
Like and ancient memory
Remember how it used to be
Close your eyes and breath in
That's the scent of freedom
Ringing across the sea
Land of milk and honey
One day will wake up from this dream and we'll stop sleeping,
Oh, yo, then we'll see clearly"

See I could put you in all them clothes
Your neck, wrist, ears, hands, all that froze
He could never ever put you in a rose
But anything goes when you dealin' with the baller
Stand on my money if I wanna be taller
Smack him with a G, I bet he go and get his lawyer
'Cause he really wanna sue me
Take the bitch route, 'cause he know he cannot do me
Know he can't outdo me in the records or the movies

If you mean what you feel then I mean what I said

You don't like cheap sex, I laid a mil' on the bed
Spread it all out and we can roll around in it
Hop off in the whip and we can roll around in it
In the back seat and we can go to town in it
Or maybe on the hood, sound profound, did it?
He ain't get the message ma, act like he ain't get it
He ain't catch a hint when you gave him back his rented
Now his lil' condo one less tenant
And I did it - but you know what?

Ride around with my Grammy's on the 'Llac

Me be the rapper, Nicky Bonds be the crack
Think I fell off when they fell from the track
You wanna come to Nellyville I'll draw you the map
Follow that yellow brick road
Follow that rainbow of diamonds down to the gold
Follow shorty as she slide down a pole
He tryna make it rain but it's comin' down slow
I hope he got the gloves 'cause I'm about to make it snow

Like kids seein Santa when I walked in the club
(Hoh, hoh, hoh...)

Listen, play with me nigga if you wanna, if you feel
Won't kill at will but will kill Bill
Somebody better grab Bill, tell him to chill
Before somebody find him buried in the hills

164,Wrap Sumden,2000,Country Grammar (2000),Hip Hop|Pop|R&B,Nelly,"Hey this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by
You see Biggie be like what's beef?
Me I'm like what's weed?
Weed is actually a medicine for me, you know.
Every 4 hours like a prescription I smoke.
And I'm thanking my refer chief for making me choke.
I'm like one of those half-baked thugs, I'm in love.
Then after that roll cool ""J's"" I mean bud.
'Cause I still piss stems and still shit seeds,
I spit residue smoke on my way to buy weed.
Wrap Sumden, always I smoke more then Cheech and Chong.
My best friends a bong and my homies a smokaholic.
I know one day, I'm gone stop,
But that'll be the day when my seeds don't pop.
You see weed helps me get my thoughts together quick.
But on the other hand, as soon as I'm sober I forget.
Shit, I'm still stuck at point ""A"" ya dig,
And my momma think that I should quit.
Ya I get high.
You might see me stroll by
In the Bob Marley tie die with the red eye.
I'm sick now.
I think I'm catching glaucoma.
See me on the corner, looking for weed donars.
You know how we do it kid. We get that good herb and swerve.
Till the gas run out, the way we smokes absurd.
That's my word, Wrap Sumden (Wrap Sumden),
Make a nigga clap somthing, get all mad and slap somthing.
Yo grab the towels cover the smoke alarms and doors.
See I somke alone, I need grass like lawn mowers.
Say dutch time, roll up it's clutch time,
And I burn mine, don't you ever ever touch mine.
Fire it up dog, but watch out for 5-0.
Eyes blowed fuck plenty henny and hydro.
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich
Gold platinum and do some shows and get blowed.
All I know, is money making hoes and smoking endo.
If I wasn't high I'd probably know a little more,
But since I don't some might consider me slow.
Don't worry though.
I keep the pants sag. Bubble eye hands rag.
Eyes glassed smoking fill from the hash.
Choking after that but don't the blunt pass.
""What we doin' today"" Same shit we did last week.
Wake up in the morning and yawn and roll up.
Bag up and make some runs and roll up.
5-0 behind me my niggas so hold up.
Ok made a left so continue to roll up.
Don't get me wrong police, yo I stop for them,
But when they leave guaranteed I'll be smoking again.
Catch my second wind and start in on my next bag.
The type of nigga smoke on the way to his rehab.
Fade"
