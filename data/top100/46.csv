""Yo. Niggas be on the mic, they be all serious...
I'd love to be serious but... effortless shit.
Effortless... effa-efortless. Mmm-hmm.
Turn my music up, Duro. Yo, yo, you my hero.
Make the shit get loud-a. Even more in my headphones loud-a.
Uh. Sweetheart, shake yo' ass cheeks.
Bust it. Mmm-hmmm. Mmm-hmmm.""
We gon' knock it down and put this
Rock solid Amplified shit up.
Girl, it's like a sit-up.
So you betta send a letta to the betta.
We cut the bank and takin' all the bankin' chedda.
Girls get pretty-ed up,
Then they comin' out the club. Rap cats, lock it up.
Worldwide vision where
Everybody sees clear.
I could get you ten here.
Uh. Makes no fuss. Keep my shit plush.
Compliment, I get blushed. That's just how a brotha is.
Big Willy kids and we really run our jibs.
Ladies, breathe easy. Let your man please thee.
Uh. Takin' rhymes to another zone.
Is your mother home? 'Cause we can get the moans,
And stay strickly on a rhythemic notion, and
Keep the joint close for the commotion and
Keep movin' around. Movie stars.
Buy a little car, buy out the bar.

""Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, what?""
We do it alive, blowin' the spot of this.
Showin' to prove what rap is. (""What is it?"")
Marauder, pass the blue moon.
Hit 'chu wit' the ill tune.
Ass cheeks move wit' the help of my jacket bloom.
Insert the veteran
Who consecutively come wit' shit yet again.
On the dance floor, chicks get horny.
Hopin' that they all move on me.
Word, for REAL for real.
Do it hard for the love of the game.
Pull your card and I'm askin' yo' name, bitch.
Jay-Dee be champion.
Tip be stylin' and definin' yo' chick, best compan-ion.
I'd advise you to fix your self, for real,
And do your shit wit' more zeal. (""More zeal."")
We in the mix and it's thickenin',
My rhyme and it's tickin' in.
The hatin' and the shit is so sickenin'.
Picasso, original. (""'Riginal."")
You forg-azy and the shit amaze me.
Sharpen your contrast and put a little color in it.
High Define your screen and put this brotha in it.

1,Barely In Love,2009,Kamaal/The Abstract (2009),Hip Hop,Q-Tip,"She only likes it when it's hot. She doesn't like the cold.
She said I got a bright idea, ""Let's go to Mexico.""
$500 in the bank, things are looking bad.
Imagine if we gotta eat, things are looking sad.
Barely in love (repeat) (chorus)
She looked into the sun and said, ""What's on your mind?""
Whee, Ha, lookatiaa, lookatiaa, sun shining all the time (sun shining all the time)
She picked up the fan and let the trailer go
She only likes it when it's hot. Doesn't like it when it's cold
When you really think about it, love is truly powerful
The undeniable force that makes it magnetic
And you can't explain it, you do what you do
Can't noboday play the fool like (something something something?)
Barely in love (repeat) (chorus)"
2,Believe,2008,The Renaissance (2008),Hip Hop,Q-Tip,"I believe thus love, thus love
I believe thus love
I believe thus love, thus love
I believe thus love

Fool, uh of the things we believe there's a whole lot of work
We should roll up our sleeves and we got a whole fun
When faces I can see that
Why doubt your plans 'cause it's all worth believing
We can make it worth do believe
That evenness trust in the dust and believe
That we can achieve that by tuning out negative feedback
Next he is, can he be concentrate to bring believe back
Into ourselves, into the world, into the rap gang
He's a miserable that means, that means emotion even likes me man
Man look we holding out for the truth
But we alone and aloof, we gon' hold for the proof
Man put it in believing, believe in believing
Seeing ain't believing, it's the feeling that we needing
Believe in each other, put the question to the system
They promising returns then question what you gettin'
We should believe in the reasons we existing
Time for renaissance to reawaken what is with it
Belief can confirm, make it is but it isn't
Sometimes I wish I had belief when I didn't
I believe thus love
I believe thus love
In the land of make belief, time to make unbelievable believable
Take a believe to the realm of the real
Believe in this shit, this force fed to the medium
Believe in this real when it's really a raw deal
Never disbelieve when you see a new miracle
Like ghetto children shining bright in Babylon
Believe in that, don't believe in stats to the contrary
Gotta be wary of them their carry on
People find belief when they don't find identity
Believe in your friends, don't believe in your enemy's
Mountains of doubt and disbelief right in front of you
Troops on the other side, what you gon' do?
Ooh, ooh, believe
Ooh, thus love, thus love
Ooh, ooh, believe
Ooh, thus love, thus love
I believe, I believe, I believe"

The Formidable, unforgettable painting Abstract
On the wall amongst them all from Tucson Michelle
A commodity, hot property, hears the morning bell
Guantanamo bayin niggas deferring routs
You soliloquies are trash inferring that you got clout
Homie, what's that about? You should revisit your scheme
Before the scheme it seems real it reverts back to a dream
Into that pea head of yours
You ain't commanding no tours
You seeing fee per deim
We seeing that in the doors
Plus a little bit more because she choosing the prettiest
Thou while it's wittiest

Taking the task, these barbaric insurgents
Who nursery rhyme niggas and play like they are crime figures

High definition for the fortunate you to view
Challenges with riches we will put you on strict review
Time to turn the tide around
Comin' with the tribal sound
Brandishing these microphones, we outlaws in the town
Corruption in the fool pit, we witness the jam
Acquisition of materials the evil of man
Trickles down to MC's
We combat the disease
With the good and hardy measurement
A real rap sediment
Degenerate genes and your bodies the host
You need to open up wide while we give you the douse
Gather round

Just feelin' things out for real, ya know?
Just wanna do me for real, ya know?
No reason to make it complicated, you feelin' agitated,
You love it or you hate itâ€¦fuck it
Desperation, jumpin' off of street corners here
Hustlahz lookin' for buzz like ""pop one in here""
Local state officialsâ€¦.yeah they out of touch
Getting money for some, aiyo, ain't nothin' much
But yoâ€¦let them tell it, we smoke it and we sell it
You don't understand, so don't tell it
You sneakin' souls just for phat diamond golds
'Cause our lady friends have likings for designer clothes
People in my hood thinkâ€¦.if I'm lookin' raggedy, then the cat is just a weak
Link
In the very fake chain of oppressionâ€¦.if television taught me any lesson, it's
""Image is Nothing"", but yo I got a thirstâ€¦Nothing, but yo I got a thirst
Nothing, but yo I got a thirstâ€¦what's first? Your rings or your purse?

The end! We have to leave themâ€¦we have to leave all our paraphanelias
Behindâ€¦.{brought backâ€¦brought backâ€¦.[repeated]} LET'S GOOOOO!)
It's kinda scary you seeâ€¦.
How fucked up things can be
Each time you take a bath
How it could have been your last
There's so much shit around us
Things we can't even see

9,Feelin',2009,Kamaal/The Abstract (2009),Hip Hop,Q-Tip,"Had this good feelin' when I woke up today
Like everything was cool so I went on my way
I guess I walk with a bop so then this profilin' cop
Said wait a minute there yo don't tell me to stop
So this profilin' cop with his profilin' hands
Figured the best that he could do was find a cat to harass
That little kitten was me, not that one in a tree
A black one with the promises that wished to be free
I mean damn policeman can't you leave me alone
I'm a prince plus a poorper with this business I'm on
See this rackin' I'm in, needs somebody like me
All of us is concentratin' on the things that we see
How much we make, so you see it ain't great
We're not makin' this slate, 'cause it's juts in our fate
I refuse to get blue so just hand me that thing
Yo what's happenin' today?
Yo we Gotta bring back that feelin'
What happened to that feelin'?"
10,Gettin' Up,2008,The Renaissance (2008),Hip Hop,Q-Tip,"Sent you a message, sent you an email
Hasty decisions we may still prevail
Both needed breaks, we both needed to bail
Walking through the corridors of my mind
The hideaways, the nooks, there filled with good times
Memories certainly yes they still bind
Still a common man and yeah that's for sure
Still a bankroll and yeah still can tour
The madness, the thing we had was much more
Come back home, don't be out in the world
It's a rat race and always for a girl
And most scavengers have found the pretty pearl
It's for the faint of heart who never get enough
Gotta get tough, buckle 'em up, we call 'em duds
And we, and we and we ah
We gotta gettin' up
We gotta gettin' up
Today is nice come on we gettin' up
Said we gettin' up
Said we gettin' up
Tonight is right come on we gettin' up
Said we gettin' up
Said we gettin' up
Come over here baby, don't look so grumpy
This kind of lifestyle could be so comfy
We can start a clan just like the Kennedy's
You and I advance, certainly we can expand
Feelings that should never end
And you respect me like a friend
But love me like your man
No other could contend
Or we could be like Doves exposed 2 history
Like staying with each other with truth and chivalry
The things we go through they shape our identity
Yes pretty let's do this all night
Consummate this thing and make it all right
And when we cuddle up and promise that it's right
We gotta gettin' up
We gotta gettin' up
Today is nice come on we gettin' up
Said we gettin' up
Said we gettin' up
Tonight is right come on we gettin' up
Said we gettin' up
Said we gettin' up
I like to watch everybody gravitate towards you
Your magnetic presences make them come through
The same way you got them you got me too
Now look at our lives so colorful
A wonderful spectrum, not 1 tone dull
Full of excitement and not 1 lull
See we had an understanding, oh yes we did
I'm bringing it back, I'm puttin' in my bid
Have a couple of kids, have a couple of cribs
We like Louie D and [? ] like martin and corretta
Doin' it to death, no one can do it better
When we leave our physical our sprits still together
Come on now, here's a placement for your hand
You rockin' with the #1 MC man
The #1 controller of right with the plan
We gotta gettin' up
We gotta gettin' up
Today is nice come on we gettin' up
Said we gettin' up

Tonight is right come on we gettin' up

11,Go Hard,1999,Amplified (1999),Hip Hop,Q-Tip,"(Q-Tip)
Now picture this a man wit his whole thing in order
Movin through life at will he ill
He make his own teeth growl wit his generous style
But he still no joke wit his wisdom and smile
Givin' pounds all around no need to act foolish
Enjoy the time no need to get toolish
I spit it out wit the general feelin' that
Once you vibe wit it then you keep on comin' back
The north south and east and the west
Wanna see which crew can do it the best
Is it the North, where people drink juice and Smirnoff?
Girls go hard but they lips stay soft
The west where cats throw jets to play
Smokin' green all day keep a loked out sway
East... side... the hustle get real
Pretty young things with their mass appeal
Or the south where thugs keep gold in their mouth
Big ol' girls with their thang hangin' out
Whatever it is I hope you evolve
We gon push it to my level let the G evolve come on

Go... go at... go at it hard... real hard

They can't wait for my to mize me meet my great but
No attention I give them no light
Niggas gotta know that I go through mics
Go through walls with sounds and speakers with real drives
You can't fuck this nigga from Tribe a yo
I put my mind to the work in here
And make sure that all of ya can understand
That I don't do bitch, I don't do tricks
I stay doing beats while you stay layin' bricks
I do do the things that keep me from the rest
And I do that well if I do suggest yo
Put your hands on your system and feel me out
Or put your hand on your money and hold your cloud
The indoor seat of lady galor seas
She get touched once and she'll never divorce me
Hey clear your brain as I implimate raw thoughts
You shouldn't be aware that I don't get off course
Stayin' steady on it niggas ain't ready for it
Flourin' it hard with A.J. Pettite on it
A noble's face and I'm doing my pace
Makin' sure all my conrads get a true taste
What?.. a good shit and I'm ringing your memory
We goin' hard yo and that's how it need to be

They comin' at you high

Then speak figuratively, I mean this shit
And speak literally, you in some shit

I dominate flows
I dominate shows
And, in the nighttime our dominance grows
And, you could see from the posture I'm holding
Yo, I'm ???? up while the rest is folding
A hip hop cat who's flown world wide and
Experience, adventures like poseidon
Bunk heads with r and b chicks
Give 'em one hit joints and they lookin' for the remix
The shit that I spit like plain clothes days
Surprised you legit make your whole team freeze
I'm so irregular
Ear on the cellular
Let's celebrate 'cause your man is a hell of a
Fillin' the blank with a good thing to fill in
We hold it still 'cause we walkin' with still (chance, chains???)
Blindsided up in your own reality
While we in the heat of the moment, fuck morality
I really wanna see you rise to my joint ma (ma)
I'm lookin' straight don't see your eyes get my point ma (ma)
However you do it, I'm doing you back
Yo, don't misconstrue it, 'cause I'm screwing it back
Yo, rappers better count my presence as they down time
I gotta move around, don't have no fuck around time
So, you better just get on back

Funny brothers on my nerves type ridiculous
I guess I really gotta do it
Put my game down

Put my name down
And it seems you fucked up like a drug deal gone wrong
Makin' out a lot, you won't be that way long
Yeah yeah, plus, y'all niggas is bush leaguers
And I bet y'all ain't gettin' no bush either
And I bet y'all ain't gettin' no a-hoop either

When I look at the screen
When I think about my chance for me
To intervene
And it's up to me to bring back the hop-e
Feeling in the music that you could quote
Not saying that I hate it cause here
I kinda dig it
But what good is a' ear
If a Q-Tip isn't in it
So to stick it in
To inform your friend
Your boy from the hood
Is on that shit again
He has upped the degreese
And dropped the mercury
To splash on the mass
And look to upper class
And win the records spins
That Sometimes goes a win
A fickleness of friends
They sometimes hate again
They always bring up tribe on me
Could not suprive on me
'Cause this is my man's on me
'Cause this is my fams
And here's somethin' new
It's from row for you
So don't miss
'Cause you was tribe on the true
My due sue hassle heart
Don't stop
Your repertoire
As long as you could see
It's you who's staying we
'Cause life is filled with mer...
Pills and little pearls and shit
I'm fucking up
A man
I'm tripp'n up
But still
There is a boy
Them people get annoyed
Who's focus is on the feel
Before we get a deal
Cum on!
Think it if life can be a thing
That wilderness is wild to me
But a trip all the... oad
I see we're just the same
Think that we're not
Where we should be
Movin' on we came to
Prefect on the street
Let's take it a pause
And ensure we eat
And open an end
To criticize the boys
They're out in between
They loose all their boys
They can't keep it down
With Dominic and Brown
And Doe's of other shades
They joy up a way
But wait this frame to add
Like brai... and cap a Pad
And magazine debris
A shit
She gotta see it
I'm no different to you
I goes through it too
I dumpes through the pages
I don't come a age
I'm not a D A T
I'm far from per... cy
I roll the tumble weed
It's just a humble scene
That I present to you
Is just a mister crue
Who burrs a harmony
And sum a melody
Just speaks to where we are
And don't a hopes a jar
A soon we're walking in
A blim to just to say
A cum on!"

Lowride
What happened in the car yo?
F'real, let a nigga
Brand new Truck butter soft seat
4 point something with a low ridin' something
Ain't nothing better than to ride out the hood with it
Who looking better and damn you looking good in it
Take a chance with a nigga in the choice ride
Listen to the CD's I play inside
Mos Def, Jay, Prince and Stevie
Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin and Biggie
And when the evening is over love
Gonna find a nice spot for the Rover love
Do things to make the man in the moon blush
My mind race but I tell my waist don't rush
You's a upper echelon piece
So when you find there's a stash then you don't freak
You wanna nibble on a nigga ear
And do all the things that make a nigga wanna get near
Oh I'm a Queens representative
Get wild by any means my incentive is
When we done, I start it up again
And ride round with you cause you my special friend
Me and you, I think we should ride
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Don't worry just come get inside
Come on, come on, come on, come on
The second cut, my ride is like art
We get creative in it when we take it out and spin it
The backseat is the canvas we paintin on
Abstract, the work we create an own
The TV's in the back and the dash too
Got miss napkins and bamboo
Don't worry, the tints passed the legal one
Outkast's banging loud in my eardrum
The way the wheels spin cutting through the still wind
Outsiders looking in with the ill grin
Fuel injected brand new inspected
Emissions got tested details perfected
Got the Armor All touch, empty out the dutch
No tobacco spillin on my rug klutz
Kick off your shoes show off your peticure
Shake off the blues we all forgettin more
More of that thing
Stuff that brings ecstasy makin' you cling
A little harder than your average hug or grab
Lady tell me this is better than takin' a cab
And when you bounce, tell all your girls
You rode around hot-wheelin drinkin', no earl
Vacationin, V up my V8
Just one night we drive and we escape
Me and you, I think we should ride
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Don't worry just come get inside
Come on, come on, come on, come on

But on the other hand, I really feel your stress and pain.
Flimsy little men, they can't command you
And they don't have the heart to demand you,
But niether do I. I guess I'll let you walk
On and watch 'cause your walk is strong.
Sippin' passion wit' a stranger in the club,
It doesn't necessarily equate to love.
It's not really in the air, I wanna take it elsewhere

Even if you have one person with you when it's hard
That makes it easy, celebrate them let know just who they are
Because of these experiences, I have some control
On the microphone and roll elevating to the stars

Staying gunning make way for possibilities
It's the capital Q, rap it'll do
What I want it to, it's like taming a shrew
Living life experiencing proportions
Knowing better, I've experienced distortions
And through the in and outs, of life's revolving doors
I'mma see that, I'm still getting more
Yeah, I'm comin' in, I'm gonna see my friend
To the top floor, seems it never ends
Heaven never ends, yeah, it never ends

You walking on me guaranteed you be crawling back

Dogs don't eat it up increase they feedin time

Am I a strongman nigga well shit yeah
Plus we can hold a convo
Or go to the movies, my crib, whatever yo
Just wanna see you by my side
We on 95, know the stash is in the ride
A rappin' nigga for real
You would find me in a cypher if I didn't cop a deal
Rap slate like big grate
You buy, I sell, we split big cake
Uh uh, just move your little thing
Move it around and shake your little thing
Uh Uh"
24,Wait Up,1999,Amplified (1999),Hip Hop,Q-Tip,"(Electronic Beeping noice for about 20 seconds)
We on a brand new page. ("";Uh."";) Millennium days,
Desperation on the streets gotta find a new way
Keep the mics and choke holds. The saga unfolds
Machavellian approaches executed by the coach
I'm in these streets like a ghost
The air-jettin' artist
To the love, I hit 'em right plus I hit the hardest, man
I got a whole new approach for the rhymin'
You cherry cats slide, I'm holdin' out for the Heisman
Uh! You play the rappin' roll
I take the rap and sold,
And intertwine it wit' mine and turn a half to whole
I'm just a genie in a Jack bottle
Them fake ballin'-ass cats is just a wack model
This joint knocks wit' the force of a gat throttle
I live by 'You put it out, we get it back' motto
Hey. But who around but just your average reproduction, love
Rap is gettin' lose so all the ice is screamin' 'Thug'
What the hell is wrong? I'm askin' in this song
One time I smoked hash out of the hippies' bong
One of us is goin' laid 'cause I ain't gettin' played
I leave you right inside that shitty-ass bed you made
And walk along chuggin' Baller's Brains, rockin' rings
And things and just waitin' for white rains
I got the drive, dog. I hope the dogs' ready
My mentality on dime chicks is stay sweaty
Wait up. Your wait up. Wait up.
Get your ("";It's the Ummah for all time."";) wait up.
Wait up. Your wait up. Wait up.
Get your ("";The Ummah forevea!"";) wait up.
Wait up. Your wait up. Wait up.
Get your ("";GET YOUR WAAAIIIIIIIIIIT..."";) wait up.
Wait up. Your wait up. Wait up.
Get your ("";..UP! UP! UP! UP! Yo!"";) wait up.
You wanna shoot dice or wanna shoot rounds?
Wanna sell rhymes or wanna sell pounds?
The decision is yours. I'd rather see tours,
Get chicks wit' ghetto shit fallin' out they drawers
My team stay posted. They stay roasted
Niggas who all in it had a hard knock livin'
Administra, rhyme minista, illa treasura
You didn't know that your man was a legend, huh?
Embonishment for the both of you
I hit the road and I take my whole fuckin' crew
'Cause I'm a Queens cat. ("";True."";) To the G's cat. ("";True."";)
Gettin' money for more than one needs cat. ("";Aiiight, c'mon."";)
Condition never peers and ("";Take it home, kid."";) mind stands out
From Seattle to South Beach my joint: grand clout
It's the street commentator, providin' you wit' data
On how to live unique and it's really not neat. We gotta...
Wait up. Your wait up. Wait up.
Get your ("";Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."";) wait up.
Wait up. Your wait up. Wait up.
Get your ("";Brand new shit, huh."";) wait up.
Wait up. Your wait up. Wait up.
Get your ("";GET YOUR WAAAIIIIIIIIIIT..."";) wait up.
Wait up. Your wait up. Wait up.
Get your ("";..UP! UP! UP! Yeah! HA-HA..."";) wait up.
And all the fellas go, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'
And all my ladies go, 'Uh, uh, uh.'
And all the fellas go, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'
And all the ladies go, 'Uh, uh, uh.'
Fellas go, 'Where you at?'
Ladies go, 'Yo, come back!'
Fellas go... ladies go...
Fellas go... ladies... yo...
A mellow disposition even when it's pain
Your mental ammunition is faulty wit' a drain
I puts it down, Lord, Fuck a mic cord
Brother's out of his game so we can see tours
The innovator - your man still a hater
The Abstract imprint, it stays like a Smint
I got the masses cold, wigglin' and shakin' they ass
Ma, you betta get involved and do it real fast
(Beeping starts again but with instrumental backing it)"
25,We Fight/We Love,2008,The Renaissance (2008),Hip Hop,Q-Tip,"And it, and it begins, he walks outside for a cigarette break
And thinks how many cigarettes does it take
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints, he thinks, he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he think about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down, she made him better
Fought the love through the fucked up weather
And she thinking about her life
With no more work, just being a wife
But instead her love she gave it to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she go to work plus go to school
Plus fight the love she must feel like a fool
She want the ease that come after pain
She fights for love, that's her campaign
We fight, we love
We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit
We'll find out who we are
We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit
We'll find out who we are
Fighting just a little bit
Loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit
Loving just a little bit more
We just keep on
Fighting just a little bit

Fighting just a little bit
Loving just a little bit more

Loving just a little bit more
We just keep on

And it, and it begins, he's off the ball
He left his friends, he ain't home no more
He's in a place that's far away
Where he can't understand what they say
They say salaam, they carry bombs
Into crowded places and cause alarm
You're the infidel who's uninvited
But really an American boy who's slighted
It ain't your fault, you want identity
So you join this big fraternity
You get to travel the world, it's cheaper than college
And you get guns and you get knowledge
Looking for your soul and WMD's
You can't find nothing 'cause it's empty
You got your gun and he's your friend
And he's your man until the end
We fight, we love
We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit
We'll find out who we are
We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit
We'll find out who we are

26,Won't Trade,2008,The Renaissance (2008),Hip Hop,Q-Tip,"Now that I know what is boy
For your epitaph niggers
Laugh, tricks that he gassed your ass
Siphon and not your cash
Seeing the door in a flash
While I stay enclosed
Walkin' out my clothes she said,
I was waitin for nothing
You're mother fucking right
Walking this shit every night
Fin this shit? Hold it tight
Rina filma on my sleeve?
Even when I have to leave
Cooler than even in the breeze
Do you believe
I was waiting for nothin'
The one division leader
In the rebound new group of shorties
Off the post, goin' coast to coast
She on the hard ones, sub him out the game she sayin'
""Naw, he good, I mean""
I was waitin for nothing
For no amount of dough
Franchise this man
Give him all the things you can
Think long term plans even bringin' in the fans
Front page magazine, listen to this lady scream
I was waitin' for nothing
'Cause she know what's better her top and
Now a beckon on the flu
Like a runnin' with the nicest nigger
Kinda sorta?
When he's singing just to slaughter no matter the quarter
I was waitin' for nothing
The club house king
Batting practice Slugger swing,
Game time same thing
When I'm in about a minute
Holdin' the bat, as good as fat
She's out the park and comin' back she's saying
I was waitin for nothing
And for ray you say you get it good
If you were the ball player at all
And the famous fall inevitably will make a call
Hangin' memorabilia from you walls
This is why you can't trade me
I was waitin for nothing
Now that I know what is boy
You can bet your money on a sure thing
Certain profit's what it brings
Ceremonies of the ringer in the white house wing
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring, do you wanna trade?
I was waitin for nothing
'Cause in the air? there's a teammate you're lookin' for
Back-shoot and aughter ball?
Leaves it all on the floor
Always lookin' to score
Pep talks in the locker room
This is why you sing this tune
I was waitin for nothing
And then you reach Can't make me sit out
I go till you get out
Her ball no get out
An all night get-down
I train for the pressure
They come all-thresha
Equipped for the game
You know my name, it makes me better
I cheer for the whole team
Let's go for the whole thing
The ballads that you're holding
And repeat whole thing
And I represent the sentiment yeah allo team
And you say
I was waitin for nothing
The physical ability with mental capability
Legitimately faces me aside of your vicinity
And I ain't really seein' me
Vacating this community I'm staying in
I was waitin for nothing
I'm glad that you feel this way,
Here is where I like to play
Need to hear it everyday
They cheer for me, say ""Olay! ""
Wait a minute, ""Andale? ""
I don't know, well anyway..."
27,You,2008,The Renaissance (2008),Hip Hop,Q-Tip,"Wait
It's you
And at the end of it all it's you
And at the end
It's you
At the end of it all it's you
It's you
It's you
At the end of it all it's you
It's you
It's you
At the end of it all
Lookin' for how I see her
When I finally realized couldn't believe it
I couldn't, even swallow
Had a lump in my throat my stomach hollow
I had a notion that things were fishy
But everything was fine so I'd be pissy
But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get in
That's when the snoopin and shit it would begin
Where you at?
Where you going?
That's what I get when I pick up the phone
Not a hello or I miss you
Or the renaissnace how does it do?
Suspicious ones go few
Can stress out your brain
In weighs on your mane
And helps you peep game I thought it was me
But then I could it see
It was you
It's you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end
It was you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end
It's you
It's you
At the end of it all it's you
It's you
It's you
At the end of it all
I couldn't take it
But the spell of love
I couldn't shake it
Even though I would discover
That there was somebody else
It was your lover
You gave me up
And managed to turn the tables
And all your honest words they turn to fables
The things that you would accuse me of
It seem were the things you were doin' love
Get it? these things you projected
And I don't want to be affected
But when you get in love
It's never easy love
To make decisions of
You've defected
You were doin' so much to try to pin me
Goin' through all my stuff but it was empty
Answers, that I'm seekin'
Well it seem I'm gettin' close
That I'm reachin'
And I was thinkin' I had no reason
Callin you a culprit it was treason
And the twinkle in your eye
It was kinda not for love
And tell me why?
We'll make a mends if you admit it
We can ascend if your committed
Your heart, is it in it?
If it goes for many days
Sweet love can decay from you
It's you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end
It was you
At the end of it all it was you
And the end
It's you
It's you
At the end of it all it's you
It's you
It's you
At the end of it all"
