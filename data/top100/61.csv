0,As the Rhyme Goes On,1987,Paid in Full (1987),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Knowledge will begin until I finish this song
cause my rhymes' the oxygen
Then wave your hands - when you're ready I'll send you
Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue
And so on and I'ma go on simultaneously
And even if I stop - the rhyme remains to be
Rising to the top - and I came to drop it
Catch it and quiz it - is my topic
Universual "
1,Casualties of War,1992,Don't Sweat the Technique (1992),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Casualties of War!
Casualties of war; as I approach the barricade
Where's the enemy? Who do I invade?
Bullets of Teflon, bulletproof vest rip
Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips
'Cause I got a family that waits for my return
To get back home is my main concern
I'ma get back to New York in one piece
But I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets
Sky lights up like fireworks blind me
Bullets, whistlin over my head remind me...
President Bush said attack
Flashback to Nam, I might not make it back
Missile hits the area, screams wake me up
From a war of dreams, heat up the M-16
Basic training, trained for torture
Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya
Addicted to murder, send more bodybags
They can't identify em, leave the nametags
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
Casualties of war! (4x)
Day divides the night and night divides the day
It's all hard work and no play
More than combat, it's far beyond that
'Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack
Area's mapped out, there'll be no, Stratego
Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go
But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall?
Somebody give the President a call
But I hear warfare scream through the air
Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare
A Desert Storm: let's see who reigns supreme
Something like Monopoly: a government scheme
Go to the Army, be all you can be
Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me
So I start letting off ammunition in every direction
Allah is my only protection
But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same
And this is Asia, from where I came
I'm on the wrong side, so change the target
Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant?
Blame it on John Hardy Hawkins for bringing me to America
Now it's mass hysteria
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
Casualties of war! (4x)
The war is over, for now at least
Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace
It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about
Whole generation, left in doubt
Innocent families killed in the midst
It'll be more dead people after this
So I'm glad to be alive and walkin'
Half of my platoon came home in coffins
Except the general, buried in the Storm
In bits and pieces no need to look for em
I played it slick and got away with it
Rigged it up so they would think they did it
Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet
When THEY call, I'm going AWOL
Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war
When I don't know who or what I'm fighting for
So I wait for terrorists to attack
Every time a truck backfires I fire back
I look for shelter when a plane is over me
Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G
Kamikaze, strapped with bombs
No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam
Did I hear gunshots, or thunder?
No time to wonder, somebody's going under
Put on my fatigues and my camoflouge
Take control, 'cause I'm in charge
When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor
Casualties of war! (4x)"
2,Don't Sweat the Technique,1992,Don't Sweat the Technique (1992),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Don't sweat the Technique (2x)
Let's trace the hints and check the file
Let see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul.
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass, till MC's get weak.
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep...
'Cause when I speak, they freak
To sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
Wit a melody and a president's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits
Wit' beats, parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique
Don't Sweat the Technique
They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped in rep., but
Researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to last who observe them
They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens, are swords
Letters put together form a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, born with structure
Because of my culture, I'm a rip and destruct the
Difficult styles that'll be for the technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique
But don't sweat the technique
I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep and the weak then complete their
Pull with a seat, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new 'cause it's radiant
And the wild style'll have much more volume
Classical too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant: mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
They fought, and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique (2x)"
3,Eric B. is President,1987,Paid in Full (1987),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnetize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
The rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note
My mind remains to find all kinda ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So Eric B, make 'em clap to this
I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric B easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
'Cause to me, MC means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Say ""Indeed"" then I proceed 'cause my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
His fingertips, so I rhyme until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make him bleed to death
But he's kicking it 'cause it ain't no half steppin'
The party is live, the Rak can't be kept inside
If he's eruptin' just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
'Cause I'm better then the rest of them
Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim
Go get a girl and get soft and warm
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand 'cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me
Funky..."
4,Follow the Leader,1988,Follow the Leader (1988),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Verse One:
Follow me into a solo get in the flow
And you can picture like a photo
Music mixed mellow maintains to make
Melodies for MC's motivates the breaks
I'm everlastin, I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as X-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard,
FLIP IT - now it's a daily word
I can get iller than 'Nam, a killin' bomb
But no alarm - Rakim will remain calm
Self-esteem make me super superb and supreme
But for a microphone still I fiend
This was a tape I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I want to see who can keep followin and swallowin
Takin' the making, bitin it and borrowin
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
But I'ma let ya sweat - you still ain't warm
You a step away from frozen, stiff as if ya posin
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me and were ya thinkin' you were first?
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the Universe
What could ya say as the Earth gets further and further away
Planets are small as balls of clay
Astray into the Milky Way - world's outasight
Far as the eye can see - not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As ya stare in the darkness, ya knowledge is took!
So keep starin' soon ya suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the R
This is a lesson if ya guessin and if ya borrowin
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin
The Leader
Verse Two:
This is a lifetime mission, vision of prison
Aight listen
In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I Eternal? Or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep ya movin cause the crowd said so
Dance - cuts rip ya pants
Eric B on the blades, bleedin to death - call the ambulance
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone murderin' MC's
Let's quote a rhyme from a record I wrote
(Follow the leader) Yeah - dope
Cause every time I stop it seems ya stuck
Soon as ya try to step off ya self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showin and provin and lettin knowledge be born
Then after that I'll live forever - you disagree?
You say never? Then follow me!
From century to century you'll remember me
In history - not a mystery or a memory
God by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave,
But remember - You're not a slave
'Cause we was put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see it because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, reveal my name
I guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted; it can't be changed or switched
Here's a lesson if ya guessing and borrowing
Hurry hurry, step right up and keep following
The leader
Verse Three:
A furified freestyle, lyrics of fury
My third eye makes me shine like jewelry
You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every traitor or snake - so stay awake
And follow and follow, because the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim the Fiend of a Microphone
I'm not HIM, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt, 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed slow down to let the leader lead
Word to daddy, indeed!
The R's a rollin' stone, so I'm rollin'
Directions is told, then the rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin', a brother said, dig em, I never dug 'em
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug 'em
Into danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, it's basic, erase it, change ya tone
There's one R in the alphabet
It's a one-letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state, followers tailgate
Keep comin' but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant - clap ya hands, you won a trip!
The price is right - don't make a deal too soon
How many notes could you name this tune?
Follow the Leader is the title, theme, task
Now ya know, you don't have to ask
Rap is Rhythm And Poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might catch up if you follow the records E. wrecks
Until then keep eatin and swallowin
You better take a deep breath and keep followin
The leader."
5,I Ain't No Joke,1987,Paid in Full (1987),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"I ain't no joke, I use to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the seen I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up convert it into hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration, 'cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tamed
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
Competin' 'cause I just put your mind on pause
And I complete when - you compare my rhyme wit yours
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me, the one you got your idea from
But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher
When you start to stutter that's when you had enuff of
Biting, it'll make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should've broke because I ain't no joke
I got a question, as serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling
'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits
Get the style down pat then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you fake it you're ready for the neighborhood chores
The E-M-C-E-E don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those 7 MC's
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns and paragraphs based on you and
Your offbeat DJ, if anything he play
Sound familiar, I'll wait till E say
Play 'em, so I'ma have to diss and bro
You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke
I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation 'cause when I invent
I nominated my DJ to president
When I'm see I'll, keep a freestyle, going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
They'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiending
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the middle of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the R so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
'Cause I'm moving the crowd and B'll wreck the fader
No interruptions till the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
'Cause everything is real on a serious tip
Keep playing and I varies quick
And take you for a walk through hell
Freeze your dome then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple stage darkness
When it get dark again then I'ma spark this
Microphone 'cause the heat is on, you see smoke
Then I finish when the beat is gone, I'm no joke"
6,I Know You Got Soul,1987,Paid in Full (1987),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker till you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
Your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul
You got it (4x)
I know you got soul
Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul
You got it (5x)
I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul
You got it (4x)
Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim'll say peace
You got it (10x)"
7,In the Ghetto,1990,Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em (1990),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Planet Earth was my place of birth
Born to be the sole controller of the universe
Besides the part of the map I hit first
Any a rhyme that I can adapt when it gets worst
The rough gets going, the going gets rough
When I start flowing, the mic might bust
The next state, I shake from the power I generate
People in Cali used to think it was earthquakes
'Cause times was hard on the Boulevard
So I vote God and never get scarred and gauled
But it seems like I'm locked in hell
Looking over the edge but the R never fell
A trip to slip 'cause my Nikes got grip
Stand on my own two feet and come equipped
Any stage I'm seen on, or mic I fiend on
I stand alone and need nothing to lean on
Going for self with a long way to go
So much to say but I still flow slow
I come correct and I won't look back
'Cause it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Even the (ghetto)
I learn to relax in my room and escape from New York
And return through the womb of the world as a thought
Thinking how hard it was to be born
Me being cream with no physical form
Millions of cells with one destination
To reach the best part, it's life creation
9 months later, job well done
Make way, 'cause here I come
Since I made it this far, I can't stop now
There's a will and a way and I got the know-how
To be all I can be and more
And see all there is to see before
I'm called and go back to the essence
It's alot to learn so I study my lessons
I thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me
I'm glad I listen when my father was rapping to me
'Cause back in the days, they lived in caves
Exiled from the original man, they strayed away
Now that's what I call hard times
I rather be here to exercise the mind
Then I take a thought around the world twice
From knowledge to born back to knowledge precise
Across the desert, that's hot as the arabian
But they couldn't cave me in 'cause I'm the Asian
Reaching for the city of Mecca, visit Medina
Visions of Neffertiti then I seen a
Mind keeps traveling, I'll be back after I
Stop and think about the brothers and sisters in Africa
Return the thought through the eye of a needle
For miles I thought and I just fought the people
Under the dark skies on a dark side
Not only there but right here's an apartheid
So now is the time for us to react
Take a trip through the mind and when you get back
Understand you're third eye seen all of that
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Even the (ghetto)
Even the (ghetto)
No more props, I want property in every borough,
Nobody's stopping me because I'm thorough,
Rhymes I make gimme real estate for me to own
Wherever I bless a microphone
007 is back and relaxing
On point and reactin' and ready for action
I'm so low key that you might not see me
Incognito and taking it easy
Quiet, it's kept on a hush hush
In front of a crowd, I get loud, there's a bumrush
Be calm, keep a low pro and play the background
Hopin' the wack rapper put the mic back down
So rip it, break it in half, go 'head and slam it
'Cause when it's time to build, I'm a mechanic
I'm bonding and mending, attaching and blending
So many solos, there is no ending
People in my neighborhood, they know I'm good
From London to Hollywood, wherever I stood
Footprints remain on stage ever since
As I walk the street, I leave fossils and dents
When I had sex, I left my name on necks
My trademark was left throughout the projects
I used to get rich when I played celo
When I rolled 4, 5, 6, they go we know
So I collect my cash then slide
I got my back, my gun's on my side
It shouldn't have to be like that
I guess it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Even the (ghetto)
I'm from the (ghetto)
Word up, peace"
8,Keep 'em Eager To Listen,1990,Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em (1990),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"(Rakim)
Me and the rap's laid back
Nonchalant and relaxed in the track
Put together well, so it ain't hard to tell
Easy to recognize, so my records'll sell
On the microphone, well known with a low tone
Show and prove when the stage show is shown
All you hear is screams when I'm hit by the laser beams
Ladies fiend, rappers are choosin' up teams
So who could beat up, just before we meet up
Before I kick a rhyme, I kick my feet up
To let you know, everything's under control
Under surveillance, takin' over your soul
So let me handle this, gettin' scandalous
All my jams are hits, never plan to miss
Crowd is captured, released at my permission
Peep em, as I, keep 'em eager to listen
(Rakim)
Opponents are found paralyzed from the mic down
Left with a little sight ears still hear the sound
Try to clear your mind but it's still there
Give him about a year, then give him a wheelchair
I damage and deteriorate, till your brain dead
No huss cuss what I discuss'll bust his head
Here's some hearin aids when your eardrums fail
You get scars, so you could read it in braille
Close your third eye, then I do body work
And I keep the same procedure till somebody's hurt
My DJ'll sew up cuts like an M.D.
And I still move crowds like an M.C.
Entertain and tear you out of your frame
Leave you in a puddle of blood, then let it rain
Then I get deep, so try to withstand
On my level to think, or sink like quicksand
He couldn't hang, so I cut the rope short
Watchin 'em fall, 'cause they need more support
This is the way that I done, all of my competition
Peep em, as I, keep 'em eager to listen
Keep 'em eager to listen
(Rakim)
The performance I give 'em is, somethin' like a hypnotism
Swingin' back and forth, till you can keep the rhythm
At the tone of my voice, you will become
Eager to listen dance in a trance till you see the
R on stage, no cheers, all ears
All three of your eyes on me, so it appears
Just like you thought it would be, but even better
Live and direct on stage, instead of the
Radio or video or studio rehearsin
I'm at my best in the flesh in person
The main attraction, center of attention
The crowd'll go crazy, soon as I mention
It's time to communicate, so let's conversate
I get my point across, when you respond I make sense
So now we could continue the mission
As I, keep 'em eager to listen
As I, keep 'em eager to listen
(Rakim)
I used to always say one day
I'll play in the NBA 'cause I'll slay
Opponents well, and also excel
As a black quarterback in the NFL
I throw to score so I can hear the crowd roar
Keep em, out of they seats and on the floor
And when I win, it'll pump my adrenaline
My record is undefeated, and I'll win again
I'll never lose or hear boos from the audience
'Cause they participate, and applaud me since
I bring 'em what they want to hear
And they'll fill up the atmopshere
With people that came to party, and have a good time
So when I'm gone, I'm sure, you understood the rhyme
Because I promise to accomplish the mission
'Cause I, keep 'em eager to listen"
9,Keep the Beat,1992,Don't Sweat the Technique (1992),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"She asked could I keep the beat
So here's the beat, every time it pounds, you get weak
Comfy, imbedded like a pillow, bouncin' wit an echo
My voice is moist, and plus mellow
I got it going on, you're gonna wanna come
Skins is the drum, (I) said I'm the drummer, give the drummer some
And we'll see if you can hang wit Ra
Hm, let's see if you can Shangri-La
Easy ...like Tina Marie I play it slick
Like Rick James, I'm the fire in your desire's flames;
I heat up your temperature, keep the tempo raw
When you start to smoke, rest assured
I start to think 'cause you're a singer like Anita
High pitched like a tweeter, deep beats start to beat her
Much harder than love taps, my rap's above that
I get girls where I want wit a maze full of lovetraps
But I don't want to fall in love
I stand in love, good balanced wit a plan to shove
Accapella as we start to speak
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek then I complete the beat
Tempo's moving and I'm hoping it'll never fade away...
The beat is grooving, words are soothing and please tell me that you're here
To stay
In the morning and I'm hoping the morning come again
Hold me close and give me another dose and
Keep the beat don't ever let it end
She said, ah, so far, you didn't miss a beat yet
Pop in another cassette, then I'm in to wreck
I'll give you a beat you never had before,
I had to explore and came up wit more
Deep trunk kicks wit a brick for a drum stick
You know the song, don't hum along, come quick
You lay like Sade, it feels like paradise
At the top of the pyramid, we review new heights
The scenery of Egypt, you and me as we get
So deep in the groove, when you move, you get seasick
You seen enough, close your eyes and relax
Move wit the tracks and stay tuned for the sax
The instrumental, enters your mental...
Tense but gentle and, sentimental,
Accapella as we start to speak
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek then I complete the beat
She wanted the extended version
So I kept splurging and add more words in;
Strong: the emotion, notions move and
The poetry's smoking, potions soothing,
There goes the moon, I'm far from done,
Rise like the sun, here comes the sun
And I won't stop till it sets and then
Rewind the cassettes and I'm a play it again;
But this time it's instrumental at a faster tempo
All I wanna hear is ""Yeah Rakim, Go""!
I work overtime on your body and mind
'Cause I'm incline to do both combined
My job is never done but done well
Horizontal or parallel
Accapella as we start to speak
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek then I complete the beat"
10,Kick Along,1992,Don't Sweat the Technique (1992),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Kick along (3x)
If you like it accapella; soul clap will be sweet,
Almost complete.
Feel the impact when it hit the street
But uh, it sound thicker when I kick it wit a beat
See I can let it speak for itself
But every now and then, I need a little help
Guess who, to the rescue ? Comp!
Ripping up comp, I step and then stomp
A spark scam'll skin the land like it's a Timberland
Prepare the stage for Rakim to stand
Then I pick a song, grab the mic, click it on
Time to get it on, kick along
See if you can move to the words I speak
Pick up on a rhythm (kickin' wit da beat)
My menta-llect gets warm, feed into your physical form
You can't keep calm
Get fit to the skit, try to hop on-
Get up to the trick as I flip the script
You're feeling rust like a thrust of an arrow, plus,
You're looking through the eye of a barrel, Bus!
Emergency! Take him to the operating room,
Put him on the floor, let his heart feel the boom
React to the wrath of a brand new song
Then kick along
Kick along (5x)
A kick is a hip wit hop
A pep wit step like the floor is hot
I project alot so you can use every kick you got
But don't forget, don't kick when I stop
I'm something like Simon says
As I'm pumping hype rhymes in your heads
The mic's a remote control and I'm pointing it at cha
When I push buttons, you're gonna have ta
Break straight to the floor
'Cause I'm a make more
Each one's composed in the shows
And each one flows, how long, nobody knows
And whoever try to take 'em, I'm a break 'em
Drag it out of him, dehydrate 'em
The beat makes the beat in your heart accelerate
Your pulse is a drumroll, it's too late to wait
A pen'll send adrendaline to ten
If then begin to blend the smooth that's sent;
That's to prevent you from getting asthma
You try to keep up, because, the cut has ya
Blood pressure to the point, never stops a drop
Putting stain in the veins in the brain, ya blood clots!
Too quick to pause it, you almost lost it
So kick along to you're all exhausted
And look what my data made! my power'll never fade
I keep it energetic, or hype as Gatorade...
Now kick it wit a beat
C'mon, kick along
Kick along (3x)
They can't wait to kick steps to this
So I make a skit just for kicks
Syncopated, pausing though,
Innovated 'cause the flow
Melodic and melodramatic styles occur,
Like a choreographer, my mind's a photographer
Making music visible for the individual
That gets visual
What I manifest you express on the dance floor
Pants get torn when the jam is on
'Cause I kick rhymes until the rhymes kick back
It's hard to kick that, where did'cha get that
Here's the concept, part of you're concert
Expect the expert to perfect and do work.
Don't stop the song till I'm gone
Keep getting it on, kick it off with the horns
Kick along
Kick along (2x)
Kick it wit a beat"
11,Know the Ledge,1992,Don't Sweat the Technique (1992),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Sip the juice 'cause I got enough to go around,
And the thought takes place uptown
I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk,
And then taught to hawk New York-
I go to Queens for queens to get the crew from Brooklyn,
Make money in Manhattan and never been tooken,
Go Uptown and the Bronx to boogie down,
Get strong on the Island, recoupe, and lay around.
Time to bulid my juice back up-
Props back up, suckers get smacked up
Don't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about
Knocking niggaz off, knocking niggaz out
Shaking 'em up, waking 'em up
Raking 'em up, breaking 'em up...
Standing on shaky grounds too close to the edge
Let's see if I know the ledge
Corners' trifling 'cause shorty's here
I get cock-d liffin' forty's of beer;
Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased,
If I get revenge, then they rest in peace.
Somebody's got to suffer, I just might spare one-
And give a brother a fair one!
Stay alert and on ""p's"".
And I do work with these- like Hercules,
Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw
'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall.
Smooth but I move like an army
Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me,
Putting brothers to rest like Elliot ness
'Cause I don't like stress
Streets ain't a place for innocent bystanders to stand
Nutting's gonna stop the plan
I'll chill like Pacino, kill like DeNiro
Black Gambino, die like a hero
Living on shaky grounds too close to the edge
Let's see if I know the ledge!
Shells lay around on the battleground
Dead bodies are found throughout the town.
Tried to put shame in my game to make a name, I'm a
Put it on a bullet, put it in your brain.
Rip the block like a buckshot,
Who cares where it goes, just keep the casket closed,
No remorse when a life is lost
I paid my dues- paid the cost!
...And my pockets are still fat,
Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat.
Even if my crew steep with one deep
I attract attention, people like to peep
So come say hi to the badguy
Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die!
'Cause I get loose and I got troops
And crazy juice!
In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini
Hang out wit Smith and Wesson, don't try to play me.
I'm at war alot, like Anwar Sadat...
But no warning shot, my gun is warm alot.
When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear,
Areas in fear but this here's severe
Living life too close to the edge
Hoping that I know the ledge...
A brand new morn, no time to yawn
Shower's on, power's on
Late for school, I catch the train
Girls sip ""Cristal"" and whisper my name
I push up like an exercise,
Check the intellect and inspect the thighs
Select the best one, pull her to the side
Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride
Read my resume she's know I'm 'ready cool
Just meet me after school,
We can moan and groan until your mom come home,
And you be calling me Al ""dope"" Capone.
Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose-
Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice
Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety
Cause alot of niggaz hate me
Coming out of the building, they set me up
Sprayed wit automatics, they wet me up
In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge
I guess I didn't know the ledge..."
12,Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em,1990,Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em (1990),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"I'm the arsenal
I got artillery, lyrics of ammo
Rounds of rhythm
Then I'm 'a give 'em piano
Bring a bullet-proof vest
Nothin' to ricochet
Ready to aim at the brain
~Now what the trigger say
Tempos triflin'
Felt like a rifle
Massage 'n' melodies
Might go right through
Simultaneously like an Uzi
Nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up when lady say don't lose me
So re-load quickly
And you better hit me
While I'm lettin' this fifi get wit me
You steppin' with .007
Better make it snappy
No time to do your hair, baby
Brothers are bustin' at me
Beats and bullets pass me
None on target
They want the R hit
But wtch the god get
Quicker, the tongue is the trigger
'Cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em
Let 'em feel the blast
Penetrate at a crazy rate
This ain't no .38
Hit 'em at point blank range
And watch 'em radiate
Runnin' out of ammunition
I'm done wit' em
You ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em
I push a power that's punishable
Better be a prisoner
The hit man is the
Brother wit' charisma
Showing you that I have
Powerful paragraphs
Followers will become leaders
But without a path
Ya mentally paralyzed
Crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred
Then it occurred that you heard I
Reduced the friction with crucifixion
Let loose the mix then
Boost the piston
Eric hit 'em with' some of that
Cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back
It won't be none of that
I'm untouchable
You see me in 3-D
When I let the rhythm hit another M.C.
Lyrics made of lead
Enters your head
Then eruptions of a mass production
Will spread when
Music is louder
Full of gunpower
Microphone machinery
When I see a crowd of
Party people pumpin'
Their fist like this
Ya hide in the back
Thinkin' that I might miss
But the R is accurate
Plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines that
I have to hit
Whatever I aim at
I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain
That time is up
You been hit with somethin'
Different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate and nothing's equivalent
Nothin' can harm me
Why try to bar me
You couldn't come around THE RA with aN army
You'll get wrecked by the architect
So respect 'em
I disconnect 'em, soon as I inject 'em
With radiation
Put 'em by the basement
Bust his chest open
Bash his face in
Let it split 'I'm
Since he brought his main man wit' 'I'm
He ask me how I did 'I'm
I let the rhythm hit 'I'm
Let it hit 'I'm
Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhyth with ral rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass
Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance
The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here let me introduce you
Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy
Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour
Now it's a HABIT
Ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention: follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Beware of overdose
Too many milligram
NO ONE made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man
Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'I'm
He'll never forget 'I'm
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em
At least when he left he'll know what hit 'I'm
The last breath of the words of death
Was the rhythm
Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know you'll blow the hell up
If I slow up, THEY'LL catch up, hell no
Wicked as I kicked it
Don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it
Reversed and switched it
To perform to perfection
Section for section
Rhymes keep connectin'
Ya guessin' what's next an'
Blood pressure rises, ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbit'
'Cause when I explained ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain hit a vein
Then remain, let it radiate
Vibes will vibrate
Why did you violate
Now I'm 'a have to let the style brak
Moans now the tone is ingrown
After this here's thrown, gimme another microphone
Before I get that fifi I met
Whisper I wanna reach HER intellect
Kiss her 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let the write reflect
Hold 'er, mold 'er, make 'er feel older
Lay her on my shoulder
EEverything I told her
Makes her feel secure whenever I'm wit' 'er
And you know how I did 'er
Me and the rhythm hit 'er"

14,Lyrics of Fury,1988,Follow the Leader (1988),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Verse one:
I'm rated ""R""...this is a warning, ya better void,
Poets are paranoid, DJ's D-stroyed,
'Cause I came back to attack others in spite-
Strike like lightnin', It's quite frightenin'!
But don't be afraid in the dark, in a park,
Not a scream or a cry, or a bark, more like a spark;
Ya tremble like a alcoholic, muscles tighten up,
What's that, lighten up! You see a sight but,
Suddenly you feel like you're in a horror flick,
You grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick!
Music's the clue, when I come your warned,
Apocolypse Now, when I'm done, ya gone!
Haven't you ever heard of a MC-murderer?
This is the death penalty, and I'm servin' a
Death wish, so come on, step to this
Hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist!
Friday the thirteenth, walking down Elm Street,
You come in my realm ya get beat!
This is off limits, so your visions are blurry,
All ya see is the meters at a volume,
Pumping Lyrics of Fury!
It's a ...fearified freestyle!
Terror in the styles, never error-files,
Indeed I'm known-your exiled!
For those that oppose to be level or next to this...
I ain't a devil and this ain't the Exorcist!
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep a wink,
The pain's a migraine every time ya think,
Flashbacks interfere, ya start to hear:
The R-A-K-I-M in your ear;
Then the beat is hysterical,
That makes Eric go get a ax and chops the wack,
Soon the lyrical format is superior,
Faces of death remain,
MC's decaying, 'cause they never stayed,
The scene of a crime every night at the show,
The fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know,
It's only one capable, breaks-the unbreakable,
Melodies-unmakable, pattern-unecscapable,
A horn if want the style I posses,
I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest,
For those that envy a MC it can be,
Hazardous to your health so be friendly,
A matter of life and death, just like a ethch-a-sketch,
Shake till your clear, make it disappear, make the next,
After the ceremony, let the rhyme rest in peace,
If not, my soul'll release!
The scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated, I'm glad you made it,
'Cause your about to see a disastrous sight,
A performance never again performed on a mic:
Lyrics of fury!
A fearified freestyle!
The ""R"" is in the house-too much tension!
Make sure the system's loud when I mention
Phrases that's fearsome...
You want to hear some sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums;
I sit back and observe the whole scenery,
Then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me,
Strictly business I'm quickly in this mood,
And I don't care if the whole crowd's a witness!
I'm a tear you apart but I'm a spare you a heart,
Program into the speed of the rhyme, prepare to start,
Rhythm's out of the radius, insane as the craziest
Musical madness MC ever made, see it's
Now an emergency, open-heart surgery...
Open your mind, you will find every word'll be
Furier than ever, I remain the furture,
Battle's tempting... whatever suits ya!
For words the sentence, there's no resemblance,
You think you're ruffer, then suffer the consequences!
I'm never dying-terrifying results,
I wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts,
Mic-to-mouth resuscitation, rhythm with radiation,
Novicane ease the pain it might save him,
If not, Eric B.'s the judge, the crowd's the jury...
How do I plead to homicide?
Lyrics of Fury!
They're getting furier! a fearified freestyle!"
15,Mahogany,1990,Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em (1990),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Me and Eric B was coolin' at the Paladium
Seen a all-world covered girl, I said ""Hey lady I'm
Sorry if You're in a rush - Don't let me hold ya up
Or interveen or interrupt, but...
You got the look - I wanna get to know ya better
I had to let her know - but yo, I didn't sweat her
'Cause if you woulda seen what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean, but European.
When she spoke, her accent was self-explanatory -
Even her body language told the story
Her name was Mahogony - twin's name was Ebony
I said ""My name is Ra - and this is Eric B""
Since the music was loud, I said ""let's take a walk,
So we could talk and see New York.
Show time doesn't start until one o'clock
And once I entered your mind I wouldn't wanna stop
Caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same
Calm ya nerves, massage ya brain
Each moment's a mineral, poetry's protein
Verse is the vitamin - Affects like Codine
So tell me how you feel and I'll reveal
A pill that'll heal ya pain - 'cause I'm real""
She musta OD'd 'cause she couldn't resist
She spoke slowly when she told me this, she said
Over Me, I'm goin' crazy
She'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy
She said she'd want my kids and help me make my next G
Tell me I ain't finesse Mahogony...
So I prescribed her something to revive and surprise her,
She's liver and much more wiser
From the light I shine when the brain cells spark,
Constantly so she can glow in the dark
Then soon, you can represent the moon
As long as I keep ya in tune
I'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here
Take it in stride 'cause it might take a year
It's funny - how time flies when ya havin' fun
We got close and it was almost one
She kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go
Fuck around and miss the show
So I told her to hold that thought real tight
We can finish where we left off later on tonight
Back to the scene of the crime on time
As they introduced the 'Fiend of the Rhyme'
She stood in the crowd with a birds-eye view of me
Thinkin' of later on of what she would do to me
The back of the room I could see her eyes gloom
Patient, but hopin' that the show was over soon
As the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row
So I said ""let's go""
I packed my mic as they screamed for an encore
The speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore
Besides I got places to go, ladies to see
And she could tell me how crazy she was over me
We drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed
And couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm', I said,
""I was watchin' you, watchin' me
Looks I received made it hard to MC
I can take a hint, so I knew that she
Wanted my ""Agony Agony Ag-on-y"" in her bod-y
Showed her some sights, then I took her to the Condo
She was pipin' hot, but I kept my calm so
She asked how come I don't smile I said, ""Everything's fine,
But I'm in a New York state of mind!""
As we reached the kingdom, she said bring some
Champagne, she'll entertain then sing some
Sentimental, songs real gentle,
It hit the spot and you know where it went to
As we embraced I felt her heart pumpin'
I knew she was in the mood for somethin'
So I laid on my back and relaxed
It wasn't the Perignon that made her collaspe
Over Me, she was goin' crazy
She'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy
She said she'd want my kids and help me make my next G
Tell me I ain't finesse Mahogony..."
16,Microphone Fiend,1988,Follow the Leader (1988),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
'Cause I grabbed the mic and try to say, ""Yes y'all!""
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab ...without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the other one, then I make another one
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, 'Cause it's sort of... an addiction,
Magnatized by the mixing
Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in
The mic is a drano, volcanoes erupting,
Rhymes overflowing, gradually growing
Everything is written in the cold, so it can coin-
Cide, my thoughts to guide,
48 tracks to slide
The invincible, microphone fiend Rakim
Spread the word, 'cause I'm in
E-F-F-E-C-T
A smooth operator operating correctly,
But back to the problem, I gotta habit,
You can't solve it, silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
Unawareness? Beware, it's the re-animator!
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assassinater, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiending for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend...
After 12, I'm worse that a Gremlin
Feed me Hip-hop and I start trembling
The thrill of suspense is intense, your horrified
But this ain't the cinemas of ""Tales From the Darkside"",
By any means necessary, this is what has to be done
Make way 'cause here I come...
My DJ cuts material...
Grand imperial.
It's a must that I bust any mic you're hand to me,
It's inherited, it's runs in the family
I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back,
If that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack.
Now I don't want to have to let off, you should of kept off
You didn't keep the stage warm -- step off!
Ladies and Gentleman, You're about to see
A pastime hobby about to be
Take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one-
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up
Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber
One on one and I'm the remainder!
So close your eyes and hold your breath,
And I'm a hit'cha wit the blow of death
Before you go, you'll remember you seen
The fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend
The microphone fiend..."
17,Move the Crowd,1987,Paid in Full (1987),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Verse one:
Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause When I heard the beat, I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It simple ain't it but quite clever
Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause if not and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long 'cause I'm a move on
The dancefloor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd
Move the crowd...
Verse two:
Imagine me wit the heat that's made by solar,
It gets stronger every time I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving or eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut!
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric B is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise due to Allah and that's a blessing
Wit knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees, I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven,
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving
Move the crowd..."
18,Musical Massacre,1988,Follow the Leader (1988),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"How could I keep my composure
When all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure?
Release, then veins in the brains increase
When I let off, make a wish and blow the smoke off my piece
Unloadin, unfold and the rhymes are explodin
And the mic that I'm holdin抯 golden
Cordless cause the wire caught fire like a fuse
Gunpowder and the slightest bruise is a friction
The outcome is there so listen
Here's the brief description
A boom then flame then smoke, ashes a dust to dust
Contact is compact when I bust
MC's are now in a massacre
A disaster a... master at fashion a beat to death
To a pulp, till it can't pump
Speakers ain't sayin' nothin'
Now the ball can thump
As I'm lookin' I stand like great buildings in Brooklyn
Then the stage is took then
Havoc struck that could product a whole court
Keep in touch with the mic when you're holdin' y'all
Sumpin and pumpin and slobbin and droolin
Nothin's pumpin, who do you think ya foolin?
Tommy Tucker, the neighborhood sucker
What you oughtta do... is pick up a tempo
From what I invent, so hard not to bite, but you can't prevent so
You start to kidnap
I watch the kid rap
When he get off he know he shouldn't a did that
Minor, old-timer, weak-rhymer, stay-in-liner
You won't be inclined to go so yo
Maybe later, you're gonna be
But for now, you're almost one of me
Now the immature imitations taken from originations
Made by tracin and a little arrangin
So perform, If ya still ain't warm maybe after
A roast by the host with the most it's a musical massacre
Never tired, don't even try it, keep quiet
Like a storm, you could rain... but a riot
Remains, the gangs power just like the towerin inferno
The beat's gonna burn so
Distance I kept, ou better watch your step
Volunteers go from here and get
Ya out of the flames
Appreciate the temperature change
Anywhere within the range of celcius
Fahrenheit on the mic, mic melts see it
Burns soon as it's felt see it's torchin, scorchin
Mic's pipin hot, steamin who's schemin now ya not
James Brown must a been dusted
Disgusted, now he can't be trusted
Embalmed with fluid
Static can cause an explosion, in fact impact's closin in
Time was up, so I don't need a time bomb
Beat gives me a heat-stroke when I rhyme calm
Pull out the tool, sometimes I wanna break fool
But I was cool, like one in the chamber
Lets play a game of rhymin roulette
And put me up to your brain and name a rhyme about ya clout
One mistake... ya out
If this imitation it can't be the same show
Maybe what you'll find somewhere over the rainbow
Courage, heart, brain, you need rhyme
Turn on your mic, snap your fingers three times
We gone, or the story won't end the same
And you'll feel the flame
The potion was weak, make another antidote
What's the science? why can't ya quote?
Elements for musical intelligence
Rhymes are irrelevant, no development
And that settles it
Go manufacture a match, send me after a blast
From the master that has to make musical massacre"
19,My Melody,1987,Paid in Full (1987),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Turn up the bass, check out my melody, hand out a cigar
I'm lettin knowledge be born, and my name's the R
A-k-i-m, not like the rest of them, I'm not on a list
That's what I'm sayin', I drop science like a scientist
My melody's in a code, the very next episode
Has the mic often distortin', ready to explode
I keep the mic at Fahrenheit, freeze MC's to make 'em colder
The listener's system is kickin' like solar
As I memorize, advertise, like a poet
Keep you goin' when I'm flowin', smooth enough, you know it
But rough that's why the moral of my story I tell E.B.
Nobody beats the R, check out my melody
So what, I'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as I seen
One of these four MC's so they don't have to scream
I couldn't wait to take the mic, flow into it to test it,
Let 'My Melody' play, then a record suggest it
I'm droppin' bombs, but I stay peace and calm
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
And I'll break, when I'm through breakin' I'll leave you broke
Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke
So stand back, you wanna rap? All of that can wait
I won't push, I won't beat around the bush
I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
You might try but you can't get close to
Because I'm number one, competition is none
I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun
'Cause I'm playin' ball or bobbin' in the hall
Or just writin my name in graffiti on the wall
You shouldn't have told me you said you controlled me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your money, pull out your cut
Pull up a chair, and I'm a tear shit up
My name is Rakim Allah, and R and A stands for Ra
Switch it around, it still comes out R
So easily will I e-m-c-e-e
My repetition of words is check out my melody
Some bass and treble is moist, scratch in and cut in a voice
And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice
I wouldn't a came and said my name and run same weak shit
Puttin' blurbs and slurs and words that don't fit
In a rhyme, why waste time on the microphone
I take this more serious than just a poem
Rockin' party to party, backyard to yard
I tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods
The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp
I can swing off anything even a string of a harp
Just turn it on and start rockin', mine, no introduction
Till I finish droppin' science, no interruption
When I approach I exercise like a coach
Usin' a melody and add new verse (?) and notes
So when the mic and the R-a-k-i-m
It's attached, like a match I will strike again
Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
Put in a order to pursue with the momentum except
I say one rhyme out of order, a longer rhyme shorter,
A pause, but don't stop the tape recorder
I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor
Melody arranger, poet, etcetera
Extra event, the grand finale-like bonus
I am the man they call the microphonist
With wisdom, which means wise words bein' spoken
Too many at one time watch the mic start smokin'
I came to express the rap I manifest
Stand in my way and I'll veto on the word's protest
MC's that wanna be vissed (?), they're gonna
Be dissed if they don't get from in fronta
All they can go get is me a glass of Moet
A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
I take 7 MC's put 'em in a line
And add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme
Well, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine
Now that's 21 MC's ate up at the same time
Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doin'
No fessin', no messin' around, no chewin'
No robbin', no buyin', bitin', why bother
This slob'll stop tryin', fightin' to follow
My unusual style will confuse you a while
And if I was water, I'd flow in the Nile
So many rhymes you won't have time to go for yours
Just because of applause I have to pause
Right after tonight is when I prepare
To catch another sucka duck MC out there
'Cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe
And after this you'll call me your majesty
My melody
Yes, my melody
Eric B.
Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorize it
Eric B. made a cut and advertised it
My melody's created for MC's in the place
They try to listen 'cause I'm dissin them so pick up your face
Shook off your neck 'cause you try to detect my pace
Now you're buggin', almost doggin' off my rhyme-like bass
The melody that I'm stylin', smooth as a violin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island
My wisdom is swift, no matter if
My momentum is slow, MC's still stand stiff
I'm genuine like leather - inclined to be clever
MC, you'll beat the R, I'll say ""Oh never""
So Eric B., cut it easily and
Check out my melody..."

No competition

Competition is none, I remain at the top like the sun
And I burn whoever come in the chambers of torture
I caught ya, you shoulda brought ya
Neighborhood to support ya
No one in my path will withstand
Under pressure the wrath of a swift man
You name the day, the grounds to be neutral
Speak your piece, the feeling's mutual
We can go topic from topic whenever I drop it
Try to stop it
In other words, what the brother heard
He tried to catch it, but what occurred
Was too much weight for one brain to take
Try to concentrate maintain then elevate
Program an ounce from pound to pound
The matter of weight can't hold my mind down
Permanent damage, I do away with
No time for fun, 'cause I don't play with
Competitors, there's only one when I'm done
Competition is none
...
No competition
...
Competition is none, I'm the soul survivor
MC's get live but I get liver
It ain't a Memorex, live in concert
At every network, the R the expert
Whoever goes against causes friction
Introduction music where's the mixing
Ra will never die, tools they never try
To beat or defeat me, because whenever I
Put poetry in motion
From the Nile, then out into the ocean
Three-fourths of water makes seven seas
A third of land three-sixty degrees
I circulate and remain to rotate
Seven days a week at a quake or a slow rate
Be prepared whenever I come
Competition is none
...
It's no competition
...
Creator, the alphabets let's communicate
When I translate the situation's straight
No dictionary's necessary to use
Big words do nothing but confuse and lose
From the first step, a concept was kept
To the end of the rhyme, it get more in-depth
All thoughts I come across, my mind's the source
Made by the R, of course
Seven holes in my face as I'm lookin' out my window
Speak with the beat and it seem like the wind blows
Through the speakers, I hear it so pump this
And we can fill up the whole circumfrence
With competition, on an impossible mission
Comin' up with nothin', keep fishin
No runner up, just lost or forfeits
They all get butterflies, soon as the dog gets
Unlocked, lines for blocks and blocks
Might be triflin, to call the cops
Bring along paramedics
But that won't help you, not even calisthetics
I'm God, G is the seventh letter made
Rainin on rappers, there's no parade
So if you ain't wise, then don't even come
Competition for this inter mixin is none

It's, no competition

21,No Omega,1990,Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em (1990),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"No Omega
I'm the Alpha, with no Omega
Beginning without the, end so play the
Eye inside, no extended version
Next episode be smooth as a Persian
Rhyme everlastin, there'll be no part two
Knowledge is infinite, once I start to draw
A better picture for your third eye, if you're blind
You know with a mic, I'm a black Michaelangelo
I'm the brother who ID ideas are colorful
Givin' 'em insight, but givin' 'em trouble to
Comprehend 'cause they thoughts won't blend in
They're pretendin, while I'm extendin
You bite like a parasite, said that it you attacks
But you won't strike, cause you ain't no match
You need more light cause yours got dim
Then you get sparked by the Lord Rakim
What's the matter G, check your battery
Go get charged up, then come battle me
You try hard and Die Hard, you ain't Eveready
When they check the pulse, you'll be Dead as Freddie
SHOP AT SEARS for new ideas
Check your engine and ask your engineers
To equalize, try to disguise it
If that don't work yo, then MIDASIZE it
You need more power, better bring Battlecat
But this ain't Grayskull, and you ain't rippin jack
Don't drop the mic and jet for your tooley
(""Bring it to me!"")
We can go rhyme for rhyme till the mic stop the
Workin
Then I'ma leave you behind the Iron Curtain
And you'll remain backstage
Your book is over, I ripped your last page
Changed the endin, at least you went out rappin'
Now I'ma tell 'em what happened
I filled the mic with explosives, and lit it up
It was too heavy to hold, he couldn't pick it up
Pass the mic, let him try to get paid
He hit the stage, it went off like a hand grenade
Now scrape him off the floor and off my list
I ain't a soloist, I'm an arsonist
Sprayed up, he said he was gonna do what?
Played up, MC Grand but Pooh-Butt
Stole his lady, and drove her crazy
You asked me why - cause her man tried to play me
I sent her back a nervous wreck
And tried to put her back in check
My speciality is masterin the female species
I specialize in her, until she sees
Where I come from, and why I came
I tame the train till she manifest my name
Fill her with life until she burst with energy
Then leave her restless, cause a lot of women be
Tryin' to drain us, and leave us stripped dry
Put holes in our pocket, but you ain't that fly
I clipped your wings and bring you down to Earth
And tell you what life is worth
It ain't rings and things that's materialistic
You wanna pip on, imperialist with
Food for thought, 'cause I'm the shelter
I'll be your clothes, keep you warm and help ya
Not to be hot to trot by a haunt
And why do y'all got to flaunt?
(""You gotta use what you got
To get what you want"")
Cool, I heat you up like a black mink coat
Hug your neck like a fat gold rope
Words I speak and my DJ's cuts will warm ya ears
Like mink earmuffs
So Eric show 'em how fast your hand'sll go
So the people in the stands'll know
That you don't scratch your cuts in the grave
Moves in waves to my rhyme displays
Float, evoke, my tempo jets
Expressions express when you kick steps
Keep em, energetic, so let it
Pound in your head till what I said is embedded
Don't forget it's copastetic, set it
Anywhere you want your poetry's pathetic
You gets... no... credit... till you get it straight
Let's motivate
No intermissions cause it ain't commercial
If you wanna break then I'll reimburse you
I won't let go so my mic won't drop, cause

'Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I... start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking, ""How could I get some dead presidents?""
I need money; I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
(Coldcut scratches interlude 2x)
I used to roll up... roll up... roll up
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nutin' move but the money
But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great; so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistling this
Feeling out of place 'cause, man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish
'Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid

It's gonna blow 'cause I took out the pin
Detach the detonator, data send
Programmed wit protons, eqipped wit predicates
Electrons and elements just fit
Your pronoun hits the ground and that's that
Hit the floor like a meteor so get back
Commas, punctuation marks separate, it sparks
Follow the course in to avoid getting sharked
More volts than a lightning bolt: handle with care!
I'm far from fragile, warfare won't tear
I'm armed and dangerous, trained for combat
Let off rounds and they won't just bomb back
Explosions I made to invade your parade-
Your weak beats' decay till they can't get played!
Wrong elements in the mic, they get sprayed
Pass the hand grenade
After the stage gets warm, I heat it up
The crowd gets charged, I speed it up
They couldn't get warm, gimme a cut
The rhyme gets good, so eat it up
Food for thought until your thoughts is sore,
Fill up a colosseum, I can serve them all
Bake another plate, and cook it far from raw
And if your overweight, then here's some more...
'Cause every dish I make tastes great and
Plus filling, If I sold a third of my rhymes, I make a killing,
Get the salt and pepper from the maid
Get the blood off the blade, pass the hand grenade
If you try this, your response is tonsilitis,
I'm leaving authors and writers with arthritis;
You got the slightest ideas, I got the brightest
Here's the lightest, so clear, it's out of sight, it's
Darkness, from the darkness, came the light
The night is the time for Ra to recite it.
Educated, but complicated style
For all the biters, I'm shutting rappers up like Midas

(Rakim) Put your hands together... clap your hands
Verse One: Rakim
This is for thousands of people who came
A show from road to road you're entertained
I don't even have to say my name
'Cause when the place is ripped in half, I'm to blame
Masses of posses packed up schemin
Ladies lovely and keep on screamin
Go Rakim, go Rakim, go
It won't be long then it's on with the show
I'm late, so hit the brakes and park the Benzito
Double oh seven, incognito
Sneak in the back door, lookin' for the stage
When I get on you react in a rage
People from side to side and front to back
Won't dance, if the MC's wack
The crowd go psycho even if I don't move
Some like the groove 'cause I'm so smooth
Then somethin' happens, feet start tappin
You can't hold back when Rakim's rappin'
The man you've been waitin for, rougher than ever
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together
(Eric B) ""Clap your hands"" cut and scratched 8X
(Rakim) Clap your hands
Verse Two: Rakim
I create em, take em, shake em, then make 'em clap to this
Most of you rappers, can't even rap to this
I made it faster, you tried to master
Syncopated styles, words flowin after
Measures of metaphor definitions of more than one
Take it both ways, I'll be here when you're done
Remember as the rhyme goes on it's rougher
Soon as I stop, you had enough of
Followin footsteps, you better turn back soon
Sucker MC's suck rhymes like vacuums
The style remains the same, the words is changed
Bitten, rewritten, recited and rearranged
Sing along if your tongue is strong, it gets sore
Sing when I'm gone and it'll break your jaw
Wisdom flows so swift, I'm Asiatic
Is it a gift, or automatic
Static, I don't cling
I got a tip of my own and I don't sing
Don't understand, here's an example
And why MC's and DJ's sample
'Cause we don't have a band, it's just my voice and his hands
That's what hip-hop was, it still stands
The records we use are from mom's and pop's collection
Find a break from a dope selection
And go to the store, then buy one more
So my DJ can mix cause that's what his hands are for
Years later hip-hop got contracts
The chance to put actual facts on wax
A mind's the coach, the physical form's the team
The top's the destination, I'm the cream
And still I rise with somethin' pumpin and somethin' clever
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together
(Eric B) ""Clap your hands"" cut and scratched (7X)
(Rakim) Clap your hands... clap em, clap em
Verse Three: Rakim
Now who's the man with the masterplan?
With stacks of verbal attacks so clap your hands
Rhyme written in graffiti xeroxed on blueprints
Students influenced are now a nuisance
You couldn't fight it, you had to clap to this
You got excited, you almost snapped your wrist
The rhymes was written for the crowd's enjoyment
When I'm with this you can't toy with
The def jam juicer rough rhyme producer
Loads of lyrics get you loose, then looser
The man so smooth and world so rough
Eric is throwin' and sewin rippin restitchin the cuts
Microphone your majesty, no one's bad as me
Seems the tragedy, Rakim had to be
Thinkin' of some def view of a video
Visions are vicious, and I'll let the city know
Whoever's frontin they know, nothin' to say though
So lay low, musical forms are kickin' like Kato
Don't get near it, hard as you ever hear it
I know it's fearified, but don't fear it
And try to predict which rhyme you can kick
You're quick to pick your best, for the mic is lit
Instead of goin' with the flow like you're supposed to go
And enjoy the show and yo, put your hands together

Provoking you to flaunt, you get the idea
Got it, gone, my schedule is packed
My day is lay back 'cause I'm ahead of all that
Then I can relax 'cause I'm before my time
I hand you a manual before the rhymes
So you can catch up and keep up and move right alone
The day is kind of off but I can get it on
I'm taking it step by step and when the night is in depth
It's cool 'cause I'm relax wit pep
Relax wit pep
Relax wit pep
I inchant a riot wit a quiet storm
Is it the way I parlay or the knowledge being born
All praise due to the magnificent, most high and magnificent
From him, I was sent wit intent to invent
New ways for better displays, for better days
No more crimes, I got rhymes and it pays
I'm prepared to take mine and get mine
And I can protect mine even wit a rhyme or a nine
A silent rage but ?(I'm amplified)?
Rhymes multiply, it's hard to provoke when I
Put a mode in effect, the episode's correct
Reload and you don't know code to respect
I get swift and change a rule, adapt the master
But still remainable, rap gets faster
Reacts and projects and tracks and it get
To the max, it's in depth, it attacks but it's relax wit pep
Relax wit pep
Relax wit pep, relax wit pep
Check one, them I'm a check another one, two
The R's brand new so you can view a view
I got equisite, exhibit, explizzit
Is it a whiz kid or kid quiz it, well is it
Relax, I'll track out, lap the halpf stepper
Here come the right one baby and Dr. Pepper
So check the wreck up scale rhymes overload
Blow up and explode, abrupt and reload the code
You can't pinpoint a low cape, the rape
Or evaluate the up to date, skate
Up front, laid back, coming off on track
Girls want some of this because I'm all of that
Sweat the concept as the ?(epps)? in depth
As the track is kept, you can't intercept the step
React and projects and it tracks and it gets
To the max and in depth, it attacks but it's relax wit pep
Relax wit pep
Relax wit pep, it's relax wit pep"

I don't stress my day 'cause it's best to parlay
I guess you could say I've been away
I wake up slow when I'm hot but I destruct the plant
And fourteen hands comb New York for fans
They make waves as they wiggle in my waterbed
Pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread
A mornin massage turnin' into a real rough rubdown
So I figured I'll lay around
They keep me wet with a juice called Tahiti
It make the room steamy, so soon they couldn't see me
They know more than calisthetics as they worked up a sweat
It wasn't even ten o'clock yet
Scrub down, then I get moist, they never treat me mean
They sweetly keep me squeaky clean
I chill as they filled the jacuzzi
I said, ""I'm tight from a real long flight, could you soothe me
Support my thoughts, 'cause I got a lot of writing to do""
They said, ""Cool,"" and just enjoyed the view
It ain't hard 'cause it's miles from the sidewalk
I'm overlookin every borough in New York
The entire, Empire, State to concentrate
For every rhyme I make
So at exactly noon they played my favorite tune
And just before they all cleared the room
They said, ""We're glad you're home from tour, now we feel secure
We wish you didn't have to leave no more""
But they wanna go to war, they even tried to shoot up the door
Double oh seven is back...
Rest assured
Double oh seven is back...
Feel secure
Double oh seven is back...
I'm fillin up the page when I'm steppin on stage
Got the people in a rage with they hands in the air
Fellas sayin' HOE, everybody yellin' GO
Fly ladies in the house all screamin ""awww yeah""
That's how they react when I attack the mic
In fact it's like a stack of dynamite, powerful and bright
Girls love to squeeze me real tight
Double oh seven is back...
Ra has returned, to romance em, better than Johnny Handsome
When I was young, women said, ""Damn son""
Ain't nothin' change but the year and I'm still here
C'mere dear and let me whisper in your ear
Hug my words so I can taste your lips
I set up hips like domino chips
But I don't let 'em hit the floor
And if you got sore, then feel secure
Where's the pain, is it the spot you set us in
Almost magic, better than medicine
Take one of these and put your mind at ease
I get more work than a lot of M.D.'s
If I'm hawkin New York, or out on tour
I express the raw dialect and explore
But don't get fooled by metaphor
Double oh seven is back
Rest assured
Feel secure
Rest assured
Rest assured
Yo, feel secure"
27,Run for Cover,1990,Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em (1990),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Gunshots and explosions]
(Scratching: Run DMC sample: ""Run"")
Run for cover.
Here I go again, ready to flow again.
Better HOPE my mic don't blow again.
Warned by alarms when the mic gets warm.
Crowd'll get critical, can't keep calm.
Jet for the exit, why hang around?
Words that I found make the mic melt down.
If you stay, better cooperate, 'cause I amputate,
And whoever don't break, I'm-a suffocate.
Leave 'em with asthma, you better pass the
Mic to the massacre master who has the
Power to build and destoy at the same time,
So track the wack at the right, and exact could
Shine. (?)
Meant to beat overheat, but I won't stop,
So evacuate the spot when the mic's hot.
Switch it from one hand to another,
And that's a hint, my brother, run for cover.
'Cause I'm armed, my brain contains a bomb,
As if I escaped from Vietnam.
Some people label me lethal, lyrics I made then put
Beats to.
Format, collapse your lungs twist your tongues,
You can't bump your gums off of none of the drums.
Words that I made'll create an iller scene,
Eric B. is the fly human being on the guillotine.
Hook 'em up to a respirator, 'cause it's the Mista
Suffocator.
What I write is like shovin' a mic down your
Windpipe.
Don't let him bitE rhymes Rakim write.
No mic-to-mouth resuscitation is necessary;
No obituary, and NOTHING LEFT TO BURY.
As it strikes on the same mic twice and then,
Cut it on, and I'm-a strike again.
I meditate off the breaks, till the place shakes,
Then I make rain, hail, snow and earthquakes.
Speak the truth, tear the roof off the mother.
The stage is stompin' grounds -- run for cover.
(Scratching)
Evacuate the building, danger, 'cause I came to
Explain the
Strategy that'll be tragic automatically,
Havin' me to cause another catastrophe.
All you gotta do is give Rakim the
Microphone and the crowd'll yell ""Timber.""
Buildings collapsin', rappers gettin' trapped in,
Areas closed off, no one gets back in.
So set up roadblocks, barrIcade the doors,
Fade, put a detour sign on the stage.
Hold my microphone as evidence, the weapon I use
And been usin' ever since
The days in the park when, rap was an art then.
Plus I was dominant, determined and dark-skinned.
Makin' it hard to walk the streets at night
For those who talk the weak beats on the mic.
Whoever's livin' large better wear camouflage.
Prepare to be bumrushed when I yell charge.
Surround by sound of the beat-down another brother,
This is stompin' grounds, run for cover.
Wheels or foot, better not stay put.
Whole place shook till the mic's unhooked.
Then you've got seven minutes to vacate the
Premises.
Lyrics'll echo soon as the break finishes.
Don't act wild, single file to the door.
No need for an encore, just clear the floor.
'Cause my mic's about to self destruct,
The stage'll blow up when my rhymes erupt.
So make sure the place is cleared out and abandoned,
'Cause minutes from now it won't be standin'.
Then send out and A.P.B.: All Poets Beware of a
Brother like me.
Now how many rhymes could your man manufacture?
How many bitin' MCs can I capture?
Trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth;
Take over their route, play 'em out like a Cub
Scout.
So leave troopin' for MCs at war,
And if it's a battle let the crowd keep score.
'Cause me and the drummer make drama, and that's word
To mother... run for cover.

28,Set 'em Straight,1990,Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em (1990),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"(Rakim)
I came to set 'em straight, and let 'em know
Whoever's holdin' the best, just let him go
Cause here's the inside scoop on the fiend
They wanna know why I'm seldom seen
Cause who needs the TV screens and magazines
Or shootin through the city in fly limousines
There's one thing I don't like, it's the spotlight
... 'Cause I already got light
They be like, ""Yo we had a get together last week
And we know everyone was there except the Black Sheik""
Because my schedule is tight, I gotta write
I'm deep in the archives, and keepin' 'em hyped
It's been a long time, since you heard a strong rhyme
None of these are weak so when you bite on mine
We can trace the hits and then name that style
MC'sll be out of a job for a while
I reposess your indentification
So hand in your application
Put your mic on strike until you're unemployed
Contract is up and I'm stampin it void
Your selection ain't that selective
So I'ma put you in your proper perspective
On the dancefloor, and doin' the SHAKE
Ready to let 'em brake, set 'em straight
(Rakim)
Somebody said I set 'em up and pulled the plug on em
But instead I let 'em go on so I could bug on em
Go 'head and flow, 'cause I close the show
Swing a song for the ladies and rhyme real slow
For instance... once I commence...
... The crowd is convinced
So now you know who to put your money on
Hurry up, before your money's gone
'Cause I'm the most common denominator
Orchestrate a rhyme much greater
I'm like a world almanac, so tell the media
Givin' 'em information like encyclopedia
So bring a dictionary, so you can look it up
So you know what I mean, when I hook it up
No misconceptions although I complicate
But this concept'll set 'em straight
They even said that I was locked in jail
So now I guess I'm out on bail?
The only Island I was on was the Strong one
And if I did my bid, it'll be a long one
'Cause if I sold weight, I'd be upstate
In the penile, waitin for a brake
Cause sellin drugs is for handicaps
I got too many skills besides bustin' rough raps
If I go to jail, it won't be for sellin ki's
It'll be for muderin MC's
The beat'll take over your heart, then I start
To cut 'em in half, cause rhymes are razor sharp
Secure the exits, all MC's remain
'Cause we got a crowd to entertain
And I know, when I go, I'll flow dangerous
Brain'sll bust, what you tryin' to explain to us?
You got lost, and couldn't go on
Came up short, so here's one to grow on
Elevate off a high IQ
In time, you'll find I'm true
Cause once I start on a piece of art
From sun to moon and light to dark I build the Ark
Now you can float off the rhymes I wrote
I'm sure that we'll hit shore without a boat
You could bring a battleship and still get shipwrecked
Attacked with a torpedo, what did you expect?
Driftin up the creek, without a beat or a paddle
Castaway on a raft and stand fragile
Rescue your crowd, which ain't a hard job
Me and my knowledge put together, I'm a lifeguard
Dealin' with actual facts it sold out fat
Here and now, but I go so far back
To bring you up to date, so we can elevate
It's no time to wait, or anticipate
'Cause I'm never late, I'm gonna motivate
So I can let 'em brake, and set 'em straight"
29,Step Back,1990,Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em (1990),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"See if you can step to this
* Eric B. cuts up the phrase ""Back to the lab"" *
Now try to do this step (""Back to the lab"")
And make sure the pace is kept
And this ain't as smooth as I'ma get
Nice and easy but hard to catch on to
Move with melodies, rhymes to respond to
The mic's in front of me, so you know it's gonna be
Rough and rugged, plus I'm smooth as I wanna be
I'm somethin' like sippin on Dom Perignon
So absorb the song, till the rhyme's all gone
My beats and speech original, you can't find these
Eighty-nine is mine, so is the nineties
Tellin' you what you need to know and more
You're unsure? On tour, I explore
From street to street, to speak, from beat after beat
My cypher's complete, when I build with people I meet
So here's the info straight from the source in fact
Paid the cost to be the boss, STEP BACK
Give me room to exercise the mind
Three-hundred and sixty degrees'll be fine
The weight of the world is what we hold
That's a six, followed by twenty-one zeroes
Six ?? sums is a lot of weight
My truth is the strength and my thought won't break
What it take, concentration, to rebuild our
Nation but we got to have mind power
And we can make it work, because I know we can
And if somethin' go wrong, make another plan
It's up to us, so strive and be wise and
When we reach the top, don't stop risin'
And I'll keep comin' up with more of
The most requested songs that you all love
Reach out and touch the mic, take control
Still gettin' +Paid+ and I still got +Soul+
And the only thing I ever wanted you to follow was poetry
Mind takes X-rays, so listen closely
From the darkness came the light, clear out of a dark night
Now I'm here to spark the mic
Send out truth, for other groups and substitutes
With run-on rhymes and weak dubs and loops
They'd rather hear the arsonist, they insist
No need to reminisce, see if you can step to this
* Eric B. cuts up the phrase ""Back to the lab"" *
Step back
* Eric B. cuts up the phrase ""Back to the lab"" *
* Eric B. cuts up the phrase
""Back to the lab, without a mic to grab"" *
So just step
* Eric B. cuts up the phrase ""Back to the lab"" *
* Eric B. cuts up the phrase
""Back to the lab, without a mic.."" *
Just step, the rhymes create energy
Charged up, by the cut, and it's sendin me
For a trip through the mind so I can locate
A laid back rap at a slow rate
It ain't hard at all, 'cause I invented it
As the days go on, you hear them with it
Brother bustin' braincells, thinkin' of a rap
With the same old style, we had enough of that
We all need somethin' to step to
And don't forget to, 'cause I won't let you
Dance without hopin that this come on next
And if it go off, the DJ can't flex
Cause here's the tempo, I'ma regulate the pace
Here's the step, go find some space
And what we gonna do is in unison, KICK
Shake your head, you're influenced with music
By now you're intoxicated, 'cause I prove I made it
The pep your step so soon you get rejuvenated
From side to side, you pause and clap
But if you came to rap... (step back)
* Eric B. cuts up the phrase
""Back to the lab, without a mic to grab"" *
* Eric B. cuts up the phrase

30,Teach the Children,1992,Don't Sweat the Technique (1992),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"No more time to pass time 'cause these are the last rhymes,
'Cause we're living in the last times...
They wanna go to war, more wars to come
But most of us fight more wars than one
Discrimination in the racial nation
While they destroy our strong foundation
Nature's balance is way off balance
They tip the scale, now it's no more silence
The hole in the ozone layer is outta control
But they wanna fight for more oil and gold
Unemployment, I got laid off
The streets is the last resorts to get paid off
For more, more mint, no doe for rent
I gotta shed blood to make a red cent
Maybe I should ask the president
Somebody give me the president
But he don't want to hear it, it's out of the question
'Cause in my section it's worse than recession
So I go to a rich neighborhood and play Robin Hood
Take from the bad and give to the good
First I go to Bensonhurst, steal a Benz, snatch a purse
Pick up my friends, that's when it gets worse
'Cause I need government and they need government
Alot of mint spent, now I gotta pay rent
Who makes the most dead presidents in the projects
You're gonna get robbed and wrecked
I parked up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot
Let's get him for all he got
I approached him slow like I was a basehead
Put the fo-fifth to his face and said
You see those kids over there wit the hoods
Walk to them real slow and give them the goods
First the gun and the doe and crush the jumbos
One false move and no one knows
'Cause I got a silencer to hush the bust
And I'm in a rush, so hush the fuss
Plus the poison you fed will no longer spread
You good as dead, I'm a fill your head wit lead
That's when I pushed him into his building
To murder him ...but I remember the children...
We gotta teach the children everyday, keep a song
Show them the light, teach them right from wrong
Make some sense so they can carry on
Teach the children
We gotta teach the children so that they can sing along
Understand the words in this song
Can't be done when we're gone, so...""
Teach the children, save the nation
I see the destruction, the situation
They're corrupt, and their time's up soon
But they'll blow it up and prepare life on the moon
Sounds like Total Recall
But who gotta spaceship, you get it, we fall
So hope for the best and expect the worst
The end is near and it's U-N-I verse...
The one's that interfere wit nature
Labeled you limited and underrate ya,
His plans over rule when he separates ya
Now it's U-N-I verse, the one that hates ya
So we gotta let them know, we're hip to the script
Change the skit, or we're about to flip
'Cause we want access to happiness
Livin' the good life and much success
Equal opportunity
Self awareness and unity
Education, the kids need a sculpture
Teach them the abacus and their culture...
And that'll help stop the robbing, raping and killing
Poison neighborhoods are illing
But they import more keys from across seas
A drug disease hits the streets wit ease
So keep on building... 'cause we gotta keep building
Till the answers are filled in
And make sure you don't stop till then...
And if you do, remember the children!"
31,The Punisher,1992,Don't Sweat the Technique (1992),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Kill him again!
Try to identufy the man in front of ya
But it ain't the role, the gear, or the money, the
Swift intellectionist with pleny, ya
Bite, if it's dark I'll spark every one of ya,
I throw a mic in the crowd, it's a question,
I got the answer... it includes directions:
""Go manufacture a mask, show me after
A glass of a master that has to make musical massacre...""
Attack your wack till it's handicapped,
You'll never hold the mic again, try to hand it back,
'Cause every rapper that comes, I cut off his thumbs,
Put a record to his neck, if he swallows it hums!
Slice from ear to ear-so till can hear better,
Before he bleed to death, here, hear every letter!
And you can see quick and thick the blood can get
If you try to change the style or the subject;
As I get deep in the rhyme I'm becomin' a
Emcee murderer... before I'm done, I'm a
Prepare the chamber, the torture's comin' up,
Trip through the mind, at the end you'll find it's
The punisher...
Kill 'em again!
I hold the mic as hostage, emcees are ransome,
Rhymes'll punish 'em 'cause they don't undertsand 'em,
I heat up his brain, then explain then I hand him
A redhot microphone... that's how I planned 'em,
Rhymes call information (?), unite midnught (?),
Like a platoon putting bullet wounds in the mic,
If ya curse me, it ain't no mercy,
Give him a autopsy, killed by a verse of me,
I took a kid and cut off his eyelid,
Kill him slow so he could see what I did,
And if he don't understand what I said,
I'm pushing his eyeballs way to the back of his head
So he can see what he's getting into,
A part of the mind that he never been through,
A journey is coming 'cause ya getting sent to
A place harder to find but it's all in the mental,
I ran a brainscan to locate his game plan,
When I'm through with his brain he ain't the same, man!
Did he lose his mind or lost in his mind,
But this ain't the lost and found because ya can't find
Your foundation; coasting, your mind is
Drifting, in slow motion... frozen,
Looks like another murder at the Mardi Gras, B!
Too late to send out a search party,
Once ya out of ya head then ya can't get back,
I give 'em a map, but he still get trapped, so
Prepare the chamber, the torture's coming up,
Trip through the mind, at the end you'll find it's The Punisher...
Kill 'em again!
Dangerous rhymes (are) performed like surgery,
Cuts so deep you'll be bleeding burgundy,
My intellect wrecks and disconnects your cerebral cortex,
Your cerebellum is next!
Your conscience becomes sub-conscious,
Soon your response is nonsense...
The last words are blurred... mumbled then slurred,
Then your verbs are no longer heard,
You get your lung fried so good you're tongue-tied,
He couldn't swing or hang so he hung till he died,
Reincarnate him... and kill him again... again and again... again and again...
I leave him in the mausoleum so you can see him,
I got a dead-MC'ing museum,
When I create 'em, I cremate 'em and complicate 'em,
You can't save 'em... there's no ultamatum,
Mic's lay around full of ashes, with the victim's name in slashes,
Got a long list and I'm a get every one of ya...
Beware of The Punisher!
Then I'm a kill 'em again!
Wake 'em up... kill 'em again!"
32,The R,1988,Follow the Leader (1988),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"Whoever underestimated, still waited
Pumping the radio, finally they played it
You wondered how come the album was late
I was giving you time to get the last one straight,
The show must go on, I got something to dance to
Slow it down and romance to and give me a chance to
Keep you in tune and up to par...
Then you're doing it with the R...
Doing it wit the R...
Something new and to keep you doing what'cha doing
This is for you and your crew and for who in
The vicinity, I don't need no identity
I see hands in the air that means many be
Cooperating, I can't stop relating
Hip-hop is making more sense when I'm stating
Paragraphs of potential to prevent you
From using my instrumental, keep in mind I meant to
Illustrate another iller break immediately
Hurry up and learn the words and repeat it wit me
Then soon you're in tune and up to par
And then you're doing it wit the R...
Keep doing it, you keep doing it wit the R...
In the Summertime, pockets bulging
Somethings's happening then I'm indulging
Music is mine, Gucci seats reclined,
Gold grill, a paint job will shine...
Pull up in the park and then pop the trunk
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
A block party starts to form, people start to swarm
Loud as a ghetto blaster, word is bond
Records remind you of a madness
The moment it's played, you get gladdest
The return of the brother, keeping you up to par
And you're doing it wit the R...
Shout outs..."
33,To the Listeners,1988,Follow the Leader (1988),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"It's to the listeners (whispered 4X)
*Musical interlude*
It's to the listener
(Repeat interlude and line 4X)
Verse One: Rakim
It's to the listeners, for those that have a ear for this
State of the art, engineered for the mix
Eardrums are playing along to what I'm sayin' you're singin' a song
Stevie Blass on the keyboard, swingin' along
But you don't have to dance, play it cool and listen
My DJ's mixin, and I'll do the quizzin
Cause who is number one if not best then better
Here's a hint: the 18th letter
The rhymes is sportable, microphone is portable
For any immortal man, swords is not affordable
Never take a loss 'cause I'm hard to beat
I ain't cheap but don't sell me a dream I don't sleep
I'm Paid in Full, so save the bull
This ain't a stick-up, you don't have to wave until
You feel Sure, and you want more then wipe your sweat
'Cause I just wanted to see how hype you could get
'Cause when I came in the door steppin hard enough to shake the floor
I just started but the others can't make no more
Runnin' out of beats breaks and out of time
If I was gone, you'd be runnin' out of rhymes
I improve, record don't have to be long
If it's understood and the story is strong
You can speak out and hold the crowd as prisoners
The people is peepless, it's to the listeners
Verse Two:
I'm the Lord, for somethin' you can absorb
Try and control and be cautious but the cut's in a cord
Make me deeper than down, I make the crowd, crowd around
People are peepless, cause the soloist found
Phrases, thoughts, made by the R of course
One thing I do is keep 'em different, and far from yours
You keep talkin', when will all the damage be done?
You say you're rulin but when I'm in the place you don't come
Maybe you're waitin, to see what I'm makin'
One more style gets taken, then I'ma be breakin
If the patterns are causes, piano is soft
But make it hard for you to start, where I left off
You find yourself, till the point is across
You hit reverse to rewind it, that's when you hit the pause
I set the scene, first you hear mixin
Then the microphone fiend's in effect, still listenin?
Pay close attention, never before mentioned
Listen up I got a brand new invention
Made from a musician it's notes are played crisp
But listeners listen to what I wrote on a disc
Copywritten but still bitten they almost sound like
Almost pumpin, but it ain't down like
A record's supposed to sound, watch as it go around
Records are broken, smashed into the ground
That ain't My Melody, brothers keep runnin' up and tellin' me
Others are trying to flow smooth and steadily
Potholes are left in my path then I crash and bruise
Whoever refuse and cruise right past em
'Cause I just left to do it for easy whatever
Death, till I get back you better stay in step
After speaking you'll stare, if I was there your description is
Letters full of poetical medicine, this is for the listeners"
34,Untouchables,1990,Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em (1990),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"This is poetry in motion
Try to catch on, stay close to the host
And MC's try to make the road rough but I'm coastin
Ladies hear the rhymes rub 'em on like lotion
Hit spots soothin, can't stop movin
Go ahead bust a sweat and you can bet I'm still coolin
When I detain it's a brainstorm
Never the same form, every brain I rained on is warm
Takin' a trip through Memory Lane to Melody
See if you could tell if these thoughts to fell MC's
Could do you justice, but you can't touch this
Some kid just tried to bust this but he just missed
I'm universal and much more merciful
So versatile with the style it's reversible
I get away even if I say a curse or two
First, let me bust another verse for you
Your arms too short to box with Ra so quit
You don't want no kind of conflict
Or you'll get stripped as the rhyme is ripped
Pick up the pieces now ain't that peace yeah I'm hip
Everything I said flows since my intro
I plant a thought extend and then grow
Holdin' my pen tightly it might be
Controversy at first when I write the
Chords of research don't just take it for granted
When I'm gone my mind remains a planet
If I keep buildin, and teach the children
So when they read in between the lines it's filled in
I break to meditate, not a peep, concentrate
Till I'm deep awake, but not asleep
At the same time risin' and advertisin
What is true, keep advised and you can stay wise
And I'm untouchable
Comin' over the bridge take a peak at the skyline
Cause that's how I shine not only when I rhyme
My culture's makin' me stronger, mentally
Physically I'm powerful poetry now that could be
Labelled as art placed in a museum
Style'll make scenery, now you see 'em
Exhibit a knowledge that's packed and filled with
Nothin' illiterate it's facts I build with
My mind's untouchable which means intangible
Contents never dense it's understandable
I study life so I can live it the right way
No time to hear what another brother might say
Why sell a capsule of crack I don't have to
I rhyme and sign million dollar contracts to
Put message on records that's graced with hard bass
Smugglin microphones, this ain't Scarface
Whoever talked that talk, I wanna hawk
And don't try to Escape From New York
Cross a 110th Street lookin' for a problem
It's Hell Up In Harlem, watch Ra solve em
I hear the music clear as I get near
The hundred and twenty fifth street Apollo Theater
Take a step back when I rap I step up to you...
I'm untouchable
Put on my thinking cap pump the track
Test your reflex relax but in contact
You fold and lose control so hold your partner closer
You're supposed to keep your composure
But you hear the drum said go then it gets so hype
It's like nitro opponents get petro
Remember the trademark left by the R
That's never soft or smooth it's comin' off the hardest
In effect, you could die-tect the imposter
Takin' my props, Rakim is still proper
I'm a prophet, you can't stop it, when I drop it
Everything I say, coincide with the topic
Thoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured
Inside my brain it's all manufactured
As we go deeper it's hard to find
Don't even think about it, cause you can't read my mind
It's clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined
In the mind with some kind of idea for
The style I'm advertisin what is true
Keep advised that you stay wise and the mind
Is untouchable"
35,What's Going On?,1992,Don't Sweat the Technique (1992),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"What's going on?
What's happening, it's been so long, what's going on
And what's going wrong? The good old days are gone
You forgot your plot and your plans as a young man
You invented a scam even you don't understand
You rig the enigma, can't figure it out
You change the route, now you're in doubt
You use to cut class, smoked grass, still passed,
Figured you was all that but that ain't last;
The times is harder, the drugs is heavier
You say whatever, the more, the merrier;
Smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes,
Now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes;
No more good times, no more time,
Too far to find, you're almost blind,
You can't see what spot that the trap is in...
(Hey bra!) What's happening!
You had it mapped out, your plans get torn,
You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone
You said you quit, stated your word is bond
(Hey bro) what's going on?
What's going on?
My neighborhood don't look so good
I'll find a way out... yeah, I would if I could,
But the government is doing a project...
So I live in the projects;
Where we fight for elbow room to the doom,
Try to live long but you die too soon,
I might not be alive to see 25,
Taught at ten to make money and strive;
I sold tapes at school and made some ends
Met alot of skins and even made some friends,
Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run wit,
Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun wit;
But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test,
But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress!
And then shake hands like a man,
'Cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand!
But you had a one on one fight wit drugs,
When we ain't cool no more, we buss slugs,
Clip after clip, until one of us is gone...
(Hey bra!) what's going on?
Yo, what's going on?
The crime rate in New York State elevate,
A city filled wit hate, more deaths accumulate,
Drug wars daily, alot of blood spilt,
Kids on the playground shot down and kilt!
Nobody wants to live on the 1st floor no more...
'Cause stray bullets explore!
We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely,
And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be
Rubbed out in a quest for clout
The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out!
Half of the projects is dead or locked up,
Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up.
Human abortion create distortions...
And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when
Babies are addicted to drugs when they are born...!
(Hey bra!) what's going on? (3x)"
36,What's on Your Mind,1992,Don't Sweat the Technique (1992),Hip Hop,Eric B. & Rakim,"I seen her in the subway, on my way to Brooklyn
Hello, good looking, is this seat tooken
On the A-train, picking at her brain
I couldn't get her number, I couldn't get her name
I said I still like your style of fashion
But I hate your hostile, 'itty attitude wit a passion
Is it because brothers like to hawk alot
Is it because your sign don't talk alot
She turned away, no play, I said ok
You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day
Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight
I was thinking of the rhymes I wrote last night
Next stop was mine, a familar scene
I was meeting my friend, killer Ben in Ft Green
Where the girls are real, they tell ya how they feel
If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel
See I don't bend and I won't rust
And I don't break and I won't bust
Stomped up the street and did I hear a treat?
Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete
I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me
Did she live in the area, was she trying to find me?
Hm, I didn't wanna play myself out
I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guinness Stout
Now was she shy, she didn't walk by
She came in the store then she even said hi
Curiosity- at a high velocity
Maybe possibly she had the hots for me
I said if we're playing games then we're gonna play mine
I'm a lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time
If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find,
I wanna know what's on your mind
About a week went by and I called her, ""Hello""
I said yo, can I speak to, um, she said no
Hey yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't wanna stress you
Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you
See I wanna get to know you so I can show you
What a strong relationship can grow to
But you gotta trust me and you're gonna love me
Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me
Now how does it feel when my mental, massage ya temple
Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you
Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions
Next you see ectacy's explosions
Now I'm coming to see you to spend some time
I'm a romantic warrior but is it a crime
And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find...
I wanna know what's on your mind
I wanna know what's on your mind
Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely
I'm in your head so you'll be thinking of me
So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams
And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen
But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown
How do the 125th street sound
Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo
Probably be watching Bill Cosby tomorrow
Then after that get into it, I mean intimate
Every word is an instrument
Making sounds and tones and songs and moans
My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones
You smile, you said you never know what the day will bring
It's always a new song to sing
The next day I went back to the her rest
Knocked on the door, intentions: finesse
She let me in and had nothing but a neglige on
Smelling like Liz Claiborne
I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables
She sat next to me and said what's up wit you
I got the feeling for sexual healing
A mental healing ; how you feeling
She caught the effect and said she feel the same
Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain
Desire's yearning, the fire's burning
You hot 'cause it's alot you're learning
Now I'm ready to explore you inner world
It's take a long time 'cause I'm just beginning, girl...
Take it easy, cut off the TV
Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me,
Use your physical form if I'm hard to find
'Cause now I know what's on your mind...
'Cause now I know what's on your mind..."
