(Common)
One day, I was tryin' to be myself
The same day this thug say, ""You gotta come hard""
Nigga, times is hard, I'm tryin' hard to make it
It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, it's hard to stop drinkin'
I guess it's hard for you hard niggaz to start thinkin'
Pussy MC's stinkin so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's 'cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction that related to me
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggaz, be too hard to say ""ho"" at the shows
I rose... like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin' me hard is criminal
Niggaz you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the fuck up
(Dug Infinite) It's just one two many niggaz got cars and no land
(Common) One two many niggaz with cash and no plan

Just one two many niggaz (2X)
(Both) That's one two many niggaz
Just one two many niggaz
(Chuck D) ""One, two""
Forever, I ain't gon' be rappin'
Shit'll happen to me, I gotta let niggaz know
This mark asked me do I know his cousin Jimbo
Nigga, I don't even know myself
You want me to get you in
Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself
Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came
Yeah, I got a name, but only twenty dollars to it
Next album you gon' blow, up my ass, you done blew it before
Being in my video, what's that gonna do for your life?
Get you some pussy? You should be gettin' rump off GP
Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV
I be readin niggaz but readin be makin' me sleepy (Hey!)
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin'
Niggaz stuck on one and them-a ran by
Claimin they fly but they stand-by
I come truer than a dream, and youse a damn lie
With that anti-rap, complainin about this and about that
Sounding bitch like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right
I'm number one

1,7 Deadly Sins,2014,Nobody's Smiling (2014),Hip Hop,Common,"Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Gluttony, baby
Is us, it's hard to see
It's knocking
Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Man, they gon', they gon'
Man they gon' knock this
And ride out to this
It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh, y'all don't need the address
It was 'round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler's insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that he'll end up in a grave
It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting
Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from MOP
They say use them rocks to make 'em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony
When niggas fucking with you [?] commit infidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it
Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth
Want you to break 'em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off
Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat
It's gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It's a dude that's getting paid in full, cars and jewels
So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon' want your food
Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix that's in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now
Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of 'em ended up bustin' the other
Greed is a mother, it's greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we livin'
The good thing is we can be forgiven
Seven deadly sins"
2,A Bigger Picture Called Free,2016,Black America Again (2016),Hip Hop,Common,"Living in a glass bubble, the fast hustle
The masked struggle that I'm in
The same one that you in
I knew inside when I was outside on the south side
Had to take it a step further
The way that Ralph tried
Oh that's my stepfather
He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors
For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose
Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free
In the picture, it was me
Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali
A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
Telling me what I can't be
But you can't paint me
Black is the color of my true love spirit
And I do love lyrics
And I used to love Harold's Chicken
And I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood
And I get lit in the club
Still I love
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9
The toughest in Cook County
They count me out 'cause I did a crime
They say it's violent time in human beings
But being they ain't seeing me as human
In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming
Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones
I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones
My pops, y'all built and destroyed him
With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment
When will we see enjoyment?
I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes
But we ain't never spent Christmas together
Tryna get it together
What I'ma do when I get out?
I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house
I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?
Still I love
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free
Make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I
Is the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free
Make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I
Is the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free
Make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I
Is the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free
Make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I
Is the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah"
3,A Film Called (Pimp),2000,Like Water for Chocolate (2000),Hip Hop,Common,":
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean
I'm a person that's making profit. see I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method
:
Seen her on madison where vice lords be travelin
And chevy windows be rattlin
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to
:
As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a black panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried
:
Motion denied (pause)
I felt the vibe like roy ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold common's hand
I'm a take you to a pimps promise land
Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya
:
Pimps, hoes, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, oh my god
Pimps, hoes, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, oh my god

With them shits on your wrist looking goofy
:
(Yeah ok)
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream
:

Ought to have you ho for me (get real now)
Pimp yo punk ass
Have you write me poetry
I'm from a land called cash
You too slow for me
:
You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than bagets
Birds in slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws
:
What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
(Try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball
I know pimpin' ain't easy but damn you barely surviving
We can't ride together cause you ain't driving
(Oh it's like that)
:
Pimps, hoes, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, oh my god
Pimps, hoes, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, oh my god
:
(This, this, this really how I look at it check it)
You and I together is like ashford and simpson
Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention
:
Think I'm gone risk my ass then give you the cash (yep)
That shit is the past
I got my own stable (where at)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a hoe that's abstract
:
Girl you getting beside yourself

Help you see inside yourself

Have you covering your body and have you eating right

Pimp rhythms, pimp flows
Pimp men (and pimp what)
Pimp systems
Got stores called big pimpin' (where)
Down south
In Texas I ran the best hoe house
:
(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin' 'choushi wa dou' (yeah right)
Bring 'em back to the states to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer
:
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Why you laughin'?)
I'm laughin' 'cause you funny
I'm make bitch niggas like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly
You'll get all the right tolls in that dashiki
:
Yo, what ever happened to loyalty?
Don't you want to become royalty
On the streets selling ass and oils for me?
But you on this hoe's ass and really I can't reach you
Fuck you then I'm about to be a preacher
Well there you have it y'all
The story of pimps and hoes y'all know how it goes
It's been the oldest profession
The whole thing is like a lesson
Ain't no second guessin'
Pimps y'all, hustlers
All that good shit
Yeah, yeah 2000 and forever
It'll be here
Uh, uh aight cool"

6,A Song for Assata,2000,Like Water for Chocolate (2000),Hip Hop,Common,"In the Spirit of God
In the Spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed
And all those in the struggle
Yeah. yo, check it
There were lights and sirens, gunshots firin'
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, tryna hold on
To life. She thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger, survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was buildin' as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they woulda served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes
Listen to my Love, Assata, yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul
It seemed like the middle of the night when Law awakened her
Walkie-talkies cracklin, not sayin' where they takin' her
Though she kinda knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about six inna morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in a cell
One cot, no window, facing hell
Put in the basement of a prison wit all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, paint, and begin to read
Two years inna hole. Her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they wouldn't feed her, hopin' she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she'd bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
'Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All of this shit so we could be free
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All of this just so we could be free, so dig it, people
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah
Listen to my love, Assata, yeah
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul, ooh
Yo
From North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldnta done
Medical evidence shown she couldnt'na shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah
Listen to my love, Assata, yeah
We're molded from the same mud, Assata
We share the same blood, Assata, yeah
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul, ooh"

While her-on rock smells make the cops tail
My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought
With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin thoughts
To my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to Walk Like an Egyptian, but Hieroglyphics fail to talk
I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago
E Bottom, here's the bottle
I think I, need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel

I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat
Some people got ignorance confused with bein street
On the, street of desire my body and soul meet
Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggaz in my box throwin' suggestions
Had me checkin' myself and double checkin', I popped the +Resurrection+
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents

Slow down son, you're killin' 'em, well funded it was not
Came to shitty deals, reminiscing give me chills
When Puff was with Biggie, Versace on every niggie
The backpacker copped the Porsche and drove to his city
Now all the little bitties from ugly to pretty
I was the magician mesmerize 'em, made 'em listen
My dick is like a Blow Pop baby
And it gets stiffer than some Botox baby
But show out baby and show me you ain't gon' act right

If you ever let me leave out a club with a big fat-ass, stove-like bitch like that without pointin' out the facts, I'mma kick your motherfuckin' ass
Man, that nerve of the ho not to give me no pussy
Come up in my house trying to watch movies and shit, this ain't no motherfuckin' cinema, bitch
Who the fuck she thought I
Say, brother, I wasted a evening, I shoulda went with you
But, oh, well, you know I gets my pussy anyway
You know that's how players do
But God-damnit, Rashid, that big-ass bitch, haha
If you'd have said to spread on that ho, man, I could kick my own ass
Well, should go to work, just another wasted night
And oh, oh
Hey, hey, what can you say?"
10,Aquarius,2002,Electric Circus (2002),Hip Hop,Common,"(Feat. Bilal)
(Common)
Yeah!
Yeah!
(Common)
Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speak
Some keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em, I'm dope the streets need me to hit em
With some of that (revolutionary rap)
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet
I'm getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifthteens of the your jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building I'm the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of aquaruis...
(Singing)
The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes (du-du ba ba ba)
Aquarius! (echoes)
(Common)
Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of feinds, I flow over water that's as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the chruch psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
We in the age of aquarius...
Aquarius! x2"
11,Be (Intro),2005,Be (2005),Hip Hop,Common,"I want to be as free as the spirits of those who left
I'm talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yussef
Through death through conception
New breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in her direction
In the right way
Told inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say
Chicago nights stay, stay on the mind
But I write many lives and lay on these lines
Wave the signs of the times
Many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wonderin' where I'm
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise
I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize that I'ma learn through her
The Messiah, might even return through her
If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends, pops they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
When drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors, we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back or too far in front of me
The present is a gift
And I just wanna be"
12,"Between Me, You & Liberation",2002,Electric Circus (2002),Hip Hop,Common,"She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We laid under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel her tears spill from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Tellin' it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love-makin'
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only knew men through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom
Between me and you (echo)
Sometimes I wish a careless whisper
Still could be heard without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me
She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't conceive her not being here
Death in her face, her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness would only visit once in a while
To watch an adult becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave, does the mind go?
Watchin' Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors there's no cure
We went through doubt and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the (?) was (?)
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death
Between me and you (echo)
Sometimes I wish a careless whisper
Still could be heard without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me
He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was in steel
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
To the spirit, yelled, ""help me""
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now there was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him
If I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself
Between me and you
Sometimes I wish a careless whisper
Still could be heard without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me
Liberation...
Peace"
13,Black America Again,2016,Black America Again (2016),Hip Hop,Common,"Here we go, here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mother's stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop (war)
And the battle with us
I know that Black lives matter and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangsters is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods
I don't believe the news or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again
You know...
One way of solving a lot of problems that we've got
Is lettin' a person feel that they're important
And a man can't get himself together
Until he knows who he is and be proud of what and who he is,
And where he come from, and where he come from
Hot damn, black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made, I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger, we got anointed singers
Like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinking or battle raps or is it Godspeed that we travel at?
Endangered in our own habitat
The guns and dope man y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact, we them lab rats
You build the projects for, now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison y'all, they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two
And then, maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self evident
All men and women are created equal, including black Americans
You know, you know, you know.
One way of solving a lot of problems that we've got
Is to let a person feel like somebody
And a man can't get himself together
Until he knows who he is
And be proud of what and who he is
And where he come from, and where he come from
We are rewriting the black American story

The B-Boys, Immenslope, Twilite Tone, Derrick and then some
I don't get rid of some faces
While marks be lookin' hard, and they be beggin bases
They have too many cases, and now they got courage
Sorta like Goldilocks, tryin' to take Pop's porridge
But I got, the story straight
Plus the name, I got rep, don't dare sleep
Slept and got, crept
An AC/DC spider went up the wall we mount
Now came down the Common the Common Sense, and now the spider out
(BOOM) A blackout, power failure
I ain't the Burger King, but I got a whale of blows
Uppercuts jabs hits and hey niggaz
'Cause I'm weird they call me Lemonhead, but I'm a Jawbreaker
And I break a Bean, but I'm not from Boston
I'm stronger, and faster, than Steve Austin
Common'll keep the camera movin -- I'm kinda fast!
I'm from a town called FRESH OFF A NIGGAZ ASS
And I'm about to go on like Stephanie Mills
YOU MUST be poppin' pills, tryin' to step to me

And in front of me (BAW!) is a dead man G!
We hit 'em hard!

So I picked him, he's another victim of a circumstance
He did a dance like Ali (SAY WHAT?)
But he floated like a waterfly and stung like a C
Ya see, I ain't out here, tryin' to be a bully
Nor am I pretendin to be a two-shoes goodie
(WORD IS BOND) that I got big balls homes
And if a player try to press me, I gotta break the zone

You better watch out, I'm tellin' you why
Common Sense is breaking, marks down, ah-follow-me-now
Yo Common Sense is breaking, marks down
Uh, check it, check it, check it

Fuck with me (""you end up the in the cas-ket"")
You flow ass pussy nigga, sucker duck bastard

This Grape tried to step to me, with his arms down
Lesson number one - when you're ready to throw
Never step up talkin' - that's like tryin' to pitch, but you're balkin
And I'ma steal first, hide the base, but you base
You can call me Pencil Petey cause the marks I ERASE
In case of emergency, it's urgent see, that you see a doctor
You tried to Gamble, but I'm the Proctor

It's rare to see, an enemy within play
True indeed a lot of shit, is over he say she say

16,Blue Sky,2011,The Dreamer/The Believer (2011),Hip Hop,Common,"Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us (x4)
(Listen) Why you had to hide away for (x4)
Aston Martin King, Luther with Dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
I'm like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eye line
Son of the most, so from up high I shine
Suited in prada, stay mellow like LaLa
Young fresh with dollas (dollars), ladies go gaga
I'm the cum lauda, top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask, pure religion and cash
From the windows that open, I'm raisin' my glass
Daylight beams, night light schemes
This is my inception, I'm writin' my dreams
Immortal view of a star doin' what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, say the Lord's comin' through
Oh-ooh-oh, in the sky we'll find the light
Oh-ooh-oh, ain't too high we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, last night
It all started with a dream
I wanted to be Run DMC
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M, dreams were spoken to him
That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint, like D. Wade or
D. Rose from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world premo's
Red carpet imagine taking pictures with the President
Told him for health care, my music is the medicine
My name holds weight, I am never hesitant
Different state resident, this is hood elegance
SLS classic pursuing my passion
Known for fashion now I'm Oscar Party crashin'
Immortal view of a star doin' what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, say the Lord's comin' through
Silhouettes of dreams that we had huh
Even now it don't seem so bad ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
I'm gon' now, imagine what I'm gonna be
30 to worthy, now I'm all worldly
My broad up in Paris, looking all purty
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, say the Lord's coming through
I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldn't take that long to get me there
Keep running till I can't go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how I'm the one
Could've been anywhere, but I'm sitting in the air
With the wolves up staring at the sun
Oh, in the sky we'll find the light
Oh, ain't too high we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies And we going higher, last night"

From beginning to end
Here's a little story that must be told
From beginning to end}
I got so much trouble on my mind so I take time out my day
To pray and I say, now lay me down to sleep, hopin' that I keep my soul
Peep, I'm gettin' old and this a cold, cold world and I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my mama, it's the same routine
Keep my room clean, I'm lookin' to do some new things
But ain't shit to do, I'm twenty-two, catch
In the prime of my life, I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel, disgruntled, tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness, I too sing I may not be the darkest, brother
But I was always told to act my age, not my color
Not knowin' that my color, was out of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes, ""Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight""
It's like, how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain?
When it rains, it pours and it's about to come down hard
Thank God I found you
Here's a little story that must be told
(My life, my life, my life, my life)
Here's a little story that must be told
(My life, my life) from beginning to end
As I walk down the road of existence, I get resistance from all angles
I tangle for cash, hopin' it'll last till the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
So I return to the a-rab, then on the way back
I stop- at the liquor store, grab me a six pack
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back to get some more
Once I get started I don't wanna stop, ah
And I can't turn around, brew, I can't turn it down
Ironically I turn it up, my liver I burn it up
It's my life I live it up, the cup I gotta give it up
One day, I'm cruisin' down a one-way street
And I done passed fun day, three blocks ago
It itself, life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin' (How come?)
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself, bein' nobody's Calvin I'm a couch bum
What makes it bad, I had incentive
But that disintegrated to a state that stagnated, I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated, or blowed
I'm dealin' with a full deck, at any day I can fold
What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan but things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to, thank God I found you
Here's a little story that must be told
(My life, my life, my life, my life)
Here's a little story that must be told
(My life, my life) from beginning to end
Here's a li-little, sto-story that must be told
(My life, my life, my life, my life)
Here's a li-little, sto-story that must be told
(My life, my life, my life, my life)
It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
I ponder and try to keep my concentration in this idiotic nation
They say become a doctor, but I don't have the patience
Adjacent to that situation, I want an occupation that I'm into
'Cause yet have I begin to live to my potential, I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience
I reminisce and wish I could go back in time to '89 when there was just sunshine
But now it's like, I'm gettin' older there's so much strain and stress
I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest in peace
Of mind, and find who I am but thank God I found you
Here's a little story that must be told
(My life, my life, my life, my life)
Here's a little story that must be told
(My life, my life) from beginning to end (My life, my life)
Here's a little story that must be told
(My life, my life, my life) Here's a little, little
Sto, sto-story that must, must, must, must
Mu-must, must be told
Mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-must be told
Mu-mu, mu, must, must be told
Must, must, must be told
Must, must, must be told
Trouble, down, the drain
Trouble, trouble, down, the drain

See her again at All Star weekend
She didn't have tickets
And she ain't into hoopers
She was there to kick it
With her roommate
Who was a video vixen
Spend so much on outfits
She's about to get evicted
Said ""I'm married to this rap shit,
Looking for a mistress""
You can be by my side
Like flavor and deelicious
Long as you ain't scared of the kitchen and the dishes
She said ""you one of them fishes, I know your mind switches"", and...

Time revolve
We fell in love as crazy as Nas and them
Broads were textin
'Cause I stop calling them
I met the parents
Watch the game with her father and
Questions of marriage
And I start dodging them
What happen to me
Happens to lots of men
Get deep in love
And then your needing some oxygen
As far as wives I was thinking like Solomon
She said ""there you go, breakin my heart again!""
Ooh... we you break my heart,

You're thinkin' that, ""Oops, I made a mistake""
You say, ""Fuck Nell Carter, c'mon Jimmy, give me a break""
You made a mistake on the first take
Tryin' to break a leg for take two
You shoulda ate your Wheaties
And Petey mighta made a breakthrough
You say to hope that things might bloom, so you assume position
Wishin he would listen, so you start to kissin'
It's alive, and up goes, and up goes you're adrenaline
You aimed, you fired, THERE YOU GO, limp figures
So you take ? and then play the role of friend and talk
Try to tell her it's her fault, when Jack your Been wouldn't Stalk
Baby Bubba youse a goner, ah, youse a goner
It's fucker up, when Your Dick Is Playin' Tricks On Ya

Walkin' up and then down the strip
Lookin' for some hip so I can skip
I spotted this honeydip, and her friend tried to sell me a script
That they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the OLD Gus
So I'm gettin' a bus, as I thrill at the disgust
Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business
Dippin from a distance, in an instance I got the digits
And blew a kiss to her
(THAT OLD STANK HOEEEE) was mad I didn't speak to her
I hooked up with the one that looked NICE
Took her mind, like an ICE
Till her friends gave her advice to think, twice
Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill
They told her to keep that booty still
I been through more hoes than the pill
Still I overcame 'cause I got game like a athlete (UHH)
In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty (BREAK)
The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was gettin' knocked
I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell
Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail
Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat
Like a belt, everything was strapped
Till my homey asked, ""WASSUP WIT DAT?""
The dat was like dis G, I told him I got busy
This was the spy who dissed me 'cause he told it like a sissy
THAT WAS FOUL, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end
The little wreck on that they locked the door and I can't get in
No more no more no more and now I know and now I know
Don't mess around with CB's, good buddie, ten-fo'

Not really on the good foot
Cause the white man kept steppin on the black man's toes (damn!)
And in his shoes there were holes
But the white man didn't care;
Shit, he didn't have to wear it (uh uh)
The scratch that he had, he got from his parents;
With his tight ass, he woulda been poor white trash, but anyway
Everyday the black man would ask him to spare change
But at him, the white man would stare strange
So the black man got fed up
Cause wasn't nobody feedin him and feedin him
And took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him
The Chinese man got 'noid and broke out like a peon
And now the black man own the store

So many raps about rims, I'm surprised niggas ain't become tires
On the street you turn code and then go screech
I tell 'em, ""Fuck 'em!"" like I do the police
The beast in runnin' rampant
I'm in between sheets tryna have sex that's tantric
But the ghetto, tryna make a get up stand up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich?
I slap a nigga like you
And tell him Rick James bitch
Witcha Hollywood stories on porches
We prolly heard stories on who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com has never been involved in Run
Unless it's DMC or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm harder than the times, you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hip hop is goin', it's Chicagoin'
Poetry's in motion like a picture, now showin'
It's the city, the city y'all, the city, the city y'all
C'mon"
25,City To City,2014,Nobody's Smiling (2014),Hip Hop,Common,"The city it blow deep
I know them cold streets
Motif is no peace
Can't trust the police
My mama stay out East
Hope that she good though
She from Inglewood so she know the hood though
Corners we stood on
That's what I stand for
Justice for hustlers I rap and I chant for
[?] Just got off that thang on his ankle
He seeing that corner from a new angle
Same old to same old
Some days are painful
They say be careful
Grandma be stay prayerful
My [?] move words with their eyes on [?]
You in the ghetto where we never settle
The breath of the city
No rest for the weary
No stress it can't hear me
A fist full of fury
No dollars no jewellery
A Chicago story
Place that can kill me is one that can cure me
Hard to ignore me 'cause we livin' loud now
Fire inside me and things that go ""Bow Bow""
Label me wild child, my old man on trial now
Yeah I'm the future but live for the now now
Make my mama proud now
We come from that dirt
I put in that work
Until my back hurt
Uh"
26,Cloth,2011,The Dreamer/The Believer (2011),Hip Hop,Common,"We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didn't matter
Ka-clow boom pop! Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her, it might be forever
I hear people saying that they like us together
I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you, I admit I had issues
Like ebony, your essence, your pedigree, your presence
It's more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust
From the cloth
Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare
That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same, cloth you just want to wear
But that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh
La la la la, la la la la
This is tailor-made love, fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs
You were there when my 'cause passed away
Not only does love, but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you, the good word I read with you
Looking at things that we've been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Let's stay in the present, no time for second guessing
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it, that's so unexpected
Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take its course
'Cause what's inside of us, no need to outsource
The cloth
Hey lover we can cover each other
Through the coldest nights, tight never smother
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's the cloth"

We take it hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh-er
Yo, yo
My little daughter, started, nursery school
Brother Com, gotta make our move through
The stylist (?) and violence with vibrance
The sign of times with rhyme shit is timeless
The mind is a terrible thing to spill
Rap life's like a dream that seems for real
A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres
After, travellin the world to see paper's just paper
Streets take ya, back and forth like a shaker
I'm a slave to the rhythm's breakin off
I get the job done - but some days I wanna take off
D be like, ""We ain't got no time for that!""
?Uestlove said, ""We ain't got no time for that!""
My old bird like, ""We ain't got no time for that!""
So I rhyme when my back hurts
Play the numbers from my grandmother like Kraftwerk
I rock the patchwork fast I'm in to win but then begin to sin
We're in to win with Hen's and Heineken's
Beast for each and greet the meek with speech
To seek and peak cause Pete, shit gets deep

On the industry I came
With penitentiary talk, Coke and a Hennesey walk
My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk
Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga
I'm killin' 'em soft
Dealin' with golf, gettin' blowed on the course
I be dissin magazines, but then buy The Source
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down - like Bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is Beat Street in backpacks
Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack 'em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds
Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter
The way you want the game I rub off like Henner
I remain like a tattoo with natural raps
Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts
Battle raps is where it began, I'ma end it wherever I land

Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know you're sick and tired of arguing,
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we gotta swallow it.
Your heart and mind, Baby, follow it
Smile, happiness, you can model it
And when you feel opposite

With a little bit of Communism
Yeah, hah
So check it out, yeah
Chick-a chick-a I'm
Chick-a chick-a on
Chick-a chick-a my
My, own shit
Like an entrepreneur, that stepped in maneur
Man I'm newer than a Jack I went up the hill with Jill
And Jack chills big bootay
But then the booty up, I told the bitch she better have my money
Or step to the AMG
You know Com Sense, oh yeah him be
That nigga that be making all the bid-by-by-bye sounds
But since then, Common calm down!
I'm on some calm shit watch Com get complicated
Simple motherfuckers say the way that Com communicated
Was too complex, I got a complex not to complain
On my brain no complain and so will my community
And I prefer compliments
So I complement at an angle, of ninety degrees
It's the 1990s, and music got known for grease
I got a sense of direction and a compass
Come past MC's with compassion, though I heard the screams of
But I ain't shy, so why shall I comfort
Commiserate at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill
But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals
Now Com can get the panty, but I want my own company
And Com is on a mission not to work for commission
It's a common market and it's so much competition
But to me, competition is none
To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot
My compact disc is a commodity, so buy it
Instead of competing with Pete
Com compromised, Com made a promise
Not to commercialize, but compound the soul
Without the elements, compelling sense into Communism"
30,Diamonds,2014,Nobody's Smiling (2014),Hip Hop,Common,"Oh
Walk up in the thing, got my campaign poppin'
Champagne poppin', bad thang poppin'
Headed to the door, and ain't a damn thing knockin'
No
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin'
Campaign poppin', champagne poppin'
I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat, we gon' do it gourmet
I'm hearing fuckin' voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds are for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was frío
That's Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pinot noir style, better with time
I'm gambling with watches getting better with time
So I'mma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say ""time is money"", forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display
Oh
Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin'
Champagne poppin', bad thang poppin'
Headed to the door, and ain't a damn thing knockin'
No
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin'

Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin'
No
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Tryna get it every way, every day
Tryna get it every way, every day
Tryna get it every way, every day
Bars in alignment, stars in alignment
Raw off consignment, God's in the diamonds
Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas that's behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I've seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining till I die man
I'm a rare diamond that's hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K
47 to 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ain't no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me
Diamonds
Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I'm rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin' that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say ""I need that fadeaway""
Had a crush on what's her name, the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you can't take his chain away
Real player you can't take this game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you can't take my dame away, devil in a red dress
But she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day-today-today-today
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me off in court, beating all kinds of cases
Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that's my favorite compilation
Diamonds"
31,Dooinit,2000,Like Water for Chocolate (2000),Hip Hop,Common,"Ah keep on, chcka chcka chcka (Repeat 6x)
Mo'fucker move back, I pursue rap at the pace of a New Jack
Miscellaneous numbers and shoes stack grooves
Rap I deliver for the hungry and underprivileged
Something different from these hollow and grunting niggas
This is business strictly, step to my business is risky
'Specially when you as bitch as Missy
Back to back LP's that sound the same, I surround the game
With a four-pounded brainstorm
To make niggas dance in the rain, scared to take a chance in the game
Used to breakdance, it's a shame
What money do to a nigga brain
If he lose his soul what did a nigga gain?
""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it""
""C O double M O to the N"" (cut and scratched 4x)
My train of thought is that of a hustler, or a nigga with his shirt off
Trying to get his work off to customers
I rap with a chip on my shoulder, squeezing Coronas
See shirts that say ""We gotta get over""
That juggy shit is over, the war is on
I on;y want to be a soldier, I'm holding on, to a culture
Focused like Gordon Parks when it's sorta dark
For niggas that's flooded with ice, my thought's the ark
Performing warming arts with some shit for the heart
Don't fuck with radio, ignoring the charts
I could give a FUCK what you made in a year, nigga, you wack
A soft nigga on a hard track, in this new rap
Generation I ""X"" cats like a Muslim
He fell off 'cause I pushed him
Let his Bently and his weak crew be his cushion
I catch him on the streets, in front of the bodyguards and rush him
""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it""
""C O double M O to the N"" (cut and scratched 4x)
You wasn't saying you was a thug before Pac came
Ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like Kane
Then Snoop released and it became a G thang
Claim sets, your city ain't got gangs
Niggas hate you, they ain't paying you no attention
In a circle of faggots, your name is mentioned
With six degrees, I separate MC's, from a business man that's good
From a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood
From what a nigga says to what's understood
Keep my shit tight like them boys in ""The Wood""
Dick is always hard like the ""Boyz in the Hood""
Peace to Dug Inf, No I, Sean Lett, the whole Chi
At the crib some cats give me the cold eye
I'm a bitch slap the next one
Let him know the world is my section for taking
You got to reduce aggression
""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it""
""C O double M O to the N"" (cut and scratched 4x)"

Be on the treadmill, uh, like ""Okay, go""
Had a body, A body that you can't pay fo'
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those Lebeaus
Spin class at the gym, strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, tryin' hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes)
Readin Us and People Mag, tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe

One of the Diddy types, da D-D-Dame Dash dudes
Pushed a Maserati Sport, readin the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin' course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin' Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected

Unbreakable, like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese, or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it where we try too much
Losin yourself and you're lyin' and stuff
Wishin for the diamond cuffs, in search of a ring
Where love is not a mystery it's everything

And though it tastes like forever
It may not stay long
Everywhere is summer. (4x)

A shaman since before my birth
And I came down to rock the Earth
My misson condition:
I give you, you listen

In binary, no 3rd return
I'm planning intention
With all the redemption

No pop, no pop, no pop, no pop
We gon'do this thang till the sky just drop
Lock in to ya mind away we rock,
In a rocket is the 87 astronaut
Top of the soul, dove and I got in a hole
At the moment they were sayin'
""It was outta control""
Strap in to your mind
Why eyes see some recline
You'll see in time your season to shine
When the stadium is dark
MCs are defined
Get ready, on your mark, put your feet on the line
The race is on to space beyond
You gon'get there by doin' what you want
Sometimes the most famous feel all alone
So we drift to a place that we call our home
I was known as being spaced and outta my dome
Now I know, it's all I've know"

(Common) Yes, its for the people, God moves, yeah
I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe it's the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'""
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say

What, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Check it, yo
You say a one for the trouble, two for the time
Come on y'all, let's rock that, uh
(I can feel the funk) (x4)
Check it
I come to grips with mics
I come to grips that a lot of mic users is dikes
I come to grips with the likes of Fred Hampton
Cold, so I'm lampin, with no need for spotlight
When I got light like an intersection, you talk
But you came to my town with protection
Election year, had the block hot
I scream ""fuck the world"" for having a baby girl sorta cock block
I write rhymes like I come from the windy city
With my crew, I click like simply, stand midi with reality
Casually, I walk through these war games
Some claim say but then they take on whore names
If that's the way your sex drives, stay in your lane
If you're a man, I can't tell like if the door rang now
Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place
It ain't a bunch of niggaz all up in your face
The music is thumpin and you're feelin' the bass
What you wanna do girl (wanna shout)
To the brothas when you come in a jam, it ain't a bunch of niggaz
It ain't high tech and ain't got free liquor
You jackin his name and stick to make you jones get thicker
What you wanna do man?(let go)
Yo, check it
Some niggaz be on the mic, sounding like dikes
Allow me to get on and bust like Spike (uh)
Lee, I'm in the majors with no rotation
Through stations of bullshit, I see through like a pager
In the age of Aquarius, various things
Is gonna carry us in intellect and what have you
Street astrologists interpret point stars and half moons
Then end up on garages or walls in bathrooms
Every black moon, a rap tune move me
The rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played
It don't stop
It's time to get it, get it made
I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face
I know how the underground tastes
I want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace
Get down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers
Colder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin
Linkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years
Fulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now
I can feel the funk (x8)
Yo, check it, check it
I came through the corridor, with the aura
Raw Chicago mora, scope the horror
Read between the lines and know the border
Some pop wines for juice, I wait in the water
Waitin for you Big Willie niggaz to have a show at The Crib
We gon get with your glamour, long as we know where it is
Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather
The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather
I rap better than you, you, or maybe him
But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb
Spilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly
Some be so high, they believe they fly like R. Kelly
But then they fall off, dusted niggaz is gettin' sawed off
They fall soft, my mental lift is for me to haul off
I kick ass
(Scratching)
I can feel the funk (x16) (makes me wanna shout, wanna shout) (x4)

37,Forever Begins,2007,Finding Forever (2007),Hip Hop,Common,"Victory won
In a world of Henessey and guns
Too young for the marches
But I remember these drums
To start reality
Wars and battles
We fought for ours
Caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me the joint
Good music and room to breathe
Those that doubt
Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave
My lady had one
I'm more like a fool
For soul and passion
The price of gas rises
Street life is pumpin' fast
Lives is
I'm watch crash
And realize that we all survivors
No religion or race
Whatever describe us
My guys do dirt do dirt
But never really talk about it
Forever begins
Just because I thought about it
Living
Once Again
We
Living
Then you go (x4)
Ashes and snowfalls
I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come
Forever gon come
It's a cold world
And I can never go numb
Look
Fear in the eyes
Say I never gon run
Sooner or later
I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters
To better the young
On tree by jury
Together we hung
Now we let our chains hang
And gang bang to maintain
Ghanastan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down
At each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the while I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God in the mist of war
No matter how much I elevate,
I kiss the floor
It was in the ?? when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever
Through song
***
Origin
Is forever
Well, well well,
We are back in the studio again
Look at that
Hey I don' need no cue cards
They got the engineers holdin' up the cue cards
What that say
Oh they say, just talk, don't sing
Son, I bet you and I feel like you and I've been here forever
30 years old red eyes,
Beholding red eyes
I see my world's tears
Yeah, origin is forever
Every peak will have 2 values
Hopeful eyes in the comfort
Of true protection and admiration of the chime
That's forever
Forever is to strive
A place of endearment
Forever is what I leave
My I-self contribution
Damn, what I gon' leave?
Ok...
I leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand
To universal scales of humanity, all humanity
Forever is finding a solution to a solution
Tsunamis, hurricanes,
Following the trails of the African slave ships
War, war, and more war
Floods, Columbine, Global Warming, Earthquakes
Another somebody done me wrong, son
Virginia Tech, is not an, ""Oh, What the heck.""
We're still, did you place your one grain
Of spiritual sand forever?
Confusion need a solution
Blend and stir, stir and blend
The part of humanity; sift the ingredients
Of acknowledgment, apology, amendment, atone
We gonna work with the four A's here
Forever part
Common good is forever
God's memory is forever"

Instinct to hustle-divided by the struggle
Plus a couple of scuffle's and up to high shuffle
Even when it sound muffled...

With king-sized thoughts that's sparrow shaped
Before I came up I had to elevate
Let a nigga move where he wanna move up to
You don't like how I'm livin'... well fuck oh
I stuck to what I was on... a star is born on a cusp
Many angel's fell to the dust

39,G.O.D. (Gaining One's Definition),1997,One Day It'll All Make Sense (1997),Hip Hop,Common,"After bein' 25, you know, just trying to survive in the world 
'Bout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows? 
Anyway, just when you start gettin that little age and experience to you
You start thinkin about stuff, tryin to make the right moves
So bust it out, this is what I was thinkin, check it
Yo, the education of the Lon-chicka-Lonnie Lynn 
Began, began with time
Bein' my bloodline is one with the divine 
In time brotha, you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White
Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no answer to why?
Just told believe in Jesus 'cause for me he did die 
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons
Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em 
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doin right and got you this far
Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or ""Al hum du'Allah""
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do
'Cause when the trumpets blowin, 24 elders surround the throne
Only 144,000 gon get home
Only 144,000 gon get home
Only 144,000 gon get it baby
I've lived and I've learned 
I have taken and I've earned 
I have laughed, I've cried 
I have failed and I have tried 
Sunshine, pouring rain 
I found joy through all my pain 
I just wanna be
Happy with being me 
Let me voice my concern 
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title 
That their actions didn't earn 
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence 
Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince 
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place 
'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know 
Who you are in the first place 
So I try to find the clue in you 
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do
Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
Damn, somethin' in me wanna know who I am 
So I began my search, my journey started in church 
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets 
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with 
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school 
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only 
Science and math are universal
Takin elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran 
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites 
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White 
Some leads were granted with insight 
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So, with followin' I disagree 
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me
But I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind 
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas you gon' surely find
There's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose 
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession 
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson 
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
Well, I've lived and I've learned 
I've taken and I've earned 
I have laughed, I have cried 
I failed and I have tried 
Sunshine, pourin rain 
I found joy through my pain 
Just wanna be
Happy bein' me 
Bein' me"

Layin in some heaven, need a little company
Let's go into a heaven, time to get some geto heaven
Geto...
Searchin for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third, eye on the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and rock sweet apparrel
The mother of my child, we not together
Baby it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Him rockin' the holy spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble
I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver
Feelin' at times, that I might just murder
Yo but that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than any car, any rock, or any broad
He found geto heaven in himself and god

Geto heaven...
Standin in some geto heaven
Geto heaven...
Standin in some geto heaven

Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talkin' to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, 'cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
'Cause one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At the destination, a king will anoint you
Goin' through the storm, many bodies stay warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop in a store
For you to grow he had to go so what you stoppin' him for
Not even I could ignore bein alone it's hard
Find heaven in yourself and god
(D'angelo)
I know I love my baby
My baby loves me
I'm layin in some heaven, need a little company, yeah
It's twenty four seven, time to get some geto heaven
Time to get some geto heaven
Geto heaven, geto heaven
It's time to get some geto heaven
Time to get some geto heaven, oh...
This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, yo it's like a trigger to me
Dealin' with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doin' something you like to support daughters
Keepin' your guys who collectin court orders
Conveyin messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I hope you didn't use it hopin you could grow to it
Whether servin' or a surgeon, you gon go through it
Can't imagine goin' through it, without soul music
It's like donnie ? half? helped me see lonnie's ? fath?
On my behalf, let's take whole steps to a ? ho tep?
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and god
Find heaven in this music and god
Find heaven in this music and god

This swamp water style'll keep 'em dirty and wet
I bet mills on the rhyme skills, we walk away set
Rich like topsoil, connect coin with currency
Places that I couldn't pronounce, and then bounce
Illegal ain't illegal if it's less than an ounce
Keep it come in T. La Rock amounts, see +It's Yours+

Glorifyin, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops
Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose
Datin game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Pos'nus
Before you get a style, let's get a style
My style pans the crowd back and forth
You were soft as the tracks you rappin' off, I pop shit
You tried to laugh it off, actin' like you had to cough
And didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern
Emcee, familiar sample period; spottin where you sampled
Your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it
I drop science and experiment -- contractually
Came to terms of endearment with my label
Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggaz, I contact niggaz
Like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows
Wipin your nose like you need blows
Claimin it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats
Or is it how they word it
If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with
Thoughts fermented, I rode rhythms and words tinted
Many lip profess, I'm verb centered

Infinite landscaper, green paper maker
Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims
Man these people still takin' rappin' for a joke

Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide
On the mic exposin your polluted bloodtype
Y'all niggaz need a visit from the Brain Fairy
Walk around dead, like your physical's buried
Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's
Shaky as SHIT! Just need to come clean and admit
That yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless
My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless

From the hood
(Verse 1: Common)
I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake
Fucking in the car 'cause we just can't wait
To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low, money by her Bible
The type of bitch that BIG said he would die for
Is the type that I ride to stay alive for
Tats on her back, looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together, she weathers the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on
(Verse 2: Common)
I don't even say shit, she can feel it
Eye talk's the realest, toenails acrylic
Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony
Ghetto Prince, she's my Apollonia
Like chick that had the back of Tony, Montana
Reminded me a me of my, of my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is
Endless love for the money, power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snapping when the cabinets ain't closed
When the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose
(Verse 3: Nas)
I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin'
Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic
They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted
Till I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence
But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra
African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours
She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors
Half hood half class, photographers' cameras
Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
Events having sponsored have some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms
You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects"

A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained
So all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait till intermission, run buy your camera
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium
I was told by a wise old to come from the heart
Though I might've did The Light, I don't run from the dark
The dark knight to spark mics, and start fights
The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice
It's strength in the beard, am I loved or feared
A beast amongst boys like Paul I'm revered
Vroof, vroof vroof vroof vroof Vroof vroof well
Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele
You frail on the mic like you might break a nail
I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L
I knew a fat girl who broke the scale
Still touched down 'cause I was off Artell
Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail
Took the underground rail to the end that failed
I rebel, NYSL
Here to leave a trail like Nelson Mandela
My words is the sword, my skill is the shield
My life is the style I stay dressed to kill
A legend like Will Smith with the steel
I could save the world when shit get for real
Skinny George Foreman, all in your grill
My rhyme style is blind, it's all in the feel
Touch it and watch the blood fall with the steel
The weak raps you wrote you could call that your will
My drive VROOM is how I stay the livest
Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid
Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids
You easy to take out cause you hot garbage
I'm amped like wattage, the truth nigga honest
Any moment opponents drop out like college
Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust
Stadium hands in the air fists balled up
Feet in the dirt, blood on the shirt
Scars over bars, symbols of the work
Tight clothes the armor, center of the drama
Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Some of you model bitches is so overrated
Don't mean to underrate it but damn it I made it
In the water I waded on the corner I painted
Draw blood like we related
MCs get de-decapitated
Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with
Mr. Excitement, change your face up like a white chick
Then light shit up like a dread with the herbs
Get sex in the city and head in the burbs
These are the words of a radical

And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my soul
Ashtrays and cigarettes, last days, indigenous people
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it, and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was born, three wise men came to visit us
One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess it's my addiction to women
I was in France, in to see Hennessy blending
Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now it's new beginnings like a born again Christian
On the mic, victorious, story is redemption
I'm sitting at the top, I'm not alone
I'm standing here with my soul
Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
My dad said it rained on my arrival
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
Like I was 5-0, but my creed's Apollo
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
For those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em
Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low
This is the Kilimanjaro, like Twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo, check my youth revival
Truth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido
Crash parties, any live yo
Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang
From the pride we'll reign, kill the game and watch it die slow

To let y'all niggaz know the demo
Voice is a instrument that's monumental
You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho
Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye
I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggaz makin' moves
That bob and weave, and niggaz with jobs on the side sell weed
I feed off the hunger that a bum or abandoned child gets
Freaky, like Marv Albert, in outfits, by Chaka Givens
I lecture how I got God but don't got religion
Got a clip for these niggaz on the net, sellin my shit

But for some reason i decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
'Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days,
with his mama and his kid
When he spoke, I wasn't trying to hear it
'Cause I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
I started thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin the New Testament
and how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
Ny voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know, turn to Matthew 24
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you astray
As long as God is with me, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray
Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds (deep into clouds)
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds)

It's a challenge
But the chance of seeing is quite a dream to chase 
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face, yeah
He gon' see it
The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher (ever)
And it's everflowing it's, everflowing 
When everything puts a smile on my face 
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going 
I keep on going on 
Oh mighty love, watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting
Perfect, like nothing
No hate..no confusion, no strain
Simply peace
Simply, simply, simply, simply
No fear! Heaven is to me 
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ, yeah
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge
Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white, hah hah
Angels sing and cymbals glare
No one's rich no one's poor, hah hah
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love, hah hah
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home haa!
haahhhaa haaaaaaiiiiahahah!
Heaven, heaven is being pops
Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren
Listenin' to they voices whenand they laughing and play
And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me 'round the knees

Ability to communicate and --
To talk, and to touch chords --
A man who has the ability and the audacity
And the -- of God to stand up, to stand up
Heard the sound of the trumpets, the voice from the throne
Seen the twenty-four elders and I knew I was home
I was told to write songs for the people
Take the original Hebrews on an Exodus of Black Excellence
Tell them to invest in us and make testaments about each other
Or how we sisters and brothers
Cover the land in corners of poems and stone
Go hard with it, let 'em know you God with it
Even though I authored it, let no one margin it
And make it all about paper or first weeks sales
Though this is from Heaven give 'em verses from Hell
Those that fell off the path, bring them back to the Mass
The staff can be your microphone
Your name is Common
You was born to fight the norm
Take house niggas outta darkness till they lights is on
I'mma put a hyphen on your name
Rapper-actor-activist
You the one that can reach into the black abyss
Stars this asterix, show 'em what a classic is
Freedom riders need passengers
And your lyrics use scriptures and passages
To make them rise like Lazarus
And resurrected again, they'll put disrespect on your name and respect it again
Every section you in, bless 'em and keep bussin'
If they don't like it, shake the dust and say 'fuck em'
Until you get home, I'm the one you trust in
I'm happy to be in any place
Where God's name is remembered
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Going home to live
Going home to live
Going home to live
Go into the wilderness like Mussa on a pilgrimage
Streets are villages, speak with diligence
And authority to fake god of pharisees and sadducees
Give them that Gardley free from the Black Odyssey
Yo pardon me, you the God bodily
Functioning on earth as a part of me
That's why I gave you artistry
Go into the hoods with the shooters and the strippers
Forget the New World Order, New Jerusalem is with us
Tell sisters they earths and goddesses
If they got bottom, don't get caught in a bottomless
Pit, there's a lot of us fit for the kingdom is near
You can tell by the wars and how the seasons appear
You'll appear in circles in Hollywood, I birthed you
And Chicago, you know how to parlay good
You'll get Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys
Give those to your family, don't get caught up in the vanity
Or the world's insanity
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Going home to live
Going home to live
With God

Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it
Players is gettin' traded

Flowin room temperature, cats is presumed miniature
Like golf. Soft like Tiger Woods

Don't need to rob banks with dike broads to Set it
I levitate to the occasion, lounge like a lyricist
Rhyme wise, you a rest haven

You need to do more deletin and less savin'

With me in your basement, your mama got blown
I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles
Through me the black experience is glorious told
From a school that's old bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, so cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap for them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Peep the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high when I be in y'all
System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks wax CDs and tapes
I am music
You can feel me all over alive, I help culture survive, I opened the eyes of many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies, with your lows and highs, open your mind to hear me
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station it's hot you can't stop my heat
I taught J and Dre how to rock the beat
On what's going on today yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me women cry and children dance, I'm trying to eat
I could'a got a mil and ran
But like Sly for the fam still I stand
I am music
I been here since the beginning
Beginning of time yo beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times yo at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when your ride is smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blow with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pops collections
Whether whole or half stepping I'm a blessing
Yo I am music"

Stay on my climb
I'm grinding, until I get blue balls

Don't make me act like where I come from 'cause it's brutal
There's a place that to run from it if you neutral

I recognize game like a scout
Ayo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I ain't about that
Messing with no other man's women
Because of jealousy then a man go under
Understand a man and his mental

I'm a grown man, I'm too old to fist-fight
I stay on point like trick dice
Tweaking like the sound man who need to switch mic
Sounding bitch like
I know the block is hot, but we just can't get ice
When our children's children sit nice?
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I train days to rip emcees, I'm peaking
But I still gotta get that cheese
You on some monkey ball damn chimpanzees
Mobbin' through the Chi-Town to feel the breeze yo"
54,I Used to Love H.E.R.,1994,Resurrection (1994),Hip Hop,Common,"Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
One, two, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com sense'll be the sure shot
Come on
I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular
Not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic checking her
But I respected her
She hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sitting on a bone, wishing that I could do her eventually
If it was meant to be
Then it would be cause we related physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy I tell ya, I miss her
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop

And Com sense, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
You act, yo, we gotta be the sure shot
Now periodically I would see
Old girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started getting thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads medallions
She was on that tip about stopping the violence
About my people she was teaching me
By not preaching to me, but speaking to me
In a method that was leisurely
So easily I approached
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm-a mad up expanding, so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did, stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was going out of style
She said Afrocentricity was of the past
Well, she got into R&B, hip-house, bass and jazz
Now black music is black music, and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just having fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
One, two, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com got'll be the sure shot
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Get it on, check it, mm-mm
Bust it, bust it
I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, looking rock and dressing hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talking about popping Glocks, serving rocks and hitting switches
Now she's a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches
Always smoking blunts and getting drunk
Telling me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressing how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed, but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her
I see niggas slamming her, and taking her to the sewer
But I'm-a take her back, hoping that the shit stop
Cause who I'm talking 'bout, y'all, is hip-hop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Mainframe, yo they gotta be the sure shot
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
One, two, Com says it's gonna drop
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha
I used to love her (uh, uh, uh, uh)
I used to love her (uh, uh, uh, uh)
I used to love her (uh, uh, uh, uh)
I used to love her (uh, uh, uh, uh)
I used to love her (uh, uh, uh, uh)
I used to love her (we fucked it up, this shit, y'all)
You ain't got your woman in check, man?
I gotta take you off, step in the bounce, just a little bit
I can't do this anymore
I can't do this anymore"

I been thinkin' 'bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love, feel I need another dose
I know it's a feeling
That should be long gone
Things seem to come up
When I hear our song
Golden brown girl, it seem so long
Since I heard your voice
Where did the king go wrong?
Emotions that that they linger on
I guess 'cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls
I need your warm
The taste of your mouth
Girl, I need your warm
Good food and love
I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer, so I'ma keep dreamin' on
It's kinda like the breakup of Jen and Vince Vaughn
Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained holding on
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you
They say you don't know know know
What you got
Till what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such yo alot
But the feelings not as strong
We were like two birds
That were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Somedays I would try but wasn't able to cry
I never been good at sayin' goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over u, my god
I spent many years tryna be the heartthrob
I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it remind me of you
Take a look at the moon it remind me of you
Hope the stars and the gods
Align me and you
Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained holding on

I want you, I want you

I want you, I want you
We do what we do
And we do what we live
I love this way
'Cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it
I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say, girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun
We can sang this together
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you"

The ink on the papyrus, come understand this (What?)
Paint the canvas, givin' you my vision
To mold you, compose you
Get a picture of the scene, then get an exposure
Words out my cipher, the life of my circle
Pain trapped inside of me, Cabrini to Ida B., don't lie to me
You want me in your needle
Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch
I excite your brain till I'm out of your system
Beat digger, not a nigger or a negro I figure you're the winner of the bread
Precede your thoughts 'fore they come into your head (Yo kid kinda nice)
From the word, I speak, unique, clear and concise
Heads I'm boring, soaring to a new height of flight
And then fight the night
With a light to gain sight make your competition say, ""Aight""
No I.D. from the city with a beach on thirty-first

When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me
I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me
Cheap-ass niggas, go and purchase it
I ain't do all this work for shit
My style's my child I gave birth to it
Like an immaculate conception, clean I came
Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name
I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes
It's a jungle out there but I'm never fevering for them white hoes
I love black thighs, you sisters better realize
The real hair and real eyes get real guys
So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind
I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon' be like
""I can't believe it, I got shot""
Bo so I lick one, not for Riddick
But I got the Rid, for my dick
And the crab MCs that be all over it
Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb?
I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Kendall
I remember me and Dion tried to get into Mendel
I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in
Now them same gumps be askin' me to get them in
I be like, ""You don't know me fool""
And color it purple, 'cause he ain't in my circle

Like an old man in a deep sleep
Or an Indian peace pipe
Identity be
The beginning, the end, the first, the last
Breathe into infinity
A verse that lasts
Got a chick in the south that be cursin' fast
When it was she tried a nigga nurse it last (?)
The hunger of a homeless
Microphonus
Played the game - it got a bonus
Man is the plan
The master like Tiger
So much is the drive
I am the definition of a rider
Daughter's name means survivor
From a tribe-a
Colliders
Just one word can't describe her
A scribe of the streets
And a good life that we all wanna reach
I'm hotter than a beach
Flow is so deep
Even underwater
I can inhale to bring the world in order

I mean this is music, it ain't all that I got, but it does mean a lot to me, I injected my whole being into it, and I've been doing it for a while, it's like my whole life has become a style.

Envisioning the hereafter, listenin to Steve Wonder
On a Quest for Love like the Proceed drummer
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and G weed from her
It's a cold world and niggaz need summer
At times my going forward seems like retreat
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribblin freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seemin contagious
Redeemin the ancients with ace this rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you chartin, certain shit I can't honor
It ain't that you sellin, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform fly-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could have sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key 20
Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollerin at the brothers, either you gon be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land, I can see my man Rashad
As he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked wit him
This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was comin'
I said it's here
It's here (echoed)"

A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Trippin' on heights, wishin for nights in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy, shown by the caddies
Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggaz named Butch through the bay bay
With waists so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto This is Chicago in the hay day
Similiar to Good Times, I guess that I was Jay Jay
A skinny nigga, young girls with penny figures
So many niggaz, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they own
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good workin with my hands
My generation never understood workin for the man
And, of bein broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot, as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world
""It's your world""
[Common] Yeah
Life and death law around us
Four pounds and pounds a verb from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that sorrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin her body, wish she knew what it was worth.
Between God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggaz she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was colder (?), growin' up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her step-father that he was aite, so her mother he striked
She got to like like minded niggaz, who liked crimes and figures
Doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rootin for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world
(Chorus repeated several times)
(Kids stating their dreams)
('POPS')
Be.
Be here, be there
Be that, be this
Be grateful for life, be grateful to life
Be gleeful everyday
For being the best swimmer among 500,000
Be-nign, be you
Be mom's mean pie
Be little black sambo
With bad hair
Be aware of what a lynch is
Be.
Be boundless energy!
Be a four star ghetto general
Be no one except I
Be food for thought to the growing mind
Be the author of your own horoscope
Be invited
Be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful
Be a proud run, only to return to fight another day
Be peaceful if possible, but justice in every ways
Be high when you low
Be on time, but knowing to go
Be cautious of the road to college
Taking a detour through Vietnam or the Middle East
Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while begging
A nation built on free labor for reparation
Be a cartopogropher [laughter] (whatever)
Be a map maker
Be able to find ""Afro-American man""
Search thoroughly; it may be close to ""black man""
Be amended five fifths
Be amended five fifths human
Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wildlife
Be Cupid, to world government
Be found among the truth, lost tribe
Be at full strength when walking through the valley
Be not foolish as temporary king
On the mountain top
Be a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy
While walking on earth
Be loved by God
As much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King
Be that last one of 144 thousand
Be the resident of the twelfth house
Be...
Eternal."

Just to get his people high.

Life is so, colorful
Reds, blues and dreams.
Jimi lives in a purple haze,
In a psychadelic maze.
Playing the streets like and instrument:
Pulling strings wherever he went.
Angel sent
From the sky
Just to get his people high.

Born to fly
Getting high off his own supply

The dream seem to go on as the day lingered
The meaning of life, you can't frame or name it

Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell 'em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control, just walking my soles low
Lit up with the abuse, they wasn't for show, I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day, bare faced, giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you? They know me on the streets where I grew
If you ain't from around here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for them keys
To the kingdom
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah)
Ooh (sing)

65,Letter to the Free,2016,Black America Again (2016),Hip Hop,Common,"Southern leaves, southern trees we hung from
Barren souls, heroic songs unsung
Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone
Tied with the rope that my grandmother died
Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions
Since slave days separating, fathers from children
Institution ain't just a building
But a method, of having black and brown bodies fill them
We ain't seen as human beings with feelings
Will the U.S. ever be us? Lord willing!
For now we know, the new Jim Crow
They stop, search and arrest our souls
Police and policies patrol philosophies of control
A cruel hand taking hold
We let go to free them so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus

Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)

The caged birds sings for freedom to bring
Black bodies being lost in the American dream
Blood of black being, a pastoral scene
Slavery's still alive, check Amendment 13
Not whips and chains, all subliminal
Instead of 'nigga' they use the word 'criminal'
Sweet land of liberty, incarcerated country
Shot me with your ray-gun
And now you want to trump me
Prison is a business, America's the company
Investing in injustice, fear and long suffering
We staring in the face of hate again
The same hate they say will make America great again
No consolation prize for the dehumanized
For America to rise it's a matter of Black Lives
And we gonna free them, so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus
Freedom (Freedom)

66,Little Chicago Boy,2016,Black America Again (2016),Hip Hop,Common,"How should I begin?
This is the story of a boy named Lonnie Lynn
As I said it, the spirits enwhip me
He was raised in the belly of the city
Chicago
Discovered by du Sable
A Black Frenchman
That I had to mention
Extensions of a young man livin' on a low end
47th and Michigan, lackin' a little discipline
Grandma Mable did the best she could
You know how young brothers want a testy hood
There he stood, taller than most Black boys
One of the best ballers out of Illinois
Collagen, Ohio, this is like his bio
Talks that we had, man, they was never idle
He talked about readin' the Quran and the Bible
He talked how he smoked dope and sold it for survival
He talked about the ancestors, in our lives; they're vital
He said y'all boys love the bang 'cause you tribal
Spiral of life, Chicago to Denver
Anywhere he went, of attention, he's the center
6'9"", big heart, big mind
He he spent his whole life tryin' to be big time
He did in a way, he made to the ABA
And the things he say on my record
When I was a shawty, he bought me ""The Message""
It was his messages in life I would step with
Didn't see him much, spirits are connected
Father creates it, the son can reflect it
His perspective: sometimes seemed crazy
His perspective: sometimes seemed brilliant
His perspective: somehow it shaped me
His perspective: undoubted I feel it
He'd walk around in them Air Jordans I gave him
I said, ""Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em""
The fight that he had with cancer was a brave one
Took Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication
Breathing heavy, he talked reparations
He said, ""Son, we live through our generations""
Offspring, coughing, Gene Ammons was playing
In the background, he was talking, I was praying
Our Father, take care of my father
As far as he went, may I go farther
May our dreams and legacies live through our children
Though I can't touch him, I can still feel him
As Pops would always say, ""Keep the peace"""
67,Love Is...,2005,Be (2005),Hip Hop,Common,"(Yeah, Love is Love.
God is Love.) 3X
How beautiful Love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving You is Loving Me.
How beautiful Love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving You is Loving Me.
1st Verse:
Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had 5 kids
Live nigs, real niccas express and chase it
In crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, Fam showing loving support
You and your baby's mom thought that Love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how till we older men
If Love is a place, Ima go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I seen Love make a nicca soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end
2nd Verse:
It's all Love where we come from
In the hood Loved we was told to run from
That same hood where the gun sung
We holla Love hoping it become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of Love many hide, some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with a man had her trapped in a maze
Tryin' to find herself to regain much of that she had gave
Love can free us to which some react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, or is he acting afraid?
Everybody loves somebody but I attract shade
Heard of the love of money, but compassionate pays
Talk about it with my youth so she understand
What it is to be loved by a man. (Unnh!)
3rd Verse:
Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest niccas soften with his homie in a coffin
We walk in, stand and fall in it
With the right companion, we all in it
Mary sang a song about it
Having broad limits in the game of life
It's the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people... ""Love always""!

I'm the sun god, let me warm you
Out of my sides the Lord formed you
Pull your dress up, ain't nothin' formal
Our fragrance is patience
We can major in communication
Relatin' like cousins, though we kissin' though
Love can be sick or medicinal
A doctor of it, you gots to love it
God body language I be spittin' while we fuckin'

You're my lovestar

I ain't the type to be all up on your social
I'm in your face vocal the way a man supposed to
A choosy lover, I chose you
God's most beautiful creation, let me mold you
You already in shape, that's more love to make
Feel free when I'm with you, it's hard to escape
When we need a break
We take it
When two souls connect you can't fake it
TV shows and cakes, I know your favorite
Cut from the same cloth, let's wear it
This ain't about labels, this about fit
Since God designed, we can start our own line
Our offspring will be you, me, and He combined
We walk the runway like blaow
Bein' in love is never out of style
You're my lovestar

Heaven agrees you are all that I need down here
Cause you make it all worth it

I want to be your everything forever

I remember she sit there with her thickness
Never played a game but I heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is ""gonna get'cha""
But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, God be with us
It was hard for me to take down the pictures
I was tripping, I even called her sister
I could be someone you could talk to, each and every day
But you were 'bout to marry, be on your merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
'Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love huh just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?
Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls
Issues that I had
Some say it comes from not seeing my dad
Keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me laid up, girl I never gave up
On you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough
I know your young and you gotta live your life ma
I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya
I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest
So confusing losing love, I'm saying god bless
Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?"

You pussy MC, it's you I rebuke, repent
You burn up you got me bit, I'm coming as ebit

My office hours are from 9 to 5, while you avoid the party I make it

I'm as dope as PCP, MC's see me and start having flashbacks
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back
Now a days blacks don't know how to act, besides Larry Fishburn
Charles Jug and Wesly Snipes, marks wanna test me because I test the
Mics
I check 'em like sound, and like loose I'm down
Plus I done got better since Soul By the Pound, I maintain
I fall fresh apon the spirit, with the lyric that's overwhelming
And house more hoes then Spellman, worse unwelcome like James Johnston
My brains sponcering speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson
Rappers I'm fondaling, they try to settle out of court
But I, could never be bought, what type of rebel eats pork?
I'll take the cat and never get caught, you wack together we fought
'Cause I can't see my melons boxing if he's not boxin' with 'em
I don't care who started it, I'm gonna be apart of it
Regardless of the odds of how hard
It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with them
I got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes
But if I becomes a 10 then some brothers all some gin
And I got juice, and this niggas scared
I'll F your head up, like the L.A. 4, when I flow for cash I got for

Her body's so endowed, seen her ass cracked a smile
Enjoyin the Nile, take it, the breeze in
On some cat and mouse and she was, just cheesein
The sun eased in our conversation
""California Dreamin'"" now ""Californication""
Said she had some drinks in the cooler and I had an invitation
If I wanted I could brew up, this is just an indication
Of how cool she was
A couple chicks came up with the groupie love
They ain't want no pictures, only to be hugged
I'm thinkin' DAMN, damn, that's really cool because
Sometimes I wanna chill
Sometimes the best things in life are not in ya plans
You came to the sand and got, more than a tan
Baby girl, I'm a man and we can do this my way
Take a ride on the highway and pretend like it's Friday and it is
(Common - Verse 2)
She was at a barbecue
Pretty painted nails, she took off her shoes
She was 'show and tell' like it was grammar school
Sippin on some L, I'm thinkin', ""Man, she cool!""
Sun smilin' on her hair
Hey, they playin' spades and we can be a pair
She had a spread on her, I can see it from her chair
I love it when it's sunny/Sonny, girl you could be my Cher
It's, Independence Day and free is in the air
We danced and danced away yo
Showed her how to step, it's like a tango
From her body angle, I can tell she like me
She got me a flav, girl you're sweet as Icee
Spicy talk, the sauce drip from my lips
Take tricks and let's dip, we can do somethin' hip
Take a trip around the world in a day, play Fiona A.
Let your worries blow away like it's all okay, and it is!"

And I'ma make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Canibus and Common:
That's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware
(Rakim from ""My Melody""(To catch another sucka duck MC out there)
Common:
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who yo team or who you startin with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggaz like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcisim, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got not get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him
Canibus:
I'm creatin' the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Puttin' together them whether my rhyme one threat at a time
So you niggaz need to stop testin me
'Cause you know you can't ""F"" with me
Steppin to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposin yourself to the verbal radiations
Sayin' you can defeat me is nothin' but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggaz be diggin my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who wanna battle?
I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggaz couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MCs will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
What!

Common, steppin to me is like going to the county being a neutron
Common, I ain't scared of no nigga
Common:
I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggaz I'm dunkin like when cops mingle
Fuck hip hop jingles, rhymin big words and not sayin' shit
The click that you came in with accent your flavor wit
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggaz off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper who's career
You could only take a glance, couldn't make the transition
>From B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference, the humbleness
But in the Chi, bumbleless
Was thinkin' as a weakness were poetrys in motion
Like a bitch, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions

Yo, the Canibus is an animal with a mechanical mandible
Comin' to damage you, spittin' understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead sharp peripheral
With 360 degree visual
When the signal was given, MCs get biten with venom
>From a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the shroud of turan, for certain
I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshippers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this
The lyrical verbalist, trash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as, you gay ass fag
I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So phat to be a rap star, takin' pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me
Because they saw me, up in The Source chillin' on page 40
Put this in your CD-ROM
Www dot Canibus dot com
You can find me on the internet talkin' to chicks
That was sweatin me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talkin' mad trash tryin' to get 'em to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it bag to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave.
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
Beast from the East part 2, comin' to see you

Dreams of doing scenes with Terence Howard and
Broadway plays and dancin' with Alv and them
The ones that make it always ain't the talented
Some dreams get lost never to be found again
At first strippin' seemed so empowerin'
Most every girl wanna do it now and then
But bein' meat everyday is devourin'
Cats put paper where she put powder in
Life would break up now she powderin'
She was high when she fell down and then
Crowd surroundin' and heart was poundin' and
She fell into a deep sleep, the siren sounded and
Seein bright lights in the mist of clouds and then
Talk to god feelin' like his child again
Said lord let me live so I can make you proud again

This the city of Chicago
The state of confusion
The style I'm using is free
Or at least it would be if my mind was
Peep I'm behind cause
I didn't handle my function while in high school
Although I was cool
The hood I live in ain't that proper
Cause a cop a stop ya
And have you at a hundred and eleventh before you can say not guilty
I'm not filthy
Nor am I rich
Ain't that a bitch
Like life is
Not your wife is
See that your better halve
Do your math
And peep that two halves make a whole
And all I have to hold
Is my self pride
So these streets I strive
Like a Black Panther
Asking can the
Situation get much worst
All I do is try to appeal to the masses
As the phrase keep it real passes
The teeth of too many phoney individuals
Snakes, that smooth like criminals
They create chemicals
That the Earth hate
Doing their damndest to decrease my birth rate
I'd settle for lesser knowing I'm worth wait
Or at least my weight in precious gems
So I'm steadily steadly steadly
Trying to lose my religion, like R E M
Created in His own image so are we him?
And through all this crises
Shid (Shit) I wonder where Christ is
Well he damn sure not in K town or the wild hundreds
Where they broadcast G.D. till the world blow-up
And Stone run it
Hunted by police for display in state vile cages
Come out to make minimum wages
And with a desiese that are contagious
It is fucking outrages
The amounts of Black and Brown they lock up
But the Most High encourages me to put the glock up
And Stock up on do for self knowledge
A brother couldn't afford to go to collage
So I had to learn form the school of hard knock
On the hard blocks of the Chi
Even I, think about moving out to River Oaks
As my liver soaks
In mad Hennesy
'Cause I got a bad tendency
To do a lot of drinking
Now I do a lot of thinking
Blinking, was your third eye
When you heard I
Was one of the chosen one
Industry doors keep closing
(Sing) Watch the closing doors
Niggas want a record deal
But can they deal with a record?
Cause once they get rich
They tend to switch
Like a sissy
Please miss me
With all that bullshit you popping
This knowledge I'm gonna keep dropping
Even if you had one of them red octagon

Is like that of a ocean, devotion 'cause I'm
The Earth, Wind, and Fire of hip hop
By Rakim and Short I been inspired
My shit knocks environ---ments
Of cats wit seventeen's tint, time is money
The mind is funny, how it's spent on gettin' it
It's sittin' wit descendants of Abraham
Who say the jam is ""Money, Cash, Hoes""

Niggas, magazine writers, MC's
Who request hot shit, I freeze
And tell 'em where I was rose, we always said cold
Hold your Horses and ya Carriages, this never-went-gold nigga
Rocks shows care-less
You not gon' respect self, at least respect the heritage
Affect the lives, the spread of wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this
And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had Dreams of Fuckin' R&B broads, it came true
Journalist I wreck, shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I MC
Familiar voice, come to find out the angel was me
Some say ""You changin, Rashid""
Times are, we still close
I rhyme far, away away away
From what you accustomed to hearin everyday, uh-ah

My refrigerator poetry's magnetic like ultra
You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posin like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay MC's, just don't come around me wit it
You still rockin' hickies, don't let me find out he did it
Got My Eyes on the Tiger, Eyes on the Prize
Eyes on the thighs of Mary J. Blige, imagine on how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky
My verse depth is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing, invitin you and yours to my openness
Shows allow me to cop Range/range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a Range/range when it's time to head home?

Yeah! The war zone. Who you fighting for?
(Verse 1: Common)
It's funk to rhythm and punk to rock
Loud like shot that come from a glock
Pick up your mind, run from the spot
Revolution jumping in the parking lot
Shit is so hot that the sun watch
Children by the window with the gun cocked
They could get robbed and stop the luck (?)
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
I lock into a...
Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system
For the humble on the path I paint a vision
How far will a nigga go just for attention
And to be remembered, you forgot the mission
Listen!
(Chorus: Laetitia Sadier)
All traces of life
In our gats we carry
That's used to dress humanity
(Common: it's a New Wave, Come on!)
A desire for
Universality
The fuse that starts reality
(Common: it's a New Wave, Dig it!)
Enough with violence
Domination agree
The time to greet equality?
(Common: it's a New Wave, Come on!)
This life is precious
It's goddamn marvelous
Before it really ever ends
(Common: Come on! Come on!)
(Verse 2: Common)
I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
For the people to make or wait it's better
In a room called real I stay forever
Everyday I lose something I gain forever
Meditate on how I can change the weather
My brainstorm for some it's like (?) umbrella
Where bullets and lies both spray together
My mind scream like Al Green ""Let's Stay Together""
How could a nigga be so scared of change
That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange
Y'all rich, we could beef curry in the game
Out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name
You seen what happened when the Com go BANG
Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main-stream
It all seems mundane in the scope of thangs
(Verse 3: Common)
From a land of shit talk, boy stars and pitch forks
Didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent on backyards, wishing in the air for a black god
Where people fix cars and clap hard
And look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
Smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
That master anger and ain't afraid to shoot
Through poured liquor fallen angels they salute (Whew! Whew!)
Feel the wind blow
A new wave- people with their hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels who rock heavy metals
And tell them that they're pharoh so let go
Come on!"
77,No Defense,1992,Can I Borrow a Dollar? (1992),Hip Hop,Common,"Armed with a arrow you're pointing it straight at my heart,
Watching me break as I try to find my way out of the dark,
They say each moment comes to an end
So my pain is its consequence,
It's a battle and I have no defence.
Sure as you said that you loved me you turned me away,
Suddenly everything changed right in front of my face,
They say sometimes loves just unfair
But why's it always at my expense?
I've no answers and I have no defence.
I guess I'll never understand
How love can come and go,
Looking through the broken glass now I know,
But even though my bitter doubt lets my lonliness show,
I'll get over you, over you in the end.
I wish that I had the courage to leave you behind,
Cause you are the one that I'll love for the rest of my life,
They say someday I'll trust again
But it makes no difference,
'Cause it's a battle and I have no defence.
No, no, no
It's a battle and I have no
No defence"
78,No Fear,2014,Nobody's Smiling (2014),Hip Hop,Common,"Sitting on stairs, in street affairs
Jordan Airs, he got at least seven pairs
His voice rare, talk with a mumble
Chicago Bearhead, caught up at the huddle
Call an audible of trouble came
His name Chris, black as his hustle name
Raction to his chains, it's like a basketball game
Watch him winning, hope your team do the same
A menace, he O-Dog, Caine
Wish a nigga would go against his grain
Used to staying but moved up in the game
Take a nigga spot, take a nigga fame
The fortune of a caine, long live his reign
He do it for a son, he do it with a gun
Whatever he do, yo, he do it till it's done
A team full of hitters, so they hit and run
The prestone even want none
Walk with the G's cause the G's never run
Something to be from the slum and be the one
This is where he at, this is where he from
Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from
Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from
Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from
Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from
Living life with no fear
Putting that truth in my baby girl's ear
Told her that dudes gon' want some ass
And whatever you do, do it with class
She wanna E, but to me, you gotta earn it
You can't circumvent life, you gotta earn it
It's the circle of life, that's why we're turning
Yo, I hit a choir and a sermon, our messiah is returning
With a tile around my neck, a style around respect
Know the smell of good pussy and the sound of a tec
They fire, drill, stop dropping roll
I popped out the cold hip-hop, that was gold
The way of the road is our ode to the legacy
C'mon dog, you know my pedigree
Find it forever be, the sun never set on me
Many reign, but the game never weather me
If I'm in the building that mean I got equity
Where articles are black like Ebony
Since I was a shorty I was thinking long charity
No fear, I say that with levity
Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from
Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from
Where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from, where I'm from

Niggaz wyling on Stoney Island
Where the chief and the president come from
Pop out, pop pills, pop guns
On the deck when the ops come
Pop some, ops run
This ain't a game nigga, ain't no options
Niggaz sellin' on the block like an auction
Dig into my pockets, see a profit
Where the money and the bitches is where the gods is
Godfathers in the lodges, at the spot
Holdin' money, like a hostage
She went ostrich... from the projects with posture
I draw with the goddess like an artist
Gettin' paper with no margins, money gods
I do it for Hadiya and Trayvon Martin, yo
In the Chi, ain't a damn thing funny
Thinkin' of ways to get money
Drive down Lake Shore, schemin' how to make more
If we ain't eatin' together, what is this cake for?
Ain't nobody givin' it, that's what we take for
Niggaz is broke, what I need a break for?
Glaciers of ice, lasers and lice
Let the chains glow heavy, we paid for 'em twice
Made for the life, ball out like we out of bounds
Bars and guns, niggaz got a lot of rounds
Trippin' like you from out of town
The fo'-pound'll leave you on the ground without a sound
Ain't no fathers 'round, +Sons of Anarchy+
Fightin' attempts, trafficking, and grand larceny
At the party with the thots with the extra body
I'm in the inner city, it's an out-of-body... experience
Face on T-shirts with no #hashtags
Just big-ass trash bags tagged hash
Out here, shit been trill
Fake-ass gangster, quick to take a fag's cash
Five versus six, Star Wars
No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors
Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9's
Two trey 8's, and one fo'-fives
Tryna get to two-threes, the numbers game
Then here come the fame, but they won't say no names
Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town?
I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around
Popes, bishops, disciples, stones
Counts, princes, lords, queens and kings
They drillin' on my land but ain't no oil to be found
I might be part of the problem
I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up
Most of them can't e'en moonwalk
My lil' cousin Bump J don't know what he did when he introduced that goon talk
Is there a Scarface castin' at the crib I don't know about?
So many Shortys have tried out for the role
That's why he slide out and ride out with the pole
Now I see how my daddy felt the dark day he discovered
That black power didn't keep the lights on
Right on, the dearly departed still rappin' to you
Lookin' for some yellow, white, red, black, brown flesh to write on
How long will they mourn me after I'm out of mind, out of sight, gone
A crash, a head-on collision affects both riders the most

Yeah we got ghost writers, they just actually ghosts"

And check it out, ha.
My raps do laps around tracks to the days
The idiot vibin', I'm the comma comma Chamelion
I use to pop the willy on my blue and gray sting ray
It had maxed, I was with bitches that had coochie
Bassum wasn't rollin' Starters, looking harder than niggas
Hoes wore clothes, that exposed their figures
Ain't 7 steps in the jam, next the police come
Heist there would be one, numbers I would get at least one
We come to the get together with whatever
You wouldn't know how deep it was, we all did shit together
Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew and then step to
The next cue, let's do it again y'all
That was when mad was tall and phat was cold
The days of Old Chicage and Fun Town and shorties we run round
Play strike outs till sun down, but the shit ain't as fun now
And the city is all run down, we troop down to Jew Town
Talking cat down on some gear, have enough for a Polish incom fair
I stare, at what use to be Bubbles and think about who use to cop our
Liquior
(Who?) Our neighborhood father figure
I'm out with my crew, ain't nothin' to do but ah,
""Niggas be rollin'"" - Ol' Dirty Bastard from Protect Ya Neck
Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a hoe while I
""Niggas be rollin'""
Gotta make a stop take a leak and get some chops cause um
""Niggas be rollin'""
We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause um
""Niggas be rollin'""
I got more rhymes then the Manor got folks had style
Since I went to McDowl, wearin' boats
And penny loafers know I had the nickel in mines
We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme
It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop
Skeeter will hit from the SAME spot
Torla tore my shit down, get down, put your body in motion
Only the strong survive, but on the 6 or the 5
Live as hot as sex use to be at the Racket
Wrong club with music by Andre Hatchet
Or either Beat Box Ferris at them country club parties
Would be hot as hell and house stud would get ""Find a body!""
Sawyers I would go there, hip hop clubs were so rare
I like the music anyways and it was always hoes there
Was said to have the best chicks but mostly High Park and V hoes
Is who I mess with, the best shit was troopin' to the loop
With your posisions held class crooked ass but still go the division
(I remember that) Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work
Bust a smoothie on the spread, but sill have some on your shirt
I tuned into BMX and taped Farly on the tonemaster
I took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster
Then HBK was the only station that would fuck with rap
You was on the shore by yourself castin' stay up your act
What you could make of it, you was a gump they was takin' shit
Either fight or break for it, we go to the lake and get full
My drink there was Boons and Red Bull
I remember swimming in Avenlon, and being in a pool
I thought I was cool, with my ""members only"" and a bold fade
Wall to wall greens to get the sport gray and palmade
And soft breasts, as we got older we would star crush and bang fags
Go to Marshals and change tags, I snagged nuff niggas
And games are off the wall, in softball, Piggy one I would call
When I first got my three way callin', I caught Marsh tryin' to lie
Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shot"

So much it's in my hemoglobin to be a ill nigga
So I figure like a father... that I'ma Turn This Mutha Out

I don't know what you thought hops, but chief I got tall props
Some cats think I'm six feet I'm so deep
Some stunts be thinkin' I'm six-fo', my shit be hittin like switches
Bitches, ask, why my, britches, sag
I ask the bitches, ""Why your titties saggin?""
Put your nipple to the bottle I bust rhymes like breastses
I can get down, d-d-d-down like pessimist
Ring the Alarm, I got Charm like a neck-a-lace

Than your time zone, broke as the rich get richer
Blunt-burnt lips and a worn-out liver
That's everyday livin', guns everywhere chillin'
Got you feelin' like there's money comin' sooner than later
Till then, I'll be runnin' from the judge and the bailiff
Crime committin' cause these women love a man in Mercedes

Now see you done messed with the wrong old lady
You done went wild; yo, check it...
There was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again
Dude that broke in my crib - it wasn't involvin him
Four in the mornin, my phone ringin'
I'm thinkin', ""Who da fuck is this,"" on the other line screamin
Told em, ""Keep (?) down,"" but they was breathin hard
It was my grandmother tellin' me that she had been robbed
I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over
Freezin but this situation made the night colder
Knew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker
With some friends in a club at the boat gettin' bub'
Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while (uh)
Not gamblin but every now and then they'd smile
Then BLAOW! They had (?) Mag's
And told everybody, ""Put your shit in the bag""
Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)
Had the place took in a minute and some seconds
Asked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)
Said she couldn't remember
She was spooked and buzzin, couldn't describe em
Cause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me
With they pants hangin' off they ass
Got her some water - and begin to think
How these niggaz take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?
Somebody round the crib know the deal (uh)

Cause yo, it's the big payback...

Walked in they was playin' Jigga (jih-gga..)
Discussin how Da Brat titties done got bigger
These niggaz next to me, was talkin' 'bout the heist
Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice
Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nut-nin
Had to use all my might not to ask no questions
Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine
Noticin these cats, had the Bling Bling
They wouldn't be talkin' if they did it; it could be they team
A week ago neither one of these niggaz had a ring
This Hype (?) came in, sellin CD's; said the BD's
Was braggin bout robbery they had done
By now, I'm thinkin' bout my gun if I see gramps bracelet
I'ma play racist (and what?) and make niggaz run

Thinkin' - when shit went down, I was I was there

These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggaz who done it
Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's
Eight million stories got me runnin' in place, it's gettin' tricky

There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious
Normally, they'd be talkin' like bitches
My barber cut me with a quickness (what?)
Asked him where he got the new bracelet;
He said it was his sister's - I knew then

Everything's gone be all right...
(Common - Verse 1)
It's do or die, your looking through the eye of a revolver
I revolve around the world, a problem solver
Alter your ego, and the way your walkin'
Talk to people, still I stay regal
Read through the bullshit
Sometime to make peace, you need a full clip
Roll dice with niggas who got bricks at a good price
Talk shit, give good advice, rollin' through the 'hood right
It's the good life, like T.I. said
Gettin' it, how could I not be fed
Get bread, get dough, get fed, get mo'
In the old school Lincoln, thinking I sit low
Let problems burn slow away
I yearn for the day that it won't go gray
Remember we were kings, back in the day
Still can be, depending on the cards you play
(Bilal - Chorus 1 (repeat 2x))
If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)
Everything... gone be all right (well... all right (3x))
(Common - Verse 2)
I ain't playin' with a full deck
The government won't let me get a full check
I'm taxin' marks, I got more heart than clubs
The black spade, givin' 'em darker love
Make 'em strip, like poker poker mag in his face
You tried to smoke my ace, you know the stakes
It's high like the ace is
Get your squad face down like cards, before they get a facelift
You get robbed, better yet jacked for diamonds
Leave you victimless, like Jack in ""Shining""
Blocked your bluff, now your respect is stolen
Took your chips, led my guys in Texas Hold 'Em
Rolled the strips of Vegas, with money boss players
Stacey Adams of different flavors, we major
Gangstas and hustles, living moviestar life
Dealt a bad hand, but I played my cards right
(Bilal - Chorus 1 (repeat 2x))
If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)
Everything... gone be all right (well... all right (3x))
(Bilal - Chorus 2 (repeat 2x))
Oh...
If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)
Everything's... gone be all right (well... all right (3x))
(Bilal - Accapella)
Yeah... Oh...
Everything's gone be all right, if you play your cards right
Everything's gone be all right..."
86,Pop's Rap,1994,Resurrection (1994),Hip Hop,Common,"Are you gonna play any music or do you just want me to rap?
Okay
Hey, hey old bean
And you to baby sweetness
I just dropped by the studio, see what my son does
My main man, my son Common Sense
They used to call me no sense
Now they say I got plenty sense, about six thousand years of it
You know, I'm just checking him out
See what's going on, 'cause I'm always sitting around telling him about
What we used to do back in our hood, you know
We used to be down and run this town and it was all at PC Pub
You know, and I'm shaking and they working on it, and they bringing it back
I see harmony, understanding
And they working on that love thing too
'Cause they be down with it, you know?
Now I hear them saying things like, ""Whoa, I get a good feeling""
I be saying ""Keep it up
Keep on moving with your groove, you're going the right way""
'Cause it's got to be in your heart
And I can tell by your beat you got it
See there, I can do a little piece, put them together there
Yeah, we used to be running this whole town, here
We used to be basketball playing brothers, you know
Now everybody's playing basketball
I wonder where they come from, what they claiming?
Gonna make an old man get his shoes out and throw one down to slam dunk on 'em
Every time the leaves start turning brown getting through the fall of the year
I can say, ""Yeah it's time to play some""
What these youngsters talking about, they running out of breath?
What you say?
Well I tell what, we're gonna try something brand new here
'Cause everybody like new things, we're gonna work on something new, and I'm gonna call it peace
We're gonna pretend like its six years old
And we gonna build it and mould it
And nurture it and culture it
And grow right into our society for all of us to have
Do you believe in the peace?
Not that piece, but do you believe in the peace?
All right, I see you raising your hand, you believe in the peace
Okay, bring it
See if I can't talk common sense into them
Let's cruise on down to 47 St. where dad used to hang out at, you know?
Eh remember in a few years when we moved from 47 to 87
47 was my hood, 87 was his
Touchdown
What's the name of the bangers in this town now?
Has everybody calmed down?
Back in my day, they was showing up, now they finally woke up
I hear they leaving it alone
Using words like ""Truce,"" I love to hear that"
87,Pop's Rap III... All My Children,2000,Like Water for Chocolate (2000),Hip Hop,Common,"Hey, hey old bean and you to baby sweetness
Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio
And I didn't have to break in this time
I'm back as a special guest by special request
And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again
They may have to wrestle to get it back
You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world
Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family from around the globe
He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes
From all my children from Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan
And of course in the motherland
Even in the orient, they know what I meant
Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan
So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out
I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children
Who've been saying and doing the right things
You know they sat on those nines of 1999
And kept them from turning upside down
And teaching the babies to love, to be able to give love
And to enter the new century with their own prophecy
The century of amends
You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours
And that we all travel the same path
It's just that we don't get there at the same time
See you next lifetime, see you next lifetime
And to my children running around here
Talking about how nice is they ice
That they've already paid for twice
What karat is they gold
That was yours before you were done in the hole
Or that crew from 1629, buy some land
Think agriculture, beat that neighborhood
Which you claim you love so dear
Are you mankind or what kind of a man?
See, Pops is straight out of the garden
From when the world was starting brand new
Hip-hop, hip-hop, the language of the underground railroad
In it's purest form
Yeah true hip-hop is just like the underground railroad
If the message is not for you
It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze
So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high
I'm flying high with Cee-Lo
Or maybe watching my long's heart dancing to a De La flow
Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree without the roots
And Black Star said we are what we are
The Knowledge Of Self Determination and my little homie KG
Up there in Minnesota milking 10,000 lakes
Keep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind
So if your heart is real
You will hear Big Will and Ms. Lauryn Hill
If your love is true, you will hear Baduism
And you can't go right until you go left
And get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff
Children, I've traveled this globe, north to south, east to west
And whenever my soul appears lost
I turn to the musical stylings of A Tribe Called Quest
Okay, we ready to get out of here
We ready to take it home now
Just so everybody knows
When Pops get ready to say something good
I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood
And it ain't no time for no shecky, shecky
That's when I call on a black girl named Betty
Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't even exist
I just come to give love and peace and honor to all my children"
88,Pop's Rap Part 2 / Fatherhood,1997,One Day It'll All Make Sense (1997),Hip Hop,Common,"Hey, Hey old been, and you too baby sweets
I'm back in the studio, you know, I drove up
In the parking lot, and the parking lot was empty
Wasn't no cars out there like nobody wasn't even in here
All the doors were locked from the inside
But, I found a window cracked on the first floor so now I'm in here
Let's rap
So, I come in here, talk to my son, you know?
But, but, his next album he got comin' out
You know it's been such a spiritual feelin'
I had to come in the studio just to see what he was doing
'Cause I was gettin' those vibes all in the rocky mountains say, ""I got to go,""
You know? I understand I'm finna' be a grandfather
And I'm so proud
I can say that in many ways, I can say I'm so happy, I'm so proud
You know? Son I wanna give you, you know?
Any direction in parenting at this stage
Because I think it's gonna come to you, just like it came to me
See you came to me and your mom from the spiritual world
We're just the physical parents, you know?
God loaned you to us, as God's spirit
We're the physical parents, you know?
Like I say, I'm not gonna give you no directions, you know?
But, I know when you started teaching me
See we talk about the life and education of one Lonnie Lynn
I think I'm the one that got taught, I do believe that son, you know?
And I know when you started teaching me too
You know, I was hanging out, mad at the world
My professional basketball career was over
And I didn't believe in the red, white and blue anymore
And I was dissipatin' heavily, I wasn't experimentin', you know?
And one morning you looked across the table at me, it was like what?
Whatchu' gon' be? Whatchu' gon' do?
You got the responsibility to teach me the right things
You got the responsibility to teach me truth and respect and love, and safety
You know? And my knees started gettin' a little stronger, you know?
I said, 'cause I can't get past these eyes man, it's just the eyes of a babe looking at me
And I couldn't look it off, I couldn't even play it off, you know?
And immediately I started gettin' the road maps seein' like how am I gon' do this?
I had to thank The Almighty for the strength, that he sent to me through you
So, I'm here to say, you know, thank you son
I'm here to say I'm so proud and numerous other things
'Cause you've been a teacher to me, just like, I have supposed to be a teacher to you
Cause a lot of people think that parenting and raising a child is a one way street
But, you taught me continuous numerous lessons
And I love you my son"

Yeah, yeah, bring it on
Uh huh, with the ya ya, yeah
Just sitting around kicking it a little bit
I thought we would record something tonight
And I do want to dedicate it to two very outstanding people
I live the spirit of
Gentlemen Crispus Attucks and Mr. Marcus Garvey
Thank you so much
The Believer
If I were a believer, I believe I would believe in the beginning
Everybody's beginning
Mine, that my very first ancestors were front row and present
When God stepped to the mic
I believe from the creation of the Garden of Eden
The separation of the tribes
Our long marches across the desert
Being Yacub's kids
For instincts born in caves of ice
All, each and every one, the souls of one God
Granted earthly existence to allow each to earn
The blessing of transcending, time-traveling throughout the universe
With the blessings and well-wishes of my fathers, prophets of my own
No search, no fear no mysteries
We inherit the power to turn nightmares into dreams
For those of us who come from less than enviable circumstances
Dreams, good dreams, sweet dreams, dreams come true
Truthful dreams, truthful dreams become life
Life becomes belief, belief becomes live!
Live the life you believe
The American dream, the black American dream, the universal dream
For the sake of the unwritten laws of humanity, I believe in God
I believe in my ancestors, I believe in my offsprings
I believe in Dr. Sebi, I believe we must stop Willie Lynch'n each other
I believe in the truth, truth
See you next lifetime"

I knock and I knock, uh, can I come inside?
I knock and I knock, girl, can I come inside?
I feel like it's home when I'm in between ya thighs
It's the joy and the pain and the bites and the brain

Tch-a-ch-tchk, c'mere boy, I said it's play-time
It's time to play with the mind of a slimmie
I don't wanna be a freak, but it's the dog in me
I don't pretend to be the open door roses type
I open the door for myself, and I close it right
In your face, now you wanna taste my food, what?
You got your own food, get a attitude
You get left, call the ref if you think it's foul
I ain't tryin' to hear that, so have a Coke and a smile
Cause after awhile, I'ma wanna get BUCKwild
And now months laters, I'ma say it ain't my child
I'm sterile girl, we ain't never did nothin'
Cause only you and I know that the Common Sense is bluffin
Little Miss Muffett, that's how the ball bounces
Sorry you gotta bounce the ball eight pounds and two ounces
That's how I'm livin', just like a rottweiler
When I was a shorty, I was a lot wilder
But then I got milder, and settled down with a harem
And when I can't bear em, I share em
You see it's like no, pass it off, pass pass the puss
I ain't a nerd, but WE'VE GOT BUSH
So cut the bush brat, and let's move it like a U-Haul
Forget the grindin shit, I ain't tryin' to get the blueball
Brrrrrrrrap bump me child, I'm speakin' upon the nitty gritty
I'm a dog -- HERE KITTY KITTY
...
Zippidy-doo-dah, a zippidy-zippidy-day
Unzip your zipper baby, and come my way
I'm Jack the Ripper, na-nah not Jack Tripper
Cause Three is not Company when your other two friends are thicker
So come one friend, come two friend, come all
United we stand, divide your legs so I can fall
In your bowl of cherries, Kerrie is so very
Thick thicker than the Dick Tom and Harry
Tom and Jerry (WHAT?) A Woody Woodpecker
You need body work, I work that body, I'm a bodywrecker
Intersector, I'm the nectar plus the plum
I manage to take advantage, cause some of these hoes are so dumb
If you got some, just an eensy BIT of game
Then it's safe to say it's that bet you can get a dame
I shoot, aim the same game, yo obedientally
Tell 'em that I get the drawers come off immediately
Here comes a nut slut, and we can do the Beat Street strut
And be that I'm a mutt -- so what?
No but if's or maybe baby, look who's talkin' to
It's true when I'm drunk I might bone anything that's walkin'
Down the street, watchin ladies
Nobody's watchin you, because you got a baby
I ain't tryin' to be a stepfather so I don't bother
Word to mommy dearest, I look farther
Down the road, to a road not taken
I'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care
A new flower, so Joe can take a shower
And get wet, and then jet
Like ah, seven-forty-seven
I tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven
Then I'm steppin, so when they call me, you'll hear
""Is Common there?"" Uh-uh, sorry
You got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack
Choppin down the cherry tree and never comin' back
It's like that and it'll be like that

92,Pyramids,2016,Black America Again (2016),Hip Hop,Common,"A nigga told me he only rhyme for 19-year-olds
Nigga, you should rhyme wherever the spirit goes
Here it goes, lyrical miracles
These are pyramids from the imperial
In theory, though, low end scenario
It's sound boy burial drove me to classic material
Aerial nights blew my mind out of stereotypes
For ethereal heights, I write like Pritchard
Invisible man, pictured below with the hieroglyphicable
Prolifical flow, on the walls where the mystics of Kemet would go
Supreme wisdom in my system is the kick in the door
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin' though
This is a ritual for those depicted as low
Now I passed life like I've been here before
The reincarnation of It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold
Us Back, coldest raps
For me the globe is like a culdesac
Around the world in a day, find forever and I stay
I'm from the weather where they spray
There's gotta be a better way, people dying everyday
Wonder what would heaven say? Devils need to get away
From Chevrolet to Escalade, from evergreen to the everglades
I kneel where the rebels pray
Seen fifty gray, but they need better shades
Niggas rhymin' like their whole style in retrograde
The escapade I'm on is like when the sun, moon and stars was born
It's hard to explain how these pyramids formed
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn
I arrived on the planet, never took the Southside for granted
Smoke a little, keep a high standard
The Roots are my niggas so I gotta fly bandwidth
Son of the sit-ins, you know who I stand with
Dude said I was a hero, I ain't nothing but a sandwich
A gluten-free one at that, close my eyes see my raps
My bio is feedback from what we need rap
On some Marshawn Lynch, let me run it back
And come with that new black spiritual
Every rap's a miracle, condition now critical
Game lack lyrical, we need black generals
Holy war, tap into you like Savion
But I'm a orator, the corduroy boy
Came the door-to-door name down the corridor of fame
I walk like an Egyptian on a mission to listen to conditions
Envision a vision of what we wishing
I've been commissioned to deprison the prism of your mind
Spit the wisdom of the one devine
Close encounter of the wonder kind, front a line
Shift the paradigm with a pair of rhymes
Style Bonnie Caylor, in the sweep with Caroline
Getting dressed up under pressure, Alabama shakes on Incense rising from the dresser, child of a fresher god
Influenced by the life of the former, Joanne Chesimard
Assata Shakur, I gotta do more
The light-skinned spook who got in the door
I gotta hit four, same thing Cassius Clay uses pottery for
I'm on a world tour with Muhammad the prophet, my man
And where we land the pyramids stand
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn"

Can't stay around too long before my tracks gonna catch me
When they do, I've got to be somewhere in LA
So I can look at the sun and get my thinking done
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
The last note I sang was indeed a false (?)
At some old and shabby bar, I never knew the name
But I knew I could and work that (?) all on my dreams
They tell me find that place, find that place
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Deep in my destination, trying to find my destination
With LA so far away and I'm soaking cold today
Constantly it's on my mind
I'm only halfway there, I'm not caring how much frustration
Oh, I've got to cross this nation
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
As the rain falls down from the heavens
Think of how far I came since '87
Took my hustle and made it a weapon
I was always told ""in the pain there's a blessing""
Mistakes that I made, they mirrored the lessons
Talking with God, I asked clearer questions
Dear Lord, is this what I'm destined for?
If so? Then what am I stressing for?
We tight, then why can't I let it go?
Everything gon' be all right, it's more than a metaphor
Let it rain 'cause it's ancestral
Cleanse my heart so they can see the best in you
Let it rain and come down visceral
For those no longer here in the physical
Let it rain 'cause it's like tears from you
Just like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do
Let it rain, I know that it's purposeful
So that it can service you and return to you
Let it rain, let the rain surround me
And never drown me, I was lost when it found me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream, a dream is where I'll be

Go to the bar to get around like a propeller
The barmaid's name is Stella
I'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me
Am I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party
Wanting y'all to give me body like Lati-fah
Niggas in the corner smoking that ree-fah
Seen a girl she had bottom like a spea-kah
Wanna put some hands on her like a prea-cha
Hmmmm! Well let me take my time

Seen that ass 'cause I got hindsight
She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight
'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt

Feels so good
I wanna touch somebody
So let's go, go
Wanna feel you close, keep touching

Security guard let me in 'cause I'm lord
Of finesse, the under, the rings, the dress
Code is to always stay fresh
Aware of a chest 'cause I stay abreast
She was extra cold, I'm here to de-congest
This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess
Knocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled
I'm locked into my mood, long as dude don't disturb my groove
I won't have to take it back to high school
Rewind! No need to take me back in time
Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline
'Cause what's in front of me is this behind
Up north she's thick, down south she's fine
Tuned in to what I'm doing
I'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing
The ladies, the ladies, a soldier of love like Sade
Showing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me
Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady
Dude got foul like crack in the 80s
Uh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this yo

Get the paper for the funnies, sports and the horoscope
On a curry goat, like flu stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short a rope
At the end of the road trip still, I'ma hold shit down like syndrome
Rappers are like Fox Brown tryin' to get home
Rarely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone
You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga, get gone
>From the wind storm, I've been told the street folklore
Body language spoke raw, don't talk to broads that are spoke for
That provokes war, stand out like cold sores
You claim that you hard but you wholecore
George Bush and CIA, you movin old or
Write like mention for publishin but you sold yours

Common:
Chicka-chicka-M-chicka-C-chicka-M and my
People call me Com and collective with prospective
I draw crowds, go off like car alarm sounds
Bomb like 'Nam sounds, tell yo bitch to calm down
Unless you want to get me skull askin me to take my hat off
On ill raps, I spit as if I had a bad cough
This Craig nigga stole a style and ain't take the tag off
Playin' yourself, you can't come with it, so you jack off
More heart than an artery, jones in my bones
To see thugs in harmony, it's gonna be some drama
If you try to sit Com down, this ain't comedy
Shit is real like a station property, crew is formin colonies
Commonly, I hear these rats thinkin' they mahogany
On every rap hook, soundin like a dog to me
In a reservoir, I flow and go
On and on, like Erykah or etcetera
Designated not to make hits but hit home
Out of proportion, hit makers get blown
(Scratching) (on the real)
Chorus: Dug Infinite
Common:
R and B studs kill me with they hardcore ballads
Love songs is violent, them niggaz whole style is silent
I hate to Staple the singers together, but in my head
It's been ringin' forever... and a day if you grew up on Marvin Gaye
Where all you singers booty this and freak me baby, it gets me
MCs be insecure, like them little hoe niggaz Immature
Wearin bobs, if I got a show in your town, I'm there with mob
Bukein niggaz and pullin broads is the apparent job
(Scratching) (on the real)
(Don't front) (echoed)"
97,Real People,2005,Be (2005),Hip Hop,Common,"Yeah, yeah, you know how me and 'Ye do
Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
Whatchu expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep 'em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggaz hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at 'em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggaz lives
Like UPN
It's real people
Yeah
For you and yours
Good music
Forever
Yeah
Rock on
We keep on
Uh... Yeah
Yeah, yeah
The real..."

Happy you agreed to hang out
Keep my head in the clouds
Keep them old names out your mouth
I can make you laugh out loud
We the only ones in the house
I can help you body wind down
Make this bottle disappear right now
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Let's stay in for the night
Maybe take a walk outside
Let's distance your pride
Me fall in love with your mind
If I look deep in your eyes
I can guess your zodiac sign
We ain't got nothing but time
We can just chill and unwind
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Freedom is the road less traveled by the multitude
The mood, it's the mode, it's the culture
Where there's food there's vultures
More Tony now, back then I was Sosa
I was sent like a penny in a loafer
The 2Pac Deepak Chopra
On a plane drinking wine with Oprah
When I missed the dap I ain't mean to insult her
Black Caesar, ey o amo roma
Tuto biene vino rosa
My dominican girl she loves soca
Take her to Minetta take her to the MOCA
Most of my friends at home that I'm close to
When they talk, put it on stone like a sculpture
Used to be a hooper, now I'm a hoper
Thoughts I bring to life like an ultra sound
I'm bound to the underground
Breaking walls down for the black and brown
A activist is active now
How far will you go for exposure?
Little homie in the paint tryna post up
Don't make me have to put you on a poster
Posterized by what I vocalize
Weathered the storm like I know the skies
Yeah we wear the mask but I know no disguise
These signs of the times are notarized
Written by the lord of the skies mortalized
In us, I got cold through cruel winters
Grandmas, defenders, Fred Hamptons agenda
Never been good with pretenders
They lying on the king like Simba
Dinner, branzino and red wine
Quality shared time
Fucking and laughing till its bed time
Red like my lips
Blue like past thoughts
Brown like your eyes
Just enough time
I can't think now
You're too close and I...
Might be too nice
These New York nights
Got me taking chances
I think your hands
Might look just right
If they held mine
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get two glasses
Now I'm swimming
Off the deep end
Heightened senses
No pretending
Make my head spin
I like dancing
In my bedroom
It's just me and you
Put that tape on
Tell me what you want
Let's just make time feel, long
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You could just stay for the night
Here, let me turn down the lights
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You can let go
Passion comes from down below
We go together like so
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Let's make a toast
That we both can make the most of this time

Reminding me of Sef, what?
Fat fat thick booty, what?
You say jack that big booty, yo
He say Ooh OH
I heard the boy he said Ooh OH
The party people he said Ooh OH
Uh uh uh uh yo yo yo
Check it, check it
Driftin on a memory, brought forth
From a fifth of Hennesey, as in times
Of eighty-nine they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggaz be fuckin' girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin over if he said, ""Dumb bitch""
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
Afterparties in Wendy's parkin lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped
Chorus: Chantay Savage
It's remind-ing... mmm whoa yeah
It's remind-ing... heyyeahhah, uh-huh
(Common)
Check it
Before these minds got ahold to some drugs
And start thinkin' they thugs
We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club
Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin'
Saved my day, dancin on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin
Over gossip, Kenwood bras was pourin
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
And started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin like Vice Lords, down to the taste
Not wantin to bring my lady around crew 'cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
At em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up
(Common)
There go the break
To get the break go, it go Ooh OH
Yeah, it go Ooh OH
You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Yo, check it, check it
Nowadays niggaz is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with em, 'cause they was born to trace
At times I contemplate movin to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace
Remindin me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin Twilight Tone tapes
Come home late callin broads hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes havin' bakeouts
We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out
Then everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin' in
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin in
Tim a be basin Mike down at I.I.T.
Rememberin numbers depended on how high I'd be
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill
My man Sef passed I feel hollow but still"

Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen
It's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madeline was back on video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes, I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense
Resurrection

I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades, I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas, now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruising Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
But it's my turn to go I gotta go and I'm gone with the storm

101,Retrospect for Life,1997,One Day It'll All Make Sense (1997),Hip Hop,Common,"Yo, we gotta start respectin life more y'all
You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself
Gotta see the God within him
Brothers gettin changed real quick over nothin
We losin too many of ours
Gotta recreate y'all
Yo, check it
Knowin you the best part of life
Do I have the right to take yours
'Cause I created you irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin the act I was a part of
The start of somethin'
I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin' I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach
Wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone I woulda fed this information I read
To someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
I'm sorry for takin your first breath, first step and first cry
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't wanna go through the drama of havin a baby's mama
Weekend visits and buyin J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve, I got to talk about them niggaz with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goi'n out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about
From now on, I'mma use self control instead of birth control
Cause $315 ain't worth your soul
$315 ain't worth your soul
$315 ain't worth it
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained 
Why didn't you stay?
Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin'
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin', more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe, havin' this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin' we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin' spendin the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers
but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our Parenthood to come from planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye, about family
Before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin, findin myself in my God
So I can discipline my son with my writin'
Not have a judge tellin me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame
I had a book of African names, case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin' the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Oh, I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
Now the situation's made things change 
Why, didn't you stay?
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Oh, I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
Now the situation's made things change
Stay, stay stay stay stay stay stay
Mmmmm, stayyy
Uh-uh
Ohh why didn't you stay?"
102,Rewind That,2014,Nobody's Smiling (2014),Hip Hop,Common,"Rewind that one time please
Rewind that one time please
Should it be, can it be simple?
Life is like the tempo of a No-I instrumental
Things that we been through define who we are now
Since ""Can I Borrow a Dollar?""
Ooh, I'm a star now, coming from Chi-town
We was the first to do it
Me, No I.D., Twilite Tone on the music
The city on our back, we was the opening act
Throw our tapes in the crowd, they throw 'em right back
But we stayed on track, they stayed on the tracks
I stayed on the raps till we made it on the map
By then, No I was my main guy
He and I was like Chi-town's Gang Starr
We had came far together, with a long way to go
Seeing a bigger picture, but now from different angles
Tangle of the hustling, survival in the game
Felt I had to leave home to be a household name
Show money low, needin' to stack fast
City did have my back, now it's a backlash
Was I a slave to the cash and wanting it so bad?
I just became a dad, rap was all I had
So I moved to New York, to make it pop
Did Like Water for Choc, that album changed a lot
But my man who I started with, wasn't a part of it
And his presence I didn't even acknowledge it
Knew I was wrong, he shoulda at least had a song
It wouldn't be me without No I.D., and Twilite Tone
Wishin' I could get that time back
Oh I care, yo man, rewind that
Me and Dion back in the zone, I'm doing shows with Tone
For the future of the Chi we gon' bring it back home
Rewind that and we could do it again
No I.D., Twilite Tone, where the story begin
Rewind that one time please
Rewind that one time please
This one's for my man J Dilla
As I say these words, my eyes fill up
'Cause wasn't non' realer than James Dewitt Yancey
So I'mma dedicate this to Dilla and his family
In Q-Tip's basement, I first met Jay Dee
I still remember the first beat he played me
He came to the Chi laid three that was crazy
Didn't even know me and gave 'em to me for free
I got the the D, ""peace yo, big love""
Cook up some hot shit, then go to the strip club
Then we made ""The Light"" and times got brighter
I said ""turn it up"" Jay'll take it higher
One day, I noticed he was tired quick
That's when I found out, Jay Dee was real sick
Things got worse before they got better
I said, ""Come to L.A. for peace and good weather""
We got an apartment just so we could spark it
MP in the front room, records in the closet
The beats got iller, but the sickness was still there
I'm wishing I could will him out of his wheelchair
It was hard for me to come home every day
And see my homie Jay's life fade away
I stayed away some times, in other words I ran
Till one day J brought me this TV stand
It was a gift so I couldn't refuse it
It came from his heart, I regret I didn't use it
The lupus got worse and, for what it's worth
I wanted him to have a Grammy before he left this earth
Wishing we could have that time back
Oh we can, yo man, rewind that
Rewind that one time please
Rewind that one time please
You never gone, you live forever through song
I feel it when I seem 'em with them Dilla shirts on
I know you're still shining, from heaven you watch me
Watch me put this Grammy on the stand you got me
That's the infinite team right there, me and Jay Dee, I'mma work with him whenever I can, 'cause he's just like, constantly progressing and growing. He's one of the greatest producers... greatest musicians of our time. For real, I really know that
Like, I used to be able to wake up in the morning and hear J Dilla beats being made. You know, I really, really used to walk by and be like, ""Man, I'm blessed."" I really felt that, like, during the time when he was making it, not like, I don't look back and have to say ""I was blessed, I know I was blessed."" But during that time I looked and say man, I'm gonna see Jay Dee make beats every day, you know, as long as he was healthy, he was making music
Common, okay for me, okay it's definitely not a Common album
But, it's Common"

You have come so far, you've got so far to go...
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
You have come so far, you've got so far to go..."
106,Soul By the Pound,1992,Can I Borrow a Dollar? (1992),Hip Hop,Common,"""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog
(Repeat 2X, then 4X faster)
I'm as bad bad, as Leroy Brown Brown
Yo I'm a pro pro, but not a noun noun
If you got beef beef, then you'll get ground ground
Cut up in soul soul, by the pound pound
I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound
Not a rebound, but like a hound, I get down down
Never wore a leash but I get loose
Producin somethin' fresher than fruits, got more soul than combat boots
Diggin two scoops of raisins for the troops out of some blazers
So amazin like Luther everyday Joe but not Bazooka
I used to be a hooper but now I troop to shoot a free flow
Me go with mi amigo, to see the Man named Chico
The legal alienaeno, I roll the instrumentals
Like Jack I be like Nimble never gentle to a bimbo
Not your sex symbol so save that soft stuff for the Care Bears
The way I freak funk Oh the Monkees sayin', ""Hell yeah""
Correction, ""Hell yes""; old folks wanna cuss
On how I walk talk and dress, they say my life's a mess
But I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight
Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake
Back to our regularly scheduled program, program
I am so damn flam, I slam a slam, BAM, I slam
Like Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian
Cause see I want it quiet in here...
I Mark a Markyiana a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases
Play like Christopher Williams 'cause I gotta keep my promises
To stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors
I'm tired of seein these non rappin' dancin motherfuckers
""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog
For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold
And reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male
And I can't tell, why for a hoe you grow a tail
And stop drinkin' ale, the booty probably smell
Ain't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid
Shit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid
Got doodoo skids on my paper 'cause I got rhymes up the ass
If I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache
I must ask what's goin' on with rap, white kids actin' black
It's like McDonald's sellin fatback
Get back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dancetracks
I'm hearin rap from Antrhax, my time the Caravan cracks
You're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter
When we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer
I'ma shoot a diss well like a fist to all these wack groups
Rhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops
I'm wonderin how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far
I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R
Or whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles
But you ain't G-in hip-hop, 'cause it's ours
""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog
It's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker
Think of thatI boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta
Is stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin to a stunk
If soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk
If if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff
It's not a myth about our dick width, I'm swift and I shoot the presents
In essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff
I'm a nigga with SOULLLLLLLLLL, my last name should be Smith-sonian
I'm gassin girls heads, just like petroleum
Get 'em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian
And turn off the lights this is the likes of a
Ticketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother
Got Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter
A chick is a chick that's how I treat her
Never go pop I'm not a two liter
A true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow
Whether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto
Wear em? No, share em? A hoe
I like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro
Cause U-A-C is family, much tighter than foundations
That holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound"" (4X)"
107,Soul Power,2002,Electric Circus (2002),Hip Hop,Common,"Yeah, for the world!
Keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going
Nigga breath can tell by how you rap you don't believe
Ain't hungry no mo' so off me you feed
I hustle at a speed between greed and need
On the streets where intuition and weed are breed
Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift
My rhyme the clip it's like the boom bip to tip (q)
In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way
Spending nites over Egypt to learn a brave day
Paint a picture of the ghetto like JJ
You the Ray J Of this rap world
I travel the globe with a black girl name Becky
Grand like Auto Theft 3
Style so developed the law can't arrest me
You walk with blood on your shirt
Like Jesse Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people
See through trying to out act Don Cheadle
I speak to original Hebrew s you know how we do
And bleed through the needle with truth
That needs no preview to proof its in the people
And how they react still in the business of smacking
Rappers is wack you had a dope track I guess opposites
Attract my mind state is black
Black like bernie mack no cowards soul power in the words we rap
Picks with fist, thick grease, dark nipples
My guy buy ice I search for the dark crystal
Racing for paper these broads is starter pistols
I spit through gang wars and strange doors
Out the sky flames pour the beats claims war
I see niggaz with flags who they waving them for?
I'm the nigga that you put the chain on the door for
The nigga that you started changing the laws for
Orator of hard-core and more
My raps the portal for the blue collar
Than made a hit and came up on a few dollars
I'd rather listen to silence then you holla
Borrowed your persona from the late that made dear mama
My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy
For truth you're a decoy
Common Sense is like the future of the Bee-boy
I fall down and get up like Don McClerken
Hit puss and listen to it whistle while I'm trerkin
Break it down like herb
The nympho of info I'm fucking what you heard
You ain't ready for war your stuck in the reserves
I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds
I been wanted to fly so now I do it with the words
For those in the fast-lane I show you how to merge
Get your own you see it's like home grown herb black economics
The people we serve with Soul Power"

La, la, la, la, la â€"" I know you, I know you...
I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be
Armorall flow 'cause he never get rusty
I ain't gotta say it, man dawg trust me
Bust somebody head, T.L.C. where was we?
Still rock the prada 'fore that, rock the Starter
Niggas out in Georgetown, the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up
We coming from the...
South (side), South (side)
South (side), South (side)
South (side), South (side)
South (side), Side of the Chi
The broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Burn CD's with no regard for the stars
Come to the grip with conflict, diamonds and the arts
Back in '94 they call me Chi-town's Nas
Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods
We even yo, you're still talking no cause
A conscious nigga with Mac like Steven Jobs
Your fly is open, McFly
The crowd is open I think I know why
I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like two dimes
People asking him, â€œDo you have any grey poupon?â€
You in the building but the buildings falling
You wouldn't be ballin' if your name is Spalding
My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans
Back in school, y'all niggas you should call in August
Summer sun it goes down but I'm still revolving
Southside 'bout to walk it out, I still get crawling
If rap was Harlem, I be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G. Rap, we're calling
With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Can't wait till they say, â€œYeah, he ran up at the Oscars.â€
Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em' played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexican don't love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters, Holla
We some true chi-town legends, accept no imposters
Uh, the un-American idol, tower like the Eiffel
Lean wit it, rock wit it, back like the disciples
Know when to use a bible, and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery, and 'Beat It' like Michael
Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku
I write to 'Do the Right Thing' like Spike do
Through conflict that's crucial and drama that's psycho
La, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
We're coming from the... Hey!
*Scratches*.. spice it up (la, la, la..)
Ya might have to spice it up
Spice it up, spice it up,
Take your life and...
Yo, we're coming from the... Hey!
We're coming from the... Hey!

110,Star *69 (PS With Love),2002,Electric Circus (2002),Hip Hop,Common,"Let's do it now, it's me and you
Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep?
Hold on. That's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I observe love
Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you
Erotica - Wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica - Can I come in your mind?
Erotica - Oh yes, our love must shine
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca
Wish on star 69, erotica...
So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?
Our love-reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns
Where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we (ah), feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me
Our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist
As I stare in your face
Your mouth half open
Your love I can taste
Embracin' you
Life: I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you
Erotica - Wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica - Can I come in your mind?
Erotica - Oh yes, our love must shine
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca
Slave to your loneliness
""Slave to your loneliness...""
Inside of loneliness
""Inside this (alt we bear)""
With love of loneliness
""With thoughts of loneliness""
Enslaved by loneliness
I want you to come
Inside your mind
And find a place
Nasty and kind
This is where
Our desires grind
And where they peak
Is most divine
A place and time
I hope we reach together
You are my queen
And freak forever
I feel you in-side my stomach
My body shakes...
Erotica - Wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica - Can I come in your mind?
Erotica - Oh yes, our love must shine
Erotica - Wish on star 69

Get in or get out
I'm standing by myself
In your room, It's so crowded
Just let me out:
Just let me out
Been through it a thousand times before

I won't regret this anymore
All the songs have been sung
All the wrongs have been done
Time now for
Me to go
Time now for

Last Night I had a dream that I did not wake up
I lied in bed all night until my eyes would shut
I dreamed of you

Down da down da down down down what (x3)
Down da down check it check it
There was a Hardy boy mystery I was tryin' to solve
Can't understand who the fuck was involved
Back from a show I had came hopped off the plane
In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame
My God came and grabbed in something less than a Caddy
Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby
As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built
By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled
I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart nailed
In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt
My mind started swingin' and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggaz is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town
Not too many people, I guess the word got around
The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound
Must have came during the day when at work, they was found
At the mount I stand folded than tie
Askin who done it
Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked
About to go wild hunted
Whoever did it had the nerve to chill and get blunted
And left a roach in the ash tray, I had cleaned out the last day
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
With the beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast
I'm kickin what shit was left all around the house
Thinkin' whoever came in on me is out
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, yes it is
(What can I do?)
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, hear me now
(What can I do?)
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, yes it is
(What can I do?)
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, hear me y'all
(What can I do?)"
113,Stolen Moments Pt. II,1997,One Day It'll All Make Sense (1997),Hip Hop,Common,"Black Thought:
It's a frantic situation (x7)
Common:
Extra salty 'cause whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me
Out of snappin, my God tried to talk me
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song
The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone
But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around
Day before I broke out, niggaz was over my crib gettin' smoked out
No tellin' who had the place scoped out
Donnie brought over some niggaz I didn't know
I'm askin, who are you, they said I'm with the Mo
If it was them, soon I will collide with them
And they better not be rockin' no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car, he would know
Now, it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib
To have the set of keys but that I wasn't tryin' to believe
But I could have put it past him or those other bastards
It would be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it
'Cause whoever did ain't gon admit it
The blunted dirty dishes is my only exhibit
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind it might surface
'Cause tellin' Allah, Joe is worthless (uh)
Chorus (x2): Black Thought
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are (x3)
Wherever you are, whoever you are
Check it out"

Hey, who dat? Check it, what
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are (x2)
Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are
Common:
Fuck waitin under my skin, the situation is scrapin
Somewhat like the girl X-ratin
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacin
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breakin in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smokin' weed
Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch, she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegeterian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story, she was stickin
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike
Chances of him breakin in, chillin' and eatin
Are about as slim as he is though I knew where he lived
In his house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we roll, I told the guy, turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck
(Excerpt from a movie)
Just tell me why. Don't lie to me man, just tell me why
It's the money, all right?
Just tell me why
It's the fuckin' money, all right?

115,Sum Shit I Wrote,1994,Resurrection (1994),Hip Hop,Common,"Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot
Groove is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it
What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing
On my own two, down with my own crew
Toe cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off
When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a massouse
I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight
When it's time for some action I get Red's ""Tonight's Da Night""
An eye for an eye, a life for his wife
Dissected I'm on some hi-tech shit computers want to bite
Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct
I'm with the fam and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links
And if knowledge is the key, goddammit I'm the locksmith
Started a missionary way on my life, the mic I rust like bostage
I switch styles like a channel with controls that are remote
Engage in a page, and with words I elope
Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the viles
Anti-Nazi when I rocks like a Z-28
At any rate, brothers gain interest because I loaned them microphones
They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own
It's like that, coming from the go rapper
I wanna bone Jada Pinkett and that hoe Patra
So keep on, and you don't, now come on
Ah keep on, and you don't
Sometime when I'm alone in my room I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme
And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it, I get charged
Like a nigga in position with the stolen card the credit
Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit
My mellows call me ""Never"", they be like ""Never's going to get it""
Never's too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics
That's why cats be like ""Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!""
Other studs come through to see what I am up to
They be on the dick of crew that be giving us sweet and buying us fruit
Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out because they look
Rest in peace to ?Heavena?, washing tons of rappers like Booker
Tee told me ""You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world""
How you going to come off with the style that's thourough?
It's like that, keep on, ha ha
It's like that, keep on
My foundation is in black block of niggas that rock they hat cock
I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox
Back I got my rap, now get your glock out the black face
Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rat race is a rat race
Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you hip-hop
You sorry excuse for funk rap
Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that
The real shit's starting to come back
The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack
I started eating cat when I was 10
Before dinner I was getting big dog like Glen Robinson
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
But comes a time when you gotta get off of that booty
The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie
But living in the big city but I still like Tootie 'cause she got big titties
My style is steep, I write rhymes on the incline
Splat guts plus fat nuts and lay up like a crib line
I'm slamming, jamming on the one
I'm a bad man, you're just a good son, come on"

That's what I do

How can I say this, fuck it I'm the greatest
I am the A-list for all these great debaters
A lot of y'all nah nah, forgot now who I am
The '87 nigga used to rah rah in the jam
Aw yeah, we put them things in the air
When I drop a single, it's really like a pair
Of Air Jordans, important to the culture
If you ain't true to it, cállate la boca
Get my drink on like a coaster
Post up on the wall that Mike used to live off
Hip-hop Master Cleansin', I'mma get my shit off
Rollin' in a Maserati Gran with the lid off
I bit all like a monster, live nigga this is my encore
Encore, encore, I rhyme for the commoners
My name synonymous with prominence
I'm to Hip-Hop what Obama is to politics

Da da man at work, I make my own lane
I'm the franchise so I rock my own chain
No I said give 'em that 80′s cocaine
Somethin' raw, something pure so I stayed in that vein
The hero that he know, that he cold
Like when it's below in the G.O., wipe ya feet off in the Regal
I'm king, observe the throne and the dream
I have it, supreme like mathematics
Yeah, a breath of fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts
Pro black magic, this is semi-automatic
Rap we won't jam in traffic
The game need direction, I'm here to map it
Uh, some people say that they be missing creativity
But when it come to hip-hop, it begins and ends with me
Sweet
(Outro: Common)
You know man, you should know where I come from
You should know who I am nigga
You should never wanna go against me
You know man, you too soft for that man
I be seeing you man, I see it in your eyes man
You ain't the type of nigga that could go against me
You get in my presence you gon' feel like a little ho
You ain't a man yet, you tryna be somebody else
Man, be yourself man, you come around my crib, you get your shit took
Huh! Wherever you go, you probably be overseas in Europe and get yo shit took
You's a ho, you know you sweet
Ain't nothing you can do man, people see that man
Broads be seeing you sweet
Done wit' you muthafuckas, it's over for you
It's over for you
It's over, sweet muthafucka"

Verse Two:
I be kickin it with the doubly-dope rhymer
I'm trippin-and-dippin-and-slippin with the rhyme like Sli-mer
(Who ya gonna call?) Ghostbuster
I'm pee-wee we stole, and I'm just a
Hustler, I tried to scheme for a sec
But the record got wreck, tried to write a bad check
So I checked myself, before self got buck
Wild, tried to live how I had to fluctuate
To a snake, and metriculate, yo I had to elevate
You can tell it's great, 'cause I'm state
Of 87, the South side of Chicago
Five-oh-one come follow me yo, everywhere that I go
And I know I ain't did nothin' (hell naw)
The district think I be just a lil trick kid frontin
U Ak got my back if there's any contact
In the back is a track from Immenslope soul cat
And it's phat, sorta like Oprah before she lost weight

And I'm all in a state of ease, utopia
I'm the Spiderman, givin' bug MC's arachnaphobia

A hubbeda hula hoop, a hubbeda alley oop to Coop
I gots the Magic, but I'm not a Laker

Break her arm and feather, whippin the wonder when she activates
Hold up! My jaws are in my crack, (aight) pass the tape
Time to activate, and ejaculate
This is the beauty of where I'm in a state
I meant to say demonstrate
I'm in a state, where I've had too much eight, ball
In the corner pocket, count em, buck it
A chicken, a finger-lickin' with a finger-bone
C'mon I'm on a roll, stippedy stutter-roll
Owah-owah-owah-owah Ayatoll
Of Khomein, my domain is infinite
Ya got trouble, well you need to get some dick
And to the hip-hop shop, the future shock

She walk into the court her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla so she love them
Looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed
(Sample)
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
(Common)
Fear in her chest her face in tears, had her man's back he was facing years
In her name though the place was his
They trying to take everything except the kids
But years she been through stumbling fights
While he trying to hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed
(Sample)
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
(Common)
The judge called for order the court reporter makin' her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him, she could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him, using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder, and gun possession
As they read back her confession she screamed
(Sample)
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
(Common)
The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
He stated, he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime- the queenpin...
(Sample)
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away

119,The 6th Sense,2000,Like Water for Chocolate (2000),Hip Hop,Common,"The revolution will not be televised
The revolution is here
Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music from the soul, y'all
Yeah, check it, yo
The perseverance of a rebel, I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that
This is rap for real, something you feel
(And you know, yes you know)
This is rap for real, something you feel
(And you know, yes you know)
This is rap for real, something you feel
(Hey, hey)
This is rap, this is rap for real
(And you know, yes you know)
This is rap for the black people
In front of two-inch glass and Arabs, I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie, I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I want to save children
Dealing with alcoholism and Afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit
(And you know, yes you know)
This is rap for real, something you feel
(And you know, yes you know)
This is rap for the black people
(Hey, hey)
This is rap, this is rap for real
(And you know, yes you know)
This is rap for real
Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, sat by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective
Though some of that shit y'all pop to it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like
(And you know, yes you know)
This is rap for real, something you feel
(And you know, yes you know)
This is rap for real, something you feel
(Hey, hey)
This is rap, this is rap for real
(And you know, yes you know)
This is rap for the black people

I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us
(Verse 1: Common)
These are the words of a believer
Achiever, leader of the globe
Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle
Walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and it's process
Birth of a son, death of another
With love I caress both mothers
And told 'em, who's in control is the one that's above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
It's tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us?
Look at the picture, hard not to blame us
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we haven't taught them?
Is it what we talking, we really ain't walking?
Dues hustlers pay, how much did it cost 'em?
Find myself on the same corner that we lost 'em
Real talking, in they ear like a walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner to the world
When I see them, I see my baby girl
Believe!
(Verse 2: Common)
The lord lives among us, the younguns hunger
Become a means to get it by any ways nece-
-Ssary, under pressure, children feeling lesser
With the steel up on the dresser killin' will aggressors
Destiny's children survivors, soldiers
In front of buildings they eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons, sirens, holsters
That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning, shawty's know to keep learning
Lesson's in our life are like stripes that we earning
Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest
That seems beyond us, even through the unseen
I know that God watches
From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us
The prophets, nothing can stop us
Believe!"
121,The Corner,2005,Be (2005),Hip Hop,Common,"Verse 1:(Common)
Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they soles, niggaz holdin' they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo'
We know where to go, niggaz rollin' in droves
They shoot the wrong way, 'cause they ain't know and they goes
The streets ain't safe 'cause they ain't knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners
(Kanye West)
I wish I could give you this feelin'
I wish I could give this feelin'
On the corners niggaz rob or kill
And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?
(Spoken: The Last Poets)
We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and
Powder blue profiles glorifying them
Verse 2: (Common)
Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right
Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype
Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?)
Its steep life, coming up where niggaz is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong 'cause its hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner
(Kanye West)
I wish I could give you this feelin'
I wish I could give this feelin'
On the corners niggaz rob or kill
And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?
(Spoken: The Last Poets)
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful
Verse 3: (Common)
Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this
The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is
It's so hot that niggaz burn to live
The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners
(Kanye West)
I wish I could give you this feelin'
I wish I could give this feelin'
On the corners niggaz rob or kill
And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?
(Spoken: The Last Poets)
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner"
122,The Day Women Took Over,2016,Black America Again (2016),Hip Hop,Common,"There's something 'bout this day that seem good to me
When people I ain't like is showin' love to me
Good food and the mood and the hood is free
Peace and free is the frequency
This is the day women took over
No longer over your shoulder do you have to look over
Imagine, war is now over
Mothers get medals for being courageous soldiers
On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa
The mayor, the shah is Liz Dozier
Hoods feel safer, families feel closer
We all drunk in love with no need to be sober
Ladies get their hair done, and men, we notice
You get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest
Prices, chivalry is no longer lifeless
We openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again
Things are merry, there's more marryin'
Monthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian
For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows
Depictin' women as ignorant simple hoes
It's more love songs from the radio
Respect for the ladies, you can hear it in the flow
Egos aside, for each other we rise
Since they done give us a life, the whole world feel alive
Oh, when women take over the world
Oh, every woman, boy and girl
Oh, maybe one day, we will see
Peace and unity the way it's meant to be
The day women took over, let it continue
Now women get paid as much as men do
Dr. Angelou's lookin' from Heaven's window
Tellin' young girls phenomenal woman is in you
Body is a temple, men don't pray
Mother earth's arms around you sayin' it's okay
Toilet seats down, that's a no-brainer
Monuments in Washington of Fanny Lou Hamer
Harriet, a soldier of truth is marchin' on
Women preachers and world leaders, it now the norm
Healthcare, payin' for nails, jails and fill-ins
Intellectual buildin', intersexual healin'
No stickin' movers, and no quick shooters
After 15 minutes, callin' you a Uber
The New World Order is fathers lovin' their daughters
And baby's mamas supported and ladies gettin' courted
In court, kids can't be tried as adults
And women, they called B's because they a boss
In all shapes and sizes, beauty is recognized
Goddess and queens is what we use to describe
Now Michelle Alexander wrote the new constitution
Beyoncé made the music for the revolution
Imagine it, a world more compassionate
The malice of the feminine and masculine, I'm askin' if
Oh, what if women took over the world
Oh, every woman, boy and girl
Oh, maybe one day, we will see
Peace and unity the way it's meant to be"

My name is Common, No I.D
Ferrari Testas, Armani dressers
Exquisite thick bitches that body bless us
Rest assured, we getting festive in Miami now
Told my nigga Ye, I'm about to win the Grammys now
Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now
We celebrate with shots of the hate because we got love
It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Going through the airport with more lye than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero, I'll drop out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening roads for Omoye and Amina
I'm a dreamer
It's for the world, world, world, world, world
Dream on
We take, uh, we make, uh, paper
And build skyscrapers
Walking on water, building my faith up
Niggas with no heart, I'm the pacemaker
Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them
Career ain't random, make anthems, streets chant them
Rock roles like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing, with wolves and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
It's Common, I'm high above standard
Fly nigga, keep my feet planted
To rock the planet, I don't stop for panic
Maybe I'm a hopeless Hip-Hop romantic
I'm a dreamer
He introduced me, I stepped to the podium
Said peace, gave thanks to the holy one
Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second
The youth, the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Feeling like the world, the world is at my fingers
'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now it's gold records, and I'm on silver screens
At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream
To the dreamers
If I dream you're here
And you dream I'm there
We'll be nowhere near
You should just come here
If I wake you up
Only difference is
You can live the dream
Just believe in it
(Maya Angelou)
Once you find your shoulders dropping
And your speech gets slow and hazy
You better change your way of being
Before you found your brain got lazy
You can build a better future when you join the winning team
If you desire a bright tomorrow, you must build a brighter dream
Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
Know that history holds more than it seems
We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream
From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
And stood half naked on auction blocks
From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
And were mis-named on Ellis island
From South America and Mexico, from Asia, they labored in sweat shops
From all over the world, they came to America
Many shivering in rags, and still they dared to dream
Let us dream for today and for tomorrow
Let us dare to dream"

It's Common Sense! With Kanye West!
On the Dave Chappelle Show!
Everybody gotta eat right?
It's the food baby!

And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money coming slow, but a least a - know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)
(Verse - Common)
You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it ""Jump Off"" like Kim and them
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them
Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him
(Verse - Common)
It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems
Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts
We never fall short, wit us it's Our Force like And 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe
Though I know to grow a - gotta learn to let go
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind
Po' livin' in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jobs get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!
(Bridge - Kanye West)
I - I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my - away
You can't front on me
I - no I can't let it ride
No no not tonight
See I can't run away or put my - away
You can't front on me

Gotta be in it to win it.
I never come lame type chillin' in the game.

Raised by game
Where niggas ain't fazed by fame.
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain.
Stay in your lane
Broke back ain't the way of the game.
My brainstorm is like a stay in the rain.
My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game
You was hot but can ya stand the flame.
Ghetto pain and windows crack.
The fist is like a symbol for black
Can tell the real by how the interact
In the middle of whack my soul stick to a track
Kickback records get kicked to the back
I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his
Child in a good school and know what her gift is
It's global warming, the world is shifting
Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bithin-ass rich kids
Who don't know in life you gotta go the distance
Whether yoga or doja, we all get lifted in the game.
(Verse Two)
I never kissed that ass of the masters
I'm the black molasses
Thick and I last
Past these rap bastards
They try to box me in like Cassius Clay
Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted
Opposing the fascist
Got cuts and got gashes, scratches over third eyelashes
Punchlines are like jab hits to rappers
Whose careers now ashes
It's too many slashes in their name
Came in the game
From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress
I seen 'em dashing smash hits
I yell run nigga run
While I cook up classics
The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets
Making it hard for real hustlers
Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend
Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game.
(Verse Three)
I just wanna be like Akeelah, an achiever
From the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure
Selling weed out of cleaners
From rocks to barber shops and beamers
Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena
The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled
Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh
Good bring business to the hood like Harold's
Find your own, walking by themselves in the street
The young die of cancer
I stopped eating meat
Greet the gods on 87th street like peace
Even though it's, got 'em facing the east
The game ain't tasting as sweet
Cats flow is still, and his complacent with beats
My radio station is deep, so eff em
Progression, counting paper and blessings in the game"

Where times is hard, hard times we embrace
Everybody want a yard, 'cause a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan
The hustle is hollarin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollarin'
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to prophet like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliament
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle
[Common] Just put it in your back and hustle
The paper's stacked so hustle
[Omar] Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that

Bill collecters and the roaches working your nerves
It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy
To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toys
So he can come so just work murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Everytime you see a head in my lap you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me to do my duty
Only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white AND 1's new sneaks

Whatever the dreams, stay on ya deem the world is ours, it's the hustle

127,The Light,2000,Like Water for Chocolate (2000),Hip Hop,Common,"Yo, I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a luh like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered - for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelin's I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matching shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the Most High
Regardless of what happen
On Him let's rely
There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yo, yo, check it
It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
Where sex and a tingle is where they assumin it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through I see that all
Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray everyday more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family - love ain't simple
Why can't it be anythin worth havin you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine
There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh darlin
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yeah, yo, yo, check it
It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh
Suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right, I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-d-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you, peace
There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Take my chances, before they pass
Pass, pass, pass me by, oh darlin
You need to look at the other side
You'll agree"
128,The Neighborhood,2014,Nobody's Smiling (2014),Hip Hop,Common,":
Thousand lives ago
We were young and we didn't know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice
Headed back to the light
But be careful don't drown in the gold
I know it glows but it's cold
I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair
:
Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones?
And Four CHs, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces
The concrete matrix, street organizations
They gave violations, hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces
The hustlers was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us
The era of Reagan, the terror of Bush
Crack babies, momma's a push, we were the products of Bush
I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
A bad ho to bee-bee-bee do me, you heard of Flukey
Stokes, it was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation
Diamonds, blinding us of real shit we facin'
Forties wasted on 'ceased, Dion makin' the beats
When they air it out on at the parties we escapin' the heat
I could break it down like whatever you need
He squinted his face and rolled the weed
You know they don't see sometimes
That in the neighborhood
It's the exact same thing
It's the same thing over and over again
Feel me?
:
Have you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred?
Folly boy, O block, eastside
Where it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride
Can't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'?
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying
Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign
I've been out there three days and I got shot at three times
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind
I know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up
But they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper
Where I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major
Small crib, big fam, mom was workin', granny raised us
No food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit
Same niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with
Better watch out for that jump shot 'cause they will hit
Homie take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit
I came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it
Feds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean
You ain't never seen the shit that I seen

'Ye you know how we do, we do it for the people
And the struggles of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
While white folk focus on dogs and yoga
My people on the low end tryin' to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin, tryin' to get them custom rims
Law we ain't trustin them, thick broads we lustin them
Sick and tired of punchin it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touchin them

At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what, the people gonna see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beef seem to breed me
Nobody believe, until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doin' business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognized
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We my nigga, yours is my drama
Standin in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake

I got a bonus for the bitch that run up on us
I got a bonus for your bitch that run up on us
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
Uh, no time to sleep 'cause if you sleep you don't eat
Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet
Niggas livin' on the street while other niggas feast
Aight wit you it ain't aight wit me
Right, gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay fuckin' bitches many types
Yeah you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yup, stay turnin' these bitches out
Dick 'em down also dick 'em out
Throw somethin' down whenever my dick's out
They know me so they restructure and reroute
They know me from Washington to down south
All the way to London to my nigga Common house
Right, it's like a game we never play out, out, out, out...
Nigga no doubt, nigga get live or get knocked the fuck out
Word up, just be about what you about dogg

I'm 'bout to let my mind float
(Com, say it)
Get your third eye poked
Fuck game, I assemble dope...
Ness, a nigga that's fresh as the 'fess
Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your B I, feel it in her breasts
Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreamin' when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
Still doin' this shit like dude in wild style
Invitin wack niggas to dinner
I ""Trick Daddy"" emcees and I don't know, ""Nann Nigga""
Who can take it where I take it
You better go into God like Mase did
Leavin' crowds complacent
I move 'em above clouds whether on some ?surface the earth? shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body
Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want no one to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy, niggas tryin' to clone us
You know us, Thelonious, super microphone
You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real
Ay, it's like a ritual
You been invited let the ?? stimulate the place
With the grace, nevertheless, I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for ???????
Hurtin' like a ?? in that ass, like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word, 'cause it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Darken the line and your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art, never go astray
Word is bond
Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucka nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious
Ownin this rap shit, super microphonist, and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkiss
You want this, so MJ kept sayin' the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime, ""Off The Wall"" wit mines
I'm grabbin my balls when I rhyme, nine nines bustin' plus
Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex
You ain't on my mind I'm thinkin' 'bout paychecks
Niggas large like an Adex Avirex jacket
Yo the gods they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my man's is somethin' like the Source Sports
We gettin' money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
You funny doo, 'cause really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should have let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday
Thelonious niggas, if you testin us we get you laid back
Show you the definition of a pay back"

We say the facts and if, they lie...
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't knowwwww
(Verse 1: Common)
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin' Derick, ""Tell Kara get us a show""
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga wit dough
They say ""You ripped"" ""Wow..."" Yeah, that's what they say
My niggaz couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say ""Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes""
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J
(Verse 2: Kanye West)
Ah... The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breath it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin' ""Damn, Yay snapped wit this beat!""
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo ask 'em how do it feel!
My best friends worry 'bout me
'Cause they know when you famous/fame-ass
And you had made cash the media aims at us and you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin' I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacate where it ain't no channels
But it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon check myself in - again
(Chorus) Kanye West: ""Uh!"" [hey!]
(Verse 3: Common)
They say ""Dude think he righteous""
I write just to free minds, from Stoney to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or Isis
They say ""life is a game,"" so I play hard
Writin for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job
They say ""Sef kept the hood together""
I tell the young, ""We can't play the hood forever""
Play my cards right, they say I went to left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim ""King"" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ's
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say ""The crochet pants and the sweater was wack""
Seen ""The Corner"", now they say ""That nigga's back,"" uh..."

Spaces and places you been, time travelin *echoes*
Time travelin *echoes*
Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime
Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine
Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface
Though my sex drive like a car chase
More than a uh, it's the piece of mind I chase
Stakes are high, like my uncle is
We both got problems, he never confronted his
Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat
And paint a picture, raw like the first coat
Send my old man a note to keep his phone on
My little 'causell know cheap tricks are homegrown
Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone
Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin' my palms
Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my god caught a case 'cause he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down
Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross
Many paid dues, but few knew the costs
I ran through the Moss like Randy
Touchindown wit God, close friends, and family
Recognize the voice in the wilderness
Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this
Time travelin, took my time in hand
My rhyme learn and plan
Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man
Some walk but never learn to stand
Still, afraid to expand what they feel
I'm dealin' wit, wakes, marriages
ATM's, Ericsson's
Loud niggas that whisper carelessness
If we livin' in Revelation
Why should the people of the sun have to run?
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
He ask why I hadn't been to see him
Really, I ain't have a good reason
He said, ""Rah, give back what you receivin""
In a race against time, I was caught
In the same game as you, but long live the sport
It's time travelin
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been
Time travelin *fades out* time travelin...
Time travelin *echoes*
Time travelin *echoes*
Yeah, yo wassup world, yo what's happening?
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend

I heard a white man's yes
Is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world
As a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention
And I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip
I watch the fat lady sing a song
On how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreamin' wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the walgreens is gone
Hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
Its hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave We afraid to the same streets that raised you
Can aid you. What other black births came suit
The rage up in harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with there mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child maybe
(Common)
He had game since he used to hoop at chattum
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black... maybe
(Common - talking)
When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from... from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged... you get laughed at... you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us... black maybe
Black maybe..."

A house is not a home unless we staying in it, stay committed
I used to get around, now I'm staying centered
Angels ascended, grounded, stay cemented
The mentality, we all casualties, I can't do this casually
Actually you challenge me to balance me
Pay dues and salaries, been through truce and fallacies
The unfamiliar (?) made me lose calories
In a house rewind playing Amy's ""Valerie""

Vibrant thing the way that Tip from Tribe would sing
So many things that you provide the king
You too fly, never should you hide your wings

Break them rules, break them laws, breaking through
Breaking walls, sacred thoughts
Are the oceans that we breaking 'cross
The truth is a naked cloth
No need to take it off, the weight is off
Love we making due is unbreakable, relatable
Stayed in you, relayed into the faith in you
You awaken to what fate can do
Fate is inescapable, super friends, we capable
To take it to a greater view they say is unattainable

Staring back into mine

She was a beautiful rose
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the dark room her life was exposed
Her picture of men, we walk on all fours
Heart opened and heart closed
Every now and then she sparkles
You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose
I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose
Even when the door close, there grows a new one
I told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one
Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him
Ok, sometimes from commitment, we do run
Rocking Lou Vuitton, said she focused on the Christian
I'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision
But not to be married with kids she was wishing
Shhh, till your soul just listen

She said daddy take me ice-skating
Looking at the rear-view, life's waiting for her
Gotta be there to support her
Can't really wait for a court order
She got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant
A lot of love inside, got to help guide it
Daddy will protect it, God will provide it
We all will be there so your soul ain't divided
Man, how quick she grows
Looking like her momma but she got my toes
I suppose it's the age that she really really need me
A lot of girls without, they become needy

Pound the ground we own the concrete jungle
Surround me loudly, wildly is how we came up
Think about the come up

Hair all done up, we can spend the summer together
But when the weather change, lady friend
You may be forever stranger lines seem to blur
