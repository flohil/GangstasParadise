Took her off the showroom floor, no money down
Near the Chrysler Building, the heart of Midtown
Two hundred horsepower under the hood
Junk in the trunk, that be far from damaged goods
Designer frames, the windshield's stay tinted
The most beautiful thing someone invented
A Wrangler had a sticker on the bumper
A sign in case tow trucks tried to dump her
Rear view mirror, that of Serena Williams
Staring with the crime and the look to kill 'em
Brushless showers and the Brazilian wax
Cash in the glove department, freeze from tax
Low mileage, on the odometer
A graduate, with more degrees than a thermometer
Spark plugs for great conversation
She would Focus on the finish line and destination
Steering in the right direction, made sure
I wore a seatbelt, and had airbags for protection
In her tank, she love to stash my tool
I kept it full, super unloaded fuel
She had a room full of skirts and rims
The old ones, used to swing off ropes, that often hung from limbs
A temp at the Ford Modeling Agency
Suburban area, where the Caucasians be
Her great grandfather was a Cherokee Indian
Exploring Navigator, traveling then begin
Sharpening his arrows on Plymouth Rock, commanding chief
Who weighs cattle, only selling the livestock
King of the Frontier, rider of thoroughbreds
He was just as sharp as a needle without thread
Legend in truth, but known to run the herds
His sons were Oldsmobiles who drink Thunderbird
Land Cruisers sitting on fertile soil
With equipment that ran off expensive oil
Folks bragging, said a horse pulled the Volkswagen
They love Mustang Sally and lolly gagging
Fished in Lake Tahoe, cooking Barracuda's
Hundred Impala's with the six shooters
From a long range with the dog Rover
It was something else to see him out and over
Some got caught in the Crossfire, a bunch of rabbits
Indicating these dudes should retire
One was oddball, rocking a sunroof
A gas guzzler, in his grill was one tooth
A strong Accent and a beard like Lincoln
Who hated the Golf course, but he love drinking
Avenger, used to pick up chicks
He had Magnums, that was laying tough but thick
Wore a Blazer, and where he used to hide the ruger
For encounters with the Jaguars and Cougars
A veteran move and salute, sing the anthem
In Accord with the plan, he was a Phantom
He had a fat lady, they called Hummer
And um, she needed bodywork for the whole summer
She had a few friends, who used to stay in the pound
Abandoned parking lots and junkyard down
Regulars in rest areas and truck stops
Cassette player, known to make the tape pop
Gold diggers, who wanted cream like well's Fargo
In Vegas, they circle around a Montecarlo
You know the snakes with the fangs of Vipers
Bloodsuckers, who will use the piss from hiking
Met the Cavaliers at the Outback Steakhouse
Chicken cutlet supreme, just for takeout
One of them was forced to live in Astoria
'Cause at the auction they had Crown Victoria
Since then, her friends charged with battery
Had her running off the sweets flattery
She kept a loud muffler, couldn't trust her
Police used to always pull over his duster
A pothead, who some called the Firebird
A foul mouth who could of used wiser words
Her man used to hustle and ran the crack corner
So insecure, he kept Low Jack on her
Peeping with his visors low, high beaming
Temper would accelerate, private eyes scheming
He would check his console for rubber
She would pass the inspection with flying colors
She would turn left, if he said right
On a cycle, he would often run a red light
His voice Echoed if she Dodged a Convoy
A previous owner, all he did was bone her
Some drove her crazy, she was just a loner
He had a leaking transmission fluid
Said it was an accident, didn't mean to do it
No insurance, but a grill to cage
She sobbed uncontrollably and still stayed
Another total Eclipse for the heart
Like the freezing weather that never gave her a start
Plus, he had a Sidekick in his garage
And if he needed a Boost, she would give him a charge
He was sentence for running an Escort service
Escaped from prison but made a few nervous
His baby mother and wife, the BMW
Number one on her list, who he brought trouble to
She done everything to regain her Liberty
Tried to be Audi, but went into delivery
Moved to Aspen, survived the Avalanche
A different Element, inside a cattle ranch
Far away when she changed the pattern
The distance was light from Mercury to Saturn"
1,1112,1999,Beneath the Surface (1999),Hip Hop,GZA,"Bobby said, ""Fuck spendin 50 on a whip, buy a clip""
Mental flip, we got a thousand tracks thought on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
You split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer, with extra compression
When sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalizes the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryin' to think you can match this
The portrait's too graphic
Panaramic view for you, stamp Wu
The feature gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We wrote block-tic checkpoints on your next joint
And who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay Murderous wordplay
Displayed, for killin' cascades
Throwin' bullets in the air to test wind and which way the cyclone spins
Counter on clockwise, still civilized
Kill spies on the wall,
That still flies all dies
Give no extension on the lynchin
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt, that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show, see the promoted for the dough
I'm takin', breakin his wax
Throw my shit on to perform my selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in revines and ditches
Underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reeds, the enemy walks above,
Clan remain subterranean mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude
Strikes Shatterin bulletproof
Helmets with scrap nail fragments of cell,
Inhale these venomous thoughs that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer at the hand
Of the Chief's command, volts is in
At 3 minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadenin the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound
You know what I'm sayin'?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris.
We talk about sex, money and drugs.
(Ruled by power.) And y'all cats don't know
What it's about. (Love and power.)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on.
Burnin desire, ebony eyes
Painted toe nails, legacys die
Drivin' by the well, egyption queens, arabian shieks
Are paid to knock off rich kings, for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands, sleepin' on silk pillows
Blood on they robes Disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolfs in black hoods, pull out they gats
Like magic wands, castin spells
Sendin niggaz to Hell Trappin they souls in realms
Baptize 'em with holy water
Springin on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters Silent nights over the dividers
A 1000 muslim bibles for the cobler
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'ma show you how thugs get down
Shoot outs, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files, describe them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders dyin' saints
Blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Dissolve it with your 100 proof liqour
Ha, I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatenin the lives of those who threaten me
Lessenin my chances of defeat by predeterminin the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter
After the third one I heard my words shall be bombed
Regardless to anything or anyone
Because I die by the gun, my life has just begun, thought I was livin' all alone
But I was wrong - this long road I have to travel
In countless battles these filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharoahs
Change to cattle I'm able to subtract the devil's arrow
Singin' at his eyes on the sparrow, mind narrow
2 positions, horoscopes and tarots
Hark harolds, angels and Christmas carols
Raven images hang from the mantels man made slaves
And modern day babbles Raw from Africa and golden ropes and sandles
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who man-handled us with leather whips and burnin candles
And rambled through our castle, leavin' niggaz shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
With to the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We went to Gretal and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackel
Children of my grand old daddy, have it
In mind were they lost in this wilderness blind"
2,4th Chamber,1995,Liquid Swords (1995),Hip Hop,GZA,"(Intro: LP version only, taken from the movie ""Shogun Assassin"" (1980))
Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
{*Baby gurgling*}
So... come boy, choose life or death
(Verse One: Ghostface Killah)
The only man a hoe wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83, rocked Taylor's
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner sitting wine niggaz sipping Apple Boone this ain't no white cartoon
'Cause I be ducking crazy spades
The kid hold white shit, like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas, rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Iron Man be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups, inflammable
Noriega, aiming knives which stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colours, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po, wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the Eighth
Built with Genghis Khan, the wreck suede Wally Don
(Verse Two: Killah Priest)
I judge wisely, as if nothing ever surprise me
Lounging, between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece, is like building stones in Greece
My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed, as my mind, roams the realm
My eye's the vision, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fits
I leave them split, like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips
(Verse Three: RZA)
Aiyyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building
No time to grab the gun they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent, from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence, and documents
On how they raped the continents, and it's the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes
Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chickenheads getting slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow
Rolling with the lambs
Twelve tribes a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions
(Verse Four:GZA)
The banks of G, all cream downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit cream
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
With his thump, tweaters hits like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggaz caught razor bumps
Scarred trying to figure who invented
This unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
'Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fuse"
3,7 Pounds,2007,Pro Tools (2007),Hip Hop,GZA,"Verse 1 (Gza)
Speakin' of this art form this slang is dangerous
MC's are like sperm cells, a gang of us
Fightin' to reach the egg
Bitin' and loose a leg
Odds are like one in ten million, a thin thread
One from a thousand speaks in his own voice
The other 999 imitates without choice
Never even knowing it
Until the going gets
Rough
See the amplified sample I've flowin' with
I grab the microphone, the unthinkable happens
See the rocket's red glare like the guns a' clappin'
They steel cage matchin' MC's is scrappin'
Not the UFC but my opponent's tappin'
So don't let a little bit of fear turn to hatred
I was sent as the savior to revive what was sacred
Also stop this uncalled-for behavior
Sylphic rap cats they lack taste and flavor
Got word from the wise to let it drop
Set this on fire, take aim and let it pop
Because, regardless to whom or what
Even with doors shut
I'm givin' 'em straight raw you're bringin' 'em more cut
Like Bolivian rock, your watered down hip hop
Rap so outta shape and far from tip-top
Pearls next to pebbles
Spoons against shovels
Dictators next to rebels and
Gods against Devils.
Verse 2 (Gza)
No time for backwards thinkin' let's think ahead,
If you wanna sleep when you awake, then make your bed
A lot of MCs came to see me on referrals
Not even knowing that they would undergo great perils
These cutting edge methods from the most specialized
Craftsmen, the last minute before the vessel flies
The lord of the art strikes a chord in your heart
Your ear love to hear the god rip the track apart
To me hip hop is like Einstein to science;
A match made in heaven, most likely an alliance
Complex individual that you dream of being
Intellectual charlatan, the all-high-seeing
Got an appetite for heat so then come and bite the beat, n'
Digest the rest and don't stress the part you couldn't eat."

(Intro: RZA)
Yeah, yeah, a special guest appearance
From the slums... yo, aiyo
(RZA)
I examine your diameter, third eye light the camera up
Be careful, I got four ninjas, inside your parameter
Perimeter, flame burst out all sides like Gamora
My poisonous is released, gas from the canister
Raise the black fist, we keep the earth on it's axis
I make a good day move slow like molasses
Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break I can't revive
In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four-five clip, filled with the spiral tip
(GZA)
I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggaz approach me
Like the blind, death, dumb, who mind was left numb
A non B-Boy nigga, couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started M.C.'ing I entered, the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I be coming with, too much to measure
With the math of an elder, and the steel of a welder
The path of tray, that I had laid down, to held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope
(RZA)
Supreme deluxe edition, CREAM with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison
Twenty two year old, dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun, and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body, now he stuck in another prison
(Raekwon)
When you see it, you better acknowledge, your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours
Pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw
Why try to fuck with these lecturers
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. Family and more, one!
(GZA)
They applause when I make my entrance
I move on 'em with age and experience, before I start the sentence
The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land
He blew out the belt drive, M.C.'s they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look, at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation
But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals, spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn
Them Clansmen, are the nucleus of hip-hop
There's no room for error, M.C.'s will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser
The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, till you're all gone
(Outro: chess sample)
The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces
And driven back, it is very dangerous
To make a raid with the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack"

Yo, check this out, my name is the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Youknowhatimsayin, when I rhyme, when I, when I get down for my crown
I come out crazy like a, like a tiger, or something, knowhatimsayin
No, no, nobody can even F' with me, straight up and down
You knowhatimsayin', so that's how we coming in, knowhatimsayin?
(From the heart of Medina, to the head, to the east
To the plaza houses, a/k/a the Mountain
To the rugged lands of Shaolin, yo
We rock all, all, all in together now
Got played, got fresh, up)
(GZA)
The world was bugging off this Wu-Tang nigga on the rock
That was just another spot on the muthafuckin' block
You forgot Cash Rule nigga? --- toss seven figures
He pull a trigger to make that account, get bigger
Had babies to feed, kept a bitch with need
Thousands shows booked, promoters on speed
His hands was in everything, including some pussy
From the Brazilian wax, to the uncombed bushy
From down state, psychiatric
Who tried to put a code on his brain until he cracked it
Now the media wanna view him like they knew him
And his head nurse, wanna sue him 'cause she blew him
Ever since he walked on stage, he was just a loose cannon
Wild drunk staggin', a nigga who kept standing
Class clown, who erase chalk from the board
The only choir member, that sing off chord, we were
(Chorus x2: GZA (w/ RZA))
(All, all, all in together now)
Kept the balance, stay dressed for the weather now
Battle M.C.'s, anywhere, whatever town
And remain victorious, in any ground
(GZA)
The All In Together Now, started in Bed-Stuy
Human beatbox specialist, who dressed fly
A half ounce of blow and a forty ounce drinker
Magnificent flow, critical thinker
Unique is one grain of sand from the beach
And had bitches eating out of his hand
He was intelligent, his style was relevant
I can name ten niggaz that stole an element
From the high speed chase to the court arraignments
All of the above, was entertainment
He caused earthquakes, just from experiments
Some thoughts got lost, not knowing where it went
His songs had a rep for many inducements
Giving birth to new styles, after recruitments
There's no replacement or any supplement
He was a new testament, what he said, what he meant, we were
(GZA)
The judge took a look at he, and threw the book at thee
The sentencing, would have made the average crook happy
They put him in a box, wrapped like a gift
In them straight jacket, watched by two, worked the shift
Gave him no phone calls, saw no sunlight
Like, Billie the Kid, in his last gun fight
Then days became weeks, weeks became months
Carved the calendar on the wall, with his front
The food pushed in, on the trays, looking sharp, in the cell
My hands covered with latex gloves
Cooks in the kitchen had laced his drinks
The wild ass physician, they was off the breaks
He got visits from shrinks who came in with ink-blots
Moving with they own plot, but the Dirt, he think not
He had nothing but time on his hands
As if he got him signed from the Clan, we were
(Outro: RZA (chess sample))
All, all, all, in together now
""All in together now!"" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
""All in together now!"" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
All, all, all, in together now
""All in together now!"" - Ol' Dirty Bastard

All I need is a beat, with a continuous loop
And a live vibe, that'll hypnotize like the flute
Along with something that's rugged by nature like the forest
Composed like the symphony without a chorus
A place with the path and trail that you follow
With the wood, where you drive your nails, but too hollow
Far from reality, with a slim chance of getting back
Even if you narrowly escape the hidden traps
Nothing but the driven raps written in my notebook
Inspired by the cap and the gown, that's on the coat hook
Prepare for the chemical rush, something new to cause
Your heart to bass, but it's tangable to touch
Associate with those who are consumed with beats
Produce fire, until they melt the room with heat
You know my ink lay all over the sheets, let us gather around
And form words, every time they meet
(Chorus: GZA)
Allah Be a Born, Cee Divine, Equality
Father, then after that, there's the G-O-D
He or Her, I Islam, then Justice
King of Kingdom, Love, Hell or Right, we still exist

Rule of Rulers, Self of Save, the Truth of the square, the same
Universe, Victory, Wisdom, Unknown/X, Why/Y
Zig Zag Zig, and now we're back home
(GZA)
I brought butter for the popcorn, dip for the chips
And ego for your trip, some scripts for you to flip
Corrections for mishaps, errors, or mistakes
Fly raps for beats, and pop and lock for breaks
A legend in my own lifetime, from one rhyme
That was specially designed, from the hook to bottom line
Shine's like a precious jewel, cut up in the workshop
With specialized handcrafted tools
Couldn't buy this hardware, so don't swipe your card there
Better yet, fold your hand, 'cause you holding the wrong pair
One hit wonders, get a little shine like flashlights
But when I drop the bomb and explode like gas pipes
A livewire, known as the dragon that spit fire
Verbal action, hot as the grease from deep fryers
Delivered in the perfect pitch, because hip hop
Is all in my genes/jeans, the pattern is seen in every stitch
(Chorus: GZA)
Allah Be a Born, Cee Divine, Equality
Father, then after that, there's the G-O-D
He or Her, I Islam, then Justice
King of Kingdom, Love, Hell or Right, we still exist
Master, Now in Cypher/O, Power's the Queen
Rule of Rulers, Self of Save, the Truth of the square, the same
Universe, Victory, Wisdom, Unknown/X, Why/Y

7,Amplified Sample,1999,Beneath the Surface (1999),Hip Hop,GZA,"Verse one:
The amplified sample, will trample, the leading cancel
That vacate your vessel
Guide this, strenuous as an arm wrestle
Move swift as light, a thousand years in one night
Then flight with insight
Everything I thought of, I saw it happen
Then I rose from the soil to sun blacken
Then came rao czars, left tracks and scarred
A pair of brightness of exploding stars
Gave me goods to taste
No ingredients to traced
And remained stuffed trying to figure the shape of space
No edge or boundary, released 2 rounds or 3
Intimidate my razor scrape, phony clown MC
The physical shatter from the blast
Pierclastic flow sets of a tower of ash
Through ignorance and misplaced trust your world's crushed
Too late to activate hyperspace of thrust
Even wearing camoflauge the analog at war
He seen his high beems
The father came in accompianed by deadly rain and when
Mentally indowed when lighting hit the crowd
The warm side crushed the barrier
The storm side destroyed your area
The amplified sample, will trample, the leading cancel
That vacate your vessel
The amplified sample, the amplified sample, the amplified sample
Will trample
The amplified sample, will trample, the leading cancel
That vacate your vessel

The amplified sample, the amplified
The amplified sample, will trample, the leading cancel

The amplified, the amplified

8,Animal Planet,2002,Legend of the Liquid Sword (2002),Hip Hop,GZA,"Welcome to the Jungle where the cat loves to scratch 
The rat squeals and the polar bear feasts on the blubber of seals 
The pack of wolves be scheming on a bunch of gazelles 
Where the leopards grab the wilderbeast down by it's tail 
You see the chimps they grow *hemps* they hustle and sling in trees 
Elephants for security that move tons of leaves 
The bluebirds arrest parrots that love to talk 
Of eagles that stalk fresh-water trout under the wing of the hawk 
You see the vultures pick the pocket of whatever remain 
In the brain we watch but a shadow of the lion's mane 
Whose roar is loud enough to take the stripes from a zebra 
He camouflage his bets in the spots of a cheetah 
Shouldn't gamble with a cheetah and not expect to get beat 
You silly goose you know he move fast on his feet 
Now you're neck deep in depth with a bunch of lone sharks 
So you move on a colony of ants with aardvarks, you see 
Most of the everglades was controlled by the gators 
It was crashed by the crocs who came years later 
See the locusts had swarmed with the bees, the tick moved with the fleas 
The dragonflies and the wasps shared with the seas 
The crab and the leeches sucked your blood flow 
And they laugh like hyenas when they out to catch dough 
See a million mosquitos from the West Nile 
Carrying the virus that made the boars less wild 
It's like the jungle sometimes 
It's like the jungle sometimes 
It's like the jungle sometimes 
It's like the jungle sometimes 
Out of fear of the deer watch for the eye of the tiger 
The Clutch from the Cobra and the venomous viper 
Boa-constrictors that cut your circulation 
Mosts of their prey and die from broke bones and suffocation 
The owls are private eyes that watch from the bark 
Black panthers are the militant who strike in the dark 
Porcupines had a rep' for sticking everything that moved 
In areas that the rhinos and hippos approved 
And the giraffe was a look-out for gorillas in the mist 
And the bats use their sonar to guide and assist 
Those pelicans who smuggle contraband for the whale 
While the skunks spray the scent to keep the dogs off the trail 
The scorpion set up a sting for sly foxes 
That use stool pigeons just to keep them in the boxes 
While the black widow laid a web for the bachelor 
Like daddy-long-leg and his hype man, tarantula 
They both prey on grasshoppers beetles and flies 
And they all become instant meals the moment it dies 
What costs little, is a little worth 
So some lose they lives wandering on the wrong turf 
From birth they grow up walking the thin line 
It's like the jungle sometimes 
It's like the jungle sometimes
It's like the jungle sometimes 
It's like the jungle sometimes 
It's like the jungle sometimes"
9,Auto Bio,2002,Legend of the Liquid Sword (2002),Hip Hop,GZA,"I was born, with the mic in my hand
Then I took it from Medina, to the S.I. land
I pulled up on the block, go out the truck, it was the first of pit stops
The era of the spinnin' tops, the birth of hip hop
That was somethin' I had identified with
So I made it my point to exploit this fly gift then
Myself and RZA made trips to the B.X.
A mass of ferocious M.C.'s and talent T-Rex
Giants in every ways, rap flows for every day
We knew we would get a reward for the price to pay
The basic training was beyond entertainment
Just the caters of the verbal expressions, self explainin'
Were my boots out in constant walks across the borough
Tore the troops out the frame when they challenge the most thorough
From well concealed firing positions we let off the most
Dangerous with that, slang that just shatter the coast
They say I rhyme like the bank that stop
Cause M.C.'s be more shook then the dice that drop
Especially if I'm rollin', then the point is definitely proven
'Cause with the GZA holdin', that keep a nigga movin'
I walk Broadway, from Quincy to Myrtle
Back to Quincy, cut careers whatever the expense be
They heard the Legend, run to the reverend
With headaches and blackouts, worse then severe seven
And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from...
They says the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood
Till it's understood...
We still search through the crates of songs that just breaks
At times we play legendary battles on tapes
Unlikely confrontation with a clash of swords
In a G that was stored, be rain that just poured
On cats and dogs, water that flooded the stance
The violence and nature had trigged the violence of man
That was bloodshed, from which said, audible threats
Publicize regrets, wanted alive or dead
A hand full recovered from the dramatic plunge
While the rest kept babblin' and speakin' in tongues
Since the competition already slaked them in a scrimmage
He continued to tarnish that already faded image
Any sport, when they come short, majors don't need 'em
Then they broke, lose they homes, lively hood and freedom
The rhyme could be a blunt object that make you choke
Like too many tokes, that'll recharge in growth
This Witty Unpredictable Talent or Natural Game
With non added of slang, it's all actual fact
The high roller knock the chip off the shoulder
Strike like the perfect bowler, with catastrophic damage
My other's hard to vanish, punishment, swift to sudden
Unparalleled advantage, brought to a level
Where you froze and can't speak
Trapped in the frigid temperatures of that peak
And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from...
They says the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood
Till it's understood..."
10,B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth),1995,Liquid Swords (1995),Hip Hop,GZA,"The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth (3X)
Chorus: repeat 2X
Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last, and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving Earth
Verse One:
Knowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve
I loved doing right, but I was trapped in hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears, but, yo, my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth, but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was payin', plus the prayin'
I didn't like staying 'cause of busybodies and dizzy hotties
That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up lookin' at loot, butt, and thighs
Durin' the service, he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon but never followed men
'Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
Space oblivion, or the abyss
With no trace of trivia, left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb, and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave was the sect of the swine
When the Bible, it condemned the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
But we used to wear a turban, but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie
No hocus-pocus 'cause I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the ryhme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
Those who sit home or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide
The basic instructions before leaving Earth
Verse Two:
I strolled through the books of Job to unfold
And open Bibles instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya-that's how the devil's fooled ya
See, look into my eyes, brethren-that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the Bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take
I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted wth foolish men
And women with wicked minds who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom
Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I perferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learned Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam
The white image, of Christ is really Cesare Borgia
And, uh, the second son of Pope Alexander VI of Rome
And once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome
I prophesied to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation-the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin' evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness
Peace to my nephew Marcus
The basic instructions before leaving Earth
Chorus: repeat to fade"
11,Beneath the Surface,1999,Beneath the Surface (1999),Hip Hop,GZA,"On a man-made lake, there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters couldn't figure-8 twice
At 16, uncut, direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result, death by the bolt
In a vote, it spoke about the average loss commission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
It kept the jury quiet and now a riot will form
While satanic man now hang in his dorm
I swing, on you fake radio personalities
Boost ya ratings, but hypes behind casualties
Fire shots, for low-pressure water gun play
Instantly slap ya fire like it's palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool from the elements
The earth use and built it to a complex
Network of communications, you're up against a hopeless situation
I screen every vehicle, through enemy observation
Swarmin unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the force significantly, change the error
Check my wind pattern, it's headin west
Success is freedom, failure could mean death
Humans sweat, aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubbel
Permanent, damage caused by the double
U, now who, cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers'll serve you
Signin marvel, who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide practically marred in marble
His accountless, amount of MC's I saved
And those same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave
(Chorus: res sample)
Scratch underneath the surface,
Where does your purpose lie?
It seems our world is worthless,
Like we're pawns beneath the sky
Face the race by reason
And ashes just the wind
The left is so our we're breathin,
Keep ourself from givin' in
(Killah priest of sunz of man)
Love and hatred, home is most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas workin for the feds
Sent out secretly to take my head
I lay back and meditate to the words they say
Skip town for a mutten goofy dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Return at the last fall of the autumn leaves
Operate the plan accordingly, in case the feds are recordin me
Sign all documents usin' forgery,
'Cause just a near thought of me
I'm Like solomon, spoke bluntly Told the word I'm black and calmly
Howls from the grave haunt me
The smell of death's upon me, I dwell in the hills like gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants and old kings
Who sold everything on a quest for god's divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed 3 times, when the moon lit and the sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss, of Satan's mistress
Walked the vacant districts, for 4 religions, studied pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians, on a cure missions
Who harden their hearts, to ward the weak, sick and ifflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her, when I touch her, soft cause hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hold on to hell
Embracing her was like embracing a 3rd world
(Chorus: res sample)
Scratch underneath the surface,
Where does your purpose lie?
It seems our world is worthless,
Like we're pawns beneath the sky
Change the race by reason
And ashes just the wind
The left is so our we're breathin,
Keep myself from givin' in
Scratch underneath the surface"
12,"Breaker, Breaker",1999,Beneath the Surface (1999),Hip Hop,GZA,"Breaker, breaker, one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Extorted your rhymes
MC's should expect the worst
But stay alert and shoot first
This is not a test, it's difficulty
Picture closely, the ignorant mostly
Blind, deaf, dumb, your mind left numb
Lost soul who failed to hear the roll of the drum
In the bottom of your bomb shelter, still felt the
Heavy blast that blew off the mask of twelve elders
The math of an elder, praise the lord
Thinking Genius, operation project England
Commander-in-chief of flight style, check the air craft
Glide like the frisbee, Digi look Disney
The check false in ones self is pure loveliness
Your break the mirror that remind you of your ugliness
So when I bust, no one is in touch
Some returning with the mic clutched like such
Fool plan but never execute
He had the heat is hand, but, yo, he didn't shoot
Therefore your mechanism of material better be sickly
Or let your lead stread incredibly quickly
I move bravely, travelling on a horse
On a battle field surrounded by the lost
Of those who plotted with the brains of animals
My high molecular structure be untangible
The name ring the bell, killable two syllable
The Wu is coming through, the outcome is critical
To be blunt, the beef was cooked up like coke good
The rhyme first came to me in the oak woods
Up to no good, rap icon
Note the industry like the wall street junk bomb
You see the mic shown, I got your height sewn
Direct currents that move through the mic-phone
Key contributor, well known major factor
Rhyme distributor, the drive of a tractor
Who run ya down if you don't move or wanna linger

MC's should expect the worst
But stay alert and shoot first
Breaker, breaker, one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Extorted your rhymes
MC's should expect the worst
But stay alert and shoot first
The immortality of my fame is the measure of other's torture,
Burnt offer from a flaming author
The falconer who flies enough birds for the chase
Strictly excel in what is excellence with grace
The significance was not the vocal applause of entrance
But the felling that exits, completion of my sentence
With aging experience, my reason ripens
I strike on your vikings, clash like a hyphen
If you enter the house of fortune, I vacate the pleasure
You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures
Everything fails with the unfortunate
Learned that recording it, so my mind brought in it
Track records ranks us with the exceptional
Extreme complex physics, high technical
The truth is usually seen and rarely heard
Was more dangerous than hatred, is the word
You wild cards jack up all trades
Those who parade their positions, show the spade
A large flock of MC's, they figure to be taught
It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought
Breaker, breaker, one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Extorted your rhymes
MC's should expect the worst
But stay alert and shoot first

13,Cinema,2007,Pro Tools (2007),Hip Hop,GZA,"There was a clubhouse, only kept special guests in
Place much darker than the room I rest in
Creepy spot where the dust covers the floor
And some fishin' rods is hangin' on the door
Paintin' on the wall of stick figures
That's rumored to walk out the frame and get bigger
Where the imagination runs wild, like who's creepin'
Neighbors are acres away and probably sleepin'
Wind dust blowin' makes the sounds of ghost
[Incomprehensible] in the room makes you feel really close
Remind me of this late night thriller
I watched the other night, they never caught the killer
Bats that's flyin' in every direction
Got to stay low and roll with the protection
Visitors that often stay for the summer
They heart beat like the roll of a drummer
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, I got those chills
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, it's all too real
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, I got those chills
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, it's all too real
The room was full, the sky was black
The bathroom, hear a crack, wolves roam in packs
In the dinin' room, the chair rock back and forth
Pull the table cloth to the sun, where it fell off
Cups and glass plates hit the floor and shattered
Three Blind Mice heard the noise and scattered
Front door was open, welcome mat was soakin'
The blood of Christ, plus all four locks were broken
In the backyard, two dogs would growl
And barkin', the eyes and they teeth was sparklin'
I started to sweat, they started to get closer
Then I saw a face on a wanted poster
An outlaw who stayed with an empty hoster
Used to shoot mugs of beer off the coaster
Make a room to turn the light switch on
Chump up, my jacket was torn
Pages from the photo album, make a return
Wax drip from the candle as it slowly burn
Then the lights had started blinkin', as if the power was gone
The room become foggy, as if the shower was on
Words was written in the steam on the mirror
In bold print, couldn't have been any clearer
Teeth that was givin' out sounds without a picture
And a voice kept sayin', ""I'ma getcha""
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, I got those chills
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, it's all too real
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, I got those chills
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, it's all too real
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, I got those chills
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, it's all too real"
14,Cold World,1995,Liquid Swords (1995),Hip Hop,GZA,"Intro: (first three lines LP only)
I had a bad dream
Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in...
(Life)
Babies crying brothers dying and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world...
(GZA)
It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outside as I'm stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods robbers snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether broke callisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggaz toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made 'em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Destruction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his Farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggaz catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where Feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggaz laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing cheques again
Back to the motherfuckign spot on Lexington
(Chorus: Life)
Babies crying brothers dying and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world...
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world...
(Inspectah Deck)
Yo - no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Clicks control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
The stick up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, provide fire sparks to wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
Cause niggaz main concern is cream
Some niggaz in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed a kid
And hit a twelve year old girl in the head and then fled
Tactical narcotic, task force, back off fast
Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions, for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script, I'm not an actor but the author
Of a modern day opera, where the main character
Is presidential paper, the dominant factor"
15,Columbian Ties,2007,Pro Tools (2007),Hip Hop,GZA,"What goes around comes around
In his only iniquity he died
Through Columbian Ties
Fated back to the essence
Still forced to learn a lesson
All debts must be settled
No question
(GZA)
The echo from machine gun round simmers
A fallen solider
His gun hangs on his shoulder
Lights get dimmer
Key swinging back and forth in the ignition
The stench was only part of the horrible condition
As he waits for the smoke to clear
All he heard was the blast
From the bomb that kept ringing in his ear
Along with gun barring troops
Fatigues and wearing boots
From far away
Weather night or day
You hear them shoot
It's a very unforgiving and hostile environment
Where military hardware the only requirement
A world where where deceased is just a thing of the past
And each area advance is more costly then the last
A presidents madness
Responsible for losses
Political forces
Land litter with corpse
Like the youth in the street who gamble and get scarred
Even the troops in the field
Bet it all one one card
Some question their reason for being here
Facing incredible odds
And a recession that so severe
Raised in the shadow of a terrible loss
And the atmosphere where even breathing air can cost
A place where the majority is going for self
Where the agenda is not far from beyond
Personal wealth
Is like
Either you eat
Or you die from hunger
Starving to death till the coroner calls your number
With no bread to bite or break from off the table
The casket had exceeded the number of cradles
When this dark danger falls across the plateau
A mask in the disseat in the streets that sat low
These stomping grounds are known to bring misfortune
Fueled by his obsession
He murdered for portions
And died of a miserable death
His final undoing and biggest downfall was from the people he left"
16,Come Do Me,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"Here I am loungin' at a hype party
Then I see this lady with a hellafied body
With a pair of bedroom eyes that were clocking The Genius
Well, you see what I mean is
She had the look as if she was attracted
To me so what I did, I reacted
In a manner to show that I was feeling the same
Now check out the game
I said lovely, I be The Genius and how ya doing?
I'm on a chase and you're the one that I'm pursuing
She said it's the pleasure Genius, I'm doing kinda fine
But what's on your mind?
I said
Girl
Come Do Me
I said sexy, where you live over yonda
What's your name?
She said it's Yolanda
She said she knew me from back in the days
And that I had her running on a wild sex craze
I said now you're kinda big and well-developed
And parts of your body just made my head swell up
She said her feelings were so deep for me
To the point where she wanted to sleep with me
I said c'mon babe, I know you're jokin'
She said if I'm jokin' you must be smokin'
I said the only think I wanna be smokin' is your boots
And she said ""I hear ya troop""
And just from that little bit of conversation
It put my hormones into activation
The whole thing just went to my head
As I held her hands and said
Baby, come do me
Hey good looking how many times may I say
That your gorgeous smile takes my breath away
Your soft warm little voice is very pleasing
And your tight mini-skirt is kind teasing
Me, it makes me wanna do the nasty
And you got the look of being very classy
So go ahead and whip it on me
As Latifah said,""gimme that body""
So you see right there I desire you
I'm not a pimp and I don't want to hire you
Cause that's not what The Genius is about
Let my love slide in and never slip out"

Left drink wine, from the purist grapevine
An' rhyme out the mutherfucking mind
Metal shine, light blind, cut the mic line
Catch juice from the ?land fo?
15 twenty inch woofers blow the manhole
Made the street crack, master feedback
?Allah masters the beat back?
The crowd look, while the stage shook
Carpenters made errors
Craftsmen had his head severed
Pyroclastic flow, heavy like tonnes of snow
Broke this rhymin' video
Verbal assassin, blastin
Exploit your break through explosively
Echo chamber ate that rap up ferociously
Game controlled, optimize the input channel
I set it relatively high for those on a panel
CD with the durable, long-life cover
Very similar to no other
I seen a million tryin' to set a flow
Thousands that show
Observe with the patience of watching a flower grow
But one individual thing forgot the ?fri show?
Now his pursuit is not for digress
A special note, thanks for being flank
While journalist's stay runnin' in front of tanks
Blew out first class, came back close cash
Ruff class, surfaces with no math
Military campaign, while shots cause information of the brain
Beat Crazy Eddie insane

Filled with pain -- niggaz reign

(Intro: RZA (Raekwon))
At the holy city of Mecca, great fan of Colon
Crazy ammo get blown, wherever I sit, son
That is my throne (you know how we do it)
(Chorus: Raekwon)
Aiyo, POP POP POP, when it shots, whose to blame?
Three get dropped and removed from the game
One get knocked, now his whole life is changed
'Cause he's so far from freeing the world, that seem strange
(GZA)
I come from a place where they say, death comes too soon
Where the hoods on the block, dance to a different tune
Every night and every day, hotels of foul play
Turns fatal, when this hostile land of AK's
On any date, not wait to pump them rounds
The reminder; it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness, gunned down in the staircase
Who had led his crew, but he was moving at a snail's pace
Many suspects, many possible motives
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position
The mission was to move in, with sheer brute force
And lives, they get lost, on a collision course
The streets are fascinating, so they gotta explore it more
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors
Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents
Conceal the truth, but can't hide the evidence
A man died holding some dice that he was shaking
Like a bank stop, but no valuables was taken
Shot at 8:45, but he died at 9
A video was the most precise witness to the crime
(GZA)
The story had a familiar ring of truth
But it needed, a little more tangible proof
He was blown off the map, behind the aggravated kidnaps
Shrap' metal everywhere, the bomb was gift wrapped
The problem had became increasingly urgent
Since the product was nothing but bags of detergent
In all the years of war, this was the most
Vicious battle and mainly fought from up close
A bundle burglary, with no surprise
Just another sloppy murder that was in disguise
Now they can do nothing but hope and pray
That the boys don't come through with the scope and spray
Valuable time comes with a price to pay
Smoke on a deserted street, just a mile away
Tusslin' with those cannibals, right from the start
That'll rip out your heart, and consume the fattest part
Better watch from the eye of federal agents
Selecting cams, while they was disguised as vagrants
Not knowing that a prisoner had held the key
Of a co-defendant, he was so far from free
Detectives search into a distant past
Of a young gun who made the block grow fast
Narrow ducks who were cooked and came home to roast
The suspects would seek refuge off the coast
(Outro: Raekwon (chess sample))
Word up, holding it down
Holding the fort, nigga, youknowhatisayin?
All we need is a bunch of red coats coming through
Stayin' official on some gangster shit
Bloodhounds, thirsty, lurking in the bushes
Yeah... (B4 - now at six - C4)"
19,Did Ya Say That,2002,Legend of the Liquid Sword (2002),Hip Hop,GZA,"I keep your heart is PZA-pumping, the beat is GZA-jumping
The crowd get wild off my style, they want something
The herds start stomping the promoters that be fronting
They sue for Cash Rule but the courts they give 'em nothing
Your soundman came with the feedback like ""we need that""
Security's shining flashlights like ""where the weed at?""
Stay in your place, see you guys smoke blowing in your face
And it's hard to stop it, once we came to drop it
Who bold enough to challenge this deadly reportation
Of keeping MC's in a hopeless situation
No comparison, if you put the darts side by side
One will weigh out the other, like friend next to brother
Try to take cover as the battle comes to a closion
That structure that supported your rap started implosion
Your whole chest and your world caved in
They completely gave in, they just sparks and brave men
Did ya say that? Record execs wanna push the album way back?
And hold out on my advance? They didn't pay that
Producers want seven points? He didn't play that
Yo did they say that?

Raindrops keep falling on your head
So heavy that it's tearing what you're wearing ain't caring, so you're hearing what I said
I'm making sure it stick like a stamp you don't lick
Or a snare with no kick
So you know it be authentic like the hand-made works of a carpenter
The 64 squares make 'em use a sharpener
Kept a fine point with the lead, then it's thread
On the paper like cancer it would rapidly spread
This music is addictive but can't live without it
At times you hear shout it ""The Wu, they be about it""
A strong following with the die-hard supportedly
The loyalty came from the songs that went accordingly
I couldn't be more wrong if I changed the format
Did something different from the most explored rap
Did ya say that? Record execs wanna push the album way back?
And hold out on my advance? They didn't pay that
Producers want seven points? He didn't play that

Positive Elevation Always Correct Errors
That's the fire till my Clansmen starts to spread terror
Spin your wig back like we DJ'ing, he ain't playing
My songs set a trap, catch 'em laying
Now we stuck but he's overwhelmed by what he came across
Not to play it is a terrible loss at whose cost?
People wait like never before for the ball to drop
At the gate lined up for a tape to cop
I still run into students banging my first joint
Wrote a essay off the second LP to prove a point
That a rhyme is a terrible thing to waste
Gimmicks and radio the God don't chase
But I replace your wackness, it shows in your flows
Immaturenesses, all of your hoes, case closed
Most of your strength is in the pocket of you clothes
That you endorse in every rhyme like it's Garbeson robes (echo)
Did ya say that? Record execs wanna push the album way back?
And hold out on my advance? They didn't pay that
Producers want seven points? He didn't play that

20,Drama,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"Talkin' bout drama
I met a young brother, how young about eight
He seemed intelligent and rather quite straight
I greeted him, and struck a conversation
To see if the youngster had some self-motivation
Peace brother, what's your name, and how ya be
He said I be soon coming off the currency
I said gettin' paid, he said yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo he shares with his baby's mother
He said a condo beats my apartment
With no lights and no gas and much backed up rent
No hot water or heat, and invaded by plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alleycat
He said yeah boyyyeee, that's poverty
I said word, I know and it bothers me
'Cause we are the victims, of a situation
How wicked man, separated
A nation and got us cold-killin' off one another
(Word-word, to the mother)
It's getting hot, how hot, hotter than July
'Cause the murder and crime rate is rising very high
For example, in my neighborhood, it's so hot
I'm often woke up, from the alarming sound of a shot
So I'm thinking what, is my neighborhood a trap
Could this be the place marked X on the map?
Now I'm spotted like a target, in the shooting gallery
So I start to seek for a better salary
So I can escape from where, from this ghetto life area
Cause everyday you're getting scarier
*Blam blam* and scarier and scarier
Causing mass hysteria, it's drama
Talkin' bout drama
Not to be bold and disrespect the homeless
'Cause I can see that they suffer from a long list
From not having shelter, and out on the street
Without a job and days without a bite to eat
Yo I feel for those, but here's another side
About some more people that's living on the outside
Because of the fact that they chose the wrong way
And it took 'em on a trip for a long day
Got to the point you started stealing from your house
Stalking the rooms late at night like a mouse
Your family's upset and you've got to go
When it's, five, below and we're ex-pecting snow
And then you're on the train with a cup in your hand
Kicking dirt, and making it look like sand
Then after you run that game for a while
You start sucking up tokens from out the turnstile
Are you that desperate, just to get a hit
Is it so effective that you won't quit, and yo
Why do you come to me crying the blues?
About you can't get a job well go sell some street news
Then you can get straight and be real
But you'd rather rob and steal
And that's drama
Talkin' bout drama
Not wonderama
But I'm talkin' bout drama
Here what I'm sayin'?
I'm not talkin' bout your mama
Nah, but I'm talkin' bout drama
Shaolin fist versus the llama
Talkin' bout drama"
21,Duel of the Iron Mic,1995,Liquid Swords (1995),Hip Hop,GZA,"Oh mad one
We see your trap
You can never escape, your fate
Submit with honor to a duel, with my son
I agree
I see you using an old style, I wondered where you had learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
[Yo god, it's a duel, it's a duel] heh, by the gods, will you show me?
[Buck buck buck buck buck buck ] and where do you come for?
[Duel of the iron mic ] you come here, since you're so interested
[Duel of the iron mic ] fight me
(In the moonlight niggaz I will strike)
(What, what? bring it!)
Verse one: the genius
Yo
Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waitin for the editin
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers
Smokin' exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessin
Give crazy shouts son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in bed-stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thievin MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushin fast
Like runnin' rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver
Chorus: ol dirty bastard
Duel of the iron mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!
Verse two: master killer
This is not a eighty-five affair, made clear
When the gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causin the crowd to self-destruct
Killer bees are stingin somethin' while I reveal
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombin your barracks, with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damagin lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testin the murderous master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seekin' for a serum, to cure em
Verse three: inspector deck
Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Duckin handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move lioke real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Bulding lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, dependin if you're passin the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's livin' heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, findin it confusin
Outro: ol dirty bastard
Duel of the iron mics [the master, he must be dreaming, heh]
It's that fifty-two fatal strikes [well, if he is dreaming...]
Duel of the iron mics [...then he must be asleep]
It's that fifty-two fatal strikes, nuh [and if he is asleep]
(Then I will wake him up!)
(Weahhhhaah-hah-hah!)
At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
They very art, that had raised them through such rapiant heights was lost
Their techniques, vanished"
22,Exploitation of Mistakes,2005,Grandmasters (2005),Hip Hop,GZA,"(GZA)
Two individuals, pulled from a lake
Inside a vehicle, one had his foot on the break
The windows was fully up and the doors was locked
The news made the headline, and the town was shocked
The driver was clutching a can of Hi-C
His jacket was tied, to a near by tree
His jeans had dye in them, and a usual tattoo
Was the only hope, to identifying them
The autopsies revealed gun shot wounds
Dental records matched to a newlywed groom
This accident, was a cover up for homicide
Two who might of, stayed alive from paying bribes
Sheets investigators, had relied on the media
For help, and to track down the perpetrated
They canvassed the neighborhood, with standard procedure
And visited the home, of a topless skeezer
Who was at the bar, when he was last seen alive
Left with him, just ten minutes after they arrived
Despite the police efforts, they turned up nothing
Just an ex-hooker, try'nna get a rep from bluffing
But the wide publicity, had just paid off
From a hard rock inmate, who was just made soft
He said he knew a man who killed the pop star
And almost got caught by a passing cop car
The inmate said probably, the motive was robbery
And knowing if he keeping it a secret, it bothers me
He said this individual killed for low billings
And purchased a murder kit, blocks from the killing
The sheriff's office, had no time to waste
Plus the inmate never deal, to avoid the case
So he co-operated fully, and snitched on his
Chop shop mechanic, who used to move bodies on the pulley
An extortionist, involved in similar incidents
Payments that came in thousand dollar increments
Suspicious activities that flooded the place
So they subpoenaed phone records for the calls was traced
The hair that was taken from his car interior
Was that of a young girl, who felt inferior
She died fighting and probably aroused his anger
Holding off her life, as she faced the strangler
The crime seemed to be sexual from nature
It was substantial evidence, that the nigga raped her
The suspects had marks on his face and chest
But it just wasn't enough, to get an arrest
Asked of his whereabouts, on the third of July
Said he partied with his friends, and had a solid alibi
But it was really something left at the scene, on a small scale
Was the microscopic traces of blood, under her fingernails"

Too wild to reanact, with tax

Play your space, I get hungry off of treble and bass and beat breaks
Everyday be a court date recorded on tape
Hell Raizah grab the mic and send your show to a wake
Cut off a snakehead the same way I cut off dead weight
We negotiate wit .38's in a ?nor? face
GZA came wit the Liquid Swords killin' you all
I'm the virus in the street that'll get in your paws
See me jumpin' outta four-doors wit my road dogs
All you soldiers want wars when you don't know laws

Besides keyboards, only thing I love is the Lord

Vent poison in the ears of the ?grown-z's? dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear
Shots were fired in the darkest moments
Niggas missed they targets, hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious, days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall, clutchin holdin' his stomach
Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred
It's like a life never ends, never know when it's comin'

This generation, a misleading calculation
No elevation, time wastin and live chasin

Blaze a lime green, six on the spleen over some green
Surrounded by crooks, a life wit jux and bloody heist

In this hell puzzle filled wit bitches, money and trouble
Stitches, for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin' up the hustle
It's a struggle, in jungle wit sin we fondle men
Plus a prison, ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle, thugs get caught up astronomical
Cash phenomenal, blast at your abdominal

26,Feel the Pain,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"I feel I'm a threat to high powered MC's
'Cause when I roll up on their live shows they kinda freeze
From being approached by The Genius of rap
Whose poetry makes hands on a clock clap
You see, I be coming with strong rhymes galore
That even a stubborn MC can't ignore
That trying to defeat me brings about danger
Like a child speaking to a stranger
Soft MC's, I see more and more
With an ancient style, the prehistoric bore
Yes, they scream and roar until their throat get sore
Now they're running to the neighborhood drug store
To buy the cough drop for what? The wrong hip hop
Now they swear they're on the good ship lollipop
But it's a sweet trip to the candy shop
POW!, now it's a six feet drop
For stealin' rhymes which is incorrect
Of those who speak on how others are weak
You wanna sneak peek of the hype technique?
Don't make me run up on start flipping like
I'm insane, or you'll feel the pain
I appreciate your comments of my creation
Your standing up followed by your standing ovation
Your kindliness to listen to the true MC
Those who know me make me #1 'cause they agree
I rock on and on past the break of dawn
Ask Rakeem, Unique Ason, or even Melquan
'Cause I be flowing at the same time showing
Hard headed individuals who don't be knowing
That I wreck it, cause my style was perfected
And injected into a drop beat selected
By who? Easy-Mo-Bee, the engineer
But don't forget the hypest in the Northern Hemisphere
The G, the, The G, the, The Genius
From Earth, not Mercury or Venus
Or Mars, 'cause then I'll be martian
But even in that world I'll still be squashin'

A small fry nigga in a baked potato world
Sizzling in some beef full of grease like jheri curls

Shook a few in the thou', but some never broke the seal
Fuck them, I stick to college radios, mix shows
Historic university, to freestyle sick flows
Might give a lecture about your rap texture

Popular is the tag in the bathroom stall, check it
This language is so captivating
When we lose a rap nigga, the news is devastating

Brought the 7 niggaz in the building to see you

Make them hire law enforcements
Plus, I just turned down tracks, can't remember the
Producer with the beats is wack, sound similar
It gotta be exciting, striking, lightning
Bring the best out, to dawn through Harlem
Writing, light stroke from my pen might choke
The tape lent, got a little air, then half the spins

The nature in the scale of events, shook the station
I stick up the track, armed only with the pen
Terrorize it vocally with the force of wind

Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars
Filthy foul, shoveling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth
His idols would lock down airports and extort
Some import, catchin ten percent of what the fiends snort
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills
They move keys and had skis making drops on snowmobiles
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers
And live large and bigger than my nigga
Who promised his moms a mansion with mad rooms
She died, and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors
And still organized his crime and drug wars

Whether by word of mouth, or if you read about it
Extra, extra, extra that they felt the need to shout it
The drummer played the beat on the table
His boy kicked a verse, like he was the first and I wasn't able
More prepared to let off anything substantial
If I had no rhymes and my planes was canceled
Picture that, before you give your bag and expose it
Couldn't develop the color, wonder why he chose it
See less than the worst competition to the point
I only use one ear to listen
Was it something I'm missin'? The food is gettin' cold
The corners about to flake as soon as I flip the bowl
See the rhyme ain't worth than less a ticket
Wasted time of mine plus the temp cooked it
Who be the first to set it off and just begun?
Turn up the heat until the track is done
And we roll together as one
Yes, I call my brother sun, 'cause he shine like one
Who be the first to set it off and just begun?
Turn up the heat until the track is done
And we roll together as one
Yes, I call my brother sun, 'cause he shine like one"

Killah Hills 10304
Restaurants on a stake-out, so order the food to take out
Chaos, outside a spark's steakhouse
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga miss da Wedding, late a fucking half hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contracting bricklaying jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, interest rates a grand to a finger
In the garment district, got it sewn like Singer
'Cause all that talk blasphemy this kid after me
For the heist, in a Burlington Coat Factory
Fuck it, he turned snake so my nigga Cash stole his copilot
Who used to drive like sacks of blow on this remote
Area, we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles South from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got the luxurious custom made yachts
Burial plots, for my niggaz hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man Muhammad from Afghanistan
Grew up in Iran, the nigga runs a neighbourhood news-stand
A wild Middle Eastern, bomb specialist
Initiated, at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggaz popped the cork, niggaz lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker, tried to smuggle a half a key
In his left leg, even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the feds rushed him, coming through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand singing, a well known soprano
A smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan minimum for the hit, two hundred grand
Half time at the game blasting niggaz out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor, judges are sent
Photographs of they wives taking baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five, that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide
First rule, anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from the interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica
Four hundred barrels of ether, two hundred pounds of reefer
And fifty immigrants with fake Visas
Life of a drug dealer
Killah hills, 10304
The saga continues"

I wiped the chrome off wit the dust cloth
'Fore I bust off
What's the cause, life loss, high price to pay
For a small reward, kill for that Bushwick and Horsely broad
I provided the jump cables, through to boost the mini-pack
Based on the drama unfolding in a track
I don't hold back, I spare no one
Swords swing like shogun, now who want it?
You see the truth, then act upon it
Or feel the fire's fore view
Ain't a MC that I hit can pull through
That niggas are like kid, flashin plastic tools
Unaware of the most-year dynastic rule, what stupid!
(Masta Killa)
Without a doubt, it's in the heart where the best darts were written
Sittin' at the window of the grand old earths
Youths thirst for knowledge, I teach but hold heat
'Cause some savage niggas are lost beyond reach
Broken homes breed seeds of no guidance
Left to wonder the streets and experiment wit devilish men
Violent, felon offenders, supreme folders
One-twenty bomb holders let 'em off and explode
The battefield haunting the daunting
Wu-Tang dance deadly emits six pence
Spiral rifle, barrel pointed, elastic noose
Plastic head wrapped stifle, survival
Tribal, title secret rival
?Archual? subliminal message throwin'
Bitch niggas holdin' on labels
Mic cables, capable of slowin down jets on deck
Fuckin' you straight through continuously
Justice, wit more of the critical penital
Some long overdue, now served by the chiefs on cheat
Drummer bills is the street prophecies fulfilled
Better chill, currents to the invited
Bang for the 'phones, live niggas on they way home
Snatch poems from clones, we got it sewn"
32,Highway Robbery,2002,Legend of the Liquid Sword (2002),Hip Hop,GZA,"(GZA)
An MC stepped to me, lying about one
Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move
A hog move, some rap cat on dog food
Microphone competition we devour
You pull plugs but take no source of power
'Cause then in MCing, the contours of the land
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan
The W U hyphen T A N G
My rap flow automatic and never empty
Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another
Flee in that direction you could get it from my brother
At least then you know that you up against G-O-D
So when we throw those grenades you better be
Ready, not iced out and petty
Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on
The strength cause local niggas be hating
But the sound still travels from state to state and
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal
Strictly hip hop underground and all ghetto
So catch it, throw it on your plate and scratch it
Mix that [shit], y'all niggas can't do [shit]
(Chorus 2X: Governor Two's)
Stick it up like it's a highway robbery
True gangstas we run New York City
We come fi takeover the industry
Cause you know them have fi too 'fraid of we
(GZA)
How come so much rap [shit] sound so similar
Is it confusing for you to remember the
Originator, paint sprayer, crafts innovators
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme
Exert maximum damage in minimum time
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidentally seen it on the shelves of stores
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm
So think about it when you trying to flow
When you wanna step to us I think you should know"

Extort from a thousands degrees of live MCs
I melt ya niggaz down to the size of fleas

Yeah you, you know your power-U
Ya reconize the voice, it's that nigga from the Wu

Lyrics:
I was always taught my do's and don'ts
For do's I did, and for don'ts, I said I won't
I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born
Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn
And ripped up, stripped up, shacked up and backed up
From fiends, cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up
Kids are slingin in my lobby
Little Steve and Bobby
Gettin' paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide and seek
The fiends seek for the crack, and they hide and let the cops peep
Grown folks say they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic, so fuckin' hectic
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected
My lifestyle was so far from well
Coulda wrote a book with a title ""Age 12 and Goin' through Hell""
Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin stunts
Back on the Ave of Lavonia and Bristol with a pistol
Stickin up Pamela and Crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid come home from doin' the bid and nothin' changes
What is the meaning of CRIME (what?)
Is it Criminals Robbin Innocent Motherfuckers Everytime?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Tryin' to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like an umpire
But it's an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist
Only the players change, so...
RZA - I gotcha back (8X)
I gotcha back so you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, that be pullin stunts

*Old man*
Your, tech, nique, is, mag-ni-ficent
When cut across the neck
A sound like wailing winter winds is heard, they say
I'd always hoped to cut someone like that someday
To hear that sound
But to have it happen to my own neck is... ridiculous
*Man gasps for air*"
35,Illusory Protection,2005,Grandmasters (2005),Hip Hop,GZA,"(Intro: movie sample)
When I request my flashing sword
And my hand take hold on judgment
I will take vengeance upon my enemies
And I will repay those that hazed me
(Chorus: GZA)
When you got bass all in your face
Sub woofers pumpin' all throughout the place
A fake rap nigga tryna plead his case
It's about to be, a catastrophe
And if you got beehive's, right before your eyes
About to start shit that'll attract the flies
And then you hear lies, followed by some cries
It's about to be, a catastrophe
(GZA)
Half of these rap lyrics ain't thoughts prevoked
Just alotta beef, till they get caught in smoke
But the problem is never cured, on top of that
Most of them be swingin' wild and then drop the bat
Many curious spectators, watch the human drama
This rap cat was all in the street without his armor
A homicidal attempt, that had failed
He flew off the roof, on the fence, got impaled
He talked a good one, but it was make believe
Much too low, for the human ear to perceive
He confused science fiction with science facts
He couldn't separate the block, from the recorded tracks
Need a rhyme or the tactic, gotta work your magic
Detailed and graphic, but the outcome is tragic
Something built to a complex network
With a panoramic vision, designed by experts
I be the ice breaker, for you unskilled skaters
I increase the heat significantly, just on paper
(GZA)
No matter what, I'm throwin' an iller dart
I can lay a verse, that'll soften a killer's heart
As fire as a five alarm blaze, that's too hot to be holding
You feel the heat, once the flame pumps lace your clothing
What some talk about, had little or no bearing
Could the next be some real shit, that's far from comparing
Materialistic M.C.'s, come off boring
Meanwhile, I be sketching up, deposit drawings
Through the years, a countless, number of victories
Changing the era, we swarm unpredictably
A rhyme book is not, difficult to manage
I leave a mic in a bandage, from catastrophic damage
Rap niggaz on a trip, gotta steal your sandwich
So I creeped, division reports was left on canvas
I made it through the worst extremes of cold weather
Scuffed up, but remained durable as old leather
But I hold the pen, you feel the whiff of Polo wind
Something like Jesus, when he civilize older men
The math that shed light, all across the borders
If our wisdom was the vast expands of fresh waters
(Outro: GZA (chess sample))
We call it a sword style, because, we are lyrical assassins
And we aware that the tongue is symbolic to the sword
The lyrical assassins... the lyrical assassins... a sword style...
(The procedure is, check with the knight
Move the knight away to deliver a discovered check from the queen
Then, sacrifice the queen to force the rook next to the king
Then mate with the knight)"

It was the summer of '77.
New York was just recovering from the raves due to the blackout.
Hip Hop was young and growing rapidly. It was during that time when my father would oftent make journeys across the waters. From Shaolin on his way to the place where many say this art form started. The ferry, or the boat, as most called it, was a floatin' forum, for talent especially MC's, who would often battle while in route to the city. It was on the boat, where he would sharpen his sword on neighborhood MC's, preparing for the battles that were soon to come..."

As well as the park slope and gowanas neighborhoods.)

Rugged rhymsters, crooked crimesters
Dime droppers, twenty-five-to-lifers
Backstabbers, low blowers
Illegal... cocaine growers
Starvation, profanity
Anxiety, brothers tryin' me
Gun slingers, dead ringers
Verse one: raekwon the chef
Yo, my slang's out of this world
Mix collaboration man, little man and his girl
Way of life got me thinkin', plus I'm analyzing young
Youths on roofs, you know, three time felony brutes
Roll together, tropical trees puff, whatever
Yo, we could go run up on kids for leathers
What drug? faculties bubble keys for g's
Cream flow like seven seas, hit chicks guayanese

The morgue route, the devil want that

Callin all cars, callin all cars! ghetto
Psychos, armed and dangerous, leavin' mad scars on those
Who are found bound, gagged and shot when they blast the spot
Victims took off like astronauts
Get with this, even your best can't
Come on down, you're the next contestant!
Get your pockets dug from all your chemical bank-ins
Caught him at the red light - on putnam avenue and franklin
They used to heat up the cipher with a shot that was hyper
Than your average jfk sniper
He just came home to spark it
Rolling like kaufman, and lay that ass out like carpet
Stop the stuttering boy, save the planes for the five-oh
Then praise the God - chk-a-chk pow!

...And then they jet back to the lab
And then remain in shaolin
An endangered island

Verse three: ghost face killer
Yo, I grab the pen for revenge and let loose, see
Like muslims, standing on the block, rocking a khufi
The hundred-dollar kick rockin' kid's back for more
Startin gold wars, with black reeboks and velours
Jungle royal life, livin' villain
Packed with visions, copywritten
Throwin' bread to pigeons, Christ has risen, king elegant
Slang-master jackets, expensive noodle hats
In sixty-nine, old times was time that brothers shot craps
The baggy blue guess jeans, pull strings off of callin springs
I'm locked in the thing, rocky ring labelled rap king
The corner emperor - the golden thieves play the benches
Rednecks be hanging big niggaz down in memphis
Back in now-y, hit the bull's eye with loaded nines
Life is like tarzan, swingin' from a thin vine
Shatter dreams, then mirrors don't need a press spirals
Aim at the white shadows with big barrels
Of moet-ahs, the bald headers, milk and amarett-ahs
Who fear none, question all personal vendettas, yo
They use guns, while we angrily shot arrows
You better keep your eye on the sparrow!

Advisin' y'all that wise words is much slicker
Under circumstances label advances
Ample opportunity, infinite chances
The rhyme, the unrelated beef I don't stress
I seen many killed for inifinte-e-less
Ya raps need a clips that packed with lies
Cowardlessly ya shot up those innocently wise
In extra long verses hundred bars the lim'
The percentage of the truth in the rhyme is one tenth
A solid mass of minerals, easily broke down
Hard rock MC's ya nothin' but compound
Sparked by the endless greed of CEO's
In the videos with those questionable flows
Take it twenty-six, cut it down to four bars, make it a hook
If it's not I'm sure to send a book

When ya move it accelerates the action of the venom
But the purity and sacrifice gettin' stung twice

Considering my own future, I'm used ta
Damaging MC's then pollyin with producers

Hold that song's playin' weak ass material

Well I'll emirge off ya set, now ya know God damn
I show livin' large niggaz how to flip a def jam
And ruff up the motherfuckin' house
'Cause I smother you cold chillin' mother fuckers are still warner brothers

This soft comedian rap shit ain't the rough witty
On the reel to reel it wasn't from a tuff city
Niggas be game, thinking that they lyrical surgeons
They know their mics are formed at virgin
And if you ain't boned a mic you couldn't hurt a bee
That's like going to Venus driving a mercury
The capitol of this rugged slang, is wu-tang
Witty unpredictable talent and natural game
I death row an MC with mic cables
The epic is at a rush associated labels
From eastwest to atco, I bring it to a next plateau
But I keep it phat though
Yo, I'm hittin' batters up with the wild pitch style
I even show an uptown/mca style
Who thought he saw me on 4th and broadway
But I was out on the island, bombing MC's all day
My priority is that I'm first priority
I bone the secret out a bitch in a sorority

Who won the covenant role, based on a nationwide poll?
For the grip tells told and rap scrolls
Perfect pitch for language that's built within
Where half the rap ink couldn't hold my pen
Meanin' When Emcees Came, To Live Out The Name
They signed the documents with the, blood of the slain
Far removed from this hip hop life off course
But the confidence and resilience was never lost
In the think tank and research labs I laid tracks
Seen work rule my life but it never broke my back
Destiny forever shake from the events to come
From the (?) and the chemical contents of the sun
A solid gold figure with a verse that glitters
Until the platinum beat comes increasingly bitter
They joined in a likely alliance with the rest
Schemin' with unsuccessful in a zealous Quest
We all see, with a degree of certainty
Who the fake, cowardly cats behind the curtains be,
(Yeah, yeah...)
They hunt, for the skin, flesh, the blood, and bones
In front, want to impress with studdes stones
(Chorus: Anthony Allen)
Now who's the man who brought you the Legend of the Liquid Sword?
Rap critics say ""Damn"" you're sick with your's
4th Chamber and the Shadowboxin' too
That Nigga be the GZA from Wu
And if you odn't know
About the piroclastic flow
Hotter than the spark that made it blow
You better recognize, recognize...
(Verse Two: GZA)
Why U-N-I-verse run like clock works forever?
Words pulled together, sudden change in the weather
The nature and the scale of events don't make sense
A story with no warnin' you're drawn in, environments
Gravity that's gone mad, clouds of dust and debree
Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar
From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes
That travel in a circle of order
Like the tape in your cassette recorder filled with cult for slaughter
(Yeah, yeah...)
Meaning the con-tracts manifestly work
The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks
Inspite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance
On his target through a crowded market
No interference
The microphone left on the scene without a serial
Evidence consistent with organic material (Well)
Surprisingly, as we marched lively with great size and degree
Till it spread widely"
42,Life Is a Movie,2007,Pro Tools (2007),Hip Hop,GZA,"I got scientist killas that'll jam your cell phone
Send a text message, kill you off with a ringtone
High pitched noise on your brain, it's heavy
Autopsy report that he jumped off a train
It started when the dearly departed tried to escape max
Then cut into the general's income like state tax
One call to seal the deal with feel
Doctor on the payroll cost a quarter mill
The mailman's late with the cheque
I'm in the flood with a bunch of bills that's about up to my neck
Plus my rent's not paid and the light's about to go off
Car got stolen by a thief who likes to show off
I can't even get a job, givin' out fliers
I'm a handyman with a pair of broke pliers
The fridge is theirs, Mother Hubbard's cupboard
I'm so down and out, I can only go upward
I form rhymes in alphabet soups
From the rhythm of the spoon, I transform the loop
From the steam of the bowl, I'm make the special effects
Add a dash of spice only God can detect
Had a word to make a bear return to his cub
A word that make a girl come home from the club
A word that make a demon return back to God
And the word that help Dorothy get home from Oz
Thirty frames per second, these films we be perfectin'
Scenes of light put through all projection
Electricity, perfectivity
Audio and visually, physically and mentally
I got a smile that'll make the mirror crack
And I seem to stay under clouds that's pitch black
So when it rains it pours, and when it pours I'm soaked
I contracted lung cancer from third hand smoke
And uh, I'm like the frog that's dyin' to be a prince
The boy who cried wolf and no one was convinced
The man who hit lotto and lost his ticket
In a rainstorm, and struck by lightnin' tryin' to get it
And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
Play it all back, play it all back
Lights, camera, action, let the tape roll
Some scripts get ripped, canned or even sold
Director's vision, producer's decision
And raised the budget, because the chase had collisions
Stunt double risks his life just for the thrill
DP checks the gate before the scene gets sealed
Gaffer slapped with a slate for being late
Craft service got nervous and dropped a hundred plates
Leadin' actor bangin' an extra in the trailer
Screamin', hittin' high notes like Mahalia
Box office hit and a blockbuster smash
Two hundred mil' budget and still recouped the cash
And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
Play it all back, play it all back"
43,Life of a Drug Dealer,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"There's a rumor that an old lady heard a
Kingpin hiring a hitman to murder
A federal prosecuting drug-dealing witness
But that's how it is in the business
And I'm in it, physically gaining power
Constantly counting up cash by the hour
And it feels good to be paid
Regardless of how many victims get slayed
Accomplices of mine drop like flies
But in this everyday a homeboy dies
Whether shot in the body or cyanide in ya Bacardi
'Cause it's a cutthroat party
Now it's up to me to retaliate
And if I score, I'll increase the murder rate
I move on ones who double-cross
Set them up, now they suffer the loss
Of he or she who's ever on the agenda
Most likely a family member
Informants, rattle-tattle-telling snakes
Get shot up, brutalized and thrown in lakes
The parts of a body is found days later
The other half was done by an amputator
I'm undefeated in plenty fights
My enemies are beaten with many stripes
I'll shoot up funerals, firebomb wakes
Vehicular homicides, whatever it takes
Just to keep control of my empire
I'll set ya own mother on fire
'Cause when it comes down just to me and my money
Ain't a fucking thing funny
All those who pose a threat I'll stick them
Ya friends, ya family and innocent victims
Get caught in the midst when I'm busting of nines
But they was in the wrong place, the wrong time
Decapitated bodies found in lots
While I'm still cooking up kilos in pots
The kilos becomes bricks and the bricks becomes rocks
Then retailed on the blocks
I drive around in expensive cars
And get women who fuck like porno stars
I get them high, you know, like powder they nose
Then put 'em in the streets as my high-class hoes
I'm wild, living foul and I'm ruthless
I leave muthafuckers toothless
I had a worker who stepped on the scene lively
Then started selling my customers Ivory
Soap, counterfeit vials of cracks
I stuck 'em to death with a thousand thumbtacks
You've seen my resume, that's just the half
I'm a bad muthafucker, just like Shaft
A character played by who? Richard Roundtree
The only difference, my guns are sound-free
Silencers ring off then wisp by
Then all you hear is a last minute cry
Of those who triedto control my territory
Not the West Side but the Bed-Stuy story
Police be giving me eye-to-eye contact
But I smile 'cause I'm putting out contracts
Now a G-note is placed upon ya head
You say picture that all right, bang ya dead
This is the life of a drug dealer"
44,Liquid Swords,1995,Liquid Swords (1995),Hip Hop,GZA,"Intro one: (not included on 7)
When I was little... my father was famous.
He was the greatest sam-urai in the empire;
And he was the shogun's decapitator.
He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords.
It was a bad time for the empire.
The shogun just stayed inside his castle -- and he never came out.
People said his brain was infected by devils.
My father would come home -- he would forget about the killings.
He wasn't scared of the shogun, but the shogun was scared of him.
Maybe that was the problem.
Then, one night... the shogun sent his ninja spies to our house.
They were supposed to kill my father... but they didn't.
*Woman screams*
That was the night everything changed *voice fades*
Intro two: rza
See, sometimes...
You gotta flash 'em back
See niggaz don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm sayin' we gonna take y'all back to the source
We bounce, yo
Chorus: rza, gza
When the MC's came, to live our their name
And to perform (forrrrm)
Some had, to snort cocaine (caiiinnne) to act insane (sannne)
With before pete rock-ed it on, now gone
That the mental plane (plaaanne) to spark the brain (brainnn)
With the building to be born
Yo rza flip the track with the what to gut
Check 'em check chicka icka etta uh
Verse one:
Fake niggaz get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clown
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was yo out the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin' smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played, like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance is if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in da front want it
Verse two:
I'm on a mission, that niggaz say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggaz styles are old like mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak, like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, hit the rail, like amtrak
What the fuck for? down by low, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be stickin but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the wu, slid off on the dl
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
(When the MC's..) now come aboard, it's medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggaz are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin"

Critical...
You're living foul, things are getting wild
It's difficult to raise a child
Cause growin' up in a lost environment
Every day becomes a new experiment
Now we are faced with problems
But if we come together we can solve them
Before we start to solving, here's a sample
Who's coming forward to set the example
Inflation, starvation
Surviving takes a strong nation
Those who like to bring about static
Be aware of the true Asiatic
What you see was predicted before
We were already warned of this bloody drug war
Wherever you sell it wherever you go
Ya still being clocked by the cops, ya know
You're paid by the hours, they see time flies
While your brain's being showered by a bunch of lies
You say I'm no slave where's the lock and chain
Hmmm, on your ignorant brain
Skip to ya loo with your High Pro Glow
Ya not stim off life, ya stimulated off blow
Or the new improved, ask beaming Jack
Criza, criza, crack
Chorus: You're living foul, living foul
My people you were forced then brought
Stripped from your jewels brainwashed and then taught
To hate, deceive and dislike each other
Separating themselves, you're not my brother
Sit up at home for a mystery
Face-valuing things that you can't see
Can't taste can't smell, hear or feel
But senses prove everything is real
I'm here to present a positive way
If strong you'll accord if weak you'll stray
Drug users are stuck in the mud
Another 20th century modern day chud
These cannibal humanoid undernourished dwellers
Just took your check to the heroin cellar
Dope addicts, that walk and roam
Might have Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
AIDS, doesn't come from me
'Cause I've studied and learned my history
It had to be something evil to bring that about
This is showing and proving beyond a shadow of a doubt
Chorus: You're living foul, living foul
When you wake up, to a brand new day
And you think about your salary or your pay
You think of negative things, should I get involved
Caught in crime, serving time, that's problems to solve
So you think about it, say that you must quit
Smoke a blunt, then you do the same old shhhh
And while ya high you don't truly know why
You spent your cash so that you can buy
Some herb (word) and some Old E (yeah)
A fifty cent Philly so the herb can be
Rolled up modern style to what we call a blunt
Know the facts is true don't try to front
Or stray away from the positive message in the song
That's only showing and proving you're not strong
And the strong is what we need today
Why? They go the opposite way
Chorus: Of living foul, you're living foul
The words right now flowing off my tongue
Is for the old, the young, the one's that's strong
Those who are worshippers of diamonds and gold
You should not be bought and you should not be sold
Those who always want but does not need
Is slightly controlled by the hands of greed
If you rob, steal, backstab and abduct
Sooner or later you will self-destruct
Chorus: You're living foul"

Was too heavy for the chevy's is chased out the station

Heavily armed military is necessary, it's a gamble

Powerful parable ditties might harm
If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs
Flashbacks to the duel of the iron mic

Them God struck, religious niggaz call it bad luck
Rap celeb, you got caught up in the web
Now bees are stingin, yo that niggaz em-singin'
I'm just swingin' swords strictly based on keyboards
Unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws
I throw raps that attack like the japs on pearl harbor
MC's be out like bank robbers
Fleeing the scene, to be a sole survivor
DJ the getaway driver
Tried to dip but he dive I socialize on vocal vibes
On tracks stabbed up with razor sharp knives
Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it
Hard to define it, when narrow is the gate
For fat tapes and then played out and out of date
Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate
And from that point, the God made a statement
Draftin tracements, replacements in basements
Materials in sheet-rock, to sound proof the beat box
And microscopic optics received through the boxes
Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical
Punchlines, that's unstoppable
Ring like shots from glocks that attract cops
Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop
But we only increase if everything is peace
Father u c king the police"
47,Luminal,2002,Legend of the Liquid Sword (2002),Hip Hop,GZA,"(Intro: GZA)
This is a tale of a town with the population
Of approximately two thousand people
They small close in their community with crime
And murder, we're virtually unheard of
With front doors, were always left unlocked
A place where mayhem only happens in your wildest dreams
Boy...
(GZA)
For some, the sun will never come out tomorrow
Like those in this heart pounding tale of random horror
Of a body count, after trashin' it, they done with it
Victims inflicted with passionate punishment
Specific offers of horrific torture
That left crime scenes, that retired law enforcers
This ruthlessness knew no bounds, as he beat him down
Shot him while gagged and bound, kept the whole town
Shocked, with they doors locked, fire arms cocked
Major roads blocked, no one knows when he knocks
As a kid he killed three pets of an attorney
So his child passion became a life long journey
Grew into a world of destruction, abduction
Left many body parts flowin' on the Hudson
Whether fountain or ditch, after the ride you hitched
Screams is high pitched from scars you can't stitch
Mutilated and decapitated, white collar chicks
Just from his involvement in local politics
His outfit stained with the blood of the slain
While his backyard full of skeletal remains
His goal in life, was preparation for death
An autopsy showed affixation, loss of breath
Was it his fascination, for strangulation
The lynchings in the '20's was his inspiration
Unspeakable acts that made front page
Motivated by an unexplainable rage
(Interlude: samples)
""A suspected killer plaguing this community
Has once again eluded police and detectives""
""We have no leads, no photos, no suspects""
""This nameless, faceless murderer
Has killed a couple, execution style, in their own home
Smashed a 12-year old Little League ball player skull, with a baseball bat""
""We have no leads, no photos, no suspects""
(GZA)
The State psychologist, forensic pathologist
Warned the detective to search beyond the obvious
They ruled out the possibility that the killa be
Physically fit with athletic ability
Talley and murder, on his agenda
There was no word, and it's code for ""surrender""
So when the headlines had announced the arrest, the repercussion
Was his trial became a lightning rod for discussion
Compellin' evidence, statements from residents
Validated guilt as he maintained his innocence
From the hair to the fiber, broke the bondage wire
The stains on the carpet consisted with saliva
DNA directly linked to the psycho
Luminal made it glow, was test to Type 0
For many years, a lot of murders went unsolved
A lot of blood resolve as guns still revolve
The bullets had names that made the frames shatter
Most savage massacre that made the brains scatter
Detectives astounded by the scope of the crime
Made a hard discovery from one of many signs
While questionin' a man he picked up on a scanner
He reacted in a loud and agitated matter
And once they tried to read him his rights
He turned cold as ice"

Mic trippin', from rock skipping
Off the local brooks, not knowing
Heavy weight, throwin' vocal hooks
Ryming off Apache, the Rza scratch thee
Records borrowed from Home Alone kid known as latchkey
Break beat fanatic, crates deep in attics
Forty-fives marked up, looped with static
Rap ring heavy, each link in my chain, trucks Chevy
Flare ripped from the magic lair, of medley
But deadly I merge forward, with a sharp spear
He must return now his flight departs here
Like Sittin' Bull, I lay with my bow pulled
Arrow poisonous 'cause my enemy clip's full
Stay in the venue, with the party promoters, life parolers
Half the crowd wild, 9 m&m holders
Apply boulders, smash your allied soldiers
Intimate footage roll off the cameraman's shoulder
Many-a-die for fame movin like Leroy
Can't be one and the same, nah it ain't b-boy
The decoy, scan this with high tech radar
Till my mic strike, leave a state-size crater
I came into this with the writer's block
To prevent a sudden shock, on a large flock
Clips are uncut episode, invinciable armor
I blaze one, once I struck the match off my bomber
Adjust this, till its EQ'ed like never
Watch a mega watt bang spot, raise the lever
Its operation cobra, it's over
Control the globe slowly, the bold soldier

My rough cut metal tapes, quick to break labelmates
Won't hesitate to negotiate your table stake
First lesson came from the session, room one
From the longest awaited, but the strongest made it
Complex, complicated, compressed elongated
Homicidial sub-title, Wu claw banga off the ocean shore
Kid jaw, cut with the jig-saw
Intern engineer, vest on the youth
Make the mic booth bulletproof from sparked wires
From autofire, rapid from the verbalist slangster's gat
Two hit Tucker she labeled it gangstar rap
Unseen heard, struck the vital nerves
Of some sort, courts got papers to serve
Still bang 'em in the head, just lead no eraser
One shot, no chaser, who gonna replace her
You punch-drunk swingin' your keys on your index
Showin off your Rolex
Didn't see the joe text, you filmed it on bolex
Smashed with the largest full finger name ringer, life clinger"

Yo this is the Gka-gka-Genius
And I got the brotha Prince Rakeem on the side
You know we got the sess bones in the house
And yo God I'ma pass you the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, so I can rule the micraphone
Verse One: Prince Rakeem
Rakeem is feelin' lovely, word a pocket full of dough
A little drunk, reaction's mad slow
Thinkin', should I go to the club scene
And do what? And bag a rub-a-dub queen
Another thing, beyond the cream, I wanted to get ripped
Put my lips on a blunt tip
It's been two weeks, since I last sparked it
Went down to the club floors
Five dollar fee, plus ID
But a brother like me, gassed his way in for free
Word, took a bar seat
Got a tall glass, of sex on the beach
Turned to my left, saw this girl she was slammin' sir
Ooh, what ya do kid? I examined her
Pushed up, I tried to bag her, for her name
What happened? I didn't have the game
Overwhelmed, by a scent in the air
Could it be? Yes, yeah, a potent bag of sess there
It was Raekwon and Loud Jerome
They had a bone, you mean a blunt? A palmetto
I said pass the bone, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
They passed it, took one pull I was blasted
Felt kind of stimulated, fan-tastic
We approached the weak cypher
Did you surprise her? I tranquilized her
Bagged her, for her name and address
Slid to her rest, achieved mad success
But did you bone her? Did I bone her?
Did I bone her; you shoulda heard her moan
Pass the bone, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone

Drinkin' forties right down to the suds
Ready to flow inside and rip the mic phone
Hmm, and all I needed was a sess bone
And guess who come down the block stumbling drunk
Ason, with two bags of skunk
Pull out the blunt put the weed inside
Roll it up tight, then the flame was applied
Inhale, but not pertaining to cough
Exhale, you know like two pulls and off
Stimulated kind of toxie
Seen a girl who was foxy, yo but she needed
OxyWash, oh my gosh, yo not to disrespect
But back to the subject
The brothers rolled up on the scene that I had known
Smelled the skunk and said ""Yo pass the bone!""
I said, ""Lounge G"" there's not enough to pass around
So go get a bag from Uptown
I gave a pound to the brothers who was sweatin
What about the Wisdoms? Yo they was stressin me
""Hey Genius, Genius, when ya Come Do Me
Step to me, you know screw me""
Just another red bone, that I had bagged in the red zone
And took home to get my head flown
Forget about the weak cypher, so I slid to the back
Leavin' tracks of smoke stacks
That originated from the sess crops
Give me the mic and watch me get props
Pass the bone, yo, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone (6X)
Pass the bone, so I control the microphone"
52,Path of Destruction,2007,Pro Tools (2007),Hip Hop,GZA,"He was raised in a house where he got scared of attention
Twisted yet methodical mind, not to mention
Circus like atmosphere, story book upbringin'
Neighborhood full of married couple who love swingin'
Creature lived the life, he spent it in the spotlight
A teacher was his wife who was stabbed and shot twice
They attended a church where they both were active
And a little bit of rope he gave others was attractive
He rule with the iron hand
If the mural wasn't hot enough then he'll swing the fryin' pan
Heavy as the hammer of Thor, you know he suffer
From the consequences of broken vowels and law
A convicted felon for armed robbery
At the time where he had sank into deep poverty
Forsaken by his mother and father, Christ achievin' the talent
He attended the sheet on the path of destruction
Today's prisons are filled with yesterdays juvenile delinquents
Convicts who entered crime even before they entered puberty
On the path of destruction
They remember how old I was when I first got in trouble
Me? Around nine, nah, six, seven, okay
He ended up on the block with kid scooters and ice cream
But ended out in foster home until he was nineteen
Stealin' for food and didn't do for enjoyment
At the time of lay off, shut down and unemployment
He moved into a new world and seek this fortune
And suited himself to the times with extortions
A hustle that was ruled by men and murder
He earned enough for his daily bread and wanted to move further
He knew no good, come from such a sin
Had issues as a kid, so he held it all within
And he pursued the game so happy
On a path of destruction even though the road was rocky
Very caught up in his own drive for dominance
And to know that he would pay in the end was common sense
Some say he had a long deserved death
And then he felt the lead when they were told he left
[Incomprehensible] assault and battery
Plus, mortal techniques, breakin' and enterin', burglary, purse snatchin'
On the path of destruction
Shopliftin', hand graffiti, possession of stolen property
Possessin' and distribution of narcotics
Illegal possession of weapon, assaultin' a police officer, larceny

The echo chamber enhance the flow wit the block party
Keep an MC head spinning like Dark Bacardi
This B.A.C. is 2.3
Now the liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free
So inhale, exhale, breathe and get well
Kick something live stop chirping like Nextel
I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever
I paint the town red, with many heads are severed
R-A-W, I still bring trouble to
Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to snuggle you
Dart heat your breastplate, meet ya death date
Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate
No other way to describe a catastrophe
The plan was drawing blood and displayed it graphically
Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter
Horrific torture, by prolific authors
Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top
It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped
So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft
A little rock'll turn 'em into Ivan Koloff
Why do the Gods make MC's study from
Thirty five, and fifty year, then try to become
Under the study with the sword above the head
So he would keep in mind under the open pledge
(Masta Killa)
Fierce glisten, something so sharp
Piercing, swords cling, the vigilante intimate
Close combat, this is MC'ing at it's best
But there is no contest, sent I'm this
Speaking of a test, this and try to question this
He so different with the swiftness, godfather civilization
Shell casing, universal nation
Could he be the one predicted, presidential sent in
Old school soul to war us, be the growlest
Asiatic arctic flow is so frigid
(RZA)
Is it, the Zig Zag, I'mma pay you a visit
Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard
World, I'm not the same
I go somewhere, don't remember how I came
Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?
Or the Digi being stained on my brain
Appear from a cloud of smoke, the voter's on choke
If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke
Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff
To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough
I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron
Ascended like Wu, so coming down from Mt. Zion
Superlogical this, superlogical that
Digital, take it back with superlogical rap
Have a shootout, at midnight, the sequel's quicker
Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker
You distressed like the damsal, lost like little Hansel
Your flame couldn't generate the heat of a candle
Me, I be a Killa Bee, keeping exilery
Gold-plated desert e, shoot ten millime'
Master the millipede, you try to end the sea
Your body being found in the neighbor yard artillery
A black blind governor, a rich white mayor
Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer
Bobby has invaded, now the whole town's slated
Your decapitated head is being took and operated
Up and down the avenue, I drive a shatterproof
Benz, and all my men's are tattle proof
My mic is a dyke, my life is a light
A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?
You get trapped in my shadow of dark, ark, who goes there?
Power-U smells like carp, don't put your nose there
Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding
And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding
Ain't nothing but bones, we plotted the sand
And spread it out, over 20 acres of land
Some call me Steels, 'cause it's hard to bend me
C-Cypher Pigs, can't apprehend me
In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash
Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash
Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet
Moving with a click that stick like dry porridge
Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?
To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here
Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice
Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic"
54,Phony as Ya Wanna Be,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"When I hold a mic in my hand, it's devotion
Then I began flowing in a smooth steady motion
'Cause I'm contented to know that I've invented
Poetry which has been highly complimented
Thus how I rhyme is what I feel on stage
And from a fraction of a thought I can write a whole page
I'll just pull a notebook from off the shelf
And like Salt-N-Pepa I express myself
To make most of you know me, and some of you don't
But when it comes to cold challenging, I bet none of you won't
Arrange a battle, improve your style
Against a brother with a totally different profile
Most of you flake cold front ya flex
And hesitate on rhymes that should've been Memorex
But you forgot I remember you're an amateur
Mystery worshipper, now I prefer
That I remind you or tease ya on who's the boss
'Cause you suffer amnesia, that's memory loss
Well get this, just as quiet as it's kept
MC's on the chart from the start has slept
Let's shake them, wake them, they should be woke
For what? They take MC'ing for a practical joke
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just as phony as ya wanna be
You present yourself to be the quiet storm
You're a sneaky little snake in a devilish form
But as they say, yo, to each its own
And to each one who plays with a microphone
Abbreviate microphone and M.I.C.
Meaning what, myself, I, you see
I invite those to battle me, then they're through
Bust it, I'm not prejudiced, you're invited too
The rap convention or the MC show
I have rhymes to block those who hit below
The belt, that means biting a rhyme
Yes, I'll wax you, tax you and plus save time
Now who is known to uphold his own
And words are heard like a strong baritone
Freestyle techniques that's wild and bold
That'll smile in your face and still come so cold
That I'll freeze you to the point of non-defrost
Now you're trapped in the Land Of The Lost
Should I, could I, would I lose
When it's a selfish sore loser like you I choose
To roll your big eyes and suck your buck teeth
Because you're upset that you ever caused beef
Yo homeboy, I never meant to tease
But it's a slaughter, can someone help him please
Feeling uncomfortable, then loosen your belt
Once The Genius gets heated up, suckers will melt
Then after ya melt, ya start dripping like water
Then you can say this was a Goddamn slaughter
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just phony as ya wanna be
Ain't no rhymes like the one I got
They put competitors in a trance, y'all
Radio stations ran them a lot
They made children play and dance y'all
How dare ya mention you're an MC
When the crowd disagrees on who claim to be
'Cause your battle piece are the rhymes you release
And that only make the crowd boos increase
Hey, may I say I'll stay a DJ
MC who try to defeat me or portray
One who claims he gain much respect
But in a battle, straight up and down, ya getting wrecked
'Cause getting with me is definitely a slaughter
Or diving in a pool head first without water
So don't set yourself up to get brutalized
That only happens when you're not energized
Bit I'm so damn energized, I'm energetic
That I can wreck a microphone 'til it's pathetic
Okay, got it in your head, correct
That I'm victorious on any subject
You disbelieve, then huh, call the title
Then after one rhyme, you'll be calling me your idol
It's like... zap... another one on my jock strap
Now you walk around praising my name
'Cause I'm slamming and I make you feel the pain
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just phony as ya wanna be"

Vision impaired, when the silhouette emerged
One nut out the clan get your whole click banned
From radio pd's cut your raps man
Forcin me to move on from one world to another
On the gulf, from the fuel jet to hover
Take cover wit the radical, urban latino
No hip-hop connection wit us and Janet Reno
I do an interview and they aim to trace my essence
To know more than is necessary blunts your weapon
My group's nova, remain unsober
And serve high times wit king cobras I shoulder
Low-post MC's, your whole style ?lafeast?
Second to get your word up, then the troops unleash
Creative ?low fling? to the grand opening
Wit my ray gun scoping, you're hoping
Uniforms be fridged when they walk the black beat
In the heat, of razors exposin fresh meat
In bedrock and gambling - rolling stone, out of zone
Where they can't monitor my 'xact poem
Collide wit the tiger beat, rappin' raga

She dated jolly green GIANTS, that, flew on JETS
An A-list actress, who was never walked off sets
She loved stuffed animals, especially BEARS
Was a role model, like a CARDINAL to our peers
A PATRIOTIC tomboy, like Mary Ellen from The Waltons
A former lifeguard, who had the skills of a DOLPHIN
When I met her, she was in drama school and wore BENGALS
Drove a BRONCO, and she was far from star spangled
Had basic skills, and worked part time in mills
Raised buffalo's, 'cause she was behind them BILLS
Had a man who always roared like LION
A domestic violent cat, tackled the girl and kept her crying
Couldn't care, she was losing her hair, from depression
She was in the air, and there was some room for interceptions
I told her to stay strong, not to be ashamed
You're a ""ten-i-see"", you just need to TITAN your game
Her ancestors were CHIEFS, who ran with running deer
On the sail with the SEAHAWKS, who battled the BUCCANEERS
The REDSKIN garments, was suede coat liners
Held rare coins, frequently sought from gold miners
They were hard working warriors, we call over timers
Shot plenty arrows at COWBOYS and 49ERS
Her interesting background, but quite unusual
A great force grip, but out of bounds for a musical
She told me to call her, if I came to town
I started TEXAN her, soon as my plane had touchdown
Holding my luggage, in the hand that revealed the bad scars
She pulled up at arrivals, driving the JAGUAR
Her BROWN skin was soft, her legs beautifully shaven
Her house was fly, sitting on the roof, was a RAVEN
As we entered, I heard laughter
She walked into a large living room, I went after her
There was two of her, girlfriends, playing chess like they were VIKINGS
Militant as PANTHERS, they're resemblance was striking
Had on thongs, high heels, and belts that was garter
Energized like phones that just came off the CHARGER
I introduced myself to gain yardage
'Cause anything less then smooth, would have been straight up garbage
The shorter one met me, when I had a sky pager
Thought I rolled with robbers, STEELERS and panty RAIDERS
She took fruit from the orange bowl, it was in season
One of them said she loved the juice and kept squeezing
I knew that I was gonna get, wined and dined
It would have been a penalty, not to pass the scrimmage line
Now I laid back and relaxed, waiting for the kick-off
One removed the lip gloss, like she was bout to lick all
She caressed me, with fingertips soft as velvet
Dying for me to PACKER, as she stroked my helmet
And I was thinking these girls was SAINTS
But it was first and ten, and there was extra walls to paint
Before you know it, I had all three in a huddle
Buckin' like a COLT, before I released them puddles
They spread EAGLES like wide receivers
As I RAM them in the endzone, and they became true believers
(Outro: movie sample)
I be liking chess
'Cause chess is crazy, right there, that's the ultimate
It's like a great hobby right there, playing chess
The board, the pieces, the squares, the movement
You know, war, capturing, thinking, strategy
Planning, music, it's hip-hop, and sports
It's life, it's reality"

So what, looked up and made the bitches clap
That was because my style's clothes, not the raps
Ain't that shit, props for the clothing
Should of brought a mirror, 'cause lyric wasn't rollin'
My rhymes is all that and yours ain't shit
And at a party, your bitch takin' crazy flicks of me
She said I was nigga celebrity
But I'm from the slums, with the bums drinkin' Hennesey
Take a sip of some Jamaican rum
Put fire to my lung, tongue, teeth and gums
When it comes out my mouth, shit's hot and it burns

Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June

Hand on my nutsac, and spitting lung-ghies

Head down, facial expression he can't hide
Kid with no direction, seems confused
A victim who spent years, being abused
His moms a drug addict, she has a bug habit
Was a seven day event, since she celebrated the Sabbath
But she back slid, or that's what the crack did
She used to shoot up, under her sleeves, the track hid
A long time ago, the father left the picture
And as time went on, he was erased from the scripture
The son, he don't have much to treasure
And these kids that be getting on him, they do it for pleasure
Demons are gradually growing inside him
Way before he ever knew the courts would divide him
A wall around himself had became a shell
Was a whole new person, by the time the bricks fell
(Chorus: Rock Marcy)
It's a short race, duck the court dates
The pork gave chase, we had to walk straight
You know the forte, nigga it's a portrait

You trying to get paid by the lake
In each state, and do the shit at high pace

Under the dirt, there was nothing left but bones
A lot of tall grass around his tombstone
His mother left alone, her heart felt sorrow
No time to play with the precious time we borrow
They live next door, but he was worlds away
In reality, but such a high price to pay
He was easy to recognize from his dress code
Nothing but a firework about to explode
A short fuse, who was bound to lose in the struggle
His grandparents went through a great deal of trouble
To keep him out of jail, they even put they house on sale
To post bail, but the kid still failed
I remember when he called collect from behind bars
Suffering from two injuries and nine scars
He said he'd give anything to be out the pen
But it would be his permanent home until the end

Wait, I got to get mines
With a side of French fries, not kid sized
Sixes fives, I give off a pimp's vibe

Throwing rocks with my pitching arm
More bricks than when the Knicks is on, I'm sitting on
Shitting on your boss, been written off
Shots I'm licking off, the top like a different source
Ripping this raw like a kitchen chore
That's a block not chicken broth
Hold the pot with your mittens on
Dicks kicking in the door, and went to pick me off like a lintball

GZA buries the scrolls then months later it was,
Then years later it was written on loose leaf,
That old formula, that was stolen by new thieves
The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it
A piece of history, that they carried in they pocket
With the time factor, speed was the order of the day
What a delay, they were able to, what he would say
Why waste the slot time, of the ridiculous rhyme

From snakes, that was dirty as rodents
Therefore to a starving one, the call for hunger is potent
Some kids at a young age, their skull is fractured
Their mind store the sickest images ever captured
They draw pistols to resolve issues
To give 'em a sense of closure to expose the brain tissue
The shells was evidence, of a violent event
That left a young dealer bent, from a hundred rounds spent
The lifestyle, is a thousand miles from a minister
A small con game with something far more sinister
Peer pressure got him moving faster, a paradise of mutation
Open the gates of disaster
And murder is not the only cold blooded crime
You got fiends that'll torture the teens to get a dime
(Chorus: GZA)
Empty ya pockets, nigga, and don't move
You react any other way, and they'll prove
'Cause they ain't got a problem with laying ya ass out
Or putting in work, so you can see what it's about
Money got the flow, nigga, and don't stop
Whether drugs or a hoe, nigga, stay on top
'Cause they don't have a problem with running up in ya house
And burning it to the ground, after the shit is doused
(GZA)
I told him to save his breathe
'Cause he hovered on the brink of death
He wasn't living right before he left
His life took an unexpected turn
For those who walked that path, here's a lesson to learn
Coming from a nesting ground, of those on the growl
In a state of darkness, menacing on the prowl
Local rivals and known competitors
Who tried to stay clear from the, spying eyes of predators
On the hunt, they constantly taught persistence
Those with less heart, keep a respectful distance
The pray, no, it's too hot, to lay in the street
They find shaded areas, a few feet from the heat
'Cause if not, then, it will be costing one
Who will soon evaporate under a scorching sun
'Cause when the drought is on, it's little left
Then what lies ahead, dehydration and eventual death
(Outro: GZA)
We doing music from the heart, and not from the charts"

Powerful motor controls are mad stable
No room for error, injury proves fatal

After blowin' out the belt drive, Math' change the wheels
Bust ya, slash ya, we still thick like plaster
There's always potential full-on scale disasters
In the rec' (?) narrowly missin'

We must come see ya, despite imminent danger
Was short on fuel, before he flew out the hangar
From the cold dirt, rocks and all, rap galore
Watch the river flow backwards once we storm the shore

On the ropes, hanging from the towel and cliffs and slopes
The magnitude of the devastation untold
The collective laws of countless souls lay in the road

Insane flower, vein blower
Aim and it's game over
You know the name, flame-thrower
Got the code to the game and I hold the main controller
Soldiers from the jump, and today the same soldier
I stay low, play close to bank rolls
Parly with the greatest who walk the same road
Oh you ain't hear? Ain't nuttin' new but the gear

Find out what I'm about, know the legend
The slight disrespect, of his name provoke tension
No threat, bringin' the force like Bobo-fet'

We rhyme back-to-back, deangerous emcees
Move on track-to-track 100 bar measure
Lost treasure, those crews who never gave us much pleasure
Agreed the sound was good, shoppin' in the state, city, town and hood
Eventually they would
Lay down the trademark with god that built wealth
To dip-dive in the beehive was on self
For the power struggle, never clown but did juggle
The heavy load made it explode to mad rubble

On a camp-out, the kerosine lamp out, so we walked the road we paved
With trails that left vinyl foot-steps engraved"
67,Stay Out of Bars,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"Yo, check this shit out
Hangin' out in bars can become no joke
When you start to drinkin' gin rum bacardi and coke
Or Martini and Rossi, Asti Spumante
Even forties being shared throughout the posse
Jukebox is slamming throughout the bright moon
With the melody, of a soft Barry White tune
I sit back, like I got it made in the shade
Holding my dick as I talk to the barmaid
Excuse me miss, ""All right here I come
May I help you?"" Yeah, double shot of rum
""On the rocks sir?"" Mm-mmm, not at all
Who the fucks need ice inside of burning alcohol
I reach in my pockets to tip the whore
But I'm clumsy, my change start falling on the floor
I play macho, and say leave it for the sweeper
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP my fucking beeper
I start stumbling to the phone booth
Revealing all symptoms of drinking ninety proof
The phone booth door is closed, the light is on
The girlie just dialed nine-seven-zero porn
She sit back, with her legs cocked in the air
While her fingers do the walking through her knotty pubic hair
Her eyes are shut tight, she moans and groan
I hit the glass, ""Get the fuck off the phone!""
She jumped up and said, ""You just had to be the one
To interrupt me when I was having so much fun""
I said, ""Hold up, yo, bitch you think it's cute
To be perverted let alone a sleazy prostitute""
She said, ""How can you try to disrespect any female
Or me and my homegirls just because we sell""
I said, ""Pussy? That's what you call it?""
She screamed out, ""You're god damn right you alcoholic!""
She said, ""This is a public phone and you do not run it""
I said, ""So is your pussy but can I use it when I want it?""
Stay out of bars (2X)
I was in Times Square, loungin hard
Me and the Prince Rakeem, you know the God
Watchin females posin for a flick
Thinking of who would be the first to turn a trick
""Yo Genius you see that?"" ""Yeah"" ""So what you think?""
""Let's swing 'em to the nearest spot to have a drink""
I winked at one she said, ""Hi"" in a low pitch
Rakeem started flowing and bagged the other hoe bitch
Now we searchin for a zebra lounge
To settle down, right in the heart of midtown
Went to this place, called the Sting Pit
Got inside and seen all types of shit
Men who looked soft but acting wild
Dancing to the beat, Ten City style
Females who wore jeans that were tight
With faces resembling transvestites
Everyone in the bar gave my girlies mean looks
As if they were fugitive crooks
They smiled at me and the God, showin all thirty-two
That's when I caught the clue
As this red-bone, who thought she looked fly
Rolled up on me, and she said ""Hi""
That one little word fucked up the whole night
Her voice was deeper, than Barry White
I jumped up, and boy did I flip
I pull out a nine and I empty the clip
The place was flowin with crazy blood
A little midtown massacre type flood
And as we stepped off from the scene
Here's the message I got from Rakeem

Plus the wack shit in the game might tempt me
Quickly drop non-stop rec shot
What I took on the road on the lap and desktop
A mixture from up-tempo to slow grooves
8-Track figure that's mixed wit Pro Tool
I rhyme wit sense the paragraph was intense
Area's dense with the flow from the sentence
Engine powered by five hundred horses
Press by a threat of joint forces
For emcee's who spit rap to cause beef
'Cause they depend on wild kill for fresh meat
On the board, you're just a piece that's captured
Weak as the lamb that's laying in the pasture
The plug that gave ya juice, I might pull it
Can't escape these endless waves of rap bullets

We rely of the stealth of camouflage
Cut supply lines, flood ya man's market
From high altitude cover the land target
Lost in the desert, the journey is stressful
Where the rescues are unsuccessful
They perish while they search for it, intriguing treasures

Walking around with beepers and pagers
And who's beeping them? Oh it's the boss
Making sure no one is taking a loss
On his multi-thousand dollar operation
But how does he thank them for their participation
Whatever the pay, it's still not enough
'Cause what they got into is some serious stuff
Hours a day back and forth on the strip
Sending customers far on a trip
And this roots of all evil brings about war
Cause you wanna open up another crack store
Children can't play in the parks and things
Because a stray bullet might be headed for the swings
You never though about that, oh I guess not
All you thought about was owning your own spot
To putting more and more people to sleep
But ya heading for a pothole six feet deep
You see the problem has gotten more serious
And the community is getting more furious
Get it deep in your head I told you so
It goes way beyond just saying no
Chorus: Stop the nonsense
Remember Steve with the blue Jag?
They found him cut up and stuffed in a bag
He had his own operation uptown
And there was plenty other drug dealers he would cut down
In other words he was living foul
Shootin up neighborhoods acting wild
He said he had to protect his drug trade
Which we manufactured throughout arcades
He made sure his enemies felt the pain
WHoever he felt was a threat, got slain
Like Donna, who was only sixteen
And she was employed on another drug scene
She try to set up a hit on Steve
But he sliced her throat until she could not breathe
This is what happens when you deal
You don't care on who you got to kill
I might walk outside and get shot
Because I live next door to a drug spot
And I don't need this stuff in my vicinity
Of me being shot for mistaken identity
This is the stuff that Steve was on
Now he's dead long and gone

71,Superfreak,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"I hopped on the train and cold clocked a chick
Who looked good as hell but she appeared to be sick
I would say she had to look as if she swallowed a worm
Then again she could've swallowed several ounces of sperm
Giving me the eye as if I was the right antidote
So I decided to swing a smooth episode
While the train stopped at Grand Central turn
Before I knew her name I was massaging her perm
I said, ""My you look drunk, have you been drinkin' alcohol?""
You got a fever here's an Extra Strength Tylenol
She said, ""Great a comedian, comic""
She leaned on me, I said, ""Please don't vomit!""
She said, ""I'm not I just need some rest""
I said, ""A few more stops, The Genius house is best""
Got to my rest, her whole attitude change
But deep inside, she seemed sexually strange
Went in the room and she flopped on the bed
With wild-ass thoughts inside her headachish head
I went in the kitchen to prepare some food
When I came back in she was completely nude
I know it sounds weak but believe it or not
That the fever in her head ran straight to her twat
She was burning! Burning up out
It took more, than firemen, to put that out
And yo, I was hard, just as hard as a rock
That I can hit a home run, with my cock
She said, ""Let me show you what we do uptown
I huff and I puff till I blow your balls down""
Wild as a wolf from off Wilderness Ave
She said, ""My what a great big ah! you have""
I started dripping and dripping in consecutive terms
I know we must save water but that does not include sperm
Did you ever know a girlie who just loves to switch
From a Part Time Lover to a Part Time Bitch
While she's loving part time, she's riding on mine
She says, ""I love you long as you keep making me feel fine!""
In her behind, vagina, or heated climax
That I would sew, control, finger then wax
Now she's swingin' so low yo she flex like wrecks
'Cause she can set records on oral sex
There's no lie what I said, she lives in the bed
If she got married, she'd be a worn out newlywed
And if she heard these words yo she would not cry
Because sperm, the only damn tears in her eye
Her drip-drop face is the one I painted
Just stared in her eyes while she damn near fainted
As she choked, goggled, then spit up
'Cause cream, was flowing, all over her cup
On the bathroom floor 'cause her parents were home
And I just could-n't tolerate her moans and groans
""Genius, oh Genius, oh rock me so hard!
'Cause I don't want to stop, I love you God!""
But there's one thing she could never erase
That the thing she really wanted just sprayed in her face
So she regret, she ever swung low before
But this little hot bitch comes swingin' for more
It used to be one, now it's five fingers of death
That rips her insides, as she gasp for breath
To say, ""I love you! I love you! Forever so!
I'm getting hot getting hot let me blow let me blow""
What she thought was love, turned out to be lust
That made her live by the laws, in sex we trust"

And gets slapped in his motherfuckin face
Just because the motherfucker tried to base

And while I see his whole click passes by
Motherfuckers think they qualify
And for those niggaz want to try
The g.o.d., the g.o.d.
Verse one:
Yo
I'm not caught up in politics
I'm no black activist on a so-called scholar's dick
I come through with the wu and drop math
And versatile freestyles bombs and phonographs
And deliver, all things and other in weight
Searched to death, on how living things relate
Cause at a young age, I was molded in a religion I relied on
And got caught up in superstition
Scared to split pole, duck black cats
Once in a while, threw salt over my back
But with knowledge of self from off the shelf
Made things seemed complicated now small like elves
So turn off the lights light a candle, and have a seance
Pull the lid off the dean martin scandal
Witches warlocks spooks and holy ghosts
Rza lets defraud the host
Verse two:
We were on the same ship when the slaves were checked
I had to pull your card you was on the top deck
So I plotted my escape, I saw the thin line between love and hate
And fast from the hog on the plate
I suffered brutal pains, from whips and chains
Punishments that were set to wash the brain
So look listen observe and also respect this jewel
Drawed up, di-tect and reflect this
Light I shine, that cause my power to be find
Through the truth, which manifest through eternal minds
Purified gases and masses the same elements
That helped spark civilization classes

73,The Genius Is Slammin',1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"What I'm about to flow on is so dope
The average hip hop fiend couldn't cope
Or explain my style because it's hard to define
So the fiend scratch and think and nod to the rhyme
That I lay down in a straight narrow path
While beats are just flowin' off a modern phonograph
Bass loud, high hats crisp and clear
That'll never let a weak MC interfere
Or bring about some technical difficulties
So I got prepared and I wrote these
Rhymes that just broke loose from the brain
Searching for dope beats on the same plane
For you to write new rhymes, it is a must
But I come off with rhymes old as dust
Even as a speck of dust it existed
Ya got that?
Forget it, ya missed it
I'm slammin'
The Genius is slammin'
You flip me on the mic, no way
That's me being played in April on the first day
Now who's a fool? What do you strive for?
Prime time juice on the box and fans galore
Forget it, 'cause you're not hype as they want you
With a maximum of two hundred, your rhymin' IQ
Is ten, meaning thin, you'll never win
So erase that, I'm not gonna lose friend
I know you're gassed, ya charged, and kinda stuck up
But I define your challenge, a total fuck up
And it's critical, a crying shame
How many MC's challenge me, and die in vain
But you should've came with ya whole rap
Community, now where's your unity
'Cause what I see right now is you and I
And you're too weak to stop me from doin' my
Damage, you know, type of body and fender
Nah! Not the same way I did Brenda
But you had the audacity to step to me
Thinking you was Butch Cassidy and you could do me
How can you do me when you don't know me
And out of the hip hop styles, ya couldn't show me
One style that may have damaged me
But that's something you'll never see
I'm slammin'
The Genius is slammin'
M.C. means mic constructor I build
That have suckers running like what track and field
When I conduct, please don't interrupt
With ya ifs or ands or buts, keep ya mouth shut
The hip hop style that I own is highly known
To bury MC's like a dog bury bones
And in this field, yo, I'm extraordinary
And in my backyard, there's a cemetery
Of meek MC's who try to speak
And off preak technique that's soft and very weak
Yet they still have the heart to ask me to duel
And like Mr. T, I pity the fool
The shining chrome microphone is the device
That makes me stand out like men amongst mice
So respond to the stimuli then fly
Straight to the sky on a natural high
'Cause I'm the transmitter, buck wild and bitter
Thinking about trying me, then reconsider
'Cause if it sounds tempting boy, I'll double dare you
And speaking of your low life, I won't spare you
'Cause you're not worthy of the mercy
Anyway, The Genius is just blood thirsty
So take a lickin' as the plot thickens
While ya head is took, ya be pumping like a chicken
How can you ever say my style was played
When my rhymes be chopping shit like a switchblade

While you dream of riding the block, and raiding the fair
Enemies get cooked like eggs, while they scramble
He lived, but he still lost his legs, as he gamble
Couldn't sell what he shipped, the shell came from the clip
His lightweight belt, had got blown off his hip
No one on the strip, had the full explanation
Only that the victim had high expectations
Most never peddle above the street level
They cut they last deal with the devil, just to settle
For the crumbs that fell off the plate, of the late great
Who died in the federal state prison, behind gates
(Hook: GZA)
M.C.'s don't want none of this, so just stop
Got gimmicks with a bunch of facades, and just props
Don't take the song seriously, they just drops
For the radio, but you ain't crazy, yo

I'm on the regular, slang competitor
I shock journalists, slap magazine editors
Watch the D.P. as he moves towards me
Stuffed on his wordplay, and can't record me
Three dimensional, visual, write portraits
Enough in the photo lab, not to get caught with
Treason for any reason, will only bring about torture
Should have been the nine, on those offers
Ribs broke my plate in the fifth
The fact that the beat came from Muggs, was a hell of a gift
So I, took the present, sent some to the essence
Like the young M.C.'s, who'd only escaped adolescence
The sword remains in shape with endurance
The blades can be quick, when replaced with insurance
But never seem to stop, regardless of the tragedy
Hyperactive rhymes, slingers with charged batteries"
75,Those Were the Days,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"Those were the days, back in Junior High
For an 8th grader, my style was kinda fly
And just to prove I was an MC Pro
I often sponsored a classroom show
And the hype part of my imagination
Was making my homeroom a hip hop station
Minutes before the late bell would ring
I would greet the audience and then I'll swing
A lyric or two as the students barked
Beacuse my rhymes had sparked
Off somethign causing the class to mingle
To a rhythm which is now a 12"" single
Letting off many styles of hip hop
Holding the mic that I made in wood shop
Forget gold, my key chain was a cable
Two math textbooks were turntables
And for a mixer, something much cooler
A penny being cross faded on a ruler
Measuring dope beats that were flexed
From hands that played a drum roll on a desk
From my home girl, her name, fly as Emory
Sweet memory
I remember sitting in my art class
Drawing up lyrics kinda fast
The outcome, a masterpiece
Live shows with hyped up rhymes released
As if lyrics were flowing from the heavens above
I'll grab a mic and provoke a push to a shove
From boys and girls who broke necks to see
The lyrics G.O.D.
Those were the days
Now it's high school, lunch room's the scene
And I'm ready to flip the routing
In the cafeteria, period three
And here I come with the JVC
I go in my pocket and pull out a mic
Plug it in, check one-two... all right
Now who wanna show and prove their MC skills?
A brother stepped forward and tried to get ill
But when it came time to live out his name
He kicked rhymes that all sounded the same
But I did him in with a matter of time
And he was done with one victorious rhyme
He was shocked because he knew he was rocked
Along with his classmates from off his block
YO!, I'm telling you, I flipped his whole crew
One against one or one against two
Or three or four brothers who swore they can rhyme
Battled me and got taken out every time
From my style and my dope profile
Plus the period of time that I rocked for awhile
As a motivated, dominated supreme force
Cultivated, activated cream and source
The wise educated and born to be
The one who would flip an MC
Those were the days"

And in the place to be
I'm a true, true fresh MC
I'm a true fresh MC
I work real hard to achieve my goal
From building and bringing out my true inner soul
Which was once on a downfall and then uplifted
So why live life foul when you're talented and gifted
I've changed, rearranged my total direction
Searchin' for happiness, seeking for perfection
Living the true life, a real story
To make you realize the truth, not scream Glory
Glory, hallelujah, not here to fool ya
But to replenish your souls as I school ya

Always Correcting Errors which stops the temptation
Of you doing wrong singing the same sad song
Renewing bad histories for how long
A Long long time ago
Going for mind made The Genius a pro
And as you see who I be
I be The Genius and thus a true M.C.
Brothers need to study some lessons
They are the blessings to keep you from guessing
The questions that is asked by the seeker
Put on the beat and let me born it through the speaker
Peace, a lot of MC's like to say it
And some that advocate it they just spray it
Out and scream and shout, beyond the shadow of a doubt
They don't know what it's about
Just to keep you informed with the significance
How can I prove this through true evidence
Some make me laugh, think they droppin' math
Show and proven is a difficult path
Within the five percent, I am the live percent
Those who perpetrate are the jive percent
I be the universal, the Biochemical
Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head is the physical
That keeps rhymin' until it's unbearable
No individual is comparable
You have aproblem inform the technician
But he's not dealing with those of superstition
Those who like dealing with it superstitiously
Cross your fingers when you steppin' to me
I don't nee beefs and problems, riffs and static
Debates and arguments that's not dramatic
I need action, it speaks louder than a word
Especially when the word is loud and unheard
Word is what? My word is bond, your word is bull
Now it's your card I'm gonna pull"

Strands of heavy metal form the steel arch design
Fit together seamlessly, everlasting rap
Heat-pressure generated by a blasted cap
The chamber when ya rollin' the dice everything count
Clan royalty where the loyalty is paramount
Couldn't be more wrong prior to your perusings
When ya spoke of us, you understated the influence
As I bury my motor-action, implode a fraction
Of ya investigation when ya askin
Aware about in ya suit and tie, cruising by
The intrepid workmen that sharpen ya shooting eye
(GZA)
Like a child I have infinite patience when I write
The victim's dental records showed they loved to bite
The under like removed off a charged battery
Someone had his ear stuffed wit the sweets of flattery
A live wire, fired the shot in the booth
It wasn't even in the shooting distance of truth
Who broke the barrier causing mass hysteria?
At the darkest hour in the most densed area
In a stocking cap, undercover, while disguising
I'm rapidly advancing our horizons
This path of trade with the sharp blade, open to all across the globe
They simply heard my call
We hit up, the remote and primitive land
Left walking reminders that saw it first-hand
The music was a secure link we all think
On the same page as holding the ink, now whatchu think?"
78,Unprotected Pieces,2005,Grandmasters (2005),Hip Hop,GZA,"(Intro: movie sample)
We would drive them to the limit
Drive the invading forces to the limit
Where they lose their patience, and they will lose their hope
And the day will come, where they are driven down
To their lowest level and give up, this is the first time this Earth
That the habitual, articulate, how they plan to try and win
They plan to fight and do it here
But making sure, that they're losing their patience
And that they will lose their hope
The third rail will always live it to it's lowest level
(GZA)
Due the hellish events, the days were numbered
Agitated and withdrawn, the addicts wonder
Moving through eternal hell, constantly beaming
In the grips of evil, wrestling with their own demons
An ordinary ride, extraordinary challenge
That get caught between boroughs that was very hard to balance
Where the shots got louder, witnesses kept silent
Through those 12 terrain days of the summer, that stay violent
Soldiers that'll grill, to the boss' desire
Captivated by the idea of speed and quick to fire
Rushed, his orders came in a commanding tone
Carried out, executed within a, battle zone
Action, spoke louder than words, that made him walk
'Cause these kids had came with more music, than less talk
Thinkin' that they was bigger than U.S. Steel
They couldn't close a deal, without a cap to peel
But once the act of fear, is exceptionally calm
With unanswered questions, what harms the firearm
It beats killing the counter, horrific in it's own way
A groundbreaking case, that lasted for another day
(Chorus: GZA)
This is the city of fast money, expensive cars, topless bars
Movie stars and executives with fat cigars
Record labels that ain't stable, with low appraisals
And the lie that burn bridges due to fragile cables
(GZA)
Write off that unpredictable things could happen
Well aware of the sudden danger, we start scrapping
Violence can erupt within the blink of an eye
As a three night reign of terror, light up the skies
Other uprisings are in the years of making
The young start sizing up the hood, and get to taking
A high voltage power line, surrounds the gold mine
Soldiers on the front line, who sell dimes and hold nines
Many times enjoying themselves, much too much
They hit the clutch, before they pull out on such and such
It's a very unforgiving environment, 'cause one out of two
Can get an early retirement, for many different reasons
The tale of the tape, is uneven
What they perceive as a prank, had stopped them from breathing
He was known to run towns, and brutally gun down
He said it was a great risk for him to be around"
79,Unstoppable Threats,2005,Grandmasters (2005),Hip Hop,GZA,"(Feat. Masta Killa, Prodigal Sunn)
(Chorus: GZA)
This is hip-hop, M.C.'s get busy
It's not pop, you'll front and you'll get dropped
You're listening to slanged out goodies, and Timberlands and hoodies
With the rhythm that came from the streets
(GZA)
I was a young one at the time, but started Mic Trippin'
Had rhythm like Ali, when he was rope skipping
I got crazy, when I heard the break beat
I used to lose it on niggaz on 4th and Main Street
They couldn't stop the attack, once I moved forward
Many was drawn back, assault was seen awkward
Only armed with the bow, and a mad flow
Poisonous arrows on a mark, that was set to go
Traveling at high speeds, towards a target
I never hit bystanders in crowded markets
Documenters catch this most intimate footage
In the center they come close, label it the hooded
Remarkable clips, of an uncut episode
They was given the safe, but never was left the code
Close up of those, who have paved the road
Invincible armor like that nigga we call The Toad
(Prodigal Sunn)
Havoc on the block, shots from the ratchet, sizzle pop
Slugs spinning outta control, body's drop
You know the saying in the hood, fuck the cops
Certified on the clock, them ducks with metal glocks
It takes place on the planet in rocks
Take nothing for granted, raised by these thieves and bandits
The enchanted, sticky green keeps my eyes slanted
Hard times coming up in the ghetto, but the Sunn manage
Watch me take advantage, get it, split it, panoramic
The notes I quote, water like the great Atlantic
Never catch me frantic, swift with the antics
Bitch niggaz vanish, niggaz, they run rapid
Sun of a Man, son of the sun, son of a gun
Breaded from the slums of each one and teach one
What's done is done, son, the game is made
Stay sharp like switchblades, continue to get paid
(Masta Killa)
You know a muthafuckin' hit when it split ya wig back
Young Gatling, strapping a .38 revolver
It's going down, wait for the sound, my soldiers rally round
Ninja men, blending in, with the surrounding
'Nuff gunmen, 'nuff Flatbush yardmen strapped with the vest
No pussy test the God, the grounds is well held
Illegal desert eagle, cadaver dog
Search for the body that's lost, of course, it's BK
You heard niggaz got killed for sheik coats and big ropes
Legendary students that sold coke, some blocks that's still hot
From shots popped back in '88
The black gate where son lay, never made the paper
Just another caper pulled by a masked killer, broad day light
Crown Heights, some are Fahrenheit, heat blazing
Cops on the beat, stop the money flow of the street
My dough is whole wheat, the fam gotta eat
(Outro: GZA samples)
(Scratched up) ""Come On!""
(Repeated through the scratching) ""This is hip-hop"""

That's how it goes
Ooh
Heavy foot traffic jam the hallway all day
Adolescence workin for small pay
World so little, he could never leave his block
His home full of riddle, so he always need his glock
He coast with his eye open, keep his metal smokin'
Young wasted minds, fiendin on dimes, cokin
Forgot kids quick to break rules, and known to make fools
Out of many, down the streets be more safe than school
There's no diploma, that can break him from the coma
A bloody war in the country, the youth hungry
On the corner, hyenas amongst me
Yabbin 'bout the stories, they be hearin, always swearin
Can't even spell the shit that he be wearin
Caught up in the silk web of material
Superficial stains ya brain tissue, that's the issue
The young is lost at their own cost, dreamin'
Screamin how we never hold positions, that's the meanin'
Brothers of murder victims share the same grief
The elderly shake their head in disbelief
And no relief came till I aimed
And blast one shot and left my name
The GZA... *echos*
Just another victim
Of the... victim
Of the ghetto
Just another victim
That's how it goes
Ooh
My residence is a city where army veterans smoke rocks
On torn down blocks, drug spots set out their shops
And cops watch, innocent niggaz roam in flocks
Romanism in tops, papers and knots
Churches and liquor stores on every corner, plot to get money not
Some funny niggaz act like they could pop glocks and those who can't cop
Sisters givin' up ass a lot, brothers givin' up cash a lot
They be strugglin to become someone because their parents not
Just another victim of the ghetto, where lost minds settle
When the devil uncivils society and die free
With double 'W' followed by J-D around the necks
And wrists the God is now a dog, the earth is called a bitch
And all my people wish to get rich in this wilderness to push a lexus
Ice on everythin' from rings and braclets to the necklaces
Children molested within these pest infested buildins
Thieves uneducated in these schools, paint on the ceilins
It's peelin off, but all I see is lost black babies callin
""Please somebody save me, please somebody save me""

81,What Are Silly Girls Made Of,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
A neck full of gold, material things huh
That's what silly girls are made of
Verse One:
On a scale of one to ten I seen a girl about a nine
A slave of mental death of only she was divine
Walking down my ex-block, the block Munroe
I said, peace to her, the girl said hello
Well hell is low and the lowest you can go
Is thirty-two degrees, below zero
So I started to rain on this young girl's brain
Causin her a great mass of physical pain
She said, ""Tit for tat, step off my bra strap.
No diamonds, no gold, you cannot get a rap.""
Then I said, ""So what?"", as I grabbed her butt
She smiled for a while but her mouth kept shut
The girl is eighteen, just birthed a child
You're young in the brain and your thoughts are wild
You're on welfare, yo but you don't care
You say, ""FTF is always there.""
Yes FTF meaning face-to-face
The main headquarters of your local place
Where you collect your bi-weekly pay
To support the foolish habits you abuse everyday
What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""Yeah that's right, I'm juicin em, I'm juicin 'em dry!""
Is that what silly girls are made of?
Verse Two:
There has never been a dame in my entire life
My girlie, my ex, my next or my wife
There has never been one who tried to disrespect
Especially a member of the opposite sex
Yo bust it, there's somethin' that I gotta let out
But I don't want to be known as Ralph the Blabbermouth
Silly girls, they think guys are soft
But all they wanna do, is knock their boots off
And just from obtaining the common sense
You can tell that the girlies seem rather quite dense
Other than dense they play slightly bold
But from the statements I made they could not uphold theyself
They break down, and they start to cry and said
""Oh! I don't believe this guy!""
Now what are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""It's all about the finances"" ""Forget the romance""
Is that what silly girls are made of?
What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""Guys with cash"" ""can rock my big a--""
Is that what silly girls are made of?
Verse Three:
Silly girls on a strip, struttin back and forth
Watchin cars, thinkin' of G'n off
Lookin' for gentlemen, who they might swing
And attitudes, like you can get anything
You wear tight bodysuits under long coats
But ain't satisfied until a pervert slice your throat
You're young you're dumb and you used to be innocent
When young, now take a look at what you've become
A bloodsucker, trying to get all you can
Out the pocket of thenext girl's man
Just to clothe yourself in gold and jewelry
You wear tight jeans with attempts to lure me
Into your web, 'cause you're livin' like a spider
And playin' it off, like everything's Oreida
You come out late at night and roam the streets
Like thiefs, stalkin a piece of flesh meat
Is that what you do for a living get paid?
C'mon, there's plenty of ways to get paid
But instead of living the life that's clean and sturdy
You'd rather go out and get your knees dirty
What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""He better buy me some gold bamboozles"" ""And some Fendi too""
Is that what silly girls are made of?
What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
First of all, don't leave home without it
Without what?
The gold card
I'm tryin' to tell you now
I don't lay on my back for free
You know as they say
If you wanna Taney
Ya gots ta pay
Yo what's up gorgeous, what's your name?
Baby let's talk about your assets first
All right baby, well let's go for a ride in my new car
What kind of car you drivin' baby?
I got a new Yugo
A Yugo? C'mere
You go, get in your Yugo
And get on out of here!
Girlfriend, tell him about hisself
I don't believe him, he got champagne thoughts and Bud Light money
Bud Light money? A Yugo? A thirty-five hundred dollar car?
And you steppin to this? I take only Benz's and better love
Forget about the love it's all about the money
So let's go put on our silk suits and step to the club tonight
That's where it's at
Yeah, money"
82,Who's Your Rhymin' Hero,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"Who's your rhymin' hero
I use lyrics versatile, beat up, on any style
Treat 'em like stepchilds and smile
I grab the mic then I check one two
Brother's look, yo what he's gonna do
Hmm, you know I don't get too hyped
I just fully load up the brain and cock the mic
And blast off rhymes, within a matter of time
I'm like a mirror of organized crime
For slaying an MC who think that he might be
The first brother who could come up and fight me
Start running like you're looking for P.C.
Protective... custody
'Cause I'm blowing off, just for going off
You may think I'm showing off, 'cause every rhyme is flowing off
A dope beat that is so sweet to the eardrum
Gets the crowd prepared to hear some
Super, high-powered lyrics, specially chosen
The battle's a snowstorm and brothers are frozen
Thirty-two degrees below zero
Now who's your rhymin' hero (3X)
The Genius, is a rap professor
Casual dresser, you may dress fresher
But the way I speak is so poetic
Describe me on the mic, I'm energetic
Even if you roll up strapped with an uzi
Still your wack lyrics couldn't [Do Me!]
Yo, I'm not the type of guy
'Cause my lyrics are high powered, meaning fly
I'm not barn, I'm building hard
You thought that I was weak, well let me speak
With me being frozen this MC weather come to
All linked together
See I got wreck, wrapping things in check
You got germs, worms, plus a lack of respect
I'll be teachin, you couldn't handle
A style like mine, I dismantle
Just by pickin' up the mic, and start showin
I cold turn it out, and yo then
I get super serious strong and then furious
Give an MC something to make them curious
On, professors, in college
I stomp 'em out just with supreme knowledge
Bustin' up witches, yo I give stitches
Super-suckin-fuckin-lickin-some-sexy-scali bitches
I go off, and off men often
See the December's Primateen mist coughin
'Cause I'm the God building hard never barred
Bringin' crazy static to your attic
Now I'm known to flip a show
Now who's your rhyming hero (4X)
You have some MC's who get too hyped
From a ten word rhyme it took 'em hours to type
That's not MCing, just an MC being
Weak on his words and never thinkin' bout freeing
Poitive thoughts that I let come out
I'm The Genius of this, I know what it's about
'Cause on the mic I'm a leader, school I am a reader
When it comes to sex, a strong good breeder
MC's max but every one I wax
And collect the cash money without being taxed
Now that I have your attention, I'd like to mention
Don't battle me at any rap convention
If so I'll show all who wants to know
To detemine who's an amateur and who is a pro
Don't mean to get ill, 'cause I know how you feel
You lack words like mines, talent and skill
Now I'm known to flip a show
Now who's your rhyming hero (4X)"
83,Words From a Genius,1991,Words From the Genius (1991),Hip Hop,GZA,"One two one two check one two
The Genius in the place to be
Verse One:
I make the mic pump my mic makes the party jump
And poison beats make hip-hoppers stump
Their feet kinda wild, to give off sparks
But I'll still light it up when the place is pitch dark
Now that you witnessed me this get this correct, rap wreck
When I'm speaking it's the God projecting
Facts into brains of those unaware
Now you're afacing the truth in the square
Bitties like biting, then yo you should chew this
Your man wants to beef, then we can do this
Then when it's time for you to face the God
I'll be giving you the whole nine yards
With lyrics that breaks the laws of gravity
So sweet to biters it gives them cavities
And can't be healer from the strongest toothpaste
So keep biting to see how the truth taste
You need guidance and self-assistance
Cause you lack the training to go the distance
But I'll rhyme, to the fullest length
And this is just a fraction of the strength
Of the Genius
Words from a Genius
Verse Two:
I'll never sweat an MC then say I wanna be him
'Cause he makes a hit records and flips a coliseum
I learn to lead myself, not be a follower
I'm not a biter, stupid rhyme swallower
I created something funky fresh funky new
Brothers started playing money see and monkey do
Should I explain hip-hop, okay I love it
Simple definition but ya still don't know the half of it
All I need is a mic, a beat, then I'll step free
And flip like I'm bugging off Bacardi and Pepsi
Dancers on stage like Alvin Ailey
While I'm deep into the roots like Alex Haley
You wanna try me, and be worn and torn
Step forward, I'll get on and start to born
A pumpin self explanator rap
Make a sucker MC like you clap
Your hands, while you clap the sound's intact
You react like an infant respons to Similac
Or then again, could have been Enfamil
But for your information the rhyme is real
MC's wonder what's hip-hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just One Nation Under
A Groove, getting down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the business for the junk of it
When I'm premitted to break down a poem
I'm like knotty hair rippin out teeth from a comb
One by one so who you calling your troops on
Ya couldn't even bust a grape, with spike boots on
Biters are crooks and try to steal the stage
I read 'em like books, flip 'em and turn the page
I'm The Genius, you're living in deep fear
Go home and write and come try me next year
With stacks of rhymes or you'll be feelin' ill troop
You being stuck in the ice cream and didn't know the scoop
Verse Three:
Some say The Genius, has a style of his own
And his hands are like Vise-Grips holdin' a microphone
Flowin smooth, with rhymes that are rough
Because I can't get enough
So I practice not what I preach but what I teach
In which the critics say is improper speech
But it's proper, only to those who understand
Why I walk on stage with a mic in my hand
As brothers look on, label me as a psycho
Just because I'll jump on stage and grab a micro-phone
From a so-called said to be MC
Who admires me with jealousy and envy
My rhymes are delivered with style and potential
Words are flowin smoothly in a sequential
Order, revealin hidden tape records
Stuffed inside pockets and those I'll slaughter
But I don't get upset, when you bite and steal
I go home and write some ill
Stacks of poetry, page after page
Imagining the scen-ery onstage
I catch flash-backs of the seminar
As I crush the dreams of a wannabe star
Self-explanatory words are shifted
In a unbitten style 'cause I'm gifted
And talented, with the lyrical ability
Bound to fuck up a hip-hop facility
Damaging MC's who dare to enter
The center, then challenge the inventor
Of an impartial rhymin status
Followed a relevant apparatus
The way I come off on the mic is attractive
I can make a quadriplegic hyperactive
With lyrics of friction causing mics to spark
My style couldn't be bitten by a shark
MC's don't understand the way I be bombin em
Roll up and ask me what's the phenomenon
First of all homeboy when I'm battlin
I'm like a doctor shootin deadly insulin
Into MC's like that of a syringe
And dare you to seek for revenge"
