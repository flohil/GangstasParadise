Ooh... Puerto Rico
(Big Punisher)
Toma
Chorus: Tony Sunshine
Pronto llegara
El dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we won't stop
We always knew we'd make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top
(Big Punisher)
Puerto Rock Puro, not Menudo no I'm not the one
I'm studyin Judo, you don't know if I got a gun
It's Pun, from the X side of things, baguette inside my rings
Everything I want I gets, bada-BING
It's mine I Shyne like money that sound like Biggie
Fuck around my town, Boogie Down my city
Come around get pound, to the ground no pity
Watch the sound, fo'-pound twenty round milli'
Get smacked silly, for coming out your mug
I'm known for bouncin' thugs from the Tunnel to the Salsa clubs
Don't matter, put the chrome to your bladder
Splatter your abs, have you pissin in a plastic bag
That's a drag now you abnormal
Don't make me go out to rumble,
And put some motherfuckin stabs on you
The night is young and I'm already fightin hidin my gun
Promoter buggin screamin, ""Who the fuck invited Pun?""
(Big Punisher)
From San Juan to Bayamon, I'm the Don Juan beside the Don
Live long, get your party on
Don't let the liquor fool you, 'cause I'll stick it to you
Somethin' sharp to the heart, or somethin' big to move you
The Desert or the shottie, whateva you the body
That chose to be the dumb nigga at the party
Too much Bacardi started speakin' dumb
Then you tried to snuff Joe - must have been Puerto Rican rum
That's the hardcore, two years a sophomore
Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls
So get lost or take one, bones I break them
Pigs are bacon, so get fried if they come
You see that? I'm like G. Rap, 'Pac, Master P
All balled up with a twist of Marc Anthony
Recognize me I'm the one that's cockin the auto
Tony Sunshine please canten el coro
[Tony] It ain't over
[Pun] I thought you ain't like the beat
[Tony] Te digo que no se ha acabao
(Tony Sunshine)
La tierra del Borinquen donde nacido yo
Aha aha aha aha...
Es un jardin florido de magico primor
Aha aha aha aha aha aha aha...
Un cielo siempre nitido, que sirve de dosel
Y dan arrullos placidos, las olas a sus pies
(Frankie Cutlass sample)
A Puerto Rico...
A Puerto Rico...
A Puerto Rico...
A Puerto Rico...
A Puerto Rico..."
1,Banned from TV,2001,Endangered Species (2001),,Big Pun,"N.O.R.E, the movie
Comin' soon
(Timbaland, SHUT THE F**K UP)
Tryin' to be out in '98, you know ???
(I'm tryin' to watch this movie)
This the real shit
(Shut the fuck UP!)
'98, its ours
(Nature)
Ay Yo, Ay yo, Regardless of rain or snow, sleet or hail
I kick street tales, choking niggas like I'm sprewell
Golden state, holding your fate in the palm of my hand
Blow you away like its part of the plan
I gotta call it like I see it, talk it like I be it
Walkin' my walk, thugged out orthopedic
'Cause I'm soon to be up, give me room watch me heat up
Niggas try to stick me like abdul lerima, follow the leader
Make me go extra hard, yo nore should I hold back or show the repirtore
Quit at 16 or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers
I show them why it's so hard to reach us
I get pussy with my fathers features
Puff heavenly, see me at 6'1"" weigh a buck 70
Catch me in spots y'all niggas never be
Packed in like green bay
Harlem week to queens day
Performing acapella, no DJ
98 live, no replays
Make it seem easy, so tell a friend to tell a friend
That its them again, nature noreaga, wild gremlins
(Big Pun)
Yo, yo, champagne on the rocks
Pour on the fort knox lazura
Shark salad with cabbage
Pork chops and applesauce
Twin connection, disrepect watch your body cave in
Pump the shotty guagin, hit the shorty while he potty training
I ain't playing, I'm truly the worst
Simply the first to get his whole body fully reversed
Uzi it hurts, leave you double-dead
I'ma a bubble-head, I never listen to nothing my mother said
Ay yo I hold niggas ransom for money
Like johhny handsome
Been sonning niggas for so long
I think I got a grandson
My passion is money, a stash and a honey
That won't ask questions but will blast anybody
That's my kind of girl, kinda of world I want to live in
Not a cell or a prison or in hell's armageddon
Just a little ghetto
Where my niggas control the middle
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little
(Cam'ron)
Yo, yo been in rich places, sick places
Seen my story on 6,666 pages
Wages, I wrote six aces
And at the same dice games, I caught six cases
All over big faces, now it's tipped laces
Ready to dig faces, but the bang it ain't
Bitch spaces, niggas loading up they rib cages
Cats like to rip places
Bloody lip tastes, but the Cam is in big races?
But I stay in import the pig places
But the world know the girl though
I fuck her off a furlough
She'll be up, hook me up
All your sales could be luck
Only question for these ducks is
Baby girl can we fuck
You the type that need a wife
Thought L-o-x told y'all the key to life
Asshole, yo I don't play around
I lay it down
Fuck around, I spray around
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it
My ass, you can kick or kiss it
[Jadakiss] (Styles)
Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this
(Bust off) and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips
Like 2 thirds of a brick (Paniero and 'Kiss)
And kiss the crystal white fluffy part in the (back of a whip)
(See the plan is to stash all), and cash y'all
(The weed so strong), they gotta put it glass jars
Niggas try to smoke me out, (mope me out)
'Cause the rims on my new joint be poking out
(I'm about to have no feelings, shit is deep)
Do they dance with the devil when they sleep
(I wake up gripping the air, wishing the hit)
Shit that they kick in ya ear,
When your soul be driftin in air
My gift is half-rotten when I spit it tears
That shit'll drop down my eye,
I'm too tired to cry,
(And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die)
(They say you get what you ask for)
So get it 'cause you asked for it
(If a nigga ain't a thief) then he better have the cash for it
And we gonna be around till ya body rot
And if the feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
What! What! What! What!
(Noreaga)
Yo, yo! ay yo, there's two ways into the hood, one plain
The other smoke chronic like straight to the brain
Ay yo let's get loose, hennesey straight, with tomato juice
Queens stallion, my guns, fully Italian
Now y'all niggas recognize medallions
I play the best hood, o-t with tim westwood
Used to be on section 8, now my section is good
Thugged out niggas, we eat as much as we could
And I don't give a fuck what! yo I save my shit
And I don't give a fuck what! you can save your shit
Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
Listen to bob marley, you funny niggas like steve harvey
Frontin live with a weak army
I play the nice guy too, I'll smoke wit you
But the realness, I ain't got no love for you
That's why I never do a song with you
Not even if your babies mom fucked the crew
And promised to give us head and swallow too
I still say no, no is no, no can doe
Ya niggas drinking henneray, drinking my flow
Yo, thug shit thug shit what what
What the fuck is the deal
Thugged out entertainment
Untertainment
L-o-x
Terror squad
This shit is fucking official"
2,Beware,1998,Capital Punishment (1998),,Big Pun,"I gave you fair warning, beware... beware... beware... (2x)
--Mobb Deep sample--
Yo... what you thought punk, shit was sweet, now you can't sleep
Gotta keep ya eyes open wide and hide ya face from the streets
I'm like the beast with a warrant, far from alarmin'
Gave you fair warnin' now you on the stairs swallin'
I'm callin' out any rapper that I doubt, smack 'em in the mouth
Throw 'em in the yoke, BOOM!, then I knock 'em out
No doubt, Freddie Foxxx files 20-shot auto glock, BLAAOW!
Benny blind Puerto Rock style
Wit' a twist of black in the brow, twist ya cap and I'm out
Sleep wit' the fish-dips for yappin' too loud
What's happenin' now? Niggaz is hard as hell but they Gargamels
Pickin' on the smallest victim gives 'em heart to kill
My squad is real and holds it down the hardest regardless
Besides of the largest, we polish the floor
With the rawest hardcore artists
Flawless victory you niggaz can't do shit to me
Physically lyrically hypothetically realistically
I'm the epitome of catchin' wreck, catch you when you cash your check
Smash you when you pass then jack you for your fuckin' Lex
Nothin' less than the best if the squad did it
Hard-headed niggaz better beware and fear like God said it
Ay-yo I warned you, now all niggaz could do is mourn you
I'm born to kill and still thrilled, I put it on you
There's no regrets, remorse, only results and loneliness
Only the strong survivors strive through life as warriors
All of us die, some of us kill, even massacred
Who wanna try? Punisher will if you ask for it
I'm hazardous for your health and hell's your next stop
For real my shit's cocked the world has just stopped...
(Pause)
I'm not the one you should be underestimatin'
Come test your fate an' I guarantee I'll be under investigation
You can't handle the whole, I'll slam you on your skull
Or we can go blow for blow like Evander and Bowe, ya never know
However though I still hold the title
When all my rivals the chance to dance who missed the homicidal
Hand on the bible I swear to defend my crown
I've been around since forever and never let it touch the ground
Don't fuck around and catch a rude awakenin'
My crew's basically waitin' patiently for you to move your patrons in
Then we'll surround you, form Desert Storm and pound you
Look around you, Terror Squad's everywhere like Soundview
The Boogie Down do it like nobody, who are we?
The foundation, you're facin' a whole army...
(Fat Joe)
Yeah yeah yeah, whassup now potna??! Know what I'm sayin'? Think this
Just some rap shit? We do this shit for real... Terror Squad nigga!
Fuckin' shoot the place up! Muthafuckas know the time. This
Muthafuckin' rap game. Joe Crack, Big Dog Punisher, Full-A-Clips crew
What da fuck... WHAT???!
Beware... beware... beware...
(Fade out)"
3,Boomerang,1998,Capital Punishment (1998),,Big Pun,"Niggaz is flossin a lot, time to start extortin' the plot
Just a portion of prod' off the top for my Porsche and my yacht
Somethin' for the cops to keep 'em blind, so we can crime
With piece of mind, turn the key and shine without bein down
Time to expand, New York to Chicago, Colorado
You know my motto, clock G's and rock keys like Drago
Pablo Escobar and Dom Perignon
We're buyin out the bar, with Don Juan, and every woman's Shawn Dawn-ing
Long donging 'em down like Shawn Michael does and I'm like a psycho
Fuckin' suckin the butt like liposuction
Up and down with the tongue twister, c'mon on sister
Big Pun's used to cock and squeeze like a gun tester
Crushin sister's backs with the demon snap, hit you from the back
Close your eyes relax, let me feed the cat
Livin' fat, true mack, niggaz was catchin feelings
Dealing with a smaller deck it just wasn't as mass appealing
I started feeling funny, niggaz comin' short with money
I called my Son he told me chill he'd be over with twenty
Punny what's the deal, niggaz wanna kill me
He said it's real, they jealous and tired of seein me Willie silly
Had more to claim, niggaz throwin' shit in the game
Gave my wife some pictures with me and bitches runnin' the train
It's like a dream, I called my team and started flippin
Lock the clip in started liftin niggaz off the ground like a magician
I skipped town, be back around when things quiet down
I lost the war for now but it'll take more to hold me down
""Top of the world ma! Ha ha, top of the world!""
Yo, this is the bad time - boomerang, bring it all back
Flashback, livin' prosper', eat well and get fat
I was Pop Dula, popular to the masses
I miss the E-Classes, rocking game with def glasses
Rock bottom struck and threw my world off it's axis
Boomerang - plan to come back like Bronx rap
Storm like the Redcoats through anything in my path
First you shine like sterling, then you broke like Rick and Pearling
(Big Punisher)
Now should I slit my wrists, go for it all or call it quits
Picture me taking my life, leaving my wife and my daughter shit
Wish I could slip back, and switch the memories
Lift the felonies from my record I respected my enemies
Live like the Kennedy's, above the law, fuck 'em all
I'm coming for the rich thieving 'em even if I wasn't poor
I seen it all like I said before
The streets are for men at war and the beasts are the predators
I shed it all first and beat a prob every source?
Of course, I bury any adversary tryin' to floss
Just because, the reason I leave 'em lost in the sauce
Teein off like we up North just for bein soft
A beaten horse like a slave gettin' minimum wage
Fillin the gauge, front page, these are the last days
Cash pays, and rules - the root of all evil
Shootin amigos for lootin perico pollutin our people
Movin kilos like it's all good, through every ghetto
I ain't judgin, but buggin how we floss so many levels
The devil's got us by the balls, that's why the law allows
The drugs to overflood, knowin' we gonna buy it all
It's time to call a world order where every girl's your daughter
And priceless as ices and pearls fresh out the water
I'm gonna get mine, either from crime, or through the bible
Whichever way, you better pay, I'm feelin' suicidal"

Yeah, check me out...
""Remember Pun?""
Terror Squad...
(Triple Seis)
I'll battle ya all, from the charts to ghetto stars
Face Triple Seis the God of War like Mars
That leave MC's smashed but my Squad, is odd
Y'all never seen relish, but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas, rockin' the (?) sweaters
The ones who paid with they life
I rock for forty days and forty nights, and every verse is tight
Better than before; rough, rugged, and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This ain't a game, I'll leave you maimed
Allow me to explain I thrive on the pain while robbin your chain
Knahmean? Do him and the fiend, grab his wallet
Leave a trail-blazin' like (Rasheed Wallace)
What's today's knowledge? Hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin' on the corner so won't speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money son that's all that it's about
No doubt, silence of code, violence of mode
Under control, can tell my real niggaz really roll
On the low tryin' to blow trees
And for no reas', we hit a nigga up for mo' cheese
Better relate and start to think, or be the missin' link
I got my +Hustle+ on like Larry Flynt
(Big Pun)
We brave in the heart, playin' a part, amazingly smart
Razor sharp, futuristic raps, state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars
First it was Nasty Nas now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low, business never personal
Just some words to know - if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him now they inject those who defy him
Depends on the state if death is my fate then cool I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me
Aight crew? (No doubt Pun!) Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, comin' with the thunder and the lightning
Invitin the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, snipin your moms, right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm it's the ghetto God
I rip a nigga heart out his frame while I scream TERROR SQUAD
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she'd starve on a diet instead I'm a God in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzlin beer bottles by the dozen with Devin that's mi hermano

You ain't understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldn't think I did that shit
I'm from where the guns love to introduce theyself
Reduce your health, little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready, for this big dog who hold a nine steady
I'm John Blazin' when you see the arms razin
Shit crime heavy already, I keep it sharper than the long 'chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers how you more ready and switch bigger
Than more berry I'm a cherry you a strawberry
If you lost that mean I'm on top of the whip
You plottin to flip, fuck around and get shot in the lip
You stop with the quick and never make another move
Even your mother lose, I hurt up your pops to pay your brother dues
""Big Pun..""
""Forever... do you understand? FOREVER!"" -> KRS
(Fat Joe)
Make way for krill, I don't play I spray for real
Blow your top with the glock, that's my favorite kill
Blaze your crib with like thirty shots
I'm already hot, but my last one is with some dirty cops
I play the streets with toast cause the thieves is close
Wanna keep your post then don't beef with Joe
Still niggaz think I won't bring the heat out
That's like sayin' Puff ain't never beat up Steve Stoute
Truth first, Terror Squad, shoot first
War with me and you guaranteed to leave the earth
I'm, dressed to kill, my niggaz rep for real
Joe Crack's back like I never had a deal
Hungry and shit, it don't get more lovely than this
Blow a hole through your ribs just for runnin' your lips
The street's a trip; either you deep or you sleep with the fish
I keep a fifth for them niggaz that's seekin' to flip

5,Capital Punishment,1998,Capital Punishment (1998),,Big Pun,"(Big Pun)
It's mine, it's all mine you understand? Just me and my peoples. Can you dig
That? 21st century, but I never see it. Bottom of the corner, baby. Ours
For the taking.
Verse one: Big Pun
Yo; I've seen child blastin a man, some with them are turning to murderers
Let us stray by the liars' death clause, fires observing us
Watching us close, marking our toast ??? is purposely overtaxing the earnings
Nervous, burning down the churches
They're scared of us rather beware than dare to trust
Throw us in jail, million dollar bail, left there to rust
Lets call in order, give ourselves a chance to enhance, broader
Advance where the minorities are the majority voter
Holding my own, I'm living alone in this cold world
My sister just bought a home without a loan, you know girl
She's an exception, some people can leap to the impression
See, me, myself I start flippin and fall victim to deep depression
I'm stressing the issue here, so we can cross the fiscal year
Tired of getting fired and hired as a pistolier
There's no longevity living off negativity
Fuck it, I'd rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery
That's how the city be, everybody gettin' they hustle on
Judge singin' death penalty like it's his favorite fucking song
Word is bond, taking my life you know they lovin' it
Got off the government and its fuckin' capital punishment
Chorus: Prospect
Capital punishment, given by the government
Systems they organized they get to you and who you running with
Can't live alone, watch for the spots and tapped phones
Totin the K, yo, for life, the rifle heir to the throne
We came from kings in Queens, people with dreams
Gods and herbs, for what its worth
We gonna fit the Earth with infinite worth
First its turning tables, open our own labels
They say don't vote the Republicans, then reverse capital punishment
Verse two: Big Pun
I've seen it all up close, shit without the movies you'd be buggin
My cousin Juju, barely a juve' lost it and turned on the oven
He wasn't playin', blew out the flame and started inhalin
Baring a secret too deep to keep on the streets for sharin
Wearing the virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
Is dickin every thick premiscuous fish in the sea,
Listen to me, shit is rough in the ghetto, you bluff, blow your head off
Fuck a snuff, we bust lead off!
Get off your high horse, or die off like an extinction
Boricuans are like Mohicans, The Last of the Po-Ricans,
We need some unity for all the deep security
The maturity, keeps me six feet, above obscurity
The streets are deadly and everybody's a desperado
I guess tomorrow ain't promised unless you Amish and death's your motto
Like Zorro, I mark my territory with a symbol
Not with a Z, but a P, cause punishment's what I resemble!
I lend you this if it expands yours, for you and yours
A real man can't fall, he stands tall
The Man's claws are diggin in my back, I'm trying to hit him back
Time to counteract, where my niggaz at?
Verse three: Prospect
You like that, It's Pun and Prospect
We hold nines, own more treasure than goldmines, making progress
With Don Juan's, there's rules to be made, crews to be sprayed
Dues to be paid, nothing y'all can do to behave
We laid in the slums, made a cake out of crumbs
Even though the government, trying to take out our sons
Rudy Giuliani trying to blind me, but I see reality
Was raised with this street mentality
My strategies wide, my battery never die
The ghetto kept me wise, so I would never fall to the lies
Its no surprise, but to or die if you want the glamour
Yeah, I want the glamour, laid up with cheese and trees in Atlanta
My Cubans smoked out like Ronald Isley with Havanas
The hammer hit 'em in the palm, never shaky, calm 'halers
This renegade blow through barricades like grenades
I turn the sun to shade, then the night back to day
Like the twenty-four hour rotation
I know the location, its just a little in-fo-mation
Here come the Squad, bringing the Terror for the nine-era
And let it rain on your fine leather, nigga, what?"
6,Caribbean Connection,1998,Capital Punishment (1998),,Big Pun,"(Wyclef) Warning!
(Big Pun)
Yo, wanna rumble with Pun hah?
(Loud farting noise) Shit on the whole industry
Yo who puff more Owls than Pun? Pile on more styles than Pun?
Who the only one with over a thousand guns?
Runnin' up in niggaz cribs like I paid the bill
Make you squeal the combination to the safe for wealth
I lace your grill with the firestarter
Hit your wife with the sawed-off from the shower powers I devour
I'm all about the fundamentals, like Pun and pencil
A piece of paper, a decent caper and someone to strafe you
My mental's compatible with the radicals
My odyssey type, qualities allow me to poli' with animals
Niggaz is cannibals and the ghetto's a jungle
Where you either bet all your bundles or struggle on the simple and humble
My niggaz'll rumble with any man for a Benny Fran
Try to imagine what they can sacrifice for twenty grand
Niggaz'll slice you and dice you into a thousand pieces
And pound out we jettin to the ground Uptown
Up in the Boogie Down, bitches swallow the team, pile on the green
Surrounded in green like flowers in Spring
For now I'm a King, so it's more than money, all the honies
Used to call me Punny cause my fam was always hungry
But now we rollin' lovely, and you feel worse, want my money
Let your steel burst, 'cause I'd rather see you in hell first
Chorus: Wyclef and Pun
(Wyclef singing) mucho trabajo, poquito dinero
(Pun) I'm selling perico
(Clef) Yo what's the dilly yo?
(Pun) I'm Uptown making moves just like Castro
(Repeat all 2X)
(Wyclef Jean)
Yo, yo, yo keep the lights keep the camera all I want is the action
The battle's on, where I roam in composition
A hardcore crowd, waitin to see, if I break
Like your first time in jail when you got fucked by an inmate
It'll never happen, I'm on balance like a Libra
And if I get murdered, Don't Cry For Me Argentina
Pour me a cup of vodka, bury me next to my father
In three days, I rise like Christ and still sober
Now my eyes open, in my hands I got the Gatling
I'm looking for the guy that sent me to say hi to Satan
Fists of fury, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry
I turn Mr. Rogers Neighborhood topsy turvy
Foes and enemies meaning the same in the dictionary
This ain't Pictionary, all you see is the cemetery
Bodies, from World War I and II is there
You don't want a third war, that's nuclear warfare
So Big Pun, count the stacks, make it fast
Illegal money turns legal now we runnin' a laundromat
Your hunchbacked and wack rap is packed in your backpack
Your better off in D.C. with the mayor smoking crack
Yo, this ain't a diss, Wyclef bomb threat
Run out of the building or get blast in your Guess
Tec for Tec, or we can go text for text, oh
I forgot, you don't read, so take this hole in your chest - blaow
Hide the blood, give you the gun, run and hide
So when the DT shows up, he thought it was a suicide
Suicide it's a suicide...
Chorus (fades out)"
7,Classic Verses (Drop It Heavy and Fantastic 4),2001,Endangered Species (2001),,Big Pun,"(Verse One)
Yo, my squad is honored like Elijah Muhammad
But I'm God-retarded, ain't no righteousness in this heart of violence
Hard as diamond but I'm in the ruff, listen up
If you ever see me with the Feds you can bet it's in the cuffs
Ain't no snitch in us, bitch in us
Unofficial-ness, everything we outside you wish you was
Official thugs in the drug profession
Drug connections, drug addictions
Still seein the judge for drug possession
The four-D's, all these is more reas'
To either get big, or leave and let live
We the best there is T.S., ain't nobody else
We probably Dove, 'cause we all way on top of the shelf
I'm lockin your wealth with the master keys, freeze
Don't try to breeze, or I'ma squeeze and blast the back of your knees
Just pass the cheese, please don't test the toaster
My tech'll roast ya body faster than Ferrari's Testarossa
You're gettin' closer to death, Reaper's got a hold on your breath
You goin' straight to hell as you sell your soul for your flesh
You was posin a threat, now you froze in the bed
Minute ago, you was poppin' shit, holdin' ya dick
Now what's the problem, you ain't nuttin like you said on your album
I thought you was wildin bustin' your guns and runnin' the island
You was't violent, you was silent tryin' to get college credits
How pathetic, did it to get out of the calisthetics
I'm +Dianetics+ combined with lyrics
My matureness is my insurance
Kill my appearance, I'm a shinin spirit
You gotta fear it, cause every last gem is poison
You gotta cheer it, you can't win you better join em
I'm head-annointin niggas like the Holy Gospel
I'm the only vato loco to smoke you with fire-blowin' nostrils
Watch for the toast, when you see it, you better draw yours
Warlords, callin The Giant, it's all yours
(Verse Two)
Fuck all y'all non-believers; I roll with God, the Squad and T.S.
Out with the B.S. we platinum, they even doubted Jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brain-bolic with knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drowned with diamond boulders all in the crown
Talk of the town, soakin you down wit toast till you drown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns, I'm on the serious tip
You keep playin'... and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit, I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mac in back of the Ac[ura]
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that, but don't think I won't counter act
My niggaz is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mac, quicker than Kung Fu
With the reflexes of a cat, and the speed of a mongoose"
8,Fast Money,1998,Capital Punishment (1998),,Big Pun,"I got the sweetest heist, million in cash, another 3 in ice
Who can I trust? Cuban'll bust plus ?good thief the night?
Here's the plan (plan), we nab the man, bring a camcorder
Grab his fam, and run the train on his granddaughter
Nah chill, that's too ill, for real I'd rather kill somethin'
Here's the deal, we shatter his grill, and drill fuck him
Oral torture, no doubt, the shit is holocaust
In two minutes tops he's guaranteed to cap and give up all the morsels
It's settled, blitt up, put on your metal, foot on the pedal
We got a half hour before the plan sours like Amaretto
Far from the ghetto, a rebel of chance, the devil in pants
Out for the fast cash, level advance
Takin' a chance, I've only got one my hundred shot
Tommy shotguns my judge jury and Johnny Cochran
Movin on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash a niggaz shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin' laced
Look at my face and I'ma shoot the place
Aiyyo the plot thickens, I'm pickin' the locks in the back entrance
Payin' attention, not tryin' to get knocked and catch a fat sentence
Not to mention these kids is mafioso with lots of dough so
They got poco lock with the down to rock Morocco chokehold (oh oh)
Their security system's linear laser protection
No sweat, I brought the miniature mirrors for reflectin
Inspectin the vault, for weapons assault, second of course
It's poisonous rays, boiled and baked in epsom salt
Rep in New York is the cat burgalar, the fat murderer
Slippin the clip in the Mac, inserterer
Hurtin' your pockets, droppin' your stock to zero profit
Holding heroes hostage and mansions for ransom like DeNiro mob flicks
Back to the top again, hand the grand prize
The safe flies open, the shining was blinding my eyes
I cracked the code, enough ice to make you laugh at gold
Passed the dough to Cuban started movin for the back real slow
That's when I heard the sirens hopin that my ears was lyin'
Knew we was dyin' when I saw the guard we tortured cryin
Pointing at the building screamin, ""I can see them, kill em!""
Snipers was willing but couldn't, there's too many civilians
Still inside nowhere to hide nowhere to run
Cuban said, ""Fuck it, we die, we die busting our guns""
Aiyyo it's time to pay, and I ain't trying to give my shine away
Let's show these pigs how much we give a fuck about a brighter day
I cocked the Eagle, Cuban drew the Glock it was diesel
Said, ""See you in Hell coppers"" and started poppin' like it was legal
We need a plan, if we can make it to the van
Missile launchers there with the grenade pistol I bought from Uncle Dan
Me and my man are runnin' out of ammo, I got about a handful
Of Black Rhino's and two Rambles strapped to my ankles
I trampled over one of the bodies, I grabbed the steel
Threw the bitch over my shoulder and used her butt as a shield
I filled the clip with the little bit of bullets remaining
Cuban said, ""Move your fat ass faster motherfucker they gaining""
I gave him the case, told him, ""Go ahead save yourself
Blaze a L in my memory, tell the family I gave 'em Hell""
For real, that's when I heard the tires screechin
Peeped and it was Joe the God with twenty Terror Squad niggaz reachin'"

Run up in your crib, blast your kids
Ain't no myth in this, shit's official
I'll pistol-whip you with my Smith and Wesson
Cause my investin' was sendin rappers to heaven
Gives me an erection
You need protection from the smooth assassin
Who really moves at action, blastin' mothafuckas
Execution fashion
Now who's the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake, smack you
Then I'll wack you with my snub 38
It doesn't take much to make me restless
Look at my face and definite lose your breath
Truck my face is Lexus
You want to test this, so really?,
I'll make one call and have the whole WU comin' on the ferry
I'm very dangerous and well-connected
I puff an L with Method, then try to
Decide who's next to fill his neck slit
So respected and admired the boss, retired your lost
Wu Tang, your terror squad, vaya con Dios!
(Armageddeon)
You guys despise guys like us
Guys like us, disgust like Spartacus
You cuss and claim a bust
You lust for a part of us, you thrust
But can't touch
Plus we far from any type of fellas you can trust
Put the pressure on the mic, I biz
Press to your chest, sound like sweat on my back
We're having sex, tight-ass flex
Pretty Pocahontas pussy sweet, like my new Tek
Sis' got curves like a GS, 300 Lex
My body's 95% alcohol, 5% cancer
Sosa diamonds, Getty, Lucci, blaze it up like Bonanza
Catch me in the cut, easy G's is burnin' my gut
As I Remember my menage au trois was mired by sluts
I questionmark your heart, punctuate your fate
All your version predicates
Done as well as you pronunciate
In the (west)?, we're gonna break you off the isle
Take C.O.s hostage arab style, no surrender
(Punisher)
Yo, I'm all about business and enterprisin'
Advisin' financial advisors on franchisin' the wider than horizons
Divisin' ideas with masterminders
Movin' on a stash of diamonds
First we get the cash, then we laugh like miners
Don't get me wrong I'm a funny bastard
But when it come to money, son, I'm not the one to laugh with
I'm after for what cash can bring me brothers
Me and my demon lovers blast and laugh at hyenas
Back to Ringling Brothers believe them others
You's the best, yet, and still
I'm investin' mils on a hunch over lunch
Puffin' on a Chesterfield, who wants to test
The real scandalous
I'm at the Sands in Los Angeles
Plannin' hits with an ananymous philanthropist
Spanish kids, close to God, like evangelists
Choppin' niggas up and makin' sandwiches...

What the fuck, Terror Squad
All we do is battle what; what, what what
Yo it's ""The Dream Shatterer"" strictly for cream team battler
Ring rattlin microphone fiend spline splatterer
King of the throne, bringin' it home five nights
Up in The Source - five mics
Whippin a Porsche - high price
Pumpin the 9-7, rhyme heaven her voice is mindbendin
Imaginin Angie nuttin but panties and my 911
That's what I'm reppin the thug tech and the glove
Step in the mud with less than a SCUD I'm splittin your rug
It's just I'm in love with Mrs. Martinez
Latin Goddess or Venus, you just happen to give me the hardest {penis}
You wanna see us apart, you're chasin the dark
Long as she run the battle she got a place in my heart
(Remy Martin)
Yo... yo, yo, yo
All of a sudden the big question is, yo who this bitch Remy-nisce?
Is she really thorough with her borough, can she represent?
Do Remy write every line and every rhyme that she spit?
Is she, really the shit, is her flow really sick?
Get off my dick, keep your sorry ass compliments
I get mad quick y'all knowin' me ain't got no sense
Bitch don't try to play me, because you not a player
Believe me, you don't really wanna see my gangster
It's easy to cock back and smack the shit out a hoe
Had to leave niggaz bleedin just so we could get our dough
It get me heated, that's why I wild out for no reason
On the Bruckner, like fuck you, gettin' weeded and speedin
I'm untouchable nigga I ain't never have love for you niggaz
Cause y'all pussy that's why I ain't never fuck with you niggaz
Motherfuckers is scandal, on the avenue of Randall
Don't slip into some shit you and your click can't really handle
I ain't havin' it, get the cash out the cabinet
Before I stab the bastard baby in the bassonet
I'll, body a botty bwoy, blow his gut open
Leave son chokin, gun still smokin'
Know how many niggaz like, ""I bet you Pun wrote it""
Y'all can all take a dirty dildo and deep throat it!"
11,Glamour Life,1998,Capital Punishment (1998),,Big Pun,"(Cuban Link) Glamour life style baby, bottle the rocks
Lose the ice, 100 mil kid, money, money, money, mo
Platinium status, yeah, what up, what up?
(Big Punisher) Stick around
(Cuban Link)
Yo, I plan to live a life a-glamour
Like my man Tony Montana
Stand and pose in front of cameras
With my golden silk pajamas on
Smoking havanas, drinking Dom P
Thinking beyond deeper than Gandhi, while I'm in the Diamante
Counting my G's, I'm out to be a millionaire
Dipped in gear, flickin' hundred dollar bills in the air
Oh yeah, Cuban Link is into getting benjamins
'Cause if doesn't make dollars, then it doesn't make sense
I represent, I'm in to be the king of New York
Went from living in tenements to up in house resorts
I'm the latino, that'll take you to war like Al Pacino
Even De Niro know not to gamble in my casino
Vino wanna rock, slaps, to dinners with mobsters
I got shit locked from Prospect Ave. to the tropics
Sitting on top of the world like the sun
A living legend from the Bronx, second to none, unless it's Pun
(Big Punisher) Chorus:
It's the glamour life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice swear to, but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life
(Triple Seis)
Ripped off from the Infiniti
Dump the body an' the shottie down the lake, leaving no identity
Just the memory, a casualty as I casually make moves on my rivalries
All eyes I be, on the quest for loot
Pushing a Lexus coupe, to pursuit them troops, against the big-joker
Sipping alimoca, playing poker with some chocha
Heard an approacher, must be fam, but damn I had to smoke Pun
(Big Punisher: Get the motherfucking gun)
Since then I've become the one wanted for a lump sum of G's
Dirty rats pack gats for cheese
Bullets of breeze at light speed
Taking your pretty wife life and sacrificing your seeds
Indeed, we let him bleed for 50 G's
Ship his body to the states, filled with 50 keys
Please, no remorse for your two face
Inside a symbol, my rifle out the motherfucking suitcase
You about to take who's place? Not Seis...
Your body'll be laced, and left without a trace
(Big Punisher) The glamour life, the glamour life, yo
(Big Punisher) Chorus
(Fat Joe)
Yo, I'ts the motherfucking Don Cartagena
The leader, Terror Squad cleaner
Leave your family crying for you like Argentina, mira
Street dreamer like Nas, my entourage is thick
Camouflaging this bitch, so God forbid you start some shit
My squad's equipped with an arsenal of ammunition
Hollow tips an', cop killers with the
Accounts in Switzerland for rainy days
Nigga I'm staying paid, you's a joke
Always broke with your lazy ways
Anyway, back to the subject, in the bub-Lex
In the back seat, having rough sex
I love this glamorous life I live, having the ice and shit
Think twice, I give Christ your kids
I live life for gifts, keep the fire burning while the tires turning
I blaze an L and seek a higher learning
Kaiser's learnin' everything illegally
We could de friend for years, cross me once that's thievery
(Big Punisher) Chorus
(Armaggedon)
Yo, the dough, the rap, the audience, party heavy till the 40's in
Ill like the Yakuza run the Orient
Take all the rent, and no man wept the path his daughter went
Dicks with the fallopian, wide as auditoriums
She fuck for dough for opium, prostitute emporium
500 Benz, 500 friends sell Cambodian
8's cup of vodka, 4 cups of juice for sodium
Money, money, sweet as the smell of magnolia
It's get you down, but you spitting image of Appalonia
Now how can I go broke, pumping twenties of coke
Plus songs I wrote, milkin' dumb honeys I poke
The young blood sat on the bench in Vant Courtland, slingin'
Singing how he trying to get cash for Jordans
Another cat toss his Beamer to get the insurance
Currency's gonna murder me... It's never enough
Breakin' my ass gettin' it, just as fast as I spend the stuff
Calling Uncle Sam's bluff dun, taxes don't bite us, bite us...
(Big Punisher) My life... my life...
(Big Punisher)
The glamour life, play precise, defense is tight
I'm out to settle the score, let's do it right
Enough for looking at grave, It's paying back tonight
Yo Twin pass the lye, pass the light
The glamour life, this life I live is trife as shit
Least my wife and kid got somewhere nice to live
I used to live in the gutter, me and my mother
Now she's fifty years old, pushing a hummer
The glamour life, hand me a knife I'll slice and dice
Mini-mize, send them to Christ in the after life
Pass the mic down the line, let them hear it
Let them fear it, send it screaming to the Holy Spirit
Glamour life, the glamour life, the glamour life
It's the glamour life, yo it's the glamour, it's the glamour life
Glamour life, glamour life, glamour life
Cock the hammer, in this motherfucking life, bitch"

Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And that's how we roll... roll...
(Big Pun)
You know I'm well known like Al Capone, fully blown like Ton' Montana
In a zone, sittin' on chrome, stoned sippin on cham-pagna
Rollin' ganja up in bible papers, see how high the lye can take us
Through the eyes of Christ, John, Elijah, Jacob
I make the kind of green a hustler dream
Bustin' out the custard cream Viper
Custom piped up with the mustard seams
Clustered green Fort Knox and hard (?) medallions
Mockin God even Italians see my batallion pull out the broad
I got the +Squad+ over-qualified, pullin over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted, three-wheelted hydraulic slide
Sparkin lye in the clouds and reppin my housin
Like the Wu do in Shaolin

Ooohooo there's, something, I want to tell you
There's something I've been, thinking, that your, crew should know

I keep my Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo with my top hat

Lookin' fat in Marc and Pelle leather like Fonzarelli
Sparkin Phillies with the Gods like Makaveli
On the celly (blown Benz, chrome rims)
Shinin like the (stone gems) on my (gold rings)
I got it sewn Twinz, I can't begin to tell you the story
That soared me from livin' poorly to a modern day Cinderfella
I've been a killer and a drug dealer, a bugged nigga
But now I'm like Puffy cause money's thicker than blood player
I'm still a threat but now I think before I flip
Call my connects together
And figure which cleaner's the best for the hit
I get the job done, Pun's handlin business
Candlelight dinners, havin' a toast with the most glamorous bitches
My road to riches was no Christmas
Now we blessed with gold Lazaruses
So expensive my whole family's religious
(Big Pun)
Aiyyo I want it all you can call me greedy and superficial
Long as my crew's official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle
I'm tryin' to triple a million and split it three ways
Joe the God, Full Eclipse, and myself - that'll be the day
I need a way to get it already got the ambition
Start the ignition, watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition
I'm on a mission which requires a higher position
Desire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin
I'm infinite like math, so I'm gonna last
But you wanna laugh all day, bullshit and sittin' on your ass
I'm all about cash and the power
A stash with the power that lasts like hittin ass for an hour
Let's get it locked, I want a watch with baguetted rocks
So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops
Forget the cops, we got Deserts and glocks too
Ready to rock whoever tryin' to stop our cheddar from stockin forever

Forget the kissin', I'm skippin' the tongue twistin'
See, that's tradition
Some chick in back of me
Bought me a daiquiri, told me meet her in back of Zachary's
'Cause she heard I was packin' meat
I bagged the freak
And hit the tele, got the phillies, lifted the belly
And put it in her mouth like Akinyele
Far from ugly
But they used to say I'm too chubby, but since the money
The honies got nothin' but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish
I'll make you rich, take your kids to the flicks
Come back and fix your favorite dish
Crazy bitch
I ain't with that, I'mma hit that, split back to the shack
Where my other chick's at
Now can you dig that
I'm the Mack doin' my thing, pulling your strings
Making you feel like you in a dream

Giving you multiples, just by the tone

In the school staircase, cuttin' class, passin my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label to earn
Like that nigga said in _Dead Presidents_, money to burn
Queensbridge, pay homage, respect Nas is the vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes, niggaz is dissin that
I'm just the best, puttin' all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings the blood _los sangres_, blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison
Verse Two: Big Pun
My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try -- 'Now you know you done fucked up right?'
Hah, you ain't got no wins in my casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa
I hate a actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial college material insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter you shitter shatter, I'm the kid
Out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before, iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun, cause one verse, dead 'em all
Chorus: scratches by DJ Spinbad
J-J-J-John Blaze
Ja-Ja-ah-John Bla-Blaze
J-Ja-J-Ja, John Blaze
""Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed!"" --> Method Man
Verse Three: Jadakiss
Aiyyo my attitude is subject to change, I mess around
And spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim
Cause y'all misdemeanor niggaz can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only 'cause I know that faggots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get, kicked out the yard for
'Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggaz up
You could meet me in my cell I soak and sock niggaz up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggaz get nathans
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin'
Verse Four: Raekwon
My son cool out (what) don't beef yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggaz, kidnap they work, make 'em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat
In the dash, did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God, stackin up joints, rack 'em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent
Here to Crenshaw, hold my words stronger than a Benz stall
Relentless, the anthology consolidated
With the quickness, dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness
Lex, imagination large, gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the Older God
Specialist, iciclist, Woolridge collar
Feelin' the rich, work for every dollar don't snitch, that's why
Broke niggaz who got heart God, sign 'em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin', Don up in the line up
Verse Five: Fat Joe
It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed Dunn
I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns till it hurts
For fuckin' with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster, with my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gortex with the lot, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned?
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to parlay, I've had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed"

600 Benz 20 inch rims house on the hill hittin' mad skin
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
It was all a scheme I used to load the teck with the magazine
So I was mean but I still had a scheme
17 years young everything seemed fun
Still considered a veteran 'cause I feared none
Pun's from the street where there ain't no rules
But carried heat 'cause he ain't no fool
Ain't no wrong for dollars in negative digits
So debted followers and got rid of the quitters
That never forget us 'cause we've been down since the
Genesis 200 horse power to 400 Pegasus
The messages don't sleep till it's over
Next thing you know shorty seven feet
Tippin' over I'm still in the water drownin'
Knights and murder till the immortal terror squad
Threw me a life preserver now I'm ice forever
Stomach bustin' out the white carrera
Life is better now niggas wanna rhyme together
Ay que sera! what can I do but take you to strive
Ay que hago! I hope the streets don't take me alive
You wasted your life and refused the struggle while
I aim for the sky pay dues and bubbles I WIN!
(Pun)
Now it's not funny 'cause I'm hot and got a pot of money
Alot of hunnies around (Don't stop do the brown for me)
My every wish is her command call her bitch she understands
I reminisce how she used to dis me and my man
Check part of the plan she told my son I wasn't the man
I ain't gonna to stop till I got a heart in my hand
I can silence the lamb but couldn't silence her cause
She was as wild as a man with a bottle of liquor
I'm not going to hit her I'm gonna debt her tonight
Double platinum now she's one in the tribe well in the ride now
Well in a fly gettin' high now no more whiteout send the cubans
To provide now it's my world I demand my respect
Give me your girl or get slapped in your neck
Ain't nothin' change I'm still humble and modest
And I'm always proud to admit I came straight from the projects
Hardy har har har

Hardcore? Commercial?
Whatchu wanna do, you wanna wile up, you wanna dance?
Don't matter to me, I got it all locked down baby
It's not a game it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall, when I bring the chain with the saw
Bring the pain to your door like death was knockin'
Unless you got my ends, I'ma make you twins with the Headless Horseman
Hell extortion, sell your soul, live your dreams
Don't pay the cost then {*bam bam*} say hello to the guillotine

Fiends for drugs, I don't need no love
Give me your fear, murder, respect, beer, honies and sex want here
I'll bend them checks for years, hungry and stressed
You fuckin' with Chris - fuck Pun - dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator, go 'head Decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever
Half the niggaz I keep, I put 'em back together
That's the terror, cut open your girl
And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill

Word to 'Pac and Big, my glock so big it can rock a bridge
Drop the midsection like the top of your wig
Ain't no bullshittin, gettin' the full treatment
Special two heated missles, till your crew's leavin' witchu
I rip you in half - blast that ass through a glass window
Laugh a little, and dash in the S-Class limo
That's how we do it in the South Boogie
Where tough rough rookies get snuffed out, for talkin' loud to me
Why should I even consider your crew? Shit on your crew
Get rid of your crew, what I'm fittin to do
I split you in two, leave you ?? when I blast the shotty
Grip you like dope and leave you there with half your body
We Rowdy like Roddy, probably robbin your stash
Catch a body like Charlie up North, stashin knives up my ass
Survivin the task, we the last ones left
Blast them tecs with clips, fast as fast'll spit
Add some tips for any, bastard bitch, pappin shit
Watch me rep till the death from the bassonet, beotch!

Watch what happens to your friend
You don't want this to happen to you
You give me the money, okay?"

Yeah baby
There ain't nothing better
You know you like it like that
Check it out yo, yo
She had it goin' on, red bone, fresh out of Bayamon
In the calle long, Dona Ana throwin' at her corazon
I should of know she was a cachatera
Always watching novelas with her abuela
Gossiping that bonchinchera
Thought that she was better
'Cause she was pure boricuan
I was New Yorican, the Bronx
Pledging my true allegiance
But now you're leaving me
See I lost out before
See you in my next life, adios mi amor
Mi amor
(Ricky)
She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She'll make you take your clothes off
Going dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
The girl will drive you right insane
2 - (Ricky)
Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
(Ricky)
Woke up in New York City
In a funky, cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must have slip me a sleeping pill
She never drinks the water
Makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her
You're guaranteed to go insane
(Cuban Link)
Yo, yo Joe the first day I saw her face
She had me walking in space
Wanting to say something
But I was frozen, stuck in one place
I ain't fronting Seis she was more amazing in grace
The type of face you pay to say everyday upon the stage
(Fat Joe)
I met her at a rave
Back in the days
We could of got engaged
Shorty's body was tight
Have many that ask her aids
Masquerades and mardi Gras
She likes to play menage et tois
Lost it all
But that's the way the hottie was
Oh, she'll push and pull you down
Her lips are a devil's red
She will wear you out

Oh, oh yeah
Lips of devil's red

21,Mamma,2001,Endangered Species (2001),,Big Pun,"(Chorus: Tony Sunshine)
Mamma... I don't understand
Why he had to fuck with me, now I gotta kill this man
I said mamma... now I'm on the run
Dear ma-mmah... what have I done?
(Big Pun)
Somebody save me, I think I just killed somebody baby
Shoulda chilled but money was really tryin' to play me
Couldn't hold it no more so I showed him the four
Duke was dissin my girl like she was hoein on tour
And knowin' I'm raw, money tried to play fly
""I said whassup to the bitch; why she couldn't say hi?""
That ain't right! I had to put him in his place
Remember them hollows I bought for three bottles?
I put 'em in his face
I didn't have to disgrace myself, hatin' myself
""Ahora a tu!"" BLAM BLAM, brace yo'self
That's the law - the streets are like basketball
But sometimes you shoot, sometimes you pass it off
Can't always take a shot, make one mistake you upstate for what?
Too much hate, time to break the lock
I hate the cops so I ain't tryin' to see 'em
I love a brother doin' triple life but I ain't tryin' to be him
That's why I be on the low, and keep my feet in the row
'Cause they're tellin' me as far as felonies
You get life for three in a row
Then whadday'know? Last week at the flicks
I had to kill somebody, for steppin on my kicks (STUPID)
(Big Pun)
I can murder half the world laugh while the other side hate me
But hurt one hair on my mamma head and I'ma, cry like a baby
She my heart and soul; what Jimi Hendrix was to rock'n'roll
Made me believe I could achieve the impossible
Now you know one of my weakness's, but Punisher keeps it glizz
So don't pull out 'cause when I pop oh what a relief it is
Send you where Jesus is - hold up, that's the gas chamber
Think before you put on that ski-mask and blast a stranger
Relax the anger, don't be so hard on yourself
That's how you'll end up twelve years old;
Bein charged as an adult
Terror Squad is here to help so you can learn from our mistakes
Cause power just makes you reject destiny and devour your fate
How many hours I waste, tryin' to figure the shit
Until I finally realized, we're just niggaz and spics
That's what they feel, what can I do but just stay real?
Keep somethin' in the stash in case I gotta make bail
Cause ain't no brothers, runnin' shit in the system
You goin' straight to jail if you colored and fit the description
... Fuck you talkin' about? I live here
This is my buildin nigga; fuck you nigga!
That's my daughter right there playin'... fuck off me!
Get the fuck off!
(Big Pun)
I don't have much time so I'm only gonna ask you once
To please forgive me mamma; I love you and I'm sorry I broke your heart
But I ask you to do me a favor and take care of my daughters
And raise them to be good respectable woman, like their mother
God bless her soul
And raise my son to be a good man, a better man than me
And for this I give you my soul, I love you
(Chorus - whispered; a woman cries out in agony)

Y'all niggas better lay low
Catch you in a hurtin', nawmean?
Blow your balls off nigga
HOOK: Big Pun
Where my girl at
Quick to bust the mack, better believe that
She always got my back, nigga twirl that
About to blaze a sack, where the weed at
She don't know how to act, 'cause that's my girl black
With that monster rap, better believe that
You know the Bronx is back, she represent that
'Cause Terror Squad got her back, some say heed that
My niggas love to scrap
Verse 1: Remi Martin
I inhale the deepest, cock back and bust rhymes at your speakers
I'm troubled, shoot out the air bubbles in your sneakers
The type to cop a Range along with all the features
Then take the back streets to avoid the leeches
A pregnant bitch talk shit, I'ma destroy her fetus
Her dead baby popped this pussy, and his boys can't beat us
Straight strong armin, bombarding, and bogarding
Remi don't write her own rhymes, nigga, I beg your pardon
It's Ms. Martin I done broke night in the studio writin
While fraud broads don't get no publishin, still be bitin
They kill me lyin', like they the ones doin' the scribin
When you can hear the ghostwriter, all up in they rhymin
I flows like water, got this drizzle with little C
Catch me with Pun eatin skittles in the middle of Little Italy
Y'all don't know diddly, I spit hot, and drop shit
Every time I kick a rhyme, Pun I burn my lip
Take another pull, bust another shot, y'all can't stop me
Come through in a jail suit, and the new Beef 'n' Broccolis
Doin' it, If I'm havin' a good time and you ruin it
I seen a nice casket that'll look good with you in it
New improved shit, the year start with a 2 shit
Next millennium, sell a million, clue shit
Exclusive, to tell the truth, y'all useless
'Cause I'm a dime that could rhyme you still on the deuce list
Remi Martin, dash, reminisce, slash
Remi, cash like a check in a stash
Me without rhymes is like a flynt with no flash
Stripper with no ass, car with no gas
Tryin' to go fast, I love to hear the guns go blast
(Blau, blau, blau, blau) I love the sounds of the shells fallin' down
Love to smoke weed, stay blowin' trees, fuck liquor
When shit get thick, I love to hear my bitches raise his clique up
You sick, but I'm sicker, plus our guns is bigger
If you really wanna kill us, do it nigga, pull the trigga
How you figure, you could really come and take what's mine
And all I gotta do is send a little letter to Rah
He'll send the troops out
My brother don't hesitate to pull a tool out
And I'm his little sis, so he taught me the same shit
Quick to flip, but your name should be prickless
'Cause every time you open your mouth, you suckin my dick
Talkin' shit, as if you a soldier nigga
When you a no cash, low class, doja nigga
Y'all rock rocks, we bling bling boulders nigga
Look over your shoulder I'm in the Rover, it's over nigga
Inhale, cock back and bust, just because
I know none of y'all busters is touchin us
I got the thoroughest thugs and, baby reminisces
That don't give a fuck, with a aim that never misses
Hugs and kisses never, just slugs and stiches
Thugs and bitches forever, check the mugshot pictures
Fuck the weather, I still got my tan Timbs on
Just copped the pink mink, and winter been gone
I been on this thug shit y'all can't seem to fuck wit
My shit is hot dogs, to top it off, still spittin' mustard
No fair, 'cause I don't care I go to war wit a musket
Just give me some oreos, a jar of dro and two dutches
'Cause Pun be the nicest motherfucker on the market
Now he got the nicest bitch, what, Remi Martin"

Sky's the limit, nuttin less if my guys is in it
For the right price, even Christ could get it
Fast life we live it - all my memories are vivid
I remember only minutes
That's how I mentally get rid of all the enemies
The spirits that definitely mimic my every melody
And lyric which so heavenly rhythmic
In magic do I build, but math do be equally compatible
And secretively battle you to reach my peak in equilateral
I'm from the streets deep in the bottom yo ain't no Mario Brothers
Official Bronx niggaz, quick to body yo' mother (ouch)

Jesus H. Christ, how many times I gotta pay the price?
You scared to death I'll make you twice as afraid of life

Ignitin the flame, keepin' your third lid
Speak and observe with the mind
What are blind sleep till they worth shit
I'm earth wind and fire, the first one to fire
Reppin T. Squad since birth till I retire
I wire your jaw, wire the walls with plastique explosives
And riot the halls at the malls where all the crackers ? live
Keep flappin yo' gibs and I'ma come back with those kids
From the back of the bridge
I think two and touch means tackle the bitch
I rap for the chips, but I'm truly assassin
Four hundred pounds, six feet tall, brutally handsome
That's the pro - got beef with Pun, you gots to go
Mafia style - tear you a new ass-a-hole
Flash your dough, but you too cool for the captain
'Cause I don't give a fuck if I was quadruply platinum
And to the 50 Cent rapper, very funny, get your nut off
Cause in real life, you don't know
I'll blow your motherfuckin head off (ooh yeah)
That's my motherfuckin word, you understand?
Thought we was a fuckin' joke? Shit
Terror Squad nigga, you don't know me
You don't know my name, don't say it, you understand?
Told you before I ain't no motherfuckin rapper understand?

The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me till I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
And rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggaz talk but they babble 'cause they ain't sayin' nuttin
If ain't blazin' somethin' with the mac I'm in the shack bakin muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin; my Squad been waitin
For the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin
An orgi-nation of veterans built
With genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills

And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine
The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up, with the stash gone
I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast
Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the click, 'cause we all share
It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum

Aiyyo I'm hard to talk to, if you live I probably thought you stalked you
Where you walked to at night, caught you then tried to extort you
New York niggaz is trigger happy, got Pataki scared
This town ain't big enough for both of us AND I AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE
There it is, plain and simple like Jigga my game is mental
While slow niggaz better know I blow their brains out they temples
I'm into black magical torture romantic dramatical author
Compatible with the average New Yorker
A fast talker, like Tony when he gassed Sosa the the masked enforcer
Out for the cash and the chocha
Smash the coca, bottle it up watch the fiends gobble it up
If I roll up, you do what? Swallow the stuff
I don't give a fuck anymore, I'm only twenty-four years old
And I've already broken every law
I'm horrorcore, this is for the heads
Runnin' up in your crib, knot if you still hot in under the bed
Chorus: Busta Rhymes
Yo, parental discretion advised, please cover your eyes
Little kids -- GET OUT OF HERE! This shit is homicide!
Drugs and money, this ain't no Bugs Bunny!
Little girls too; this ain't for you it's for the thugs honey!
(Big Punisher)
Hey yo my shit's the truth, 150 proof no question
Parental discretion advised, keep out the eyes of the youth
It's too explicit, bullshit! I challenge the statistics
Violence existed before our music was even suggested
Arrested on sight, it's like there's no rights
That's why I rhyme so aggressive and bring every message to life
I fight the power, spike the powder to 90 percent
Keep 10 and feed Twin half for personal reasons
The seasons change... things re-arrange, but I stay the same
Play the game, for the wealth, until I've made myself a name
So blame it all on the gangster rapper, thanks to Joey Crack
For the chance to do it my way like Frank Sinatra
I ain't a actor so it's all facts, strictly raw rap
Totally intended for yours dressed in all black
With the ski mask, or the pantyhose makin' cameos
In liquor store cameras with the twin Calico's
(Big Punisher)
So forget the boom, one look, you shook -- you know I'm stickin you
Liftin you off the ground, look down -- that's where I'm puttin' you
Look in my eyes and remember me, how does it feel mentally
Havin' the enemy be the last thing you ever see?
The recipe is death and I'm the chef, fricaseein your flesh
Be my guest, but I ain't cleanin the mess
Me and TS we testin niggaz faith, just to see they face
Expression when destined to states, that death be in the case
I'm in the state of grace, in the hated race, by the pagan face
Couldn't fight us, made a virus, gave us AIDS
I paint the wake 'cause they ain't get me yet, wet me
Or reflect me yet, I know they comin' they just tryin' to let me sweat
I wreck it like when I was just a boy, eatin Chips Ahoy
Wasn't allowed to raise my voice, now I'm makin' noise
No more toys, strictly Mac's and missiles, shorties with forties
Packin pistols catchin bodies make sure official
So they say, I pray there's a better way
My kids don't do as I do, they do as I say, cause daddy don't play
(Busta Rhymes)
Word is bond
One thing about MC's is that we don't conceal the truth
We present real pictures about the positive and the negative
So don't blame the hip-hop when your seed is learnin the real life from us
Do your duty at home and raise your child in the house
Parents...
You don't do your job we gonna put your children to bed at nine o'clock
Past your bedtime
You get your ass in bed you ain't 'posed to be hearin this shit
Word up

Grab the guns and start lighting
Y'all the bitch niggaz behind cars scared to death like ""yo, who fighting?""
How the fuck you teaching me I ain't got no obedience
Y'all are made of shit I'm the thug's ingredients
And for my niggaz I peel like fucked up paint jobs
Cover your block and put holes in you like old blankets
Fuck a bitch use a sock and wipe my nut what?
Run in your spot and use a Glock to get my cut what?
Smack you in public and embarrass you slut what?
Put you on punishment the same way I do to my son
And the only bullets by my stomach be the clip from my gun
And when my gun busts it's over so close the curtains
My silencer's like ch, ch, ch like birds was chirping
I like Boricuas ya know that Sheik be freaky
I put coke in their peepee then stuff the bras
Put some coke in the bras that look like coconuts
That's what's up don't have Sheik's click clack this up
Disload the back pack her bitch ass back me up
You know double R and Terror Squad niggaz want they cut.

I'm well know like Al Capone, full blown like Tone Montana
In the zone sitting on chrome stoned sipping on Champana
Rolling ganja up in Bible paper
A high that will take us through the eyes of Christ, John, Elijah, Jacob
I make the kind of green that hustler's dream
Busting out that custard cream
Piper 'cause I'm piped up with the mustard team
Plus the queen Fort Knox and hearts
King of medallions Monty Guard
Even Italians see my battalion prop the broad
I got the squad over qualified pulling over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted three wilted hydraulic slide
Spark the Live in the crowd ripping trough housings
Like the Wu do in Shaolin
John Blazing on a pound of buddha and all the mami chulas,
They want to ride on my Honda scooter
You know the red one from the video
But really though she ain't coming and she ain't running the

You talk a lot but you ain't never realized that if you walk that block
Cock that Glock, think I'm pussy oh shit man!
Big Punisher's off his rocker
What you got? Beef wit' me? Aight then papi, Sheik's with me
Thought you cats were gonna creep on me
Without some type of an injury.

I see coward in yours, what you up in my eyes?
Big dick between mine, What the fuck between your thighs?
Pussy, If I shoot, are you gonna shoot back?
I don't think so, your man's the thug you ride piggy-back
You're the one that passed the gat, told your man to bust that
You ain't making no money, you're a broke-ass cat
And once these pop, cops bring the chalk
And the mop to get the rest of you off the sidewalk. what!"

I was the luckiest man on Earth, my wisdom was worth
Any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than givin' birth
My first verse explains some of the game she was playin'
I'm blamin myself cause in my wealth was her pain would haven
Behavin like a money hungry hooker, funny how the money took her
From an average honey to a stunning looker
I look back and reminisce how we used to kiss
And smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ'
She got too big for her britches but The Bridge is Over
Not the one in Queens I mean the one she dreamin' wasn't sober
Told her how I felt, gassed me when she cried for help
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fuckin' belt
I felt stupid Cupid struck me with a poison arrow
Shoulda drowned ya when I found ya crushin in my boy's Camaro
I didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead
You robbed me of my honor, you ain't shit like my mother said

Won't you come back?

Nah baby, I'm Not Gon' Be Able to Do It; You blew it
Threw it all the way cause you was stupid -- girl why'd you do it?
I mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me
It's hard maybe we can make amends, be friends
But only hurtin' all of us for certain by forsakin' him
Just take it in, don't even say a word, observe
The way you were, preserved, these words so you won't play the herb
Ever again, never pretend that he doesn't have a father
I'm always there and you don't wanna bother
I honor my word on my father's grave, guide him through his hardest age
So he can thrive and survive in these modern days
I wanna raise my little man but you keep resistin
I'm insistin you chill for real before you come up missin'
Listen, I don't wanna fight I'd rather do what's right
A boy needs a father that's the most important part of his life
(Big Punisher)
I gave you everything, love letters and sweaters with leather seams
Feathered wings, and rings with emeralds right out of Geraldine's
Simple dreams a dream fulfilled, the green DeVille Cadillac
To mack, not a fact redeemed the bill
I mean for real I can play it mami how you wanna stay
Armani Fresh, givin' the next nigga my punani
You want me back 'cause he hit it wrong, now you wanna get it on
With the Long Don, word bond my shit is strong (come back)
Girl don't even start again, I beg your pardon
And get your hands off my six button Cardigan
'Cause ain't no love lost between us far as I'm concerned
Please leave, cut that busted weave I've been dyin' to burn
Go buy a perm, try and earn some respect
It's better to have loved and lost than live with regret

(In the) hot tub, poppin' bubb-ly
Rubbin your spot love, got you screamin Punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I *stick it* even Luke be like ""Don't stop, get it get it""
Chorus w/o Big Punisher
(Joe)
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena (3X)
No more rollin' with an entourage
Unless it's Pun and the Terror Squad
Punisher, Punisher, Big Punisher
Punisher... Joe and Big Punisher
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena (6X)"
35,Super Lyrical,1998,Capital Punishment (1998),,Big Pun,"Punisher --
Ay-yo my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you
That's... the mathematical madness I'm on, the savage, the strong
The marriage, a bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on as if Picasso laced you
There's lotsa hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school, that's why I have to debate you
My raps are like cables, slashin' your face, you
That's how a master degrades you
I'm battlin' Jesus if he passes through my label
I'm snatchin' his halo
God I pray that you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizin'
I'm only emphasizin', I'm still all about business and enterprisin'
I'm super lyrical, a brain boosts the chemicals
That's used contenicals inside of my mental projectable
CHORUS -- Lyrically I'm supposed to represent (Biggie)
Niggaz'll tell you that I'm nice with the
Blah, blah, blah (Canibus)
Lyrically I'm...< >...I'm supposed to represent
Black thought --
Black Thought the super lyricist, your arch-nemesis
Still with the Punisher, that's my accomplice
Stressin' to emcees how they don't really want this
Electrifying shit his excellency Thought spit
These cats they sentimental such with a gentle touch
Dancin' double dutch and all sayin' nothin' much
My sound wave liftin' your chin up like uppercuts
New found ways of rippin' shit up, I de-ve-lop
Your squad chest swell up, still you're mini-ay-ture to me
Nature-ally I bring the extremity
Musically intense with the globe in suspense
Contemplatin' where the world traveler been since
The Roots bless you with a strong record, long like a epic
Immerse you in some 'ol next shit, ill poetic
Thought from Illadelph somethin' like nothin' else
My talk stomp like elephants upon every elf, cause... what...
CHORUS -- Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggaz'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
You will lose... I must break you (Ivan Drago from ""Rocky"")
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggaz'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm-I'm-I'm...< >...
I'm supposed to represent
Punisher --
Ay-yo peace Roots east coast niggaz reppin' the streets most
With heat, toast, and keep close more Phillies than Pete Rose
These dos, niggaz that'll lift ya mentals
Lyrics'll twist your temples into pretzels
Like the ""Triumph"" instrumental
Black thought --
My instrumental's the Renaissance, no resem-ba-lance
To nothin' you come across, lyrical holocaust
The crowd pleaser emcees freeze then catch seizure
They praise the Lord of rap thesis, true believers
Punisher --
Just call me Baby Jesus 'cause lately niggaz be praisin' me
Just for the way I blaze to be crazily, tape to CD lasery
It pays to be amazingly flavery
Daaaaze 'em to my rhymes that basically hypnotize you occasionally
Black thought --
Occasionally as I focus on my next opus
The way it's all fucked up and emcees is hopeless
I leave your head wrecked as I erect sculptures
My thought's just a fortress, approach this ferocious up-closeness
Chorus -- Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggaz'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm-I'm-I'm...< >...
I'm supposed to represent

36,The Dream Shatterer,1998,Capital Punishment (1998),,Big Pun,"Ay-yo I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap like Adam and Eve from the garden
I'm carvin' my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the ""BP"" shine off the board head
Reverse that, I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
'Cause he ain't worth jack
Hit 'em with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back, watch the earth crack
Hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggaz be swearin' I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King, I be rapping and tongue's packing
The ones, magnums, cannons and gatling guns
It's Big Pun! The one and only son of Tony... Montana
You ain't promised manana in the rotten manzana
C'mon-pana we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana snake bite anaconda
I'm in Ivana with wine-a, try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin' I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma, and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kinda gramma
CHORUS -- When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination (2x)
I'm pure adrenaline, uncut, straight to your gut, medicine
Raw cure for pain I coat your brain like polyeurathane
Simple and plain, I'll explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire, I'm-a make it burn!
Higher and hotter than lava this scholar
Is 'bout just as smart as MacGyver
To put honor inside the heart of a lion
Revolved in a life of crime (crime!)
Fuck it I like the shine (shine!), Up in the white and lime (lime!)
Comes with the pipe design
Plushed out! (No doubt!) Both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach, GET THE FUCK OUT!
Take a hike, we can even battle to make it right
Go 'head lace the mic, you finished? Say good night...
Head to head in the street, I'll leave you dead in your feet
Settlin' beef, I'll even let you rhyme to the Benjamin beat
But it won't matter, you dreams still gon' shatter
It's a long ladder to climb and mine is on the stagger
So get outta town, 'fore I hit you
With the loudest sound you ever heard
Desert bird player you outta bounds
You need the Pun to dis you if your whole steez is unofficial
I'll come and get you and let the desert E's tongue kiss you
With one pistol and two clips, I'll make your crew do flips
Like acrobatics, I'm charismatic, my gat is magic
It makes rappers disappear, whisper in your ear
Crystal clear, come here, let me kiss your tears
Everything you fear is here, you ain't got to search further
The first murder's the worst now I thirst further for reverse birth
Every verse hurts, every curse word's already more offending
Than Eddie Murph's worst
I thirst for blood like a vampire, any man claimin' his game's tighter
Is a god damn liar!
I set 'em on fire, retire your train of thought
Drain a quart of blood out your brain and leave you insane in the dark
The king of New York! Lays his crown in the Boogie Down
And sprays the town, with a Mac hoodied down
I'm no joke! (Yuh!) I soak your face with a sweeper
Dying disgrace, I'll face your death through the speaker

Yo I don't think they're ready for this one
Another Darkchild remix
Brandy, RJ, Big Pun, Fat Joe, Terror Squad
Come on
(Big Pun)
Hear the truth shorty
With my fruit punch and my forty
Sweeter than candy, Brandy's the only one for me
You get it up
It's only the middle of the week
But when you called Joe and Pun
You kept it real with the streets
That's the true honor
Not the jewels or Garbana
Any fool can't accomplish just a few hundred dollars
That's paper thin, I got my mamma out the apron
I'm loyal to her from eight to ten
Make way for the twin
[Fat Joe](Brandy)
Who the twins that be making it hot
(Say what?)
Number one on you Billboard charts
Showing love to them thugs who be holding the blocks
And we be tearing up the club like the Three Six Mob
Joey Crack baby, ain't no time to react lazy
Brandy gave us a call and our track's gravy
Perhaps maybe we can ball with this
And all get rich, I ain't only talking ish!
(Brandy)
Some people say that I am not the same girl
They think that I am in my own world
What makes them think that I have changed, yeah
A little dough can not erase my problems
Me, like you, I have to try and solve them
Yes everything is quite the same
1 - [Brandy]
Sitting on top the world
Sitting on top, no that's not so
Everybody changes, let it go
Sitting on top the world
I'm just one girl trying to live my life
But someone telling me what I like
(Brandy)
Back in the days... when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
(Brandy)
I wonder why it's often said that my life's
A fairy tale and everything is so right
I wish that you could know the truth, yeah
My life is real so please don't get it twisted
Problems the same and got to be dealt with
These are the things I wish you knew, ooh yeah
(Fat Joe)
Ever since you wanted to be down
I wanted to put you on
But you ain't come around
Had no time for the don
Sixteen on the block
The latest phenomenon
Number one with a bullett
And your own sitcom
Brandy hand me one of the platinum hits
People talk but they don't know the half of it
Well the fact this is, we're in the worst business
And anything you have you deserve it miss
(Big Pun)
Encima del mundo
Follow the squad we never segundo
Tell el mundo, telling vatos of every remover
Word chula we packing men like Lollapalooza
From here to Havana, Cuba then Puerto Rico en scooter
Getting mula
Sitting on top of the world like A Buddha
Who the first Latin to go platinum without the basura
Big Pun the caputera with cheddar
Never settle for second best 'cause I'm primera, which forever
Repeat 1 till end"

Verse One: Prodigy
Yo, disperse from off this, who the culprits
That claim to be the newest, rappin' bullshit
My rhymes, get Ruger endorsements, my song boost
And the tech sales through the ceiling, let's talk with guns
Convo till the po-lice come
Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match
First max like it's Hamburger Hill for real
It's Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on, my outfit
Stuck on some wild out shit, all about it
We move gambit, through the overcrowded
Forthwith, pull out long fifths, extended clips
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc
Me and the click-a, sit down and eat dinner
Wake up every mornin write a new banger
That strike harder than your best attempt to sound like P
Or the H-A-V-O-C, nigga
""I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned""

Fake one, take one, no ultimatum face one
There's no escape from straight from the brain come the great one
My blade swung, decapitate your snake head
Slit your snake tongue make one false maneuver you a mystery
Unsolved, the mob that we robbed's automatically involved
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs
Rock turtledove bowery suits
And purple gloves, me and you can have some fun
Make it a blast, you couldn't take the impact
With steel shoulderpads, blood for blood
Veteran, covered in mud, wounded in the midst of war
Still tradin slugs gettin' major love
Way above you newcomers, I come thunderin
With the heat of two summers when I enter the zone
Move mountains with the presence alone before the words
Rip through the microphone, chrome dipped lyrics
Are known to split stone, you private eyes home in
But can't seem to clone
""I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned""
[Big Pun] Remember Pun, the one you bit your whole shit from?
""I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned""

Yo, Big Punisher's ready
Prodigy, Deck and me, QB (""Shaolin"") and Bronx trilogy
Lyrically hazardous for your wealth, swing on your world's piece
Foil your plans, boil your grams, take a shine
Fold all your hands, spoil your man's, make him mine
Take all you made, call you gay on Hot 97
Drop by your dwellin got the weapon right behind your melon
Ain't no tellin' when the bullet's behind the trigger
I do it to live niggaz and Pulitzer Prize winners
You wouldn't survive nigga, if I chose you
Froze you from ear to ear, showin your whole vocal
Who told you, you could roll through, my lyrics practically rose you
From the grave, like The Crow's do (*next lyrics overlap Scarface sample*)
I told you a long time ago, don't ever fuck me
'Cause if I leave you half dead (""Oah-kay!"" - T.M.) consider yourself

Meet me at Vito's with Noodles, we'll do this dude while he's slurpin' spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fuckin' floor, Joey Crack, buck 'em all
If they move, Noodles shoot that fuckin' whore
Dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know
That we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddly
It'll be a cold day in hell the day I'm taken out
Make no mistake for real I wouldn't hesitate to kill
I'm still the Fat One that you love to hate, catch you at your
Mother's wake
Smack you then I whack you with my snub trey-eight
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children
Like Amityville drill the nerves in your cavity fillin'
Insanity's building a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealing
A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support
I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves
My brother from another mother sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me, one of the best - might be
Even better leavin' niggas kneelin' on they right knee
Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture
You small change, I'm blowin' out your brains gettin' richer
Hit you with the Mac (Mac), smack your bitch, nigga what?

Supposed to supply us with rights, tonight I hold my rosary

You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it, it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it
Creep with me, as I cruise in my Beemer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kickin' ass as I blast off heat, and
You never see me talk to police, so
You should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat, and I'll leave you right there
So beware it's rare that niggas want beef, Big Pun speak
And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets
Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion, Puerto Ricans
Known for slashin' catchin' niggas while they sleepin', no relaxin'
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three Tecses in the jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars
Full-A-Clips mob inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock down
We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine
Every time plus I'm the crime boss of New York
When we talk to walk the walk all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk, I prey like The Predator, whoever want it
Go and get it set it baby and I'ma bury ya

You got to watch those, jokers who pop those

That's ca-ca, chill pa-pa, no ah-ah (ah-ah)

I'm quick to dumb out, run up in yo' crib with the guns out
Spray your peeps, smack the baby teeth out your son mouth
Who can stop me? I told shorty I'ma shoot you papi
Caught him in the crapper with the clapper;
While he was doin' caci
I'll probably die in jail - make it through life and fry in hell
Either way I'ma lead the way, cause only time'll tell
I rhyme for real, not that imaginary vocabulary
I really will stab you and every one of my adversaries
There's no remorse - fuck these thug niggaz, show me the boss
Gimme a hustle worth the risk of goin' up North
I love my freedom, and you know I love my bein
So sometimes I gotta get ugh and mug for my per diem
I'll see him in hell, we'll settle it there, better it there
No innocent bystanders to get hit with a spare
Like I really care who catches strays from the Mac
Like I really care who you paid to rap on your track
Nigga you wack - you ain't bringing nuttin for us
I got songs with the Devil and Jesus singin' on the chorus
You can't ignore us, nigga you know how we roll
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
(Big Punisher)
Can't no comp come at me, this battle the Bronx'll back me
Got the nicest niggaz alive talkin' bout, ""Papi's nasty""
Cocky crafty like Rocky sassy Puerto Rock Apache
Posse not even the cops could catch me
I'm too fast - four-hundred pounds, but I move ass
Soon as you spoke, I already smoked you with two jabs
My game is tight - you wanna play, just name your price
Fame to ice, your brains your life, the game is sheist
And I'm the trifest on the field
Even in school I was nominated the most likeliest to kill
This bastard steal, a full clip and a extra
And I'ma blast ya till your whole click respeta
Leave you muerta, it ain't me it's the metra
'Tate quieta, the bitch got a bad temper
Don't surrender - you ain't got a chance
You be lucky to leave here half-dead, in an am-bu-lance
So take a chance, but expect the worst
Put my foot so far up your ass
The sweat on my knee'll quench your thirst

Yo, yo, yo, yo...
Yo, yo, yo, yo...
Yo, yo...
It's hard to explain how my squad can harbor the strain
Of being the largest name in rap, since the almighty Kane
Acknowledge the fame, my call was to reign the streets from Harlem to
Queens
Back to the Bronx who fathered the dream
Started this thing called rap, where I reign supreme, my team
Regardless of that, I've seen things as far as the crack
That'll make the hardest largest artist heart just collapse
I'm part of all that that's why it's so hard to go back
And start from scratch
I'm locked and I'm trapped in a giant cage
Tryin' to savior these few dyin' days
I have left, to the form of flesh...
Should I lie in my grave?
I'm tryin' to persuade, my matto is try to be brave
And not give death the satisfaction of seein me dyin' afraid
That why I rise from the grave singing church songs like
I was Je-sus Christ ba-rum-pum-pum-pum
[Big Pun] (Chorus)
Whatcha gon' do when Pun comes?
Knockin' at ya front door
And he wants waaaaaaaaaaar... yeah
He ain't a rapper he'll kill you
(Big Pun)
Till my last breath I'll have death before dishonor
(Come on) and welcome drama (yeah)
Wit open arms and a code of honor
My hole persona equals that of gods
Definin' matters hard all before you even had a job
I'll stab and rob if I have to
Fuck it I'll blast you, tell the devil it wuz Pun if he ask you
And let him know how we be deadin' um'
Show 'em my emblem, the tombstone, the throne, every millennium
A child is born that can preform at a level beyond the
Expected 4 minute 30 second song
We reign supreme, my team be all up in ya dream
Wit the ""kill anything"" grill, chillin' beside the guilotine
Executioner style, black suit and a smile
Who's next to get their neck hacked loose in the crowd, move from the aisle
Don't make me have to prove that I'm wild
Word to Cuban, my crew killers, y'all niggaz shoot in the clouds
(Who's in the house)

[B-Real] B-Real of the hill eliminate the guitars
(Verse 1: B-Real)
Thinkin' of takin' a plane
To take a flight out to the red light
And smuggle 10 pounds of weed
Make it home tonight
Be the number 1 smuggler in the area
Got enough weed to fill up and air craft carrier
Erb slanger, Hasila Incorporated
State to state and over seas gettin' faded
Buddha king had seen the green proton
I'm bringing it on right back home to Don
Many different strains of erb in my brain
I'm slippin' through customs in my hydro plane
Skunk and the one chocolate ty bud
Niggaz let's get high in the sky hit the blunts
And the bongs, fill up the lungs, niggaz don't stop
Fools get sprung when they get there smoked up for crops
Like gettin' props, where all the soldiers in the board
Yo what would you do if the world was yours.

Having blocks on in the lava parts dome

Dime droppers will give ya fad time if you sleep
But momma single be mastera heater on city streets
In the east I be known as Don Cartegena
Claimin' the (?) like (?)
Lacin' the china wit Menida
To seller need repeater or be a leader
Like a preacher or presume a steeper
Peep the shit that I be on, sippin' Don
Until I'm drunk with a million in my trunk like Nikki Vons
Come on I be the top extortionist
Adopt adopted foster kids right out the muthafuckin' orphanage
Yeah, I do it for the youth, I'm livin' proof
All my peeps in the streets know I speak the truth.

With pharmasoticle lavatorys
Major to chemistry, PHD in streetology
Degree in drug industry
Combinin' H²O with matter from crack batter
Rest it through molecules scatter
Launchin' rockets to make the pocket fatter
Mind bitin' an arm starts a crime
G equals and MC dat ain't near the square son I gets mine
But yo the kill the fill with force fields and shields
And holy steel, a nigga keep it real
You know the deal, if the stakes ain't to high for me to grab
I got's to have, stack all the cabbage
From constructin' a drug traffic
Police a jam me in try to find a new pot to frame me in
Aramians so I resort the evil thoughts like Damien
This flame of fury to the D-A and the jury
100 grand the judges hammer slams I'm a free man.

Be larger than life, twice as nice as ya idol
Pump you with pride, then guide you str8 to hell like the bible
I'm lible to start manipulatin' minds infiltratin' clown
'M out the pitfalls of life entice with nickel plated nine
It seems every time I'm dream I'm in a nightmare of fiend
Livin' a world of mothers and queens and men would fight fare
[Fat Joe: Hell Yeah!] I wish I could, I wish I could
Never forget this whole damn world ain't shit I'm just a hood
Yo I change my life make my wife and get the chance for the pain
And physical abuse, give her back her best years
Grab my chest hairs, pound my fist on the hard cement
Spark the scent, and cloud the sky till my heart's content
Repent and vow she be forgiven
How could we be proud to live in a world
Which condems man, child, to women

I'm as wicked as Hitler first born
Cause of me, lot of old ladies purse gone
""Kill Niggaz Softly"" but not with her song
Matter of fact I kill 'em viciously, brutally
Strip them clowns down to nudity
Shove the chrome where they doodoo be
It's a stick up, don't try to get brave
Don't even chance it Duke
I want y'all motherfuckers strippin like you dance for Luke
Don't stop, give it give it - or you gon' get it get it
Get your fuckin' Yankee fitted splitted when I spit it spit it
Y'all faggot rappers funny as Saturday Night Live
Creep through in a white 5 and snipe five
Y'all got some trife wives
Show me where y'all re' at, where the ki' at
Sleep eat shit and pee at, park your 3 at
Spark like Vietnam, tell your mom through the intercom,
""UPS ma'am sign here,"" send a bomb
Leave that bitch - roasted and toasted like a chestnut
And if I run out of milk, for cereals, I leave her breasts cut
Got this pitbull and I feed him fresh guts - sick 'em Cujo!
Steal your bitch and dick the culo
Slam yo' ass and I don't know a lick of judo
Fly to P.R. - stick Menudo
Come back, cop a 6 with two-do'
Cop a brick from you know who, Julio Crew
From Washington Heights in jail I had niggaz washin my Nike's
Now I'm squashin the mic, extortionist type
Harsh with a knife
I'm flossin yo' ice on some Bronx shit tonight

Cannibalism is livin' in my metabolism
Givin' 'em spasms and aneurisms at baby baptisms
That's all my thugs thinkin' bout, drinkin' your blood
Boriquans love flooded rugs bloody and bloated mugs
Leavin' the reverand decap' and severn when I'm beheadin
The Armageddeon is lettin demons slip into Heaven
Goin' back to spiritual ritual times
What you gon' find - shiftings of Satan in critical bind
Nevermind, I do that often, I've risen often
Bust out my coffin, I'm a livin' abortion
Battled the Devil and deaded his demons
Trained other beings to be in his different levels of Hell,
Still screamin
Seein bodies bloody and babies bloated corroded
Know the Chinese exploded
Know they run with Gotti who know it (check it)
I never run I never ran, the fattest motherfuckin man
I roll with Cuban makin' junk to jams
That's all I'm knowin' and I'm never kneed
All on your soul I feed, I'm lettin punk motherfuckers bleed
Fuckin' with me, better hide yo' seed
Better think twice, before you ride on me
'Cause I'ma lift your weight,
Then I'm droppin' you in the incinerator
Then I'm hittin the hospital and poppin' two in the incubator
That's how we do it pana, hardcore, no more goo-goo ga-ga
Oh I'm sorry pa-pa, was you the da-da?"
48,You Ain't a Killer,1998,Capital Punishment (1998),,Big Pun,"[Verse 1]
The harsh realities of life are takin' toll
Even Jesus Christ forsake my soul
Please tell me what price to pay to make it home
Take control — I'm makin' dough, but not enough to blow
J.O.'s, they lust my flows, but 'ey yo, I don't trust a soul
That's all I know or need to, these evil streets'll meet you
Halfway and eat you alive tryin' to survive illegal
I'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross, whip you like a horse
Sacrifice your life to a higher force, then I'll stomp your corpse
It's the Bronx of course, recognize the accent?
One of the last livin' still in action general assassins
Catchin' any wreck, blastin' any tech, smashin' any chest
Passin' any test — Charles Manson in the flesh
Any last requests before you meet your maker?
Sow what you reap or wake up, shakin' up a storm like Anita Baker
I'll take you straight to hell and fill your heart with hate
Incarcerate your fate in Satan's fiery lake, then I lock the gate
Make no mistake, this shit as real as Job, we follow the killer's code
When we come for you, tell me, where will you go?
Nowhere to run, hide, I'll find you and and silence your screams
And even if you kill me I'll still be in your fuckin' dreams
[Chorus]
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat
[Verse 2]
You've made a grave mistake
Shouldn't of come here, you changed your fate
Your brains'll make the debut on the table when I raise the stakes
The pain is great but only for a second, it starts strong then lessens
Just when you restin', the Armaggedon sets in
Left him with [?] stress (T.S.), blessed him with no regrets (Yes)
Welcome to Hell, son — the threshold of death
Face the serpent: I blaze your person, you get laced for certain
Leavin' Jakes no trace to work from — close the case like curtains
I'm hurtin' head severely really tryin' to bring the pain
There's nothin' more satisfyin' than when you cryin', screamin' my name
It's not a game, it's Purple Rain, floods and bloodstains
Big Pun's my thug's name, bustin' my guns, that's my love thang
I'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your Adam's Apple
John Madden-tackle your corpse to hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
That'll have to hurt, I'll work your body 'til it burst
Then curse tu vida, like a Brujeria verse
I'm worse than anything you ever been through, sick in the head and mental
Essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan, when I'm the rhymin' abomination
[Chorus]
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk

It's hard to analyze which guys are spies— be advised, people
We recognize who lies— it's all in the eyes, chico
We read 'em and see 'em for what they are
D's in undercover cars, takin' my picture like I'm a fuckin' star
I'm up to par, my game is in a smash
With half a million in the stash
Passport with the gats, first name and last
Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
Give me the mini-shottie, I body a nigga for a penny probably
I'm obligated to anything if it's crime related
If it shine I'll take it, still in my prime and I finally made it
I hate the fact that I'm the last edition, properly a stash magician
Could've went to college and been a mathematician
Bad decisions kept me out the game, now I'm strictly out for cream
Doin' things to fiends I doubt you'll ever dream
My team's the meanest thing you ever seen
Measured by the heaven's kings, down to the devil's mezzanine
I've never screamed so loud— I'm proud to be alive
Most heads die by 25 or catch a quick 3 to 5
So be advised: the street's full of surprises
It's not what crew's the livest
One that survive, it's who's the wisest
[Chorus]
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap

You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk

I've never screamed so loud— I'm proud to be alive
Most heads die by 25 or catch a quick 3 to 5
So be advised: the street's full of surprises
It's not what crew's the livest
One that survive, it's who's the wisest
[Chorus]
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer..."
50,You Came Up,1998,Capital Punishment (1998),,Big Pun,"[Noreaga] Yo what the deal baby
I see ya aight
[Big Pun] Still not a playa but you still a hata
Ha, Pun here where my horns at
Where my horns?
(Horns sounding)
Intro/Bridge: Big Punisher and Noreaga
Fa ye da da ya da da da da
Fa ye da da ya da da da
Chorus: Big Punisher and Noreaga
[Noreaga] Pun you came up
What what, makin' it happen
From rappin' on the corner of blocks we going platinum
But when we roll, are you still ready to ride
[Big Punisher] Yo I be ready to ride and I be ready to die
(Big Punisher)
Ay yo my word is born long as I'm alive I'ma put it on
Could'a gone to gee shit, thug nigga till I'm gone
Where to Bronx I'm flippin, five boroughs thoroughly reppin'
Lets unite the city and step to the world as a weapon
'Cause everybody's checkin' for Pun second to none
'Cause Latins going platinum was destined to come
The inevitable, heavenly better than whatever you do
We eligible, TS's incredibly credible
For the revenue we gettin' you open with lyrical dope
And these breaths that are potent is like an injectional dose
[Big Pun and Noreaga] And it never quits
Take it from TS's top terrorist
Rapper slash hijacker bombin' tracks ever since
I was young, I wasn't always Big Pun
It wasn't always this fun, ay yo I rose from the slums
I had to pay my due, lay a few
But I ain't sayin' who, stayin' true to da game
No names, playin' it cool just me and da crew
Holdin' it down long as we round
We gonna keep sockin' it to you like Homey the Clown
Going down like Pac ready to ride or die nigga
La da le la la la la la
(Big Punisher)
Ay yo ain't nothin' changed I'm still the same
The way you remembered me since the centipede
Harder, big blacker back in the seventies
Try to remember me from my aggressive will
The way I kept it real is more important than any record deal
I used to chill on da block with Cuban and Seis
I still do but now it's in the blue convertible eight... fifty
My true niggaz will always be wit me
The shifty kiss me, tell me they miss me, then try to dis me
'Cause I'm rispy crispy for life sixties the price
Another fifty for the Cuban twisted in ice
Niggaz is shiest but I sike 'em out
Though they like to doubt I make them all believers once I let the Tyson out
'Cause I can vouch for only a few only the crew
From the old school I consider loyally true
I'm morally rude from a fool to a scholar
Follow the rules on how to spot a plotta that's cool for a dolla
I wanna holla at my peeps that reppin' the streets
Wrestlin the beast of chest restin' in peace
Blessin' my seeds and watchin' over us
Till I die I'll align the souls of mine
And shine for all of us"
51,You Was Wrong,2000,Yeeeah Baby (2000),,Big Pun,"(Drag-On)
What?
T-S nigga
Y'all don't know?
(Drag-On)
Aiyyo its on, I see how niggas didn't learn
You is wrong, thought the fire didn't burn
Its on, me and Pun ain't from the Bronx
You's wrong, nigga we can get it on
Aiyyo, guns we toss 'em, and bodies we auction
To his family we tell 'em he owed us a fortune
Gimme forty-thou, you can have yo' child, you don't know
What I had to go through, to clap this clown, check my background
The last nigga to see you bleed, the last nigga to see you breath
The last nigga you wish you shoulda believed
And Drag move quick, blend right into a wall like a brick
The only thing you see before I blow off ya shit is my wrist
'Cause my hand the gun is covered in
Not this range, when I pump this pistol, its very rare I miss it
Damn it on ya lips
Y'all keep talkin' like y'all teflon with no weap-ons
Nigga I'm pumpin my four, I ain't throwin' no more
Nowadays niggas run upstairs, open they drawer
My circumstance, you ain't got that chance mines in my draw, you get it?
That's means y'all walks for two dicks, so don't be stupid
And make me use one unless you ?that bitch?
(Big Pun)
Aiyyo its one, you thought I was wack
You was wrong, album double plat
Yo its on, stop talkin' shit
You was wrong, get off my dick
How dare you doubt on the ???, Big Pun the undoubtable
The only rapper that'll pull out a gun and slap the shit outta you
You can't tell me nothin', I'll clonk you and stomp out ya belly button
I'm too violent for this rap shit, I should be out somehwere killin' som'thin
Too quick to blast, some niggas talk shit and dash
But I really will KICK YOUR ASS
Juggernaut, I don't care if you a thug or not
I'll get Jamaican on ya ass, boy, with the Bambaclad
On your mark get ready, run, I'm sparkin everyone
The one get locked stand back and watch where you from
How dare you come and try to shit where I eat
Fuck you nigga, literally
Dick in your cheeks, you rich in the street
But I'm still gon' hit cha'll niggas
Because up north you be tossin salads with maple syrup
I know you hate to hear it, but everybody know this one
Why you always gotta be right nigga, why can't you ever be wrong
(Fat Joe)
Now its on, from the Bronx where it's at
You was wrong, me and Pun brought it back
Now its on, stay on with the gat
You was wrong, it's the Don, Joey Crack
Who the fuck want beef with Joe Crack
Make your body fold back
Lift his soul with the chrome mack
I don't chat on the phone, 'cause the phone tapped
You heard there's money on the block we control that
I got the work in the pot where that stove at
Cook it up till its wack, get my dough back
You niggas so wack, tryin'a compete
I blind you with heat, I'm the reason crime on the street
I die for my peeps, keep an open eye when I sleep
Let you slide when I coulda put five in your Jeep
Who's liver than me? I ain't know you really want it
I'm like Christ, niggas beg for they life when they see me comin'
Ain't nodoby gonna stop my shine, you out'cho mind
Don't make me have to cock my nine, pop ya spine
Neva did believe in the Don's
Since ninety-two I've been proving that y'all niggas was wrong
(Remi Martin)
Aiyyo, its on, though I'd stay on the block
You was wrong, now Remi on the rock
So its on, thought I wasn't gonna drop
You was wrong, I was right all along
I told these niggas, that I was the sickest bitch
And every time you spit, I'ma spit some sicker shit
Ridicoulous, I reminise when I blaze the track
Tight shit, make a nigga wanna play ya back
I'm hatin' that, but I'ma make 'em all believers
Fuck hot, I'ma come and straight drop a fever
Cop a heater, turn around and pop your leader
And for the followers, I'ma leave their heads hollower
Make your wig twisted as if I was Oliver
Layin in a hospital, hooked up the monitors
That's for the game, y'all lames just came to first
'Cause I ain't neva heard a bitch straight flame a verse
I blame the church, how God let you lie like that
Who scribed you for, 'cause you ain't neva rhymed like that
How the fuck you gon' tell me that chick is tight
She ain't 'aight 'cause she don't write, you wrong
Yeah Baby"
