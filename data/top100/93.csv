Headcrack, time to get the bread black!
4, 5, 6 is in the mix - I'm hittin them with trip's
Headcrack, time to get the bread!
I rolled on every cee-lo corner that I know inside the city
Kiddies, I got a fat mitt in my pocket lookin' pretty
So who wanna get paid on the block? A thousand's in the pock'
Now go and grab your knots from the stash spot
I shake them up and shake them up roll and I break 'em up
Two ? and a pound-cake (""Yeah nigga, wake 'em up!"")
Keepin' my fingers wrapped around the joint in case niggaz
Start brawlin, because I see 'em FALLIN' to the strong point
One by one they losin down the line
A fifty buck roll, a duck blows, old nigga pay me mine! (""Damn nigga!"")
I grab the dice, place your price, all you men are mice
Riffin as I'm sippin on a Heineken and gettin' nice
I shake 'em up they papes are gettin' dead, nigga sittin' on a Beretta
Said he wanna bet that I don't throw a better
Now the game is surrounded by some money hungry bitches
I put the kisses on my fists and rolled the triple sixes
And once again it be the point, that I shoot
That be puttin' crazy loot, in the pocket of my army suit
Now who wanna come throw another round
I rolled a fo', a six, hold up, NOW I seen a fuckin' pound
Yeah you nigga know what the name of the game is
I'm in yo' anus, cee-lo you know that shit that made a nigga famous
Because I'm on the ding-dong, I can't go wrong

I make 'em sweat from beginners to the vets, I'm a threat
Some niggaz double up on they fifty bets
I gotta be nice to the dice, so I'm talkin' to em
I step back, gave a snap on the sidewalk and threw em
Nigga went and put his foot in the way see, and tried to ace me
Now I've got niggaz rollin' to that bitch Tracy
Yeah, but Tracy ain't so gentle, niggaz thought she was simple
And loses with two deuces and a fuckin' pimple (""A loser!"")
I crack another brew, sit back and watch what niggaz do
Who threw that 2-U? I'm rollin' the whole fuckin' crew
One by one niggaz come payin', that fell to the trey and
Furlough inside the bait, that's what a nigga sayin'
Your luck is tough, I'm makin' enough to buy a kilo
Uh-oh, look out below, I think I rolled another cee-lo
Pick up my crap, niggaz don't get back a DIME of that
And keep my hand right by my waist where my nine is at
One more test, and niggaz quittin, that's zero
Broke, cryin broke, I'm doin' backstrokes in cee-notes
Crazy pockets are empty, what a god damn shame
Niggaz you know the name of the game - word the fuck up!

I know this chick, yo mami is rich, she push a six
Living some bloodshed, her man is pushing bricks
Crib way out in the sticks, they house looking slick
It's like some shit straight out of a Hollywood flick
Me and my clique met the chick up at Saint Nicks
Honey was thick, I was the first nigga to kick
Yo mami was thick, silk skirt with thigh split
I couldn't quit, trying to peep out the privates
The live shit, you know how loose I get
I'm scheming on her back, peeping her hips, fiending to hit
Plump cherry lips, medium tits, Chink eyes her baby hair chick
The type you want to pair with, have an affair with
We chattered a bit, slipped me the digits, to the hip and the phone flip
Said she had to split, hopped in the whip, headed up the strip
Probably had to get with her man and shit
Later on at night, I'm stressing love at first sight
Some ain't right, I ain't the type of cat like me
To be dealing with mad feelings
And even though mami was mad appealing
Body revealing and big wheeling
This shit is illin, I don't like it
Fuck it, I can't fight it
I reaching for the cordless to call Miss
I insist to get with this
Tan Tone answer the phone, ""Hello, who this?"" (chick)
""It's me baby, G Luciano, what up lady""
""Fine and how you doing boo"" (chick)
""Ain't nothing new but you, angel, yo why don't you swing through
""We could sip on some champagne from Spain boo""
About an hour or two she came through, fly hairdo
We link, push in the six circle circle drink
To purple mink, had mad bank, Chanel bag full of Benjamin Franks
More ices than a hockey rink, face of a Saint
Went for a drink ? Hot shots
Would wanna spend those five digit o's, on bimbo's
Bar closed, back to her six double o, she drove
My eyes closed her nigga dozed, when I awoke
Saw mad snow, we at her spot at the Poconos
Bridge robes, crib hot as a stove
She changed out of her clothes, put on a silky bath robe
Panty hoes with see through holes, pretty toes
Took me into the master suite, shit was sweet
Jacuzzi four feet deep, with satin sheets
As I was speaking to this half black/latin freak
Met on a Manhatten street, body petite, fat on the cheeks
I was getting open, started laughing and joking
We weed smoking, stroking, the shorty's spoke and
Said what the deal is, the realness
My man is crazy as Bruce Willis
If he catches us, he'll try to kill us
He got a whole army of Kiiers
Me no worry, I got the clapper son
End of the first verse, chapter one
Word
Shit is real in the field
Thug love story
(G. Luciano)
So here I am
Laid up in this lavish house, up in the Poconos
With this chick I don't even really know
Steady stressing me how ill her man is
So what I go and do, heh-heh, I nail her ass to the bed anyway
Straight twisting mami's back out
Hit three o'clock, fell right the fuck to sleep
Clothes still on, breath smelling like Henrock
Totally no kind of regards for this bitch's man
I guess it's just another one of those G Rap adventures
(Kool G. Rap)
The next day about a quarter to eight
I heard a squeek on the staircase
Got the gat from under the pillow case
Somebody broke in, now me and boo fully awoken
Good thing I slept inside my clothes and shorty was frozen
I'm waiting for a head to poke in, and start smoking
The home invasion, right through the door, he started blazing
Bullets was grazing, shit was crazy and
I had to think to fast, let the gun blast, duck, then dash
Heard a crash, they broke through the door, they on her ass
Jumped off the balcony like a falcon Gee
With honey right in back of me, feel on top of the snow in agony
Shit was thick, couldn't get to the six, they loaded the fifth
Saw the snowmobile yo fuck it
We start jumped it, get on top of the shit and peeled
Mad soldiers out in the field, busting they steel
The raw deal, kill or be killed, shit is real
Ten hit me right on my heels, trying to make a thugs blood spill
In zero degrees, niggas on skis, me and these Gees
Slipping through pine trees, we skid up behind these
Two big rocks and left off shots, about four dropped
The other six started to pop, I feel something hot
I think I got hit, my jacket is ripped
Loaded my last clip then broke out quick and checked the chick
She on my back tighter than shit, like vise grips
I started clapping, niggas rolled up in blowing black and
Spotted this Rover by a log cabin, we got our as in
Mash the gas, make the fucking wheel spin
The safety again, and still doing a hundred and ten
Shorty shivering, lips quivering, ski suits up in the back seat
Pulled over the Jeep get it in
And took a rest stop at the river bend
We living, we made it the fuck out, mad slugs delivering
Pretty soon we at my rest piece, up in the bedroom
Got shorty boo tending my bullet wound
Put on some tunes, she blew my shit like a balloon
Up in the moonlit room, and dicking her womb
Hitting full behind her, grinding her with my anaconda
She rode the dick like a honda
I took her to the point of no return like Bridgette Fonda
She back spasmed, giving the crazy orgasm, from steady rhythm
My dick glistened, her lips hit'em, I shot jism
Then laid back in the sack and lit the ism
I thought about the realism
Niggas coming and bring they steel with them
I got just the thing to deal with them
Nickel plate Mac, the laser attached, with two clips packed
Push a niggas whole head back, so I snatched that
So quick spread out and play the layout
Still on alert, me and the skirt, day in and day out
(G. Luciano)
Yo what's the matter mami, you scared or something?
(Mami)
I'm a little worried baby
(G. Luciano)
Yo, don't be worried about nothing, all right
Everything is gonna be all right
(Mami)
OK
(G. Luciano)
Look, we just gonna go to your house, go get the money
You know, we gonna get your backs or whatever
And we gonna get out of there, all right?
(Mami)
All right, ven paca papi, dame un besito
(G. Luciano)
All right, grab that bag money
(Mami)
Let's do this, baby
(Kool G. Rap)
After three whole days of lamping, we broke camp and
Went out to the beach, many mansions out in the Hamptons
Brung the clamp, ready to shoot shit up at random
Five hundred grand is buried in the sand
We planning, up in the crib-o with big windows, I'm counting the dough
She packing her clothes, had her Lexus in the back of the Rolls
I saw the keys, I grabbed the G's, we on and took those
Shit was sitting on some chrome momo's
Tinted windows, a LS Ford double O
Told the chick, yo you moving to slow
Speed it up baby, we got to go
And get this plane and hit the Caymans
With the payment, somebody came in
A platoon of goons with heaters aiming
I drew the Mac 10 and started flaming, they did the same and
Slugs spraying and blood raining, I left about seven thugs laying
But this one cat was gaining, he grab the dame and
Put the heater to the chicks brain and
I let my two guns drop, they got the drop
They took us both to a boat dock, then on a yacht
The chick's man was there with a sixteen shot
Nigga was hot, took the glock and hit me dead in my knot
Honey started to panic and yelling that money in Spanish
Thinking he's out to take advantage
So we're out in the fucking Atlantic
With no lifesavers and stranded
Backhanded the chick on the floor, called her a whore
Said, ""amor you won't be pretty no more""
Took us on a tour, down in the deck
Guess he wasn't ready to kill us yet
Saw this nigga there, holding the Tec
Ready to wet, I'm started to sweat, a niggas stressed
We up beside a horrible mess
I saw a box with the letters on it S.O.S
So I took out a flare gun and shot the kid in the chest
Took the Tec from out his hand, now I'm ready to bless
The madness, put the rest of them niggas to rest
Looked around, the chick's man was the only one left
Threw his ass over board and told him hold your breath
Caught my breath, I seen honey down on the deck
Eyes closed with a bullet hole dead in her breast
Held her in my arms till her soul finally left
I'm mad depressed, my baby was an innocent death
A real thug lost the only women he loved
And I bugged, busting slugs at the stars above

2,Black Widow,2002,The Giancana Story (2002),,Kool G Rap,"She tossed the flamer '94 walked into danger
Behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back on the street, back on her feet
Clappin the heat...
(Unknown singer)
She's dressed to kill
Iced-out head to toe, a snake in black
She's cleared, to, get ill
She's about the dough, the black widow
(Verse 1: Kool G Rap)
Yo, she was a tight bird, female version of Iceberg
To put in the right words
Played the right curves, beige and white birds
The type she served it was quite superb
Ran through the city in a white suburb
Lived in a predominantly white suburb
She liked the herb, rockin' all the richest type of furs
Make your life submerge if you strike a nerve
Dough she like to splurge
Shine of her light blurs from off her finger
Honey was off the ringer, the way she tossed the flamer
'94 walked into danger, behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back to the street, back on her feet
Clappin the heat, from the back seat, in back of a jeep
Stackin the heat, pilin the ones
Made her point when violence was brung
Regulated and balanced the slums
Brought in a cat with a talent for guns
Click quick to silence a Dunn
Convoys of black limos
Employs strapped with mack millos
Bustin' off caps through a cracked window, that's the MO
Push your wig back, make you a black Leno
The feds on her tracks got the phones tapped for info
Tryin' to map the dividend flow, and where the ends go
Checkin' on whose name the Benz go
Who pushes the buttons when Mac-10's blow
A rose on a black satin pillow
The silhouette of her web, killin' for bloodspill, a black widow
[Chorus: unknown singer] + (Kool G Rap)
She's (out for blood) dressed (for the kill) to kill (bustin' slugs)
Iced-out (shit is real) head (livin' crime) to toe (life of crime)
A snake (droppin' heads) in black (pullin nines)
She's cleared (dodgin heat) to (play the street)
Get ill (let the guns blow, had to eat)
She's about (copped the raw) the dough (went to war)
The black widow (beef no more, cold fours at your door)
(Verse 2: Kool G Rap)
She was married but four times a widow
The fifth time ditto, kiddo
Step out of line, kitko, she spit nines and shi-dells
Put a pound to the tip of your niddose
Put 'em in line piddles
Diamond-stud shinin the clito', the web spinnin
With bloodstains soaked in the bed linen
Spread venom, known for bustin' the lead grinnin, tilted red brimmin
Makin' the lights inside of your head dimmin
Givin' head to men and, leave a knife in they chest with a red ribbon
Bread to swim in, foes get left deader than Lennon
Threads of linen, sippin gin with a shread of lemon
Dead-up thoroughbred, slim and trim and stackin cake like Emminger's
Under the down coat brown coat like cinnamon
She went to have the Benjamins, for that she injure men
Send a squad to go and injure men that injure men
On top of that she popular, hit the opera
Francis Ford Coppola, mezzanine she's with binoculars
You even think about poppin' her, stoppin' her, moppin her, droppin' her
Hard with bodyguards divin on top of her
Cops in they Blu-Blockers watchin her, steady clockin her
Jock her, dreamin' of knockin' her, thinkin' a scheme for knockin' her
Dress provocative, show the cleavage between her knockers
Bust a sock off with a blocker to rasta inside her locker
She cover the bills though, restaurant delicatessen Armadillo
White Willow, strike of the black widow
(Verse 3: Kool G Rap)
She held a white weddin
Type settin just like a sight from heaven
Spend twice the bread'n from her last rice on her head'n
All types of presents, striking presence
Bodyguards ready to light they weapons, ignite the Wessons
Refuse to live the life of a peasant
Days and nights was right and type pleasant
At the foot of the aisles, took vows
With all the criminals and crook pals
That put smiles on niggaz' necks while they look foul
Piles of cops peepin her central book files
Beef them niggaz cook wild, groom lookin' shook style
Forced into marriage, horse and a carriage
Remember lifespan shorter than average, lady boss flossin her carats
Dreams to get rich and perish in Paris
Cherish the cabbagem, makin' her path out of the church passage
Thugs they do they dirt massive
Skirt slashed, first class, Doni Amberg glasses
Flirt with her lashes
Snapshots, smirk for the flashes
Plots to leave her murked in the masses
Two killin' experts on the grasses
Put in they Tec work for the cashes
Leave the Earth hurt with a passion
Two louds shots burstin in action
Made her head jerk from the blastin
Lady down, holdin' her shirt gaspin, hit by another turf assassin
Reason not even worth askin; the facts are real, though
Got her cap peeled for stackin real dough
Lifestyle brillo when you're rollin' for krill dough
Death of a black widow"

This one goes out to my Queens thugs, that steam slugs
My real killers out on the corner that's seen blood
My wild niggaz schemin with snubs, fiendin for grub
Eatin off the streets, triple-beamin the drugs
The ones that put a red beam in your mug
The ones that bug and be in the clubs
And hide whips, gleamin with dubs
This one goes out to my peoples
That hit the hot blocks to cop the diesel
In back of the spots but chop on the lethal
Then pop goes the weasel
If niggaz want it, then pop goes the eagles
We can draw guns and rock like The Beatles
Drop pots of evil, ghetto D with shots from a needle
Lay you down with shots that are cerebral
Before rap, my click was hot as Segal, now we clock legal
Hop like Kenieval, pass the cops in our Regals
Above blowin' like diplomats, me and my click of cats
Duck when we spit the gat or get your shit twisted back

That young fella straight from the slums and that's that
Got kicked out of school 'cause I used to carry guns in my knapsack
Been a serious dude, never the one to laugh at
So play crazy and this 380'll twist your cap back
Before rap, I played the slums where the cash at
Duckin the boys in blue, with jumps in asscrack
Now I switched over, but still tote the big toaster
For niggaz schemin so I'm fiendin to bend your wig over
You might catch the kid herbed out, bent over
Without a license, gettin' brain in a tint Rover
But not for nuttin, a frontin dude get popped for frontin
Y'all the type to snitch when a cop's comin'
But that don't stop nuttin cause trust me the cop's duckin
A badge don't mean shit, when the glocks is gunnin

Or be worse, layin with they wig hotter than the oven

G Rap as real as it gets, peel with the fifth
Bust down a mill' with the click, ill with the chicks
Wheelin the 6 to cribs on hills in the sticks
Metal we pack is heavy you can feel when it spit
Used ta, reel in the chips, slangin krills on the strip
Now we, spillin the Crist', niggaz still with the hits
Won't stop until I cop a half-a-mill' for the wrist
Rule with a iron fist but still in the midst
G Rap and his squad of guerillas, carve your grill up
Harsh killer hold the hammer like 20 bar villains
Spit flames like Godzilla, menage-a-trois in large villas
Pack the trey-pound God pealer
It's a hard thriller mob chiller
Decide your fate like a Tarot card dealer
Y'all niggaz is yard squealers; play around and be a scar feeler

4,Blowin' Up in the World,1995,"4, 5, 6 (1995)",,Kool G Rap,"Back in the days was kinda crazy, kid I started out with nothin'
Wasn't livin' like Thanksgiving, I was turkey without the stuffin
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the poorhouse
Say mama caught the drama, she would bleed tryin' to feed 4 mouths
Wasn't rockin' Girbauds, I barely had clothes, and when it snowed
And temperatures droppin' below zero, you know I froze
No CD's, a black and white TV, a seat is a rubber tire
With a hanger for the antenna, turned channels with some pliers
Had nothin' in my cabinet, but cans of Raid
I'm knockin' on my neighbor's door
To borrow a cup of sugar for my Kool-Aid
I wasn't freshly dipped, my gear was straight ripped, I'm trippin'
Cause my winter coat got lost buttons
And zippers that wouldn't stay zipped
I never remembered ?, the brother was straight fat cat
Not even a Big Mac black, I had Kid Castle topped with crackerjacks
Walkin' the streets, with the weak sneaks on my feet
And the freaks wouldn't speak, I never had lipstick on my cheek
So much for gettin' humped from the stunts, I always struck out
The one y'all likes is takin' hikes if you can't pull a buck out
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, youknowhatI'msayin? I'm blowin' up in the world

Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, yeah...
It seems like only yesterday, my moms was on my back
""Get your butt up out the sack and find a job or hit the road Jack""
Black, I don't disown her, I'm just a kid from Corona
With a G.E.D. diploma, with more ribs showin than Tony Rhoma's
In order to get straight, I gotsta to make a muscle
Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle
Standin down on the corner slangin fat rocks to bottles
With the black tops, for cops got my shorty watchin my back Hobbes
Makin' mad lucci, bought up Louis Vuitton gucci
Hoochies callin me boochi, while they smooch me, givin' up the coochie
Now I'm a felon, started sellin and splittin melons
I started gellin, to tellin' police just 'cause I was swellin
Hangin' out on the corner playin' cee-lo, rollin' for half a kilo
Yo you'll never see G-low a-goin' below
Yeah, straight gettin' fortunate, as long as fees was torchin it
It started gettin' hot around the block, the cops was scorchin it
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me
Cause business is drugs is gettin' too risky
So now I just lamp, collect stamps, snatch up tramps diamonds and pearls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines

Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, yeah...
I got put on by DJ Polo, cut the record, ""It's a Demo""
And started chillin' in limos with champagne and tinted windows
Hoppin, no time for pages, sportin gold chains and rings
Clockin money and fame, nothin' changed, I'm still the same
Just spendin 20's and 10's at women pullin on my linen
And grinnin 'cause I was winnin' in this game from the beginning
The lyrical skills was kinda ill, gave you a slight chill
So I just let the hype build, known for rappers run and go write wills
I turned from a hobo to a solo bozin for dolos
Stole my dough, you still below, now I perfer cigars and blow Mo'
So catch a flashback, of a G. Rap track, attacked, like a headcrack
That's smack, through your cap, with the lead black
And here's a new cut, for pooh-butt, rappers hangin' from off my
Two nuts like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux
So peep Kool G. Rap, don't sleep, money unless it's witcha girl
Straight up kid, I'm blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, youknowhatI'msayin? I'm blowin' up in the world

Mine flooded with crush, rides big as a bus
Thirty-two plus, what can you and your crew do to us
But look in disgust, plot to seize the shinin sea
From coppin the V-T-W-E-L-V-E
Pissed off at G's but we don't believe in knockin' knees
We cock and squeeze, and leave some shit shot and breeze
Attractin these chicks mixed, black and Japanese
And slappin these nitwits, with fat stacks of G's

On her knees, see more semen than all the seven seas

With the chick-o's, hit the ones with the six-oh's
Hollow tops spit those, let the dough pile

6,Cannon Fire,1998,Roots of Evil (1998),,Kool G Rap,"Heyyo check it
This goes out for all of the ones that's walkin' around here
Out in the streets blindfolded
Not knowin' what's really goin' on
Nawimsayin?
These streets is a habitat baby
Word up
Pito
In the garden of snakes, ain't no breaks, no mistakes
Just games that's played at high stakes, the next guys wake
Try ta fly strait, not violate if you wanna die late
The tri-state, crime at a high rate, where peoples dilate
Gun shots that make the block vibrate, it shook niggas migrate
Some die by fate, yo niggas cry hate
A fly facer get they thighs scraped
And little PUS that's why raped
A kid inside his gate get murdered by jake
A young nigga try ta fly capes, and get caught on the FBI tape
In verse of the State
Lost the case and gotta fry date
Ninety ninety eight, day of July eighth
Some cats get ta stack the hot papes
Live in the skyscrapes
Go ta airline, buy flyin' states
Where they can hibernate and operate
Impregnate, so ???
Other niggas will lay the power race, wit tre 8's
Try to apply weight, and ready ta die staced off and dehydrate
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down
Son how that sound?
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down
Son how that sound?
It's like a time bomb you hit Vietnam ta Saigon
Keep your mind calm, your nine on, me hard ta find harm
Peep the crime dons rollin' wit ex-cons holdin' they out rons
And teflons ta be streets flooded wit red ponds
Like it was red dawn, bodies get found around without the heads on
Judges set bonds that figures they know niggas is dead on
What's left of death penalty facilities where niggas step on
Wit those that blew trough, go get they body filled wit electrons
The tec drawns, the ones that live foul, they're leavin' wet moms
Wit lead charms, put her ta bed wit her head drawn
Killas wit red palms leavin' bodies cool as the dead fawns
Caught in the dead wrong, found they way, ran into the feds arms
Yo
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down

For steady cash flows, niggas'll blast you past the Astros
Blow you like afros, the little fast hoes that last all the fast dough
They splash foes, red as Tabasco, they lay your asshole where the grass grow
Runnin' wit armies like they Castro
Them Donny Brasco's get Johnny Doj around they last holes
Keepin' 'em half froze, put in shiny boxes rockin' they last clothes
The cash close inside your top pocket of stashed roast
Body got found down on the back roads where all the trash blows
And broken glass globes, the dip chicks slicker than gastro
Who bag a slash blow and spot some top of the block hot as a gas stove
That's Mastro's cats in the Astros
Who ain't afraid ta let they gats go
The paper dash bros lovin' the flash though
And pass mo'
Stash rolls, count 'em like math pros
And crash low soda, PoPo's don't step all up in they path yo
Them cats go, that's smack on the back burner, but keepin' the gas low
When task rolls they snatch his ass mows, movin' too ass slow"
7,Da Bosses Lady,1998,Roots of Evil (1998),,Kool G Rap,"(Imitation of excerpt from the movie ""Scarface"")
That chick he's with... (huh) she like me
Oh, she likes you huh? How do you know?
I know. The eyes Chico... they never lie
What, are you serious?
I'm serious... what do you think?
Man that's the boss's lady
{*Sarcastic*} The boss's lady
You're gonna get us killed
Fuck you mayn! The boss's lady... that guy's soft
You got some of that for me?
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?
(Verse 1: Kool G. Rap)
Had to have her
Since my first glance at her, pimp stance at her
Watchin men throwin' Banjamins and Grants at her
Bottles of Italy and France at her
Advanced at her, spit romance at her
Champagne glasses chatter
Ass fatter than that actress up in Family Matters
Lips thicker than Mick Jaggers
Dick so hard the shit could stab her
She pushed a sick Jaguar
Paint shined like it was black lacquer
Carried a small gat for back up, whole shit spectacular
Peepin out her frame walkin' in back of her
She had the hourglass shape, girls disgraced stay out her way
Past late, get that ass raped, fast tied up with mask tape
Mad papes, I could tell by the way she was draped
Her sex mate's caked up like Drake's
He got the crib by the lake
Wanted by the Jakes for takin' powder weight outta state
Straight surrounded his grounds with tower gates
Garden lookin' like a flower wake
Every hour he make about enough dough to spoil this bitch sour
Sex, money, and power, pussy good enough to devour
Hit her up inside the marble tiled shower
Snapped back to reality, told me her name was Valerie
Don't fuck around with the help
Nigga on the salary, pockets too low calorie
Her man'll send the cavalry, straight turn the town to a shootin gallery
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Off his life
To get in good with the boss's wife
Cross his life just to floss his ice
To get him hit for the cost of rice, tossed at night
If the thoughts is right
Bodies could get lost in sight
(Verse 2: Camileone)
The boss's lady, I cocks the four-fifth and hold it steady baby
My man ship mo' weight, than the fuckin' Navy
Out to get this gravy, so you can't take mine
You crossed the line, fuckin' with the boss's devine
Aiyyo, his man's, they commit crimes (yeah right)
Found out you tryin' to fuck with his dime, you lay your life on the line
But the cards are in my hands
I love this rich man, and fuckin' you is not in the plans
I'm out to get grands and livin' on my own land
So why fuck with that help? I'm livin' in wealth, you under his belt (whatever)
Hourglass shape I know you felt, wonderin how the pussy smelt
Lavish taste'll have you livin' in debt
Fantasizin 'bout his wife's sex, how could you disrespect
The man who supply the cash for yo' checks? (So what?)
On the low cause you know he blaze tecs, and you fear for what's next
Your life could be dead, for tryin' to get my pussy wet
Realize the bigger picture, I deal with bigger figures
Don't have time for affairs, with the average niggaz
Keep the lustin to a limit, cause ain't no benefits in it
Too much to lose if I let you hit it
You know the force is deep, and you wanna creep
Thinkin' how sweet it would be if I just let you eat
But till the boss show, I gotta stay true, the chump change won't do
For me with you, isn't evident boo
(Kool G. Rap)
I like your style, kid you get wild, let the chips pile
My click slit smiles across your man's throat, so look who big now
Barkin on shit like a big growl, lame chick you got this shit foul
We got the big bricks shipped in from miles
While I'm whippin shit, 6 plus 6 valves
Do a milli' from sick style, we regulate it
Yo boo I guess you haven't heard the latest about these new ages
Stackin outrageous
[Camileone] + (G. Rap)
Yeah, I heard about the way you flip birds
Got these niggaz standin on the curb, leafers and herbs
You and my nigga exchanged words then parted ways
You swore to God all day your squad would spray
My man in all kinds of sick and retarded ways
(Straight gave him a harp to play)
I peeped your resume (You with me Angel?)
Yeah no doubt, but I should bang you"
8,Da Heat,1998,Roots of Evil (1998),,Kool G Rap,"Still on this paperchase
Load the stacks up in the safe
Cause champagne tastes with beer money don't cut the cake
Me and my peoples play for high stakes
Look out for FBI jakes to turn up the case and place me upstate
But yo its all legal
Every last printed bald eagle
We started out as small people now we tall and lethal
From poverty, to land properties, runnin' monopolies
We properly, sit in butter leather shit and mahogany
Call it robbery, just as long as I grab the lottery
Im tryna prospectally strictly going for jackpottery, obviously
Kool G Rap I like a lotta cheese
A novelty, models be stripping
Like the shit's pornography, the odyssey, lyrical prodigy
See my philosophy like Socrates
Logically cats follow me catastrophically
Apostle G
Your role model be and anything less is just an S.O and S. with the apostrophe
Fuck all that hypocrisy
You know who got with these lyrics about the street heat first
Check my biography, its possibly
Cause I was ahead of my time just like a prophecy, monstrosity
Nigga wanna copy me like photography
: Hits so hot, come hit him up!
: Straight, bringin' the heat son!
(4 times)
We keep the raw's flowing, the Glocks blowing, the pockets swollen
The poppy seed lye's growing, knots big as Samoans
Got cash flowing out the colon
Be on the yard dash like Jesse Owens
Tryna get strikes and riches like bowling?
People look out for Jakes patrolling
They hate to see niggas be straight and holding mad diamonds glowing and the papers folding
We rolling Kennedy Caver? status, living it lavish
Cop the shit thats as hot as a raddish
Five o' one quarter carats from outta Paris
My units is moving quicker than Randy Travis
A lyrical style that ravishes, creeping past all your averages
Carry my own weight, fuck extra packages
Just make sure this is quick as savages? from outta the habitat with bad habits kid!
Lift up your whole wig, get you jigged just for one more hole in the Earth to dig
When I spit the shit from out the cig?
Its nothing short from bloodsport to get your mug torched
Listen to what the thug taught
Before you get rocked, down on the block for cops to find your blood corpse
From scud missles
That I could sizzle your blood and tissue
Got dirt by the fake ones and all the unofficials"

Got one of these GS-4's? Navigator system and everything, word up...
Chorus - (Singing) That's all I wanted, was someone special, someone
Sacred in my life, Baby won't you be my Daddy Figure...
I regulated you from fake dudes to lake views
Minks with laced jewels
Nails, hairdo's and facials
Placed you in snake shoes
Did it up right, took the six night seven day cruise
The beige creludes
Your pockets stay full, upgraded you, made me wait too
I made you my suede boo, main chick, wifey and Angel
Put ten Karrots on your wrist, five on your ankle
My whole angle, allow you in my triangle
To shine and twinkle, eat steak off a platinum single
These other cats is rectangles, they sweat bad girls
They Bullwinkles, tricks of Rip Van Winkles
But now you mingle with a real cat that gets the Pringles
And all you gotta be is thankful that we can see the sea food menu's
Push whips, hit all the venues
Fly gear sharp as Ginsu's
Stare at the other pairs of gym shoes
As long as you continue, to keep it genu
Never pretend to, I know its in you
The true Mommi, jigged out female Armani
With tight Nani, sippin' on Cristal and Donny
Roll with mad Parmesani
Pretty the most, no lactose, had to play you close
Fataly attracted like Glen Close
Made other men ghost
Staright overdose of high post
You rollin' with me, rich man's wife live your life in luxury,

I lays down my laws at the door
And any nigga that's lookin' for trouble
Gotsta face these silver double-four's
That I be packin on my hip, hollow-tips inside the clip
Ready to rip a niggaz shit and make his wig slip
To the side as a homocide's committed
I gets rid of niggaz quick cause ain't no bullshit permitted
I'm a outlaw, the motherfuckin villain doin' killings, I won't stop
Until the morgue got bodies stacked up to the fuckin' ceiling
And ain't no drivebys, a mag and a bag lady, disguised and surprise
You got a hole between your fuckin' eyes
Niggaz is grazed, catchin strays from the blaze
Amazed by the ways I lays 'em down when my shit sprays
Crazy brains hangin', and niggaz veins are swingin'
Bangin' and gunslingin, even my own fuckin' ears are ringin'
'Cause what I carry's much bigger than Dirty Harry's
Do a Hail Mary, I make Bloody Mary's out of your capillaries
Pieces of flesh, hangin' off a niggaz chest, cause the vest

And one inside the wifey and the baby carriage
So head for the hills, I kills niggaz for thrills
Causin crazy blood spill, when I let one drill in your grill
I will pull out the glock to clear the blocky when I cock it
Get laid and played out of pocket with a rocket in your eye socket
So raise up queers, and say your fuckin' prayers
I've been killin' for years, huntin motherfuckers like reindeers

Champagne wishes of caviar dreams, a team that's gettin' cream
With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin' the life of rowdy packin fifty cali's
Rockin' lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count mad for seen bad
We've seen a half a milli dashin out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin' papers by the layers
And those that betray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used to shootin targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
That'll stray pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin' straight charming in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots ta come get through a whole army
The celo rollers money folders sippin bola holdin' mad payola
Slangin a Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game we do our thing son
Livin' the fast life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American dream
So we're plottin up a scheme to get the seven figure cream

Verse Two: Nas Escobar

Mid-state and Green it seems, is where all my niggaz be
The ghetto misery, shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular, angle of the clout war
Police searchin up my Lex over who's petrol
My tec blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin' Cristal like it's my first child, lickin' shots, holiday style
Rockin' Steele sweaters, Wallaby down
Twenty-four carats, countin' cabbage, like the arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin Guinness shootin catchin cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys
The luciano Frankie Aiello, Bugsy Seagal
Green papers with eagles from a trade that's illegal

Sellin rocks, to pickin' up stock and boat docks with glocks

Fiendin to make his dreams come true, but see, money was caught mean
Started runnin' wild and livin' life type of foul, that was my shorty's style
But deep down in heart he was still only a child
He was typin nice at ball, if he had height, y'all
Mighta been 'NBA Today', instead I watched his life fall
Blowin' up the spots and poppin' them tec glocks
Collectin street props, splittin tops, didn't stop, so many men dropped
Started committin murder after murder
Blasted the last nigga that tried to riff so fast he flipped him like a burger
Slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger
He got put six feet under by a small shorty that was younger
And this type of street violence today happens too often
It hit me hard as hell to see my dog up in the coffin
People droppin' a rose when the casket is closed
Hey yo, that's the name of the game out on the street, that's how it goes
They say: ""Live by the trigger, die by the trigger""
It ain't about whose gun is more bigger, nigga
It's bout whose draw is quicker
So to my shorty dog puzzled I'm pledgin
Died at the age of 17, Brooklyn East New York legend
(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers)
Keep it real on the street, money, and look out for one another
Thinkin' back when I was chillin' with K-Von, but now he's long gone
So I carried on and wrote this song to keep the strong on
Me and black-o way back in childhood when we was wild hoods
Runnin' around the neighborhood and up to no good
Started hangin' hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars
Then put behind bars sellin drugs and pullin yards
Then my crimey got locked up for cookin the rock up
Started bouncin' uptown to stuck up, my nigga straight blew the block up
Yeah, the blue and whites was on sight runnin' with flashlights
On the double a fast life, that's when he seen his last nights
Out on the street runnin' from the heat
Then got locked up from (Happy New Year!)
All the way down to (New Year's Eve!)
The two of those in a wardrobe of clothes
Got back on crackin', I let him whip the macks and go lookin' for hoes
And then another sad story is headed for me
When I found out another soldier died in the territory
So in memory of my dog I write a lyric
Straight hopin melodies travel from my mind to your spirit
Hear it when I get biz for K-Von, I'm pledgin
Died on 104 Northern Boulevard, Corona, Queens legend
(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers)
Keep it real on the street, money, and look out for one another 3X
(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers)
Keep it real on the street"

Foul cats scheamin up the setup
Tryin' to leave me and my cream wet up
Two in the head, leaded up
Call the coroners to make they bed up
Infrared shit from neck up
Before they got to lit the tec up
(Kool G Rap)
It was a setup, my nigga got hit, they blew his chest up
The hollow tips ripped his vest up, son is messed up
And blessed up; call my cast up -- it's time to dress up
Four-fifth and Smith-n-Wessed up, ready to press up
And fuck their nest up, the enemy is Hennessey to sessed up
Actin' up, hit my motherfuckin man up
Never again will he stand up, yo Big Jan hook the plan up
Pull the masks, pull the van up
These niggaz tryin' to hit the fam up; these small times cats
Yo fuck that, I can't see that, where them niggaz be at?
Where they hang at? Where they live at? Where they slang at?
(Aiyyo Son one is a known cat, he walk around with the chrome gat
This hoodrat know where the nigga home at)
Well here's a quarter baby, go and phone that
This motherfucker bout to get his shit blown back
His whole dome clapped, we cock back the gats and started cruisin
Up the boulevards and avenues-n, I'm short fusin
And two biscuit usin'; mad hot but, not in the mood for losin
We hit the strip pickin' up clues and
We on the heels of this nigga shoes and
Out the blue when, we see the chick the nigga screwin
Pushin his whip with the ice cuban
Hemmed her up sweet, put heat to her wig piece, the zig piece
To this nig's beefs, this bitch named Charise
From East New York, listen bitch, you better talk
Or get your whole frame surrounded, with white chalk
Pulled the rat in back of the van, bitch we don't want you
We want your man, you understand?
The hoe said, ""Please, I got his house keys, the nigga got
Five keys and mad cheese, a hundred G's""
Lie to me bitch you gettin' one of these
Four-five C's in both knees, she said, ""Honestly I promise G
I'm not lying,"" then the hoe started crying
We hit the road me and my niggaz flying
To the crib in Jackson Heights, the nigga live three flights up
He type buck, but I ain't givin' a fuck
Grab his bitch up, make the hoe go first in case
The nigga buck, open the door up, and put the stunt in front
Then we all started creepin', he stretched out
Up on the sofa sleepin', yeah me and my cats standin there
Just peepin, money's about to get laced
My nigga Ty threw a glass of whiskey in his face
Big Jan ready to blaze the place; he on his way
To Amazing Grace -- nigga woke up and saw the big guns
Me and my two sons, he knew he was done
You hurt a loved one, step back about to let him have one
Yo fuck that, aiyyo black, where the sack of heroin at?
I'm bout to give cat some motherfuckin railroad tracks
We dumped the whole bag inside a spoon and left the room
To heat that, and came right back, yo grab the nigga arm black
Put raw shit in the nigga vein, watch the needle drain
Went from being restrained to mad 'tane
Less than a moment nigga started zonin
His mouth foamin, lookin' like he possessed by The Omen
His bitch was reachin' for the phone and, I had to smack her
With the chrome and, left her on the floor moanin
Cocked back, I had to finish this, know my stee'
We leave no witnesses, shot and got the fuck out the premises"

New York, New York, the city that never sleeps
Bodies, covered in white sheets, are layin in the streets
Shit gets deep, as we creep up the block by the kids slangin rocks
And holdin' glocks stolen from the cops to get props
You gotta split a top, on the regular
Or get plugged in your mug, from a slug, by your competitor
Gunshots echo throughout the city like thunder, no wonder
Another brother six feet under
You know it ain't no jokin when the streetlights are broken
So keep your eyes open, or get ready for a, smokin' 'loc
Step out of line, I hope you got your nine gun son
The Smith and Wess', you better press 9-1-1 (word up)
Or make a run for it there's too many to tackle
The Big Apple'll put your ass on ice like a Snapple
So even though I rap I gots to stay strapped
Niggaz act up I back up (PI-YAH)
I bust a cap inside your fuckin' hat
Don't even pose with them hoes, the swinger that you chose
Just might be down with the foes, only the shadow knows
And ain't no lollipop, lollipop over here only the shottie pops
(BOOM) Now just sit back and watch the bodies drop
The younger gunmen got the bigger niggaz runnin'
The shorties (what) the shorties (what) the shorties are comin'
To push a nigga wig back, and leave his ass flat on his back
The motherfuckin ghetto knows, and it's like that
(Kool G. Rap)
Today's headlines, another nigga dead
Six to the body and fo' to the head
Followed the red bitch in the bed full of lead
A drug-related case and now the place is filled with Feds
Ramshacked the shack, disclouse 'bout two kilos of dope
Two ounces of coke's caught in the pocket of his coat
So, another brother caught the ultimate surprise
With blown out brains, to drop stains on his eyes
Dazed as I sit back and watch the channel two news
Watchin his family goin' through all the boo-hoos
You lose, like an Ill Street, the Blues are gettin' deeper
Nothin' left in the room except for him, the Grim Reaper
Police are takin' ? snapshots, scoop up some blooddrops
Pull out a file on a juvenile child of mugshots
The cops knew he fell victim to laws on the street
So they just, pull out the white sheets, to cover up the dead meat
Seal off the area with yellow tape, draw the white
Chalk around the body now the party has to motivate
One more outlaw, was murdered on the scene for the green
Died at the age of seventeen
(Kool G. Rap)
Strollin the concrete, packin my heat, walkin' the backstreets
I seen niggaz pull up, peepin me out the side a black Jeep
Six feet deep, that's where I'm goin' if I'm slippin
Steady cockin my shit 'cause I already got the clip in
Now who's the first nigga to run up, here they come up
The block hardrocks with glocks rollin' holdin' they guns up
I buck, I buck, and then I struck one in the chest
Nigga shoulda wore a vest but now his ass is put to rest
But now I got three mo' niggaz, pullin triggers
Strays are ricochetin off the bricks, zigga zigga
But who got the biggest strap? Who's bustin' bigger caps?
My BOOM BOOM BOOMS against they PAP PAP PAPS
No haps, G. Rap ain't goin' out like a sucker
I reloaded the shot and dropped another motherfucker
Quick, I duck and shit to dodge the bullets comin' at me
'Cause I won't be too happy with a slug inside my nappy
Two more niggaz left, they scared to death, but I'm leary
Shit gets kinda scary when I got bulletholes near me
I went between two cars, lettin off the quarter pound
I see another body fallin' down to the ground
Quick I run up on him 'cause I don't think that he's dead
Standin over his ass I put two more inside his head
That's three niggaz down, only got one nigga to go
I gots to send his ass to the gravedigger so
I lay low in the cut and wait for moneygrip to slip up
Nearly shot my whole clip up, I got one more slug to rip up
Look over by the GS, see his ass stickin his head out
Boom, let the lead out, blew a piece of his brain dead out
The back of his head, now he's dead, because he fell face down
Right on the motherfuckin streets that he dwelled"

Over chips they'll leave you drippin witcha side numb
Come out the fort with your torches up and ride Dunn
No one survives with a shy gun inside slums

The bullies are back
Gettin' the news that's tragic, feuds are graphic
Moves through the traffic
Break any rules you lose your attic
Who's in the habit of usin' the static
Make somethin' ooze out your cabbage
When dudes with ratchets, can pay your dues
Stools on the mattress, bruised and battered
Blown out your shoes and your fabrics
With Jakes searchin for clues and maggots
My crew is savage, we carry no dead weight
Bet they hide you when I slide kid
All my tools is packaged, and lose you faggots
Stay coppin them jewels with karats, so who's the rabbit
Trix are for kids, in the buggy eye 6 on the strip
Strictly for big wigs, so tell me what this is
A nigga that's bout his biz, a nigga that don't forgive
A nigga that don't renege, a nigga that bust a cig, rupture your ribs
Front and I'll bring it to you 'xactly where you live

Hit a fry when the good die young

Yo it's a whole city of animals
Cannibals, bloodthirsty niggaz that hammer you
And handle you, shots makin' you flammable
That's what an evil man's plan'll do
Vandal you, candle you, dismantle you
Leavin' your fam and crew, pan a few blocks
Bodies in camera view, for a grand or two
Land you on channel two
When niggaz can't eat, that's what the fam'll do
Leave you for the mantle, examine you
For the van to come transfer you
Too late to bandage you, too much damage to you
The coroners know how to manage you
Down in they land they planted you
That's what the cannons do, forever branded you
Spare cannoned you, abandoned you, rock you to sleep
Niggaz surrounded you, death wish granted you, fan at you
Went to my hundred shot clip when they flip and throw a grand at you
Peel your shit open like a can of brew
Then they work from the mandible, havin' you livin' where the salmon do
The good die young, redrum, who left to take a stand for you
(Kool G Rap)
You ock a hot bet (?) and catch a popped vessel
And shot vestibule; you got testicles
Beef bring a nigga get shot visible
Rock with the best of you; then it's back to the block
The blacktops we open up shop and clock decimals
Fake cops, scrape from the teeth hot for residue
The foul slang liver (?) page, reach for that shit on your waist
Every killer in the place get hit in the face
Turn around, simmer down nigga, get in the safe
What you fear when the shots is blowin'; shed a tear for the one
That caught one under the ear inside of his top popped open
It's death for all niggaz that left with the glock smokin'
Came in with hot toast and left the whole spot soakin
Fuck y'all niggaz not knowin', we make your seeds stop growin'
Guerilla nigga, we keep rhymes flowin
Bust a four pound, man down, found in the lot swollen
Drama brung, all inside the slum, the good die young"

Yo it was midnight and rainy and, spotted these three Panamanians
Gold chains, and carryin Iranians
Pulled out to stain me and, these cats might try to flame me
And shit, might be hit sent from this bitch nigga Damien
Used to slang 'caine, back to back, up in this game we in
Went against the grain when he got banged in his cranium
Now he got cats all on my back, tryin' to bang me and
From Peru, flew in a crew of evil, now shit is lethal
Drew the Eagle, blew about two
And made one of the two see-through, but I still see two
Of his peoples, up in a Regal, and they got heat to equal
Shit that got put in Beenie Seagal, fuck these illegal
Alien-ass niggaz out of the grass
Put extra clips upon the dash and continued to blast
Fire flashed, I left another one of 'em splashed
The bloodbath, three niggaz found dead on the ave
Went to a phone to hit my nigga Big C, swiftly
Yo dig the shit G, these niggaz tried to hit me
Yo meet me in about fifty, with Big Ash, be movin quickly
I'm about to hit D, put that motherfucker six feet
""Aiyyo what happened G?"" Niggaz on the ave was clappin at me
Bustin' at me, tryin' to put caps in my nappy
""Yo as long as you made it kid I'm happy""

Called up my nigga Jay, call the nigga Damien for me okay?
Make it about 3:38, straight, this is what you say
""Aiyyo we fucked up, he got away""
If he play, I'ma split his toupee, we on our way
To this nigga's office, with armed forces, he showin softness
And watchin, horses racin with other bosses
Pulled out the torch and, the nigga saw the guns, got stunned
He probably got none, knowin' he bout to catch a hot one
Terrorizin the whole spot son, the phone rung
He acted like it was the wrong number, lookin' all dumb
Hands on the glock spun, five minutes later, the shots rung
That nigga got done, died with his hand on a cocked gun

Came in with two wiseguys, fuckin' guns big as lifesize
Had a chick up on the bed and shit, with the nice thighs
Yo senorita, mamasita, wish to plead with boricua cliqua
Arriba, flashed the heat now
She started talkin', seconds later two Cubans walked in
Holdin' packages of silver chalk and, shit ain't the raw and
Became a war man, he put two in my man's internal organs
But for the poison, tryin' to fuckin' Freemen like Morgan
Two hit the floorin, with blood pourin, left 'em snorin
Their wigs tore in, layin all up against the door then
The nigga spray, I caught a slug in my shoulder blade
My boulder grazed, I'm catchin flashbacks of older days
In the small caves, I'm dazed and shit
She goin' to bed with the spray shit, tryin' to lay shit
OK bitch, and fuck the gay shit, started to lay shit
And left the brave bitch wet, part of her neck and face hit
Emptied the clip, then replaced it
Niggaz is on the floor tomato pasted
Wasted, spirit eras-ted
Bonnie cased it, went to the other side, embraced it
The whole place is lit, we Scarfacin shit
Cigar case and shit, on some marksmen shit
One nigga strainin moanin in pain aimin his biscuit
My man fixed it, left him with his wig twisted
Wipe all my fingerprint ballistics, went to the other room
And saw the brick shit, straight legit shit, bag it and zip it
Left out the front door like we ain't do shit

Hoodied up, loc in the whip, pokin the clip
Arm extended out the window, chokin the fifth
Legend or myth seek a Taliban, hit Babylon
Don't misinterpretate the smile of a Don, I'm fowl as a swan
Get at you, spit at you with ya child in ya arms
Clap at your bitch, full semi'matics eclipse
Display rage like an evil omen
Trust me in the backseat when you drivin'
I'll pop your fuckin' cerebral open
Take position when them snakes hissin
End up nickel-plate kissin', out of state missin'
Get gravelled in the battles and wars, rattle the four
Cause cattle when you rhyme big you sound like you horse
Let's do it
(Chorus: Joell Ortiz)
It's nothing! Dudes'll talk like they killers
But they eyes can't disguise the fact they really fear us
It's nothing! Them big rims on the truck
That slim hoe that you pluck? That flossin'll get you stuck dude
It's nothing! This ain't your ordinary rap
It's extraordinary scrap - Cris', pour the Henny back like
It's nothing! (What's my name?) G Rap, Giancana
No throwbacks are fitted, we own rap and spit like
It's nothing!
(Verse Two)
Five star general ranked in the game I don't respect y'all seargeants
I wreck you varmints, eject them comments, and wet y'all garments
I bank sure as the flames from out them Texas orange
Keep fresh hoes in flesh and bondage, collect and garnish
This ain't a threat it's a promise; give you a hospital bed
And a harness, reps get tarnished if you don't hit that deck
For homage and beg for your pardon, G Rap head of the squadron
Kid be sent to alarmin; you flipped and stepped out of margin
You infuriated the Gods and the stars and
The sky's bout to thunder, you low-life come out from under
About to heat your winters and drought your summers
One right up on your fort, forty-five Colt buckin the horse
Give your body your nuts in divorce
Dick in the dirt, you flip to the earth
Check where the hit tip grippin the shirt
Get a flashback, flick to your birth
It's war for you mo-rons, we wave four arms
Draw with arms, more arms and more arms and more arms
G Rap Giancana that raw Don made my bones
When I was a young buck I played with chrome
Blaze Stallone, get your brains blown, grazin the dome
Get my stage on, the rage is on, my nigga

Jacuzzis and saunas and eatin steak at Benny Harner's

A nigga that's spunky and likes to keep his pockets chunky
Makin' most of my money, from all the dopefiends and junkies
I learned from the best the ones that's livin'
And the ones that's put to rest

I got a fly hoe up under the wing, a swinger that does her thing

She sits at restaurant tables with mink foxes and sables
Drinkin' Cherenade brand label she'll rock a sucker's cradle
And yeah, honey is more bounce to the ounce
She walks around with lucci in large amounts
Millions inside Swiss bank accounts
Her name is Tammy, got a beach house in Miami
Rides around with a small jammy in her silk and satin panties
A down hoe, a Foxy Brown hoe, standin her ground hoe
And if you clown yo she'll turn into a bust a round hoe
Fly as a Heaven's Angel got sapphires in her bangles
Diamond earrings hangin' dingle gettin' money from all angles
She's pretty under the New York city bright lights
And real light, way after midnight, I hit it cause the slit's tight
Wake up early and make my rounds, break up break down
Packin a silver four pound, some clowns be trying to get down
Light up a smoke and grab a stack of C-notes
Them slick stick up kids don't get no free dough bro
'Cause I ain't tryin' to be broke

25,Let the Games Begin,1998,Roots of Evil (1998),,Kool G Rap,"(Kool G. Rap)
Yo I come in the form of danger lurkin
Blastin the mad streets and merkin
Shot at strangers from out the Ranges and Suburbans
Curtains for anybody perpin
Leave in a hearse for certain
Blood on the curb and bandages like turbans
We roll a durbin
All in this dirt, puffin the herb an'
We bring the verbs in
Double action's loaded with Germans
Area's urban, block's hot where we be swervin
Gun fights strike like a serpent
People nerves jerkin
Lay down any person
Strictly for just talkin' rehearsin
The skills remain tight as Holy Mary the Virgin
Slowly carry the burden
So we varied the shit you heard an'
Hit you with the different methods and versions;
We simply,
Let bullets rip until the clip is empty
Get laid in your tracks as if you was ??
Hit you like Jack Dempsey
The mac packin MC, with gats clappin like an M.P.
Over your friendly wimpy, frame like an M.D.
Blow you until your block's windy
Be on short of a shot frenzy
My glocks don't stop till the cops hem me
Blow holy hollow tops in me
Hazardous shit - guns is accurate
Sendin niggaz to meet the King of Nazareth
Playin' me close has a risk
I bash clicks like they was massacres
Blast the tear gas, thinkin' I'm pacifist
That's the fifth, one last kiss before your ash is missed
These bastards is gettin' clapped by the strap at the wrist
Chorus: Kool G. Rap (repeat 2X)
Yo let the games begin
The tec and mac-10 flames begin
Thugs to the end, my whole crew insane with sins
Hammers to firing pins
Me and my kin be makin' you spin
The Lord or The Devil takin' you in
(Kool G. Rap)
It's the Corona Queens apocalypse
My block is hit with the dark eclipse
Takin' no hostages, so grab the glocks and clips
The rap's apostle-ist, niggaz to Loch Ness
Large as Colossus is
Mumblin shit get shot at the esophagus
A Thug Saga novelist
Sex in this rap shit monogamous
Rainin like the drop is while you be topicless
Blow money monopolist - do it for eons
Shinin like it's, neon - heart colder than freon
Decidin which MC to pee on;
Baby cause that's the shit that we on
Niggaz go to Warrick like Deion
Put the G on
I analyze guys with Montana eyes
To vandalize any man alive, soon as the hammer rise
Cut 'em down like samurais
Kickin that real shit that you fantasize
Niggaz step aside or recognize
G. the real cat, pack the steel cat, baby feel that
Leave you layin flat witcha shit clapped and peeled back
Battle-actin' rap shit'll put you in back of a Cadillac
A bad decision; fuck up your whole vision like cataracts
Red roses on a dead foe
Layin in wet clothes from head blows
Your whole brain be exposed
Get your body torn out the frame from lead throws
None of my victims ever bled slow
Stiff as Edgar Poe, that's how it go"
26,Mafioso,1998,Roots of Evil (1998),,Kool G Rap,"Who macks the most shit? smoke ya whole clique like roach spliffs
Who's ro's drip enough to hold drifts and float ships?
No mo' shifts, I hold enough chips to toast Criss
It's G. Rap, the cat that's on your wanted most list
I wrote this so you could sweat this and soak this
Make you lose ya focus with raps stronger than coke is
We're crime culprits, put hot shit up in you like posters
Left for the vultures, we DT's pickin' up cultures
Three-thousand volt ya just like the third rail
And if you heard shells a herb fell
Swift with the words well
Jakes on my dirt trail
Kicked up enough dust to hurt cells
Swerve in SL's, niggas feel me like my shirt's brail
Curve the jail cell for jakes that wanna H-block those
Niggas in Paco's keep the blocks froze and the shops closed
Where the pot grows, young cats coppin' the drop Roves
Get the Nacho's, and no cops show when the shots blow
Shit's red hot though, the streets remain flooded with D's
Bundles of Ki's to maintain a hundred degrees
The main crime wave
We handle the beef in .9 ways
Get your mind grazed
My teck-nine sprays your spine blades
When it gets too hot on the block better believe the rhyme pays
Put all you cats in cradles if you crave divine ways
Diamond ??? rays blindin' you with my shine glaze,
Unlike them other rappers that get stuck in a time phase
Chorus - Wanted for ???, major operations, distribution (G. Rap is down
With a mafioso posse) Wanted for ??? major operations distribution,
Rackateerin', prostitution, and paid execution
My corporation's body casin', watch where you pacin'
Thug orchestration, this is live niggas you facin'
We paper chasin', for that million baby we lacin'
Fifty Caliber gat embracin'
Leavin' you wit' legs without sensation
Who's full of malice? what thug's the wildest?
Act childish and get your body sent to a stylist
Who live the foulest? be grippin' cannons till my hands is kalused
Pile this paper longer than malice from Ney York to Dallas
Purchase a palace, sip Collatas with the whole brigata
Bodies get dropped while I attend the opera
Land on Casino roofs in Helicopters in Las Vegas Nevada
Can't stop until I got a Casa up in Trump plaza
929 Mazda, foreign chicks talkin' with accents like they Sza Sza
Cream like Iri Amin Dada
Thug saga, slugs burn you like they lava
You and ya bimbo get hit up through ya car window
Creep on your benz slow and let ten blow
From out the darkest shadow
My aim's straight as an archers arrow
I'll spark this barrel
Hit my target even if the mark is narrow
Lay you like a pharoah
With fragments inside your bone marrow
Get your wig flown just like a sparrow."
27,Mobsta's,1998,Roots of Evil (1998),,Kool G Rap,"I dreamed that I was at a club scene where all the thugs be
Every criminal mug be, living in luxury, what the fuck G?
That must be Bugsy, in the black tux over there with Lucky
Bring my heater, niggaz might try to slug me
Take me out in back of the club and buck me, and touch me
I felt a hand tug me then turnin' around I peeped the lovely
Fly face, fat ass gave me a glass of bubbly, said,
""Compliments of Bugsy,"" then took me across the persian rug to plug me
He shook my hand and hugged me; thought he would do me ugly
But he dug me, pockets chubby said, ""Nino where them drugs be?""
Over there by the derby, buy they dirty devils from me
To keep my paper sturdy, yo word G
I ain't afraid to get my hands dirty, you heard me?
I be D and fuck all that living thirsty, so Nino
Do his out in Jersey, showin no mercy, with Frank Nitty
Who else and, some nigga with a Babyface that they called Nelson
Bad for your health, Machine Gun Kell' and your Dillinger
Death messenger, known to carry the six cylinder
Look for my army, fatigues to Giorgio Armani's
Holdin' the Tommy, no one can harm me; Will and Tommy
Tried to alarm me and quote, he turned to smoked salami
Dead as a motherfuckin zombie, full of my ammo
With Bugs Mirando, against the grain so, gotta send him
Over the rainbow, he must be brain slow, caught him down
At the train po' in Santo Domingo, left him for dead
Two bullets in his Tango, like how that movie Shane go
Frank Costello, hostile fellow, he murders while remainin mellow
But most of the niggaz on his team was yellow
Cold blooded veins flowin with red Jell-o
There's Joe Adonis, had mad dramas, won't hesitate
To put you in pajamas, fly hooker fine as the Pocahontas
Beauty queen you'll wanta pok-her-hiendas
Frank broke a promise between the organized crimers and old timers
Costello gotta go six below, nobody voted no
To veto, so they hit him with a hollow torpedo
Up in his torso, he ain't a boss so, he can go
Without ever lettin the whole police force know
Lex Diamond was scheamin on Capone's scroll
Wanted to own his whole zone, it leaked out
They shot him at a pay phone
With the big chrome, his whole wig blown
Blood flowin from out his flesh and bones
At the wake at the funeral home it's havoc
Family got hit up with automatics
Non-stop static inside the rackets
Jack McGern was burnin split Joe Adonis cabbage
The underworld was goin' savage
Pretty Boy Floyd was non-void, unemployed, he destroyed shit
With the Infamous click, wasn't to be toyed with
Mad jealous of all the liquor sellers
Shinin with wine cellars, turn 'em from hood dwellers to Goodfellas
Me and Nitty was like bank tellers, nothin' niggaz could tell us
We drove all over, I pushed a shiny yellow Testarossa
Moved on it closer get the toaster
Started to feel like death was closer, I hit Capone hard
Murder him and his bodyguard in they car and dust the chaffeur
Beef over, I blew him like a supernova
Niggaz nicknamed me, The Black Cobra
The Lady Casanova, yo I'm even deadly when I'm sober
Act like you got a chip on your shoulder
And blast the two right through your boulder
Money you didn't know they shoulda told ya
Nigga you fuckin' with a soldier, wake up and smell the Folgers
Niggaz out here done lie in piss to cover up the odor
Operations from here to Minnesota to Dakota
But yo here comes Greasy Thumbs, who wants to get the easy funds
He whispered in my eardrum
""Let's take over the entire city, and split the dough
Me you and Frank Nitty and Siegel and that'll make the bank pretty""
No doubt before we go we gotta murder John Torre
Yo get all his territory dough and end the story yo"

And my motherfuckin man Grimm
Just comin' with somethin' to keep the brainstem

It's Big 1 son, Jamaica Queens is the turf
And I'ma exploit, heaven and earth, for what it's worth
It's the MC extrordinaire, the jewels glare
The God is rare, I'm takin' bitches back to my lair
I want mines and yours, strippin niggaz to they drawers
No probable cause, with the chrome double 4's
It's the Queens New Yorker with a bulletproof parka
In eighty-four, it was Calvins and British Walkers
Now I'm sippin Harvey's Bristal Cream with the glock 17
As the sirens race to the scene
Tryin' to get dough, like Pablo, today, fuck tomorrow
Seats for carro, as I recline in Monte Carlo
I got the game down to a science, it's the clients
That turn small time hustlers into giants
Three course meal, waitin for my appetizer
Blowin' like a geyser, time only makes me wiser
Paraphenalia, and material, makes the crew imperial
I put the fear in you, sippin beer with two
Handlin business properly, form a monopoly
Storefront property, if not, another robbery
I'm puttin' forth the effort, murder's the method
The steak is peppered
Son when I let off you meet your Lord and shepherd
Bloody money gets niggaz deaded and wetted
Don't forget it, money's the metal and my hand is magnetic
Chorus: Grimm, B1
I gotta flip these bricks
Cause bein broke drive me insane
Money's on my motherfuckin brain
From O-Z's to ki's
The triple beam brings fame to my name
Money's on my motherfuckin brain
Niggaz be scheamin and teamin
But still I maintain
Money's on my motherfuckin brain
Cause money and murder go hand in hand
It ain't nothin' but a game
Money's on my motherfuckin brain son
(Grimm)
Cryin hopin God forgive me for the ones I killed
But until still, I dry my eyes with hundred dollar bills
Like McDonald's, makin' mills servin'
Fuck a Landcruiser now, pulls a ? to Suburban
Stressed out, sittin' thinkin' past bed time
Scared can't sleep, nightmares about fed time
Diamonds, linens, ostrich and all that
Fat shit I'm talkin' code cause my phone's tapped
Crackheads worship me like I'm Jesus
Uncle Sam can't stand me 'cause I'm fuckin' all his nieces
Cuties every colour, who I wanna fuck next?
Buy a new car, maybe Lamborghini trunk next
Look at the jealousy in the eyes of the roughnecks
Bulletproof glass just in case they wanna buck Tecs
A large ratio in this game dies
But I'm flippin pies, till the Senate legalize
Chorus: Grimm, G. Rap (same lines)
(Kool G. Rap)
I'm sportin flavors and Timbs, a ninety-five Bezn with the chrome rims
Presedential Rolex, two carat diamonds with the stone gems
Pockets filled with lucci leather wallets designed by Gucci
Parlay in restaurants, eatin shrimp, scampi and sushi
Fly minks, with icicles that blink inside cuban links
Lookin' ?, brothers stink, got loot like I'm doin' banks
Hundred dollar bottles of chammy, condos in Miami
Front row seats up at the Grammy's, the broke niggaz can't stand me
Hold the flame low, hotel suites inside the Flamingo
Just home by the dingos, I step up in 'em rockin' Kangols
Straight up fakin no jacks, cause all my crackshacks are jam packed
My mad stacks, show that I'm on the right track, like Amtrak
So stand back, 'cause I'ma make whatever it takes
To shake Jakes, and shoot snakes, and bake more snowflake cakes than Drake's
Cut up your grill like I'm the Barber of Seville
Still like Gotti bodies are found inside the harbor 'cause I'm ill
It's war, but no more kids are bein kidnapped, matter of fact
Ain't with the shit black, I was young when I did that
There's dope in the Copa Cabanas, cock back the hammers
So niggaz in pajamas get they wigs split like bananas
Stable of hotties, niggaz with shotties catchin bodies
Neighborhood John Gotti with more notes than Pavarotti
Yeah, paid as a motherfuckin bank teller
The Goodfella, I stay a motherfuckin drug seller

Giancanna the name break it down simple and plain
Went from a small chimp in the game to gorilla king pimpin' the game
Know how to tempt dames to tense in the Range
Hit the block to pitch rocks, the strength of the name
Limp with a cane, lactosin limp for the king
We even pack toast expend from the flames, my aim
Strictly about makin' that bread pop (y'know) blocks red hot
From feds and cops, lookin' for rock bottles with red tops
Tradin lead shots with dreadlocks
Infrared dots till their head drop, we fled spots
Word on the curb is when it came to birds we spread flocks (no doubt)
No tellin' when the bloodshed stop, glide till the sled stop
Copped the latest every hot flavor in them crocs and gators
Somebody clique riff, pop the bravest
Out of town trips in whips I got from Avis, drop knots in Vegas
My plot for paper was crockpots of wafers

Nigga into warm mansion rooms, wall to wall with handsome goons
Half-naked bitches dancin to tunes (uh-huh)

Skylights up in the ceilings for the plants to bloom

Prison niggaz that ran balloons
Shut down shop from Jan. to June, and still cop land in the boons
Fuck women in tanning rooms
Every last fingernail on their hand groomed, self built do
Down to the mink pelts, gator belts and silk suit
If I can't stack a nigga cap get peeled loose
Word to them cats that died on the street, it's spilled juice
So where that Don be? (right here) In the calm breeze in the palm trees

(Kool G. Rap)
Last night, got caught in a gunfight, I think it was like
Four niggaz clutchin they burners and bustin'
But only could see one in sight
The one on my right, yo son he like we both got gripe
He wanted my life, come at a nigga
With a gun and a knife
He tryin' to make the wiped out nigga layin up under the white
But I ain't tryin' to go up in no dark tunnel
And burn to the light
And let myself be one more nigga that just got spun in the night
And done in on sight, and tryin' to breathe
With one in my pipe
But I'm not one of the type, and I'd rather lose all hung on the mic
Than to be up in the yard receivin CPR
At one in the night
Now I can run and take fllght, but all right, yo son'll be hyped
And I've played mother nature before
So yo I'm clappin thunder tonight
I step right, inside of the street light, my gun it was bright
Send him to kiss Christ, and let my shit slice
In front of him twice
Let one splice, cause fuckin' with price, ain't tryin' to be nice
I want him on ice, no back home
To a son and a wife
He tried roll dice with real life and got his buns in a vice
Nigga was all enticed to lead his life sheist
But none of it's nice
I peeped shit, and seen his whole click, was runnin' in fright
Instead of comin' to fight, get someone to fight
You son of a dykes
With one in the pipe, I'm aimin to light the one on the right
They all deceased, so yo my asspiece
Get hunted for life
Four niggaz cut down, and I can receive one hundred to life
Up in a jailcell, that's crawlin with lice
And runnin' with mice
Live trife, fillin appetities with nothin' but rice
Slow biz and no kid's nigs
Start runnin' my wife
Only got one life, yo get this fuckin', gun outta my sight
Back at the house, after midnight
I'm done for the night"

Niggaz wanna flip - THEN WE TAKE EM TO WAR
Break a nigga proper - THEN WE BREAK HIM SOME MORE

I represent the murderers and felony offenders
Who either bought time out, to get these legal tenders
(Surrender!) Nah, I'm goin' out with a bang nigga
FUCK PATAKI, I gotta do my thang nigga
Forty-four mag, bustin' into action
Brains left in particles, fragments and fractions
Grimm, the money stacker, heat packer
I'm lurkin, I'm waitin, attackin like a linebacker
Fuck what you heard, crime pays
And always, unorthodox, I hold my pistol sideways
We kill crews, hearts go numb
And if retaliation comes then yo fuck it, it just comes
(Yo who you?) I'm Dr. Death motherfucker ever heard of me?
Close your eyes, cross your fingers, time for surgery
I'm already dead, so nah, you can't murder me
Cause quantities of entities enter me evilly
Chorus: repeat 2X
(B1)
Since I murder for hire, rapid fire's what I require
Makin' niggaz perspire, so send a message through the wire
Cause violence is contagious, it got me bustin' gauges
The '95 Larry Davis and I'm wettin niggaz for wages
Queens is the home of 1, the known felon
And ain't no tellin', when I'ma crack your fuckin' melon
For the right amount of chips, I spit clips and hit whips
Leavin' niggaz bloody, the leather seats is where the shit drips
With the pound-seven, I be creepin', rockin' niggaz while they sleepin'
Shots repeatin, leavin' faggot niggaz leakin
When I cock back the iron, niggaz is dyin', marchin to Zion
Cause the pound-cake, roars like a lion
Word son, niggaz be collapsin, cause my weapons is
Ready for action, makin' your heart catch contractions
In the underworld, shootin gallery niggaz lose calories
Cause my salary's based on fatalities
Chorus: repeat 2X
(Kool G. Rap)
Here I come to get some motherfuckin wreck but first I gotta
Umm vest check, uncheck, clip one check, clip two check, I'm set
So let a motherfucker move a muscle
When I tussle they'll be piecin niggaz back like fuckin' puzzles
Cause Kool G. Rap is known for bringin' mad noise, a bad boy
When I was younger always carried guns, I never had toys
Grimm, gimme the infrared they see me and I'm puttin' red dots
On niggaz foreheads to makin' motherfuckers Indian
You got beef? Go get yourself a wreath, because it's murder
'Cause I put holes in my beef like fuckin' White Castle burgers
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fo'-pound
Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down
I see em, he's comin' out the fuckin' coliseum
And hopped into a BM, shit!
Put in my clip and then I dipped into the ride that my man had
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide
I'm rainin on him (faster nigga) oh yeah we're gainin on him
(Oh shit he's with somebody else) fukkit, put his brain on him
Boom boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin up a cigarette
Bang bang, I left the other nigga wet
It's G. Rap baby, you know me, you try to hurt this
I split your fuckin' top and leave a fingerprint on purpose!"
33,Tekilla Sunrise,1998,Roots of Evil (1998),,Kool G Rap,"Killers in Spanish villas in Sante Fe
Eses all about hammer play
Desell Marachi, preferred to watch me
It's a Tekilla Sunrise, over the sky
Tea rocks in the watch be flaring but hot see
Got these from my nigga Vatche
How big your blanks be, ain't nothin' scot-free
I'm ready to cop three, talk to me papi
Before the shots put out the Nazi's
Call off your Rockies
Yo pap they cockin back the glocksies
Pap had to stop three, two sombreros ready to
Mop me, drop me, proceeded with the head of the click
Bread in their fingertips
The sly chick came out with three bricks
From out of the V-6, yeah mami like peep this
Yeah you got that sweetness
This ebony G's to bust open
One of the bastard get the heavenly freeze
I'm runnin' with these
Yo hasta luego, amigos
And up and away we go
Before they decide to bring the beef burritos
While they count the Fritos
I'm makin' my way to the G-S-3-oh-oh
Big bag of the megalitos, three whole kilos
Spot about four vitos
With bullet belts filled up with torpedoes
I'm leavin' niggaz tore meat though when I draw heat yo
Tryin' to leave me dead in the street yo
Mami ?? con tigo
Showdown at sunset, I'm leavin' one wet
Slowly I step, my head sweats, my hand on my Tec
I die for my respect, let the slugs and bodies connect
All for the wreck, gotta support my rep on the set
Tekilla Sunrise, my two wives, decides who lives or dies
Leavin' my rivals, flat on they back facin the sky
From out the left, took your last breath, death in disguise
With open eyes you dead in the desert, Tekilla Sunrise
I'm cockin on low, ready to hurt foes on dirt roads
Makin' my hand jerk from every burst I gave the first blow
Keepin' alert though, givin' 'em red glows, givin' they shirt holes
Three birds'll blow up in the back seat, I swear to God fuck
She could've been a model, Coke bottle figure, instead
She bent it just like a Desperado, left her hair hollow
Two slugs to swallow -- whose next to follow?
Some cats behind some cactuses
Clappin hazardous, who these niggaz is with low shot averages
Bustin' right back at they cabbages, givin' 'em flashbacks
Of baby carriages, this Mexican inside this Lex is
Tryin' to crash my shit, drivin' reckless
Look like he desperate
Pulled down the tinted glass and let the Tec spit
It's hectic, car flew in bodega with his neck hit
Body and head was separate, totally disconnected
Bust back two shots
At ones that standin with cannons up on the rooftops
That drew glocks, but my 20/20 spot 'em for two blocks
I'm wettin shit like it's rainfall they doin' dew drops
Two more shots came out saloon doors
I'm blowin' shit up like platoon wars
Hesitations I got no room for
Assume sure, the head honcho was bullet wounds bored
Out in the dusty sand, gun was still in his hand
Kicked the can when shit hit the fan
Fuckin' around with this G Rap the Hitman
""This is Mary White reporting live from the town of
Seenalojo, Me-xi-co, where there are dead bodies

The streets, is where they clapping at
The streets, is where the action at
The streets, is where they packing at
The streets, is where its cracking at
The streets, bringing it back to that
The streets, banging ya gat to that
The streets, start hanging back to that
(Kool G. Rap)
My niggas ride where they bust at
Die where they bust at my murderous guys
Slinging them pies where they lust at
Or corners where they hang most
Name boast and bank toast
Drive with the thing close
Slide with a James post
Empty clips is on now
Coke fiends are strung out
Broke niggas bum out
Jakes holdin' they gun out
When back streets are taped up
Bodies laying faced up
Cats running with ace up
The spots get 'em paced up
The street lamps are broke now
Mad bitches to bone now
When niggas peep your home out
And flip when they zoned out
Thugs bringing the street war
Bust shots let the heat roar
Taking trips to be more
With bricks up in to fiend off
The towns where they spray shit
Bust rounds and lay shit
Selling pounds' a great shit
And clowns get their face-lift
Spots where gats pop off
Shots clear the block off
Slugs knock your block off
And have you licking hot sauce
On the corners where the dice roll
And clubs where the ice glow
The lames get their life stole
And bleed from a knife fold
Niggas laying they law down
Some draw with a four-pound
PJ's are tore down
Thoughts of laying hos down (The streets)
Blocks where they lick shots
And rock what the fifth cocked
Kids cop the six drop
From brick box and zip locks
Towns where niggas kill at
Posting where it's real at
Keeping gats concealed at
See a foe you peel at
Strip where you get ripped off
Hot lead get licked off
Fronting and your clicks off
All your jewels get stripped off
Sidewalks where they creep up
Get locked up with a street bop
Kids running with heats up
Lifting both of your feets up
Niggas they let their guns loose
They wild guns loose
Gat up under the chin
Blow a niggas shit through the sunroof
Decide where they pack nines
The chrome gat shines
You try to clap mine
You outta line niggas get flat lined
Now Chickens a get your crew laced
For rocks and a blue face
Niggas giving they screwface
For the loot and the suitcase
Spots that blood spills on
And dealers clock a 'mil on
Murderers get their kill on
Mad cash is ill-on
Beef turning to combat
For life so they pump gats
Little kids they harm that
Put bombs where your moms at
Niggas tied up and kidnapped
And smacked up with big gats
Get found with they wig cracked
Leave 'em right where they live at (The streets)
Running for red beams
Blood flowing in red streets
Mad fellas with bread schemes
Running from the FED team
Little shorties are knocked up
Straight giving their crouch up
Juveniles decide to pee now with they ox up
Crack blocks and weed spots
The fiends up in the Detox
Some rollin' in three drops
Others ain't gotta beep bop
Bitches that get their hoe on
Smoke dope on and so on
Spotted nigga with glow on
With dick they could blow on

We bring the thug shit for real nigga
You know how we do
Y'all know how a nigga bring it
Straight direct at you kid
Like a Don from out of Sicily; under the arm is where the pistol be
Top of your forehead, the kiss'll be
Planted ever so soft and gentle but die viciously
Hours of torture, before the torture apply misery
Days before I feel pity to give a guy liberty
Seen him, his pants shitty and eyes all glittery
I'll die a rich man before the FBI figure me
40 stories up, inside a high rise in Italy
No hidden forces, only natural courses deliver me
Gray hairs from the great years, fears never shiver me
Reminscin, how we car-bombed ignitions
Of politicians, judges strong-armed to listen
Men turnin' up dead, or hurt harmed and missin'
Bulletproof cars are driven, Teflon edition
Bodies cut up in large chunks, thrown in car trunks
Music inside the bar stunk
Gettin' surrounded by bitches blowin' cigars drunk
One of my stonefaced goons'll make your heart pump
Electrocution with cables that make the car jump
The yard punks, that sinned with a life sentence for sellin hard junk
The family, the whole commission
Has been around since the days before prohibition (no doubt)
Mathematics was good then, the slow addition
Some overdosed down a coke slope, a dope addicition
Lookin' back on them days, I ran a whole division
Some of the Jake and the state was tryin' to throw the mission
They caught a ticket ride to hell with no admission; beyond these tracks
A life of networkin, sippin bourbon and co-gnac
First version observin in stocks and bonds we stack
The chronicles, these are the days of Don G Rap
(Havoc)
With, murder on his mind, take it in blood
We takin' that aim, and niggaz throwin' shit in the game
(Chorus: Havoc - repeat 2X)
How it feel when we comin' at you, these gats blowin' at you
Personally, don't give a FUCK where you at
And an unfamiliar face, you know we like WHO DAT?
On point nigga, it ain't goin' down like that
(Kool G Rap)
We do our thing, underhandedly still, tuck a mill'
For the family will, mansion and hot wheels in Amityville
Treat a snitch nigga like Sam when he squeal
Break the code of silence, just hand me the steel
For every wrong done, a man'll be killed, there's plans to rebuild
Curtains and drapes, got these Jakes tryin' to can me for real
Until then, be in the backyard with clam on the grill
Or catch me laid up in the canope ill
With two mamis handin me thrills; Vivica Fox body Vanity grills
Rubberbandin these bills; tryin' to duck the fame and the glamour
Tryin' to stay from out the range of the scanners
Not tryin' to get my frame in the camera
Avoid tabloids and front pages
Bums get knocked off and bumped for favors
Collect Trump papers with pumps and gauges
Royale suites when I bunk in Vegas
Got homicide searchin the city dump for neighbors
Pinky ring with a chunk of glacier
Copped a spot with a bunch of acres
Some of them got they bodies slumped for capers
Barcaleno hat, ducks and gators
Got a crib full of housemaids, butlers and waiters
My click, from the minor league jump to major
We gon' rock until we jackpot, FUCK THEM HATERS
If we have to run up in City Hall, abduct the Mayor
Any man against the master plan can fuck with craters!

My Range bling, platty chain hang to the knee
I'm thug for life, ain't no changin me

Aiyyo, who got the drop, my gun been cocked
Spits from four-fives to flintlocks, pinky finger with the pimp rock
Hustle on dim blocks and sip Henn-rock
Draw quick, got a second hand like Big Ben clock (ya heard?)
Reach for that heat, put your wig in the wind pop
Fill your belly with ten shots; if I get hit
And you see blood then flood the bullet wound with gin shots
Put beef in a Slim Jim box
Bitch you wanna pinch and win slot
Clap lead until your big friend drop
Niggaz'll front until I send chin shots
Beat the rock until they send cops (or what?)
Till one of us'll get carried out on the thin cot
Emergency room skin chopped by ten docs
Got it locked like a bid in the state pen box
When I dares peers hangin' to where my shin stop; before I struck rich
Fucked bitches and killed 'em with a ten inch cock (f'real)
Bitch nigga stuck him with a ten inch ock (y'know?)
Bread bloods and stiff vodka, deep in this game
Know the feds want the clique locked up
We love brain so we headhunt like witchdoctors
My lil' momma let lead dump from big poppa
Even the Jake surrounded the spread with pig choppers
That taste preposterous; tear gas, tanks of oxygen
Like we in banks with hostages (what we want?)
All we want is minks and ostriches (what?)
Diamond cuff links and proper shit
Snitches left stinkin in carpet stiff
Or get they carcasses turned to link sausages (f'real)
Ain't nuttin sweet, we known for bangin' cartridges
We got the heart for this
No matter how light or dark it is (ya heard?)
(No matter how light or dark it is, f'real)
Thug for life (what?) Rep by strips (killers)
Let loose clips (dealers) Stack mad chips (you know we)
Bag bad chicks (my niggaz) Push fly whips (all of the)
Hoes blow dick (nigga) G flows sick (what?)
(Verse Two)
My whole life about chrome rims and stone gems (what?)
Big boned skins, Capone brims, dick blown in my own Benz
Quick to Scarface thugs who raise up blown brims
Dolla trickin never politickin with grown mens
Ideas of settin me up for loot I won't bend
Just make that light bulb at the top of your dome dim (uh-huh)
Who rap-happy nigga keep the lyrics and poems grim
Get found at the bottom of the river with stone Timbs (word)
Babyface, swimmin flash stomach and toned limbs
Wake up every mornin work out in the home gym
Reppin this rap game until my zone ends (uh-huh)
Till mixin boards melt down, the microphone bend (yeah)
I spit about street shit but never condone sin
Kept it thug for life baby followed my own trend

Make a chick take the gum out her mouth, replace it with cum
Jake raided, I'm in the bed with a bitch, an inch from a Glock
ATF with a fuckin punk that's sent from a cop
My dog got tied up and whipped in the spot
Face covered to get 'em, rape the bitch with 'em
Niggas in your crib speed up your heart pace rhythm
Life to me is doin dames that'll soothe the growin pains
Can't be mad that a nigga tryna grow and change

Never know who your killer be (Yeah, speak to no one)
Just put a Desert Eagle beak in his lung
Leak 'em and run, some guys light the blunts up
(And then what?) And then go ride with the pumps up
Chopped up bitch inside of a dumpster
Paramedics tryin' to speed a nigga pulse up
(Yo, he's a cold blue) victim of the vultures
Block sizzlin hot, flooded in the middle with cops
Innocent nigga topped, riddled with shots
Kids up in rock spots clock knots, fiddle with glocks
Ready to die for what little they got
Tricks, hoes and thugs (That's right)
The ones that put holes in mugs
Waitin outside for them ones that pose in clubs
To that strange nigga knockin' on your do' with gloves
Let the .44 blow for grub, it's no love
(VERSE 2: Prodigy)
You got uniformed cops, the D's when it's hot
TNT knockin' down the door of your spot
The feds come get you once you think you on top
They just been buildin they case, they got you on tape
The CIA clip you if the shit is that deep
Your money's that long, you ain't that strong
Informants'll bury you under the jail
They got wires and statements for juries to hear
Then they got rivals that got it clickin just like you
That's your competition, them niggas tryin' to eat too
They'll set you up for dead if you don't show strength
Extort all your workers cause you ain't built for this
Plus stick-up kids and jealous-ass niggas
You gotta watch your front, sides and your back (Damn)
You gotta keep your eyes on your bitch and your mens
You gotta keep your mind sharp livin' so fed"
