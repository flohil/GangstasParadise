Sick with it
Bitch, I'm Bruce Lee
Seduce me
You're nice and juicy
In the parking lot, I gots to get mine
Why the fuck we goin' in when there's bitches in line?
I spend my time watchin' bitches' behinds
Thinkin' bad shit in the back of my mind
I bump and grind with nothing less than a dime
Making movie money, you still investin' in rhymes.
And I'm in this bitch
With a hundred dollar bill, y'all
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
I got a hundred dollar bill, y'all

Got all you freaks lookin'
When we walk by, pussy start cookin'
Rookies start tookin'
Get your ass up, V.I.P. section's gettin' tooken
Might dance, might not
Might spend enough
Cool as hell, but still pipin' hot
Soon as I find a spot
All my people gather 'round
The nigga with the shiny watch--me
Ice Cube, motherfucker
Next to me, you a test tube motherfucker
We kinda rude, motherfucker
Get too close and bucka! Bucka! Bucka!
Don't want no problems, y'all
Fuck around, I'll pull out the problem-solv'
And watch E pills dissolve

But check the people that I'm with
'Cause they'll lay you flat down
And they'll do it right now
Yeah, you scared of the phone numbers that a nigga might dial
Club-hop, car shows, picnics
Big cars, big jewels, big dicks
Rush doors
Or gotta hop the fence
Blow this door
Gotta blow my rent
Gotta show my ass, then go repent
Gotta call in sick
And tell 'em where I went."

4,2 n the Morning,1994,Bootlegs & B-Sides (1994),,Ice Cube,"""Yeah this is a story of a famous dog
Of a dog that chases it's tail, will be dizzy""
(Ice Cube)
Met her snake ass at a barbecue bash
She had a lot of ass and a twenty dollar stash
... Of some of that superb 'erb
She said, ""I got the chronic, so fuck whatcha heard""
""Ice Cube do you wanna hit this?
This shit is hype, sho' you right""
Soon as she passed me the J and a lighter
Me and this hoodrat bitch got tighter
Talkin' all day on the blanket (so whassup?)
With her ass jacked up, beggin me to spank it
Lookin' like a host from the Barbary coast
Nigga don't wanna get burnt like toast
Whassup wit deez nuts in ya me-outh
Aight everybody... c'mon we out
Took her to the six dollar hole in the wall
And I like how she's holdin' the balls
Gobble gobble, from the incision
Stuff that bitch and it ain't Thanksgiving
Didn't even have to fuck all night long
Take me home, damn it's on
Jumped out the cover, snatched off the rubber
Met the hoe's mother - yo whassup?
Got the seven digits and I'm gone'n
That's the kinda bitch you can call at 2 n the morning
Chorus: Ice Cube
Not just knee deep, she was O.G. deep
When she did the freak with me
Not just knee deep, she was O.G. deep
When she did the freak with me
""Yeah this is a story of a famous dog
Of a dog that chases it's tail, will be dizzy""
(Ice Cube)
I bumped this hoe on the danceflo'
Where you wanna go? She said, ""I don't know""
I thought I had a treat in the passenger seat
Now her ass wanna get somethin' to eat
From where? She said, ""Denny's I figure""
I said hell naw 'cause they don't like niggaz
Let's go to my house and order Domino's
And maybe I can get the bitch out her clothes
Got to the panties, her ass started fightin
And I'm thinkin' bout my dog Mike Tyson
Took her ass home, all alone (ring ring)
Whoa-oh, there go the phone
Ay whatcha doin'? ""Nothin""
Then what about screwin?
Now I'm fuckin' and I'm yawnin (*YAWN*) yup
But thank God for the bitch
That'll come/cum at 2 n the morning
(Ice Cube)
You the kind of girl to eat a dick up raw
And drink a 40 through a straw
And I love ya, 'cause you're down to get dug
And your man don't know you're gettin' fucked by a thug
You a woman that's true (that's right)
Doin' what the fuck you wanna do
And it's cool, cause you got a purse full of rubbers
And I'm a friend of your brother's (yup)
So jump your freaky ass in your Hyundai
I got a room at the Omni
Nothin' tricky, no you ain't picky
Whassup Nikki? Down for a quickie
Get your lil' dickie and your Mickey and you're straight
And gotta be at work by 8
Called you last night, you wasn't home and
Damn - it's half past 2 n the morning
""Yeah this is a story of a famous dog
Of a dog that chases it's tail, will be dizzy""
[Girl] Hello?
[Cube] Yo whassup this Cube, whatchu doin'?
[Girl] I'm asleep
[Cube] Asleep? Get yer ass up and come over here
[Girl] Want me to drive way over there?
[Cube] Yeah, come on through and shit, y'know, it's about 2

24 with a L as I bail through the concrete
Shit is kinda deep, deep
Deeper than Atlantis
You got to know who the man is
L.A. better known as Pelican's Bay
The ghetto bird's got the word from the stool pigeon
A bird in the hand can't beat a chicken
There ain't no warden, shit
Just broken glass fuckin' up my Jordans
Twice upon a time in the projects
I done got jacked for my Rolex
But I keep goin', let it pass
'Cause the swap meet got a sale on ski masks
And my little homie Kevin
Been carjackin' since '87
L.A. is like a jail cell and I got 24 with a L
Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger

Get in that cell, nigger
Get in that cell, nigger

Now, I made a little money, good
But I still want to live in the hood
But buying new fly shit
Is just like inviting ants to a picnic
It's just too many sets
And now I'm getting those kidnap threats
But who wanna get wet?
'Cause I'll soak ya, you think I'm fat like Oprah
All I got is a little piece of nothing
And now you wanna jack all of a sudden
Rather have me face down on the floor
Instead of that devil you work for
Motherfuckin' coward
And clowning my man 'cause he wants to go to Harvard
Now I got a strap when I bail
Through the hood, 24 with a L

24 years, but see I got life
Sorry Mike, it does matter if you're black or white
'Cause I'm up against the black and white
They spread my legs and grab my nuts tight
Niggas keep hitting me up
And bitches try to get a drop of nut
Askin' me to dick this so they can blow up
Throw up from the morning sickness
Keep my shoulder on the wall like the county
'Cause you buster ass niggas can't clown me
South of pee go, that's where we go
Deep in a Regal, Desert Eagle
Sittin' on my lap like a bitch with a gat
Westside's on the map
So if you want to scrap or even drop shells
It don't matter, 24 with a L
Get in that cell, nigger

8,3 Strikes You In,1998,War & Peace Vol. 1: The War Disc (1998),,Ice Cube,"One mo' strike and I'm through, nigga
Bottom of the ninth swingin', for my life
I'm up at the plate, goin' for the gate
They got my moms seated in section eight
Been on deck since my last felony
I'm that 0 for 2 mothafucka
With the Louisville Slugger
Shay Whitie, that left hand punk
Is on the mound and he comin' wit dat off-speed junk
It's the Westside Hustlaz, vs these LA Pigs
You can say the damned vs the nigs
My little homies in the dugout
They lookin' sad, 'cause fourteen niggas done struck-out
My first offense was possession of weed
Now I'm in the major leagues and
That mothafucka Bill Clinton-is a son of a bitch
Had the nerve to throw out the first pitch
I'm just tryin' to get rich like Trump
The Home Run king is now in a slump, pass me a hunk
How the fuck can I stay out the pen
When its one-two-three strikes you in
One-two three strikes you in
Now how the fuck a nigga supposed
To stay out the pen, I'm on a blend
Of Gin and Hen, everyday of my life
With two strikes it ain't right
He's in the wind-up
Here come the pitch
I swing, aw shit (foul tip)
They felt the chill 'cause if I get on first
You know the deal - a niggas gots to steal
Like to steal home and I betcha
That I can run over, the LA Pig catcher
Just because I'm black, wit a bat
They wanna send a nigga back to the warning track
Fulla count they say I won't amount to shit
But fool I can hit like Kenny Grit
With a split in my mouth on tha cellular phone
(It's going, going, gone!)
And watch a pitcher get served
You from tha LA Pigs
I know you coming with a curve
Ay batter, batter is the chitter-chatter
I'm the designated hitter, a nigga
Much badder, than Babe Ruth
Will I tell the truth and nothing but the truth
Hell yeah, I'd rather be shootin' hoops
'Cause a niggas guaranteed to win
Against a bullshit loss and three strikes you in
Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out to the crowd (wha what, wha what)
Another nigga on trial
Keep ya peanuts Jeezuh
And fuck you Cracker Jack
I hope I never come back
I gots to root for my homeboys
If they don't win it's a shame
'Cause its one-two-three strikes you in
Twenty-five years of pain you know my name
They wanna nigga to run and get hung
High strung, so this pig can win the Cy-Young
I'ma hit this mothafucka a mile
In the batters box, high as Steve Hal
You can't salary cap my gat
No strike, 'cause gangsta-rap is on the map
I'm like Satchel Paige wit a gauge
Or Jackie Robinson, when I'm robbin' one
Of you Cracker Jacks fool I'm a mothafuckin vet
And fuck yo seventh-inning stretch, so
Take me out to the ballgame,
And see my neighborhood name
In your Ghetto Hall of Fame
Yeah (It ain't right)
Playin' people like a game (It ain't right)
Human beings, puttin' 'em in a jar (It ain't right)
For double life, triple life (It ain't right)
Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out to the crowd (wha what, wha what)
Another nigga on trial
Keep ya peanuts Jeezuh
And fuck you Cracker Jack
I hope I never come back
I gots to root for my homeboys
If they don't win it's a shame
'Cause its one-two-three strikes you in
Twenty-five years of pain you know my name
You know my name (wha what, wha what) x 4
If I die tonight, you know who did it (you know)
If I ride tonight, you know who did it (you know)
If they sheck me up, you know who did it (don't guess)
If they check my nuts, you know who did it (get 'em)
If they break my bank, you know who did it (yeah)
If they pull my rank, you know who did it (get 'em)
If they sock me up, you know who did it (yeah)
If they lock me up, you know who did it (get 'em)
If they smear my name, you know who did it
If they kill my game, you know who did it
Remember me (you know who did it)

Gots to get a job 'cause I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid by rappin' to the nation

But there's no SC for this youngsta
I didn't have no money so now I have to punch the
Clock, gotta slave, and be half a man
But whitey says there's no room for the African
Always knew that I would clock G's
But welcome to McDonalds may I take your order please
Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
'Cause my son doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and similac
Do I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from Bush
Or Jesse Jackson, and operation Push
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A masengel what the hell crack will sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches,
Miss Porker, Little Joe and Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I got me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
'Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I'll never get love again
'Cause blacks are too fuckin' broke to be republican
Now I remember I used to be cool
Till I stopped fillin' out my W-2
Now senators are gettin' high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is our only room to walk
'Cause we don't want a drug push
But a bird in the hand is worth more than a bush

11,A Gangsta's Fairytale,1990,AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted (1990),,Ice Cube,"Intro: Little Russ, Ice Cube
[Story-teller] Once upon a time, in the black part of the city
[Young kid] Yo G, yo G you better get out of here man, 5-0
(Door swings shut, car peels out)
[Russ] Yo Ice Cube, man
[Cube] Whassup man?
[Russ] Why you...
[Cube] Whassup?
[Russ] Yo Ice Cube man, why you always kickin the shit about the bitches
And the niggaz? Why don't you kick some shit about the kids, man? The
Fuckin' kids?!
[Cube] Word
Verse One: Ice Cube
Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-C-E
And let me tell ya a story or two
About a punk-ass nigga I knew
Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street 'cause he was piping hot
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop
Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe
At that type of shit he's a pro
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way
To make some money, why not?
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes
Drove a 500 sittin' on Lorenzoes
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out
Saw, her and her friends sellin sheepskins
[Little Bo Peep] Yo yo I got them sheepskins
Yo, my empty sheepskins
Yo baby, what's up with that?
Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin' up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin' her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence? Yo I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go
Interlude: Little Russ
Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit!
(Well, you know the rest)
Verse Two: Ice Cube
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
With a joint, drinkin' some 8-ball
Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville
Lookin' for, the wolf to kill
They're fucked up and they want revenge
Them and Humpty used to be friends
Now they're enemies 'cause he's a traitor
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And Mister Rogers is gettin' mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin'
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next
So Mister Rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho
Cause Cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve, givin' up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em
Little Boy Blue is up front givin' orders
Little did they know Cinderella was a fink
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink
A bad influence? Yo, I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go
Outro: Little Russ, Ice Cube
[Cube] Aiyyo man was that dope enough for you?
[Russ] Yeah you aight, you in the house
We outta here, seeeee-yaaaaa
[Cube] Yeah you better go home before I whoop your little bad ass
[Barney Rubble] Some bedtime story huh?
[Bugs Bunny] It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't wanna live here
[Andrew Dice Clay] Ay, good ol' Mother Goose, remember her? I fucked her"
12,A History of Violence (insert),2006,"Laugh Now, Cry Later (2006)",,Ice Cube,"(William Shatner - Host of Rescue 911)
Blacks who ventured across the unmarked border were often attacked
By teenage members of the new gang called The Spook Hunters,
One of a handful of white gangs active in this time.
It was only natural for L.A.'s newest residents to respond unkind.
(Unknown)
As white attacks started to increase in the mid 1940's and late 1940's
Blacks started to organize their clubs really as a defensive mechanism.
And the boss men or the business men and the Snyder boys and all these
Clubs in south L.A. really were just sorta defending themselves against
White violence that was coming from Huntington Park and Southgate.
(William Shatner)
The demise of the black panthers in Los Angeles is said to be another
Blow to a generation of black teenagers that witnessed many of its role models
Assasinated throughout the 1960's.
[Ice Cube] spoken
What I'm sayin' in so many words, they shoulda let the panthers
Went on because there probably would never have been no crips and no bloods."
13,Alive on Arrival,1991,Death Certificate (1991),,Ice Cube,"Down at the best spot
It's me and JD and they sellin more birds than a pet shop
The spot's hot and everybody nervous
That's when the blue car served us
Oh why did fools had to let loose
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce
Big Tom had to push us
13 niggaz runnin' straight to the bushes
For they gats so they could draw down
But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down
Not known why I dropped out
Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out
So now I gotta jet
Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin wet
Tryin' to see if we got him
Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom
Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out
Woke up in the back of a tray
On my way, to MLK
That the county hospital jack
Where niggaz die over a little scratch
Still sittin' in the trauma center
In my back is where the bullet entered
Yo nurse I'm gettin' kind of warm
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin' form
Coughin up blood on my hands and knees
Then I heard ""freeze nigger don't move""
Yo, I didn't do a thing
Didn't wanna go out like my man Rodney King
Still got gaffled
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel
Now I'm handcuffed
Being asked information on my gang affiliation
I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes
And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime
I need to see a MD
And y'all mothafuckers giving me the third degree
Look at the waiting room
Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room
Nobody gettin' help
Since we poor
The hospital move slow
Now I'm laid out
People steppin over me to get closer to the TV
Just like a piece of dog shit
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet
One hour done passed
Done watched two episodes of M*A*S*H
And when I'm almost through
They call my name and put me on ICU
Halfway dead
No respect and handcuffed to the bed
Now the trauma starts
Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart
So I begin the ass kissin'
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician
Got the chills, but my temperatures 103
Only got a band-aid and an IV
That's when I start cussin
Police steady askin me who did the bustin'
Why oh why can't I get help
'Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self
Too many black bodies the hospital housin
So at 10 P.M. I was Audi 5000"

Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry

Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin' in a dig, yo it couldn't be

Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Pack my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
'Cause the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin my own kind

But when I start robbin the white folks
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope

Whassup Cube dog?
I got this bitch-ass nigga right here
Y'know, fuckin' with this tramp-ass bitch
Puttin' her before the scrill' all the time, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Man I got this nigga transcripts, and every-mother-fuckin' thang
Tellin' this bitch all my mother-fuckin' business
Puttin' ass over cash everyday
Nigga fuck that, this Westside
(Ice Cube)
Be gone you fuckin' peon, got the Don furious
Talkin' on the phone got the Federal curious
I'm serious! I don't give a fuck where he is
Snatch him out the factory, bring his ass back to me
How the fuck you think I got the NAME Bossalini? Punk
Mack God Rap Genie, you can't see me
Up in this game ever since you was a lame
Y'all train at my school, nigga I rule
You never make me holla, smokin' on a fifteen dollar
From across the water, watch your daughter
She might catch the Holy Ghost from this rap sermon
While you vermin smokin' Sherman, I'm rollin' somethin' German, bitch
Money earnin makin' mo' money (ching ching)
Enemies look so funny, with they clothes bummy
Don't need no honey, that's right
'Cause I'm thinkin' with my big head, FUCK what my dick said!
Chorus: Ice Cube
We puttin' cash over ass, each and every day
Go on let the players play... (the hustlers)
(We some money makin' motherfuckers... I know that you love us!)
We puttin' cash over ass, each and every day
Go on let the players play... (the hustlers)
(We some money makin' motherfuckers... I know that you love us!)

Now who's that nigga got these bitches lookin' silly? Me!
I'm the Big Willie for rilly, the real dilly
You can ask Phillie 'cause I got a year's supply (Yup!)
You must want to die, don't get the lye
After dark up at Griffith Park, shallow grave
For the mark check his heart, the game about to start
Big thangs automatic pu-tang (automatic)
Keep your mind off them bitches, eyes on your riches
If it twitches give it stitches
If it jiggles or switches, fuck and take pictures, now
I'm livin' in a two-point zone, and I'm still bumpin
Call me in the clutch, ain't lost my touch
Nigga what? on the microphone
If I drove it in the video, bitch, I can drive it home
Tight as a Corleone
You got to get your own, baby get on, now
(Ice Cube)
Get your ass up and go to work, cause you know
On payday, nigga that shit gon' hurt
Fuckin' with a skirt instead of handlin your bizness
Rich dude, now you got to make three wishes
I'm suspicious, of any motherfucker puttin' fuck over finance
'Specially fuckin' up my plans
I'm the boss, I can be late
But you'll never see her and me, over currency
Givin' you the third degree, cause you got
Too many broke bitches and you like bankin for a penny
Stop fuckin' on them dum-dums
Find one with some ass and some income
Who wanna win? Who wanna spin?
Who wanna make, twenty-five eight? Me
Ice Cube the great... pushin rhymes like weight
Never put that hoe, in front of that dough nigga
For what? (Never... fuck a bitch nigga)
For what? She ain't gon' love you if you ain't got no dough fool
(Bitch fuckin' with me got to be workin, gettin' paid yaknahmsayin?)
Gotta come up, scrilla scrilla y'all (Never ass over cash nigga)
Scrilla scrilla y'all (We greedy)
Cha-ching! (She can get some CD's, push some keys)
Cha-ching! (Ha ha ha, make the bitches shake they tit-ties)
Cha-ching, cha-ching! (Over my knee)
Cha-ching, cha-ching! (Never ass over cash)
Never ass over cash"
28,Cave Bitch,1993,Lethal Injection (1993),,Ice Cube,"Give me a black goddess sister I can't resist her. no stringy haired, blonde
Hair, blue eyed, pale skinned buttermilk complexion. grafted, recessive,
Depressive, ironing board backside straight up and straight down. no
Frills, no thrills, miss 6:00, subject to have the itch, mutanoid,
Caucazoid, white cave bitch...
Ease back, white bitch, I don't play that
Just because I got on my L.A. hat
Stalkin' walking in my big black boots
Is my jingle, now you want Mandingo
Big, black and handsome
I should hold your devil ass for ransom
Sorta like Patty Hearst, but I'll burst first bitch
And you know what's worse
I'm coming from the land where the choppers roam
So fuck you bitch and your coppertone
Stringy hair - no derrier - frontin' and fakin' with your silicone pair
Do I wanna fuck? not hardly
That's kinda like barbie fuck bob marley
It ain't gonna happen, I keep rappin'
Muthafuck Tenielle, but see I'm the captain of this ship
And I'm true to the game
Y'all all look the same
Standin' by my backstage door, hopin' that'll switch
Spread out you little cave bitch
Why every time we get famous
You wanna play us like Andy and Amos?
The devil sent you to try and tame us
But you can't tame me, with no bitch named amy
Lookin' for the dark meat
But hoe, I ain't tryin' to go out like barkely
'Cause every time I turn on the TV
I see several brothers with she-devils
Smilin' 'cause you out on a date
But sooner or later, the bitch'll yell rape
Soon as daddy found out you a jigaboo
He'll kill like he did Emmitt Till
Yah, he tried to kick bass
But the bitch probably threw it in his face
Sargent bale ain't nothin' but a trick
Nasty as hell, stanky little cave bitch
Now don't think that I hate you
'Cause I won't date you, bitch I gotta stay true
You can be a fan, but don't expand
And try to get my dick in your hand
You better run to the minute man
Pale as snow, so act like y'know
'Cause if I slap it, flip it, and rub it like that
Yeah, it gotta be black
Plus yo ass too flat
I need a butt big enough that can clap
Rat-a-tat-tat
You can't get mine ho
I'd rather fuck an albino
At least I know, she's comin' from the nubian
And not the Ku Klux Klan that you be in
And I don't give a fuck if your family is rich
You're still a little cave bitch."

In them same traps niggaz cain't figure out
In the fast lane, boy, but the bridge is out
Make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled

Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us

See New Orleans get bitchslapped by FEMA
Louisiana got racist-ass politics
Free the Jena Six (NIGGA FREE THE JENA SIX!)
Your honor, Osama, Obama
Even, yo' momma ain't fuckin' with my karmas
They want us to quit, forget
And not give a shit about these sick-ass politics

37,Color Blind,1991,Death Certificate (1991),,Ice Cube,"Ice cube:
Here's another day at the stoplight
I'm lookin' in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South central is puttin' ice cube to the test
With four brothas in the ss
Now, I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slippin I'm fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Do these fools got a problem with me, or do they got love?
And when the light turn green, I don't bone out
I wanna see, what these black men are all about
'Cause if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm pluggin they super sport
First they get behind my ride
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scopin out the one smokin' indo'
Comin' up fast, rollin' down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, 'cause I'm color blind
Threat:
Killa cali, the state where they kill
Over colors 'cause brothas don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop
And he won't stop and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little locs are gettin' a little too loc'ed
And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong words then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a u-turn, come back and get served, nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
But wearin the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me
'Cause I slang these thangs like a g
It's on, is anybody killin' for the summertime
I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind
Kam:
I'm fresh outta county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
'Cause everyday, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story
So what's left, the judge goes deaf
When you try to tell your side and you ain't blue eyed
Boy you better duck, 'cause the book is comin'
And just hand your car keys over to your woman
Because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even shed a tear
'Cause believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph
'Cause brothas, you don't know the half
On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
But ever since I've been down, I'm colorblind
WC:
Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, young and dumb and full of come up, a baby loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke
Coolio:
Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin'
'Cause I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin'
Grabbed the a.k. and jumped in the g ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side
Wc:
Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the 5 dollar stick and I put in my clip
Coolio:
So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sendin niggaz to harrisons ross
Wc:
Caught one from the back and I looked in his eyes
Thinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by the other kind
Coolio:
I ain't contributin' to genocide (why?) 'Cause I was colorblind
King Tee:
Niggaz in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
'Cause, I walk the alleys of compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way I get burned baby
Lou wears blue, big fred wears red
Put 'em together and we color 'em dead
Dead, dyin', gettin' smoked like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral
J-dee (lench mob):
I understand how all my homeboys feel
'Cause I've been shot and to this day, I pack my steel
'Cause I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
With blue and red bandanas on the street
And if you're slippin, you'll be six feet deep
'Cause me and t-bone, we pay it no mind
And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind..."

39,Dead Homiez,1990,Kill at Will (1990),,Ice Cube,"Verse One:
Up early in the morning, dressed in black
Don't ask why? 'Cause I'm down in a suit and tie
They killed a homie that I went to school with (Damn!)
I tell ya life ain't shit to fool with
I still hear the screams of his mother
While my nigga laid dead in the gutter (Shit!)
And it's getting to my temple
Why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?
It makes me so mad I want to get my sawed-off
And have some bodies hauled off
But no, I pay my respects and I'm through (whaddup Cube?)
Hug my crew, and maybe shed a tear or two
And I wanna get blitz
Grab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce
About a brother who had to be the one and only
So I dedicate this to my dead homiez...
Verse Two:
Another homie got murdered on a shakedown {three gun shots}
And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown
Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted {two gun shots}
A framed picture and a closed casket
A single file line about 50 cars long
All drivin' slow with they lights on
He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath
What good is that when you're six feet deep?
I look at that shit and gotta think to myself
And thank God for my health
'Cause nobody really ever know
When it's gonna be they family on the front row
So I take everything slow, go with the flow
Shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know (Word!)
'Cause that's what Pops told me
But I wish he could have said it... to my dead homiez
Verse Three:
I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun
Now it's ""Rest in Peace"" after every one
Except me, but I ain't the one to front
Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month
Plus, I knew him when he was yeah big
Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig
But somethin' ain't right
And it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight
Lovin' each other in a caring mood
There's lots of people and lots of food
They say ""Be Strong"" and you're tryin'
But how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'?
So that's why Ice Cube's dressed up
Because the city is so fuckin' messed up
And everybody is so phony
Take a little time... to think about your dead homiez."

Fine bitches, you shit out of luck

47,Doing Dumb Shit,1991,Death Certificate (1991),,Ice Cube,"<O'Shea! O'Shea!
Get your ass in here, boy
You hear me calling you?
O'Shea!>
When I was young I used to hang with the seventh graders
Little bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders
Fucking with the girls in the fourth grade
Either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids
Walking with the schoolhouse bully
By doing that, I had a lot of pull, G
Cheating on tests, making a mess
Cussing like a sailor at recess
It must a been a half moon
'Cause you'll catch me running out the little girls' bathroom
Chewing on Good and Plenties
Got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies
Yo I was living like the class clown
Pulling all the hokes, making all the jokes man
When you young it's hard to see
That it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD
Popping out your window with a BB gun
Better yet knocking on your door and run
Playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank
Even though I was still shooting blanks
As soon as the dark hit
I was stealing candy out the corner market
Until I got my ass whipped
'Cause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit
Thirteen, that's how old I was
When my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz
And I was looking at any butt and ass
Me and my homies started cutting class
Going up to the high school
Looking for any bitch I could lie to
Tell 'em I was older than I really was
Smoked my first joint and got really buzzed
That's what a mack's made of
But when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love
Hard as a rock the long way
And then I put the rubber on the wrong way
But I still gotta have it
Overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit
Goddamn I was hot
A virgin but I still knew how to lay pipe
Even though the hoe worked me
I still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
Then the shit got strange money
I started shaking and jimmy felt funny
Then the nut came gushing
I jumped up got dressed and start pushing
'Cause I thought the bitch broke my dick
'Cause I was still young doing dumb shit
At 17 got my first Volkswagon
And mastered the life-long art of dragging
To the women in college
Hung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge
Breaking in cars and all that
Hitting punk fools with a baseball bat
Fucking at a real fast rate
Till they said that I might not graduate
Then I said fuck the dumb shit
Cause Pops'll fuck me up quick
If things continued
So I start rapping about shit I been through
And I got real good
Now I look at all the kids in the neighborhood
Trying to be baby macks
Doing shit that I did seven years back
Going through a stage
But before they can grow up they on the front page
And they mommas is having a fit
'Cause they died young doing dumb shi"
48,Don't Trust 'em,1992,The Predator (1992),,Ice Cube,"You can't trust a big butt and a smile
No, that's the old style
In ninety-deuce, shit ain't quite the same
Bitches gotta brand new game, yo
It's kinda hard to see
But the dating game ain't what it used to be
Back in the day, if a ho wanted ya dough
She give you a piece of ass and there we go
Go and get knocked up and then get socked up
You be broke and locked up
But the news done hit
Bitches all over on some new improved shit
To y'all macks
Come to find out that bitches are pullin jacks
I remember every night all you had to worry about
Was gettin' caught at a red light
And the nigga gettin' ya five, day to days
Now shit done changed
'Cause you gots to watch the ones in the skirt
And it ain't about gettin' burnt
I know it sounds strange, but could you
Stop thinkin' with ya dick for a change
'Cause you'll get a bullet in your brain, mr rich
And about that bitch, don't trust em
(Ice cube comin' at'cha with a crazy bitch)
Don't trust no (bitch! bitch! bitch!)
(Ice cube comin' at'cha with a crazy bitch)
You can't trust no (bitch! bitch! bitch!)
*Repeat*
Here's how the bitches jack:
They try to catch a dumb nigga in the act
You came to the club, stepped to the bar
And pulled out a wad of doves
After you got buzzed, she walk by
You saw how big her ass was
Got her on the dancefloor
And she started dancin like a ho
Jimmy got stiff, she ain't have a ride home
So you gave the bitch a lift
She didn't wanna trouble you
But hopped her big ass in your bmw
Hopped to her house and started kissin'
And jimmy just wouldn't listen
'Cause you got real horny
And that ain't cool at four in the morning
Started undressing the ho
Got to the drawers and the ho said ""no!
""Not on the first date
""It's gettin' kinda late, could you come back at eight? ""
You said ""yeah!"" 'cause you thought you met a wholesome ho
But nigga, she know you rollin' in some dough
And you'll regret and somethin' 'bout a bitch you just met
Don't trust em!
(Scratching of bbd's 'poison' and pe's 'don't believe the hype')
Eight o'clock on the dot, nigga's hot
Dick hard as a rock
Straight on a solo creep
Can't wait till her little boy go to sleep
So you can seduce the g
Bust a nut and make an excuse to leave
You got her worked out 'cause you the man
But the bitch got diff'rent plans
She said ""take off your clothes, jump in the bed""
While she powder her nose
You get butt naked, 'cause you ready to wreck it!
'Cause you's a motherfuckin punk, next thing you know
The door flies open with a blast
With four niggas in ski masks
Pointin a gun at the pimp
You're scared as a motherfucker and jimmy done went limp
They beat you down just a taste
Take ya to your house and make ya open up the safe
Drove you far, tied up in the trunk of your own fuckin' car
Take you out and pop the cap
I told you the bitch was a trap
Don't trust em!"
49,Down for Whatever,1993,Lethal Injection (1993),,Ice Cube,"Damn
I'm broke
My feet hurt

And that bitch is slippin'
It makes me wanna - creep
It makes me wanna - creep
(I got somethin' for your mind, your body, and your soul)
(I got somethin' for your mind, your body, and your soul)
Damn, I'm such a G it's pathetic
Here comes the big-headed nigga that's dippin'
Sippin' on Courvoisier
Goddamn, I must have the floss today
Now pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary
So I'm chasin' bitches like Tom chased Jerry
I'll put the pedal to the flo'
In my two-tone Ford Explo-a
You know how it's done
Sounds bumpin' ain't that somethin'
Jumped on the 110
She's flyin' in the Blazer
Like, ""Go Speed Racer"", but I ain't gonna chase her
Like Racer X, but I don't flex
'Til it's time to have sex
So when you wanna get togetha?
'Cause you know a nigga like me is down for whatever
And I'm down for whatever
When I was little, I didn't wanna be like Mike
I wanted to be like Ike 'cause
Papa was a rollin' stone in the '60s
And he liked green just like Bill Bixby
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty
Pockets never skinny
Played ""let's get it on"" in the living room
And when he gets drunk better give him room
'Cause he'll turn the party out
Sayin' ""This is my motherfuckin' house""
And y'all gots to go through the door
And if you can't find the door
He'll help you with the 4-4
Talkin' much shit on the grass
And straight down to blast
I'm still in my P.J.'s
He's in a turtleneck sweater
And we down for whatever
And I'm down
Solid pro is down for whatever
The Don Jagwar is down for whatever
And it don't seem to stop
Now, I don't talk a lot of shit
But when it's time to get busy with these hos, let's go
'Cause I'd rather see a skinhead dead
Than my niggas wearin' blue or red
'Cause I got the gift to hit them hos swift
And I'm smellin like a fifth of somethin'
Yeah, that's right
I'm standin' in the store
Koreans act so nice
'Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchell's
Donut and you know what?
I'm cool like dat like Digable Planets
But don't take a nigga for granted
'Cause, whether it's a verdict of the L.A. Four
You just don't know
That this rappin'-ass nigga will change with the weather
And be down for whatever
And I'm down - creep
And I'm down for whatever
Bumpin' in your Jeep
Ice Cube - devoid of pop
And I will never dance for you trick-ass niggas
It makes me wanna - creep
It makes me wanna - creep"

Gangsta rap has arrived, I'm the only man alive
October 31st, 1985
Hard times, just got harder
Adolescent Ice Cube, the shit starter
A martyr, thanks to the father
For bein this mean as sixteen raps, feel like the bitch scream
You learned about your triple beam from me
You stopped payin' for pussy and hit that ass for free
A little G never thought, that I could change the world
Witta attitude, a Raider jacket and a jheri curl
Got every girl wantin to do me, screw me
Boyz N The Hood, the first rap, the first movie
Ooh wee *woman screaming* it's alive

The world had to bow to this new style
Dial 9-1-1, makin' more money than the law allow
But Fuck Tha Police, they can get deez
Now who was sayin' shit like that before me?
No-body, but everybody wanna take the star's place
And be Scarface in the car chase
Illigitimate, counterfeit
Even got white boys talkin' shit off the shit I invent
No no, motherfuckers musta took a photo
Tryin' to call my gangsta shit 'mafioso'
But who ya usin'? Fool it ain't no solution
To the evolution, of pimps and prostitution
I cuss, skanlous, I give a rush
To niggas who mind turn to mush, smokin' on brush
Hush, I'm just a lush for this Hen
Chrome electroids, connected to my pen
When, blowin' motherfuckers ain't knowin' what we goin' through
Spiritually, lyrically showin you
They call me, 'AmeriKKKa's Most Hated'
Gettin' liberated by this monster I created
Dr. Frankenstein
{Mr. Short Khop}
We love to bump you Frankenstein
Yo' shit is the best
Take my body and my mind
Don't fuck with the stress
Hit me with that game to win
If you want, hit me again
We love you Frankenstein
We love you Frankenstein
{Ice Cube}
Now how many times did a nigga have to warn ya?
Ya fuckin' up the formula (call the coroner)
It's outta hand, 'cause sucker ass niggas like you
Try to pay the rent off my blueprint
New cent to the industry
You thought my shit was biodegradable, uh uh, it's unfadeable
Unstoppable, runnin' through your suburbs
Incredible thug words
We gets down, nigga do the Monster Mash
And watch a nigga like me collect monster cash
'Cause I'm sittin' wit this bitch who got monster ass
Keep 'em wonderin how long the Don will last
And never pass, and when I want it buttered on toast
Can't no nigga see Ice Cube on no coast
So all you gotta do is focus
And see that I'm the fuckin' loccest with this hocus pocus
Dr. Frankenstein
Dr. Frankenstein, ugh

I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
How the fuck do you figure?
That I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?!
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder

Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck

<Pop pop pop> was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucka'
The shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
It's a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside...

Before you learn to walk with one another?
How sick can you be?
(Enemy)
Verse one:
Where you gonna go when the brothers wanna bust a shot
Where you gonna go when I wanna kill bloodclot
Supercat said that the ghetto red hot
Bust a gloc, bust a gloc, devils get shot
Nappy-headed, no-dreded look where ya read it
Buck the devil, buck the devil, look who said it
Listen what I say after 1995 not one death will be alive
God will survive, him protect the civilized
Who really cares if the enemy lives or dies?
Not me, not me
Me never eat from the tree with the apple
I'd rather have a snapple
Do you know where you're going to
Do you know where you're runnin' from
Scared of the sun, I live in the sun
You shrivel up like a raisin
And burn like the blunt that I'm blazin'
Ku klux klan scared of my nutty beats
Cause them nutty beats equal bloody sheets
Out number you somethin' like 15 to 3
See, don't love your enemy
Enemies, enemy runnin' from the g
Enemies, enemy, you're my enemy
Enemies, enemy, when will I see?
Enemies, enemy r.i.p.
Verse two:
Where you gonna run when God wanna do ya?
J. edgar hoover, I wish I woulda knew ya
With the boom ping ping is the ring from the fire
Me not afraid, cause me know elijah
Goin' to the east but straight from the westside
Swing down sweet chariot nad let me ride
Through the fire, through the fire that will please us
I know that farrakhan is your baby Jesus
Devil don't you know I'm a soldier?
In god's name and the baby claim I'm gonna hold ya
Like folger's crystals feds
I'ma pick your ass like juan valdez
You don't care if me die from the cracka
You don't care if me have a heart attacka
You don't care if me get car jacka
You don't care 'cause you're nothing but a cracka
Now it's judgement day, and allah'll never play
""Freedom got an ak,"" them guerilla say
Bobby seale said, ""please make it rough, bro""
When God give the word, me herd like the buffalo
Through your neighborhood, watch me blast
Tribe of shabazz, get in that ass
You shoulda took heed of my word and became a friend of me
Now you're just a enemy
Verse three:
Now I change my style up, my style up, bodies pile up
Just to trouble you, throwin' out the w

Now you treat me like a germ
Cause your scared of the su - per sperm
Please don't bust till you see, the whites of his eyes
The whites of his skin, the whites of his lies
Nappy head nigga with the bone in his nose
Ya scared I'ma put this bone in your hoes
But I don't wanna, I've been to cona
From the cavebitch with the nasty persona
Hit me with the big black billy club
Cause you white and your hoe than a silly nub
Three men in the tub, rub-a-dub-dub
And it's really scary, now they're in the military
Sodom and gomorrah, devil read your torah,
Bible, holy qur'an
Once again it's on, got the hollow point teflon
And the brother ron 2x, so who's next?

Crazy toons is a crazy coon ready for the enemy

Niggas wanna play, each and every day
Pass me the pill, a nigga shoot the j
Rougher than the roughest rough muthafucka, had enough muthafucka?
Handcuff this muthafucka with the duct tape, tie it to the bumper
Grab his bitch, dump her, cause nobody wanna hump her
They call me thumper 'cause I thump till it hurt
Knock your dick in the dirt, puttin' in work
Master farad muhammad comin' like a comet
When they see em, they all start to vomit
1995, elijah is alive

Bloods and crips and little ol me

Brought it there for his wallet and my bottle
That's my motto and I gotta warn ya
Before I'm through, I'm going back to California

Please, welcome O'Shea Jackson better known as Ice Cube!
How you doin'?
[Ice Cube:] How you doin'?
Good to see you.
Well known that the Crips and the Bloods are allegedly coming together.
Yeah, you've been alot in the media lately than other rappers, we'd mentioned earlier Cube, that uhm...
You know? You have been labelled a lota thing.
What do you say to the people with the causal being anti-semitic, (fuck 'em!)
Or anti-careerist?
And, basically a portrait of the violence because of your lyrics, what do you say to them? (fuck 'em!)
It's probably the reason why they say that it's beacause some of the lyrics were...
Aimed at the women, bitches and hoes, and all that.
I wanna talk a little bit about that, too.
Because we saw the parents' discussion about this last time and... (yeah!)
So and brothers, uhm... folks walkin' around, totin' guns, uuuuhm...
All that kinda stuff, do you think that sometimes those images and those lyrics...
Help white folks justify their continual racism againts us, or continue racism against us? (nah!)
I-I speak... in a perpective as uh... brothers on,..
What we need to do is look in the mirror.
I-I, I do want the white community to understand our community more...
And see what's going on, and see what, what uh... the things they've done to us in the past...
Are still affectin' us now... mentally, you know?
And,.. the reason I said it's because, I mean everything I said about, uh, uuuhm... you know?
Everything I said on records before the riots, you know? Uuuh... (uh-hmm!)
Anything you want to know about the riots...
Was in the records before the riots! All you had to do was go...
To the Ice Cube library and, and, and...
[Female Interviewer:] In, in, in...
Pick a record and it would have told you.
You know? I've given warnings...
So in other words, it's almost like a... war-warning or prophecy?
I-I've, I've given...
I've given so many warnings on what's going to happen.
If we don't get these, uuh...
These, these things straight in our lives, the clashes the-then, you know?
Armageddon is-is-is, is near! Eheh! [beat stops]
This here...
These words all about money."

And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothing like a man that can do wha he wanna
Ain't nothing like man on that you knew on the cornna

It's a new law: keep a hold of yo riches
Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it

You left 'em hangin' man, what the fuck?
Verse 1: Ice Cube
Little boy blue is outta folsome
Now them three little pigs gotta roast him
Drivin' down sesame street and I bet
That little muthafucker's out fuckin' smurfette
Ain't saw the wolf yet, but it's no doubt
They'll catch his ass slippin at his grandma house
They got the MAC-10 pointed out the coop
'Cause they gotta follow they nose like fruit loops
Peeped out little miss muffet on her tuffet eatin grits
She saw the MAC-10 and the bitch had the shits
Ran into her house, called up her crew
Cause red riding hood wants to kill little boy blue
And the wolf too, what is mister rogers doing?
Moved out his jordan, bought him a ewing
Him, little boy blue and the wolf in the cellar
Planning on gettin' cinderella
Cause cinderella still works for the pigs
Through with the dwarfs, doin' bebe's kids
Now snow white got the horny ass fever
Doin' the beauty's beast like jungle fever
Now the word's on the street
When the crews meet
You better make alot of room
'Cause it's on with the pigs and them other nigs
When the cow jump over the moon, everybody jump.
Now little boy blue is up front
With the nine millimeter, ready for the hunt
Little red riding hood caught his ass slippin'
Drew down on the boy cause the bitch is steady trippin'
About to get loose with the deuce deuce.
That's when the boy said, ""What about the gang truce?""
The little hoe had no words
The wolf came around and the bitch got served
Three little pigs bought wigs
Dressed like sheep, cinderella is little bo peep
Tryin' to creep, on the crew
The wolf, the rogers, the blue, they through
Cause the pigs did the buck buck bang, ping
Now you hear the fat lady sing
Cinderella ran like a trick
To the pay phone cause the bitch is still a snitch
Now the pigs are caught by the pigs and taken
In the pen to get fried like bacon
You still can't trust no hoe
And ice cube'll tell the kids how the stories, should go.
Outro: Little Russ
Yeah cube, man that shit was dope nigga.
You all that and a bowl of grits.
Nigga that shit was on props, nigga.

65,Get Use to It,2008,Raw Footage (2008),,Ice Cube,"If you try to get wit me
Pull a four on the fifty
Fuck yo monkey ass up like bobby did whitney
Trigger fingers get itchy
When niggaz get bitchy
And they need they story told on Jerry or Ricki
Well you're green and you're iffy
I'm clean and I'm spiffy
If they lock me up today I'll be back in a jiffy
All my niggaz that's wit me
All my bitches are picky
To ride around that's right on time
Bitch you know it's tricky
Take a hit of the sticky
Everybody get tipsy
When we hittin that whisky
All my niggaz get pissy
Don't fuck wit no sissy
All we bumpin' is missy
If you know where I am motherfucker come get me
I'm a man out of mickey
All my niggaz love hickies
That don't go away till ya well in your sixties
All I'm wearin is dickies
Don't try to evict me
When we come to atlanta we gon re-open nickies
Game Verse:
I'm a gangsta rap teacher, nigga you better know it
It's the don gotti Jr. slash motherfuckin' poet
Sit back and take notes while I spin like 100 spokes
My flow is razor sharp I'm comin' straight for ya throat
With that west coast gang bang
Watch him when his chain hang
East coast down south
Niggaz do the same thang
Throw up ya dubs like wutang who bang
Harder than that nigga barrellin' through ya hood wit two chains
Swangin' like he's nuts, 'cause he don't give a fuck
I know nigga that ain't bangin' in no khaki's or some chucks
It's that westside, connected with that nigga who flow so wreckless
He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I bet this
Motherfuckin' coast ain't got shit after me
Ain't have shit before Cube except a Dub C
The mack circle is back with mad purple in fact
I'm bout to join the Lynch mob that's me squirtin' the mack"

Nigga, some don't think I can flow, so here we go

About a bitch is a bitch is a hoe is a slut
And I don't like niggaz on my nuts!
So I dedicate this one to the groupie
And the charlie, all on my snoopy
Brothers keep askin, ""ice cube yo when will you bust""
They surround me and make a big fuss
Now I was taught, back on my block
That you don't ride on nobody's jock
For anything they do, fuck him and his crew
Unless, you were gettin' paid too!
I'm not saying this to diss each and every fan
Women you can ride, man be a man!
Shake my hand, and make it a firm shake
Say, ""whattup ice cube? "" and then break
'Cause if you're hangin' there I'ma tell you loud and clear
Get off my my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here

I step into the club, to rub-a-dub
It seems like all the little hoes fall in love
With my money, cause yo about a year ago
I was just your ordinary average everyday crazy ass bro
But you know, I just can't be equal
'Cause they know, I know a lot of famous people
But to a one-night stand, there's no sequel
Here's the pickle, pretend it's a popsicle
See for a fat booty, I do damage
They think I'm a star, so I take advantage
It's just another ice cube groupie test
She's a hoe 'cause they knew her at the front desk
Told her to meet me, at the room 110
And the bitch showed up, with her boyfriend
I let him in, all he could do was grin
He had a camera, a t-shirt, a pad and pen
He said, ""yo ice cube, can you sign this? ""
I only did it cause his bitch was the finest
She blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown
Like - how can we get rid of this clown?
Me and her sat down, he got a little jealous
Cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us
And he asked me question after question
It felt like a motherfuckin interview session
Then his girl got up, I heard the do' shut
And he was still there, swingin' from my nuts
I said, ""get the fuck out!"" and made it loud and clear
Get off my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here
I see me about ten mark ass motherfuckers fans
Knock on the door, talkin' about whassup?
Yo man, it was about a hundred and twenty dicks man
Niggaz start, niggaz comin' out of hotel rooms
Without no bitches!
They can get gaffled like they in a motherfuckin raffle
Punk ass
(Ice cube)
Yo, I respect the respectable
If your girl is all on my dick, check the hoe
Say, ""yeah that nigga he can rap fly

Just ran out my last stick is where I'm comin' from
I'm not tellin' you to diss mr. ice cube
Cause you know, I'm the one that can show and prove
Now groupie girls, I just make 'em wait
But the groupie boys, I can't tolerate
I hate it so much, I'ma start givin' stitches
To the niggaz that's starin' like bitches
'Cause I'm not a fairy, a mary or a faggot
Gimme the eye, I'll fly, and tag it
Now you see? jockin ain't healthy
Cause you think that I'm young and I'm wealthy?
With juice, so I see you try to run behind
But I'ma tell you punk, you gets none of mine

You think all the girls around here are trickin' up there lookin' like Superchicken
At night I see your light through my bedroom window But I ain't got shit but the pad and pencil
I can't wait till I hear you say ""I'm going down, mayday, mayday."" I'm gonna clown
Cause every time that the pigs have got me y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi
Military force, but we don't want ya standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher
""So fly like an eagle."" But don't follow us wherever we go
The shit that I'm saying, make it's heard Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird
""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird""
""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird""
Now... My homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex
And let me try the four next Now the four I was driving was hotter than July
Looked up and didn't see it whippin' in the sky Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom
""Calling all cars, I think we've got em."" I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood
I think I drove through every single hood South Central, Compton and Watts
Long Beach, bust a U, here come the cops Wish I had a genie with about three wishes
Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious You know that I'm running
Shit, I hear it humming Fuck, I see it coming
Is it a bird? Yup Is it a plane? No
I hit me a right on El Segundo Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala
Let's see if they would folla me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another
Met me a baby pitbull and his mother Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window
I wish it was my ten-four had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third
'Cause I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird
""Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back
On. Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115
Miles an hour, with the police chasing him. Ehm, they're not gonna be
Real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh...
Ehrr, they hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse.""
Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't wanna see him could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?
See, I didn't want to bank you but don't make me bank you, thank you
Tried to get yo the hood, and you might guess that a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle Saying, ""Fuck, where did he go?""
I bust me a left from Rubellon. Park The 735 and I'm bailin'
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man, She helped me run like Harriet Tubman
Looked out the window by the black bed I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face I close the blinds 'cause I didn't wanna catch a case
All that night, I heard the bird circle while I was eating fish and watching Urkel
She said I could sleep on the couch By two A.M. I was digging her out
Fuck the ghetto bird
""Which way is he going now?"" ""Ok, now... now he's... he's actually southbound... on a service street...
And, uh... Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure
Out which service street he suddenly turned off on. Uh, the sheriffs are... are... well I know that...
Sheriffs ground units got thrown off""

Niggas used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy,
Pass the hennessy it gives me energy,
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at I clear the whole pack,
Talkin' shit 'cause I'm down for my set I'm a vet
Smokin' on a wet cigarette
(Who these niggas think they are)
(Wishin' on a ghetto star I represent my tar)
I start bustin' and they scatter like water bugs
'Cause these westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothin' can save us from sportin' Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors,
('Cause sometimes I feel like a nut don't give a fuck when I open ya up)
Hot rocks fly from the back seat, and
Busta ass niggas run like a track meet
An if you crawl in the middle bleed mo' than a little (what)
Killer king is the hospital
Feelin' numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit black mothers have fits I don't give a shit
Fool I'm a vet you can bet that
I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there
(Foe life) I'm still there
My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning takin' out the trash
Feelin' like a loser alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the peddles the other on the handle bars (what)
Tryin' be ghetto stars they said:
Are you from the westside is it so?
I said hell yeah and who wanta to know (me)
In slow mo fo' fo' slugs face down in the mud
Puddle full of blood left for dead
The pain starts to spread now I can't feel my legs
I meet doctor who at King Drew medical center
As I enter I.C.U.
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to
Now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holdin' this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
But my dick don't work it don't even hurt (damn)
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube
I be pissin' through a tube Fool I'm a vet
Fool I'm a vet you can bet that

Fuck a V-A they need G-A
Gang hospital for a crippal now I'm drinkin' rippal
Same corner same hood I'm still there
With bandanas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hoodrat hoes I'm fired
They mad 'cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody wanna put they dope on me
Sayin' I won't get searched by the LAPD
I'm sitting on a doorway duece five
Dependin on that to keep my ass alive
I don't got bows but my arm's about a one-six
My fuckin' legs, lookin' like tooth picks
Some times I can't deal got to beg the B G's to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch now I'm on the torch smokin' cocaine
Just to maintain nutin' to gain nutin' to lose
And last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom
Feelin' like a two year old you can't get a sip from the brew I hold
Nigga it's the only friend to a stranger AKA hadicap gangbanger
There's a lot in my life I regret becomin' a ghetto vet
Fool I'm a Vet

A queen treatin' niggas just like King Tut.
Gobbin' up nuts, sorta like a hummingbird,
Suckin' up the Lench Mob crew, and I'm comin' third.
Used to get straight-As, now she's just skippin' class.
Oh my, do I love to grip the hips and ass.
Only 17, with a lot of practice on black boys' jimmys and white boy's cactus.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, but I gotta be brief:
A lotta niggas like bustin' nuts in her teeth.
Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic,
That don't mean shit, 'cause she's givin' up the ass quick.
Quicker than you can say ""candy"", the bitch is on my Snicker... and oh man she
Can take on three men built like He-Men;
Her little-bitty twat got gallons of semen.
Fourteen niggas in line ready to bang your
Pride-and-joy, I mean daddy's little angel.
Tell the bitch to get her ass out the house,
'Cause your daughter's known for givin' up the nappy dugout.
Chorus, 2x: I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch remains,
I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!
Mister, mister, before you make me go,
I'm here to let you know your little girl is a hoe.
Nympho, nympho, boy is she bad; get her all alone and out come the kneepads.
I know she's a minor and it is illegal,
But the bitch is worse than vanessa del rio.
And if you decide to call rape, we got the little hooker on tape, now:
Tell the fuckin' slut to please hurry up,
And wear that dress that's tight on her butt,
So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed,
Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead.
Face turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles.
Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes.
You should hear how she sounds with a cock in her,
Boots get knocked from here to czechoslovakia.
Two on top, one on the bottom;
First nigga got the boots, man, you shoulda shot 'im.
'Cause after I got 'em it was over. now niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover.
On daddy's little girl.
She keeps nuts in her mouth like the bitch was a squirrel.
So tell sheryl to bring her ass home,
'Cause the line at my house is gettin' loooooooong, and...

Uh, gotta get it... uh... hmmm... get it, get it
--Baby--
(Verse one) {:21}
Stab through the neighborhood, these spinin'
Weez winin', scrap with the John Lennon
Head rests, TV's in 'em
Best in the nation, on this playstation
The Don Daata, gotta get you hotter
Been a buck naked nigga smokin' water
On a Friday, the get high day
Blowin' at a hot date, findin' Shade
Black and bicantay, with ass everwhere, how you do that there?
A sight to behold, break the mold
Just tryin' to get some before the world explode
I see you tryin' to get caught
Well shake what your mama gave ya, plus what you bought
We fuck and we fought, we laugh and we cry
Told the truth and we lie
You be good to me, I'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and I'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot
(Verse two) {1:15}
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--
You know you ain't right standin' at the light
Think it's chocolate with that shit too tight
And if I fuck around and get you in the car with me
Motherfuckers would think I had a star with me
Now see the haterism increase
They hate when you got a dime piece
And I got one shotgun, and I might catch a hot one
When I'm lookin' for love and niggas got none, uh
If you let me handcuff your wrist
Bonnie and Clyde ain't got shit on this
'Cause Bonnie and Clyde had to take a risk
But most of my money see it's all legit --baby--
It's all about your state of mind
Now what would you do if I handed you a tech nine?
Are you feelin' me?
Would you stay down like Hillary?
Even if you thought about killin' me?
You be good to me, I'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and I'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot
(Verse three) {2:19}
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--
Are you the type of girl that would call them folks
Have your man leave the house in chains and ropes
Don't need the kind of girl that'll have me in court
On lawsuits lyin' about demestic abuse
Have a bitch like Judge Judy cussin' me out
Garnish my cheques, reposses my lex
'Cause I come from a place in southern Californi
Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni
But fuck the world don't aks me for shit
Unless you my boo, and I'm fuckin' you
The rest of these broads ain't knowin'
That I'm a have you bumpin' Lauryn, in somethin' foreign
Come through blow the horn
Stick your wrists out the window
And wave to your kinfolks
Let 'em know who you with
And to your crazy ass daddy, let him know who to get
You be good to me, I'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and I'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--

Blade runner, in a beige hummer all summer

Picked up a ounce in shreveport

Uh, yeah
I hear a beat like this, and think about growin' up
House parties, with gangbangers showin up
Represent your hood, everybody throw it up
They say Cube get on the mic, nigga blow it up
I used to lyrical, political
But now you want it sugarcoated like cereal
First I met Dre, then I met Yella (yessir)
Dr. Dre made me rap acapella
Me and Jinx did a show at Dudo's {?}
With K-Dee, I think it was two shows
Then Dre introduced me to E
Cruisin down the street in his red Jeep
He said, yo niggas we should flip it like this
Cause them Boyz N the Hood like the gangsta shit
I put the pen to the pad, young nigga was raw
And told the world how we felt about the law
It was real
(Chorus 2X: samples + (Cube))
I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin' up in the hood)
Back down memory lane

Oh shit, it's B.W.!
Them niggas on tour and they comin' our way
Little one is still tucked away
In that trailer park, just bumpin our tape
Jerry Heller tried to make his escape
I had to bounce, while other niggas got raped
Same niggas turned around and said fuck me
No fuck you 'cause I'm down with Chuck D
And I'm 'bout to do a movie up, a classic
When I hit the screen, nigga it was magic
Never thought I'd see Eazy in a casket
Thanks for everythang, that's on everythang
I learned a lot of game from you
I like your son, he got his name from you
I tell him everythang that he need to know
If he ask my advice, I won't think twice homey

I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin' up in the hood)

From Boyz N the Hood, to XXX 2
Everybody wanna know my next move
Fans all around say ""We love you Cube!""
I wanna take time to say I love you too
I love all my fans 'cause they know I'm a man
And not a little boy or some fuckin' play toy
A lot of niggas say I grew up on you
And let me know if anybody fuck wit you
Cause you talk a lot of shit about the red, black and blue
And how they treat a nigga called Katrina, did you see her
White folks worry 'bout them fuckin' misdemeanor
While black people dyin' in that God damn arena
Just because I'm actin' nigga never stop rappin'
It's in my blood homey, I'ma keep the party crackin'
Money keep stackin till they put me in a casket
Who you think you fuckin' wit? Here's another classic

(Ice Cube, Verse 1)
I am the one, that you heard about, read about
I am the one, that had to take the ghetto route
I am the one, don't make me pull this ghetto out
I'm comin' straight from the cave who let him out
Crazy nigga thought he was gone, but he ain't gone
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home
When I hit the block, watch them scatter like roaches
So don't be fake, 'cause I know what a hoe is
Handle my business, no playin' 'cause I'm focused
You the definition of what a fuckin' joke is
When they see you comin', they play with your emotions
Fuck with my emotions and they find you in the oceans
Yeah I said oceans, yeah I mean plural
My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl
We'll fuck up your world, no boos to my drama
We'll include yo mama, if you fuck with my commas
I ain't tryin' to scary you
I ain't tryin' to hear you
I ain't tryin' to control that nigga in the mirror
I'll I'm tryin' to is bark before I fight
Before I take you down, might as well be polite
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be a hero, you nothin' but a zero
A nigga for the people, where ever they go we go
(Ice Cube, Verse 2)
Now when I roll through the hood, lil' kids watch my every move
Tryin' to be a good example, don't make me bury you
If you sit on my swagger, bitch take some carellflu
Don't underestimate the damage caused by a '22
Pop yo' ass right behind the ear within' hear
Nothin' like a firecracker, hits you like a linebacker
Don't forget the grind factor, I am a grinder
And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya
Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China?
Nothin' mothafucka just don't act like a vagina
You won't catch the rath of this hardcore rhymer
Now you got 55 niggas right behind ya
Now you wanna talk it out, but we don't negotiate
Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate
Straight from the west and we got to be respected
Here it's going down, here 'em runnin' for the exit
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come

Pace those to Euros, eatin' those green and great chips
Get 'em by the bag, you can say we Feedo Lay chips
I'm so hungry that I can eat these niggas faces
Beat the plastic surgeons givin' Hollywood a face lift
Off the grape shit, and I'm feelin' like I'm faceless
The Mob you ain't in, nigga don't say shit
You ain't nothin' to play with, nigga I beat the basics
Cock and spray shit, quick to leave a nigga faceless
Playin' Superman, we get a brave nigga sprayed quick
Niggas can't fade this, music for the ages
Because we get it in like Young Crush
She be payin' big fishin'
In the water bitch you in the deep end
Boy I pull you deep in, underneath the deep end
Nigga have you sinkin', when I hear you creepin', hear you sayin'

79,Higher,2007,In the Movies (2007),,Ice Cube,"Yo, I wanna get high
I wanna get high
Walking through campus with my backpack
Bailin' to orientation
So I can change the nation
See many faces but none of 'em mirror me
Show my ID to the punk ass security
Step on the quad, lookin' for the track squad
Walked by a bitch who think she's God
Passing me a flyer, talkin' 'bout the Messiah
She wanna take me higher
Keep your rhetoric in the heavens
Look and see a bro' with a fro like Michael Evans
Done spent 6 years in the college
Always telling me to question the knowledge
Sittin' in the black hole with the black stroll
And not even one cave bitch in our click
Sayin', fuck Professor Fitz
I come from the land of the Bloods and the Crips (What's up nigga)
Don't like scholarships because they hurt me
Nothin' but a slave to the university
That's why ya see me on the track field run by ya
Caught by a liar who wanna take me higher
Shit, he wanna take me higher
Wait until they get a load of me, shit shit
I wanna get high, so high
Chocolate Thai
I wanna take flight, ya goddamn right
It's a party every fucking night
Been there for about six weeks
Walked by the freaks
Look, black greeks
How the fuck ya figure
I dig ya me bein' from niggafied nigga
White boy in the room with me
Who never saw BET, what the fuck
He's about to erupt and turn red
Start hangin' with the muthafuckin' skinheads
'Cause he can't deal with the overkill
College ain't nothin' but niggerville
And he regret that his school is filled
With niggers, jews and wetbacks
Plus chinks, now he drinks
Hour after hour, screaming white power
Motherfucker want me to call him sire
He wanna take me higher
Shit he wanna take me higher
Shit wait until they get a load of me
Shit shit shit
A girl gets date raped just like that
At a frat, now she chase the cat
Feminist saying women is God's gift
Do you need a lift, can I take a sniff
Do I sound sexist 'cause I'm chasin'
After Deja, she from Texas?
Down to kick the asses of the fascists
Who wanna put me in the oven and burn me to ashes
But I'm not burnin', the world keeps turnin'
And nobody learnin'
'Cause college is full of shit
Teachin' me to memorize nothin' but the lies
Chillin' at a rally for peace
The beast from white power up in the tower
With the M-1 gun and a scope on dope
Thinkin' he's the great white hope
Motherfucker levels off
He wanna see me six feet deep shoveled off
'Cause Columbus University is nothing but a empire
Who wanna take me higher
Shit they wanna take me higher
Wait until they get a load of me
Shit they wanna take me higher
They wanna take me higher
Unh damn, they wanna take me higher
Damn, wait until they get a load of me
Damn, unh, they wanna take me, they wanna take me
Them muthafuckas'll never break me, shit"

Black nigga draped in gold, with a nine milla
Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary mail
Love the way these niggaz smell, keep comin' back, can't you tell?
Love to see my mama cry, love to see my babies struggle
Love to see my woman juggle nuts 'cause she got to hustle
I don't give a fuck how my life go
Now I'm a slave man to this caveman without geico
Everybody wanna call Michael a psycho
But he ain't never came through the hood with a rifle
Gunnin' niggaz down 'cause they don't got the right clothes
Hit the wrong person 'cause we shoot just like hoes

...If I can sell you the American dream, I can sell you anything
I got to get out, I'm getting put out of my house
I got to pack up, my refrigerator and couch
It's a set up, but the bank wants me out
Or the L.A.P.D. will smoke me out
This suggestible weight, it choke me out
They gave me a loan and I had no clout
They gave me a house, for me and my spouse
Call my momma and my aunt,
Y?all should re-finance,
I let them dance with the devil,
Dig their own grave and I gave them the shovel
Fuck, my daddy built that house
And when he got drunk he almost killed that house
Is this the American dream, or the American scheme?
That got me walking in these American streets?
Its kinda sad when you have to get a hernia,
'Cause you help your grand mama move her furniture
If I can sell you the American dream, I can sell you anything
Look at this maggot, with a stimulus package
I can give a fuck about a dow jones average
What the fuck you do when your paycheck is average?
Law abiding citizen turn into a savage,
Got to feed the children, got to feed the habit
Fell into a rabbit hole, chasing that rabbit
Now I'm in wonderland feeling like the Son of Sam
I'm at your west coast branch, gun in hand
Imma feel like superman,
Walk by the teller, better call the trooper, man
It's the revenge of the lambs:
""Big bad wolf, we're sick of these scams""
Sick of these plans, sick of this dance
Walk into his office took the nin out my pants
You're not a man, you're a servant
Then I pray to God nigga nine get to workin?
I never get the working
You know I heard they hood robbin?, your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
I never get the working
You know I heard they hood robbin?, your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
Uh, drug dealer envy
Doctor feel good, give you what you need
In California, prescribe that plead
Oxy cotton and codiene
Turn your grand mama into a fiend
And see the sign [?]
I know you bout to die, but let me see your ID
I know you bout to lie, but can you pay this fee?
If you can't pay, then please have a seat
You can't see a doctor but you could see a priest
We can't save your life until we get some insurance
Your premium is paid, add that insurance
I hope you got endurance,
They got me on hold and I'm under the influence
Nurse high as a kite,
In charge with my life,
And everything is lost,
Without a blue cross
You know I haerd they hood robbin?, your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
You know I heard they hood robbin?, your money or your life and there ain't no stopping

83,Horny Lil' Devil,1991,Death Certificate (1991),,Ice Cube,"You are the prince of darkness
Arch enemy, father of evil
Hell born, demonic, savage, fierce, viscious, wild
Tameless, barbaric, uncontrollabe, obstinate beast
Verse One:
Horny little devil, you gotta back up
Horny little devil, you can't bust a nut
Lookin' at my girlfriend's black skin
You wanna jump in, but she don't like white men
So don't throw that work you fuckin' jerk
Or get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker
She ain't with the pale face
Cause y'all fuck at a snail's pace
And you might get sprayed with mace
By the ebony
So when she's doing her job you better let her be
Don't try to pinch the gluterus
Thinkin' that you about to knock out the uterus
'Cause she'll tell you to kiss her ass quick
And where I'm from, devils get their ass kicked
Mr. Sexual Harrasment
Asking for a blow while the answer is ""fuck no""
Looks like you wanna terminate
But that's when I go Psycho like Norman Bates
I wanna kill the devil for talkin' shit
'Cause he can't get a taste of the chocolate
African breast; cause white bitches got no butt and no chest
Black women have bodies like goddesses
Sorta like Venus, but put away your penis
Cause the devil is a savage motherfucker
That's why I'm lighter than the average brother
Cause you raped our women and we felt it
But it'll never happen again if I can help it (me neither)
Cause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet
So horny little devil, you better listen
Before your ass comes up missin'
And it's like that
Verse Two:
Now you wanna get me
Horny little must be a F-A-G
Tryin' to fuck me out my land and my manhood
Got broke eating Spam and canned goods
Locking down on my neighborhoods
Treat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand
But my ass is a virgin
You mignt have fucked the Indians
But you can't surgeon me
And when I'm on top I won't be fuckin' ya
I'd rather put a buck in ya
'Cause I hate the devil with a passion
And when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin
Dig a hole and throw his ass in
And I won't be happy till I'm down to my last ten
Get his fuckin' pitchfork
Tie him up, and then feed the bitch pork
Little devil wanna fuck me out my pay
But horny little devil true niggaz aren't gay
And you can't play with my Yo-Yo
And definitely can't play with me you fuckin' homo
'Cause we'll blow your head off
And turn that white sheet into a red cloth
Plus when they're all dead
I can quit that jheri juice and get a bald head
Then let it nap up
Go down to the corner store and beat the Jap up
Clean all the crap up
Out my city
Now the whole block look shitty
Put his dick on a wood block
Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop
Now who's the next to nut
Color Me Badd, but you can't sex me up
So don't even try to put a dick in a die
Because this is what why in 1991 I'ma get my gun
Put an end to the devil, so get a fucking shovel"

You and your family can have peace and tranquility.
Enjoy the refinement..""
""Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?""
""Hello, my name is Elaine --
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles""
How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin' a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove compartment
'Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin' but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin' alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive
""Hi this is Elaine again.
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles,
Or is somebody taking your things? Have you witnessed a drive-by?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again.""
""This is Los Angeles."" ""This is Los Angeles.""
Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
'Cause it ain't nuttin' but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
'Cause most niggaz get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
'Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe
And you won't survive in South Central
""Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin' like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
Punk motherfucker!""
And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill
Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin'
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God damnit!
Rule number three: don't get caught up
'Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a vice
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
'Cause South Central L.A., is one big yearn
Waitin' for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin' ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
'Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin' a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central
Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,
You tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out.
And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,
You know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke.
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit.
You'll sho' get got, just like that.
This ain't no joke motherfuckers.

""The army is the only way out for young, black
Teenagers.
We'll provide you with housing, we'll provide you
With education,
We'll provide you with everything you need to
Provide a life.
We'll help you to be the best soldier in the u.s.
Of a.""
""'Cause we do more before 7 a.m.
Than most niggers to their whole life time.""
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Verse one:
I wanna kill him, 'cause he tried to play me like a
Trick,
But you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck wit.
I got the a to the motherfucking k, and it's ready
To rip,
Slapped in my banana clip.
And I'm looking,
Is he in watts, oakland, philly or brooklyn?
It seems like he got the whole country behind him,
So it's sort of hard to find him.
But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth,
Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out.
'Cause the shit he did was un-called for,
Tried fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore.
And that shit ain't fly,
So now I'm setting up the ultimate drive-by.
And when you hear this shit,
It makes the world say damn, I wanna kill sam.
""Momma, some man at the front door""
""Uhm hi, I've got reasons to believe that someone
In this household
Has just turned eighteen, am I correct? ""
Verse two:
This is why I wanna kill the punk,
'Cause he tried to take a motherfucking chunk of
The funk.
He came to my house, I let 'em bail in,
'Cause he said he was down with the l.m.
He gave up a little dat,
Then turned around, and pulled out a gat.
I knew it was a caper,
I said: ""please don't kill my mother"", so he raped
Her.
Tied me up, took me outside,
And I was thrown in a big truck.
And it was packed like sardines,
Pull of niggers who fell for the same scheme.
Took us to a place and made us work,
All day and we couldn't have shit to say.
Broke up the families forever,
And to this day black folks can't stick together,
And it's odd, broke us down, made us pray to his
God.
And when I think about it,
It makes me say damn, I wanna kill sam.
Verse three:
Now in '91, he wanna tax me,
I remember the son of a bitch used to axe me.
And hang me by a rope till my neck snapped,
Now the sneaky motherfucker wants to ban rap.
And put me on the dirt or concrete,
But God can see through a white sheet
'Cause you're the devil in drag,
You can burn your cross while I burn your flag.
Try to give me the hiv,
So I can stop making babies like me.
And you're giving dope to my people chump,
Just wait till we get over that, huh.
'Cause your ass is grass 'cause I'm a blast,
Can't bury rap, like your buried jazz.
'Cause we stop being whores, stop doing floors,
So bitch you can fight your own wars.
So if you see a man in red, white and blue,
Getting chased by the lench mob crew.
It's a man who deserves to buckle,
I wanna kill sam 'cause he ain't my motherfucking
Uncle."

Kiss my ass or suck a d.i.c.-
K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me
I fucked that lady in the bed
I missed that pussy and I bust a spread
I tried it again in a thumping wagon
The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging
Tried it again and I failed to grasp
I missed that pussy and I bust my ass
Then I fucked this lady in the tree
The baby came out and said ""run-dmc""
(Ice cube)
I knew this girl who looked just like you
Light brown and a fly hair-do
I wanted to do her, screw her
So I stepped to her
On-key bitch had more ass than a donkey
I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over
Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over
Just call me the plumber at the end of the night
Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe
She didn't get offended it was splendid to me
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be
I guess I just wine her and dine her
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her
Waxing that ass like rain dance
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her
Took her to the comfort inn
Tucked her in
Pulled out the third leg pumped it in
She said will you call me
Yeah I'll call you a bitch or a hoe after I ball ya
Naw I'm just playin' but it's still the same

And why is it when a black man stands up to speak for his people, and all the people stand up to speak for their people, there's no problem with it?
What you saying?
He said black, he said juke.

But why is it when a black man stands up to speak for his people, you feel so threatened? And everybody's paranoid? And you talk about shot sigar gaytion?

America preaches integration and practices segregation!
This is the ONLY difference.
They don't practice what they PREACH!

Today was a good day
Hehe...
Left my homie's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryin' to do since the twelve grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
Felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my jimmy runs deep, so deep
So deep put her butt to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her butt off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for the murder
Two in the mornin got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a pimp""
Drunk as hell but no throwin' up
Half way home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I gotta say it was a good day"
99,It's a Man's World,1990,AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted (1990),,Ice Cube,"Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand
Cause after I do ya
Huh I never knew ya
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
Ice cube won't wait so give it up cow
After we do it you can go home now
I'm a brother with a big long...
(Yo-yo)
First of all let me tell you my name it's yo-yo
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no
Yo-yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
No, yo-yo's not a hoe or a whore
And if that's what you're here for
Exit through the door
There's more
To see of me but you're blind so
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0
(Ice cube)
Ay what up buttercupper miss yo-yo
I know you like to rap and like to flow so
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world
Stay down and play the playground you little girl
(Yo-yo)
What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping
'Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening
It never fails I'll always get respect
And you lose so take a rain check
(Ice cube)
Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon
(Yo-yo)
Well you're mistaken
It's not going that far
I make brothers like you play the back yard
You used to flow with the title but I took it
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it
(Ice cube)
Damn it look it
'Cause you're talking a lot of bull
(Yo-yo)
Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull
(Ice cube)
This is a man's world thank you very much
(Yo-yo)
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch
Break
(Ice cube)
Ah miss yo-yo so what gives
I hear females always talkin' about women's lib
Well get your own crib
And stay there
Instead of having more babies for the welfare
'Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger
The name is ice cube you know that I ain't the nigga
For you to look at when your hair get nappy
So take a piece of the pole and be happy
(Yo-yo)
Hell no because to me you're not a thriller
You come in the room with your three-inch killer
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown
I'm a put it like this my man
Without us your hand would be your best friend
So give us credit like you know you should
If I don't look good you don't look good
(Ice cube)
I doubt it baby 'cause we're still most dominant
(Yo-yo)
But you don't know how funky that I can get

This is a man's world thank you very much

Man women I put a lot of fear in em
'Cause I had it up to here with em
Drink a beer with em
No way 'cause I can only deal with 'em about an hour every day
Yeah if you know what I mean baby
(Yo-yo-)
Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe
If you was more of a man instead of faking it
Women deserve the credit when they're making it
(Ice cube)
Yeah so what's the problem
(Yo-yo)
Well I think we solved it
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it
(Ice cube)
Yeah I admit you can flow
(Yo-yo)
Well that's true

But you see I'm a pro with the bank too
(Yo-yo)
Yeah I can see you got it good

Oh that I know

But you see you're not better than yo-yo
The brand-new intelligent black lady

You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me

That people are poor
Can't get enough to fucking eat or live their life

I wouldn't have shit to rap about
You know what I mean!
A'right, a'right, everybody back up, star status comin' through.
The man is in the building.
Don't touch him, don't look at him, and don't ask to take a picture.

With that attitude that it ain't nothin' badder
Now you can call me rapper
Or you can call me mister
Big money trapper, fuckin' with your sister
I'ma do it my way, from here to Zimbabwe
It's too hot today
Fuck what you got to say
Fuck if you mad at me, better go change your battery
Ain't gonn take my sunshine, like I hit the lottery
Ah, he's a show off, a hot head go off
Yeah don't make he mad
He might tear the fucking door off
Take all his cars, and don't try to fall
'Cause one of his people, might cut your fucking toe off

Everthin' I do, ends with you curious

Straight out of Compton, a crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
And I'm rollin' with the motherfuckin' Neptunes
When I'm caught off, I got a sawed-off
A midget bitch that'll suck a niggas balls off
You too girl if ya fuck with me
I'm gettin' head in the lane doin' sixty
About to crash like Teddy Pendergrass
Mama said a hard head make a tender ass
To all the dogs that bark a lot
Who don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
We'll be creepin' in the parking lot
Motherfuckers don't know if I can park or not
'Cause I circle like vultures, La Costa Nostra
Bumpin' all the baddest bitches like I'm 'posed to
What's yo name, what's yo number and ya culture
You need nuts in yo face like a poster
If you in a club nigga then shit bang
If you on the streets nigga then shit bang
If you on the block nigga then shit bang
And if it's what ya need boy, do ya thang
If ya in a Range Rov then shit bang
If you in that 600 then shit bang
If you on that Steel Horse then shit bang
But if it's what ya need boy, let it bang
(Ice Cube)
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
Fuckin' pig wanna act like he like me now
In 86 same bitch tried to lock me down
And motherfuckers wanna ask why I'm cocky now
To all the bitches that think they bootylicious
I think they nutritious, I think they do dishes
I'm makin' three wishes or takin' they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches
Egomaniac, lil' homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an asshole and it ain't a knack
So take a hit of that and remember that
Where my motherfuckin' niggas and my bitches at
In the late night hour hit the front to back
Check the motherfuckin' rims on the Cadillac
On the ass attack, can you keep it tight
And if the head right, nigga there every night

This might be a nigga last record
But respect it 'cause I could do it all night playa
I'm all fight playa, you all spite playa
It's all right playa, a nigga might care
But to catch me you gotta do a light year
Ice Cube insane in the membrane
Baby go ahead please do the damn thang
We gonna get chu' high nigga
Our rhymes will get chu' by nigga
Tell me if I qualify nigga
To bail in like SuperFly
I wanna get that, cop that, buy that, drive that
You want it too but don't know where to start at
Fuckin' with me, nigga better bring his hard hat
Nigga where ya heart at, leave ya on the tarmac
Where my top at and my nigga Mack
Ridin' shotgun, with the top gun
Don't catch a hot one soon as he spot one
Westside Connection is a doctrine
This ain't another club song
Or love song that y'all can fuck on

When I wanna do it, how I wanna do it
And you better hope I don't do it to you
Now, I don't care what you got to say
I don't care what they got to say
Nigga I'm grown
Let me tell you a little somethin' about me
I was born not to give a fuck, wanna drink, get your cup
Turn it up, throw it up, take the world, blow it up
Somebody slow it up, roll it up, smoke it up
My own can't keep me from loc'n up
One ear out the other, one man out to smother
The neighborhood, that left me here without my brother
You undercovers and you dirty muthafuckers
In the hood, that still fuck without rubbers
Club hop, bar hop, car shop, nail shop
To the mall, spend it all, why not
What bills, what rent, don't know what's spent
Why you care, do you work for the government?
Fuck it homey, I'm a laugh now and cry later
Get your paper we can laugh now and cry later
All you players you can laugh now and cry later
Investigators let you laugh now and cry later

See I'm a product of this urban decay
A nigga dyin' for tomorrow, but live for today
A nigga lie steal and borrow, and cheating's okay
Don't you tell these muthafuckers that my name is O'Shea
'Cause I'm a look up my baby's credit, let him regret it
7 months old he's already got a jail record
I'm the one to blame, put it in my mama name
She's not a drama queen, but I got the bling bling
I need the watch and the bracelet and the earrings
I need you all to show up at my hearings
Tell the judge I'm a nice guy, good guy
And I'm a play the sad face when he look nigga
Fuck it homey, I'm a laugh now and cry later
Get your paper we can laugh now and cry later

It's fucked-up, that y'all won't answer my calls
Tell mom, at least she can send some drawers
These walls, make y'all forget about me
I'm comin' home, in 2033
But that's irrelevant, did you get the mail I sent
What I tell a bitch, you better stay celibate
She start lyin' to me, tell me who she ain't fuckin'
Never tell me that my homeboys ain't nothin'
Bun in the oven, it belong to my cousin
Got the nerve, to tell me that you really love me
What?
I'm a get the ass when a nigga make parole
Hit her with my cane, cause a nigga gray and old
Fuck it homey, I'm a laugh now and cry later
Get your paper we can laugh now and cry later
All you players you can laugh now and cry later

Won't touch down till we're livin' like the Jetsons
Proud of yourself, because you done done it
Gotcha 22's and your name on your stomach
Think about a woman
Rather stand in line or bust the ass of a young buck
Got stuck, now you're bleedin'
Hospital ward, is got your reading
Learn about the knowledge of self ya see
That ya mad enough to go and stick the death to these
See, it ain't about bein' hard
But that's what'cha tell the little homies in the yard

And wish you could start all over again

Very bad, so I had to make the trip
And thank God, I didn't have the drips
I was there so a hoe couldn't gimme that
Just to get - twenty free jimmy hats
Now look who I see
Ain't that... yeah, that's the bitch from up the street!
With the big fat tail
Who always told Cube to go to hell
She thought she was wiser
Now she's sittin' in the waitin room, burnin like heat-mizer

To anybody who lived on the block
Now hoe, look what you got
BEND THAT BIG ASS OVER for the shot
Cause somebody is pipin hot
Drippin like a faucet, I'm glad I didn't toss it
Got you a college boy, who was worse than me
And he probably fucked the whole university
Still wanted him to dick you down, kick you down
With some bucks, now who got fucked?
With a nigga for the money he's earnin
But ask for some water bitch, and look who's burnin

And your pussy wouldn't be blowin' smoke signals
Man, this is gonna kill 'em
Guess who got a big fat dose of penicillin?
They'll ask, ""Who?"", and I tell 'em you
The new leader of the big booty crew
And after the day, I'm sorry to say
You come through the neighborhood, you couldn't give it away

And the trick thing about it
I don't know if we can win
And what's sad? I don't thing we WANNA win
Can you help me? a nigga need a job
I'm desperate, for some corn on the cob
I'm helpless, will I have to steal and rob?
No black? dinner so I got to ask bob
Bob got a job but it's done by a robot
No lunch breaks so it could do a whole lot
More than a human being and it's European,
Ran by a Korean, American,
So there I am, surrounded by aluminum
There's no way you can run,
There's no way you can be,
It's just and me, versus modern day machinery
It's man vs machine baby
My head's in the guillotine baby
It might take it off clean baby
Automated dreams it was man vs machine baby
I'm a fly caught in the web
A fish stuck in the internet
Don't they know I'm a deathly catch?
Eat this meat, every bite so full of stress
So what can I say to you?
I'm highly relatable and biodegradable
I thought we was unfadeable
Slaves to machinery, is that the way to go?
I don't need you to fuck 24/7
I guess that computer love
I don't need you to love
Human contact ain't what it used to was
It's man vs machine baby
My head's in the guillotine baby
It might take it off clean baby
Automated dreams it was man vs machine baby
The whole world is automated
It need to be investigated
When people are eliminated
What we supposed to do when its time to feed all the babies?"

So learn a quick lesson, about your smith and wesson.
Sit your ass back and comprehend,
As I let you know about man's best friend.
Now remember, it used to be a dog like lassie,
But now in '91 it's a gun if you ask me.
Just like a jimmy hat's used for protection,
I use my nine when suckers start to flex it.
'Cause if you run up and try to play mine,
I rather have a ak than a fucking k9.
'Cause if you shot your gun and my dog tries to fetch ya,
Me and the dog's going out on a stretcher.
And I ain't with that, so I gotta get that
Big black gat, aim and I hit that.
Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the (? ?),
Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend.

Here is the reason why ice cube's packed,
Just in case the little punks try to jack.
I can't put a motherfucking pitbull under a coat,
And a small on my back.
So I gotta take my beret off, and I betcha
It'll probably work a 100 percent better.
'Cause it'll keep me out of danger,
With sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber.
So this goes to all y'all intruders,
Beware of the owner, 'cause the owner is a shooter.
I don't just wanna give your ass rabies,
I rather have your ass pushing up daisies.
And I can't do that with benji,
Rin tin tin, or spotch mckinsey
Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the (? ?),
Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend.
""Just don't let me see you shoot no dogs""
""Hey, I got shots fired here, send me another unit""

117,Maniac in the Brainiac,2007,In the Movies (2007),,Ice Cube,"Intro: Cube
In every game, we gotta have the brains and the muscle
The game and the hustle... to be real on these streets
So here you have it, the Brainiac
<Female voice> Ice Cube
With the Maniac
<Female voice> Mack 10
Mack and Cube: Yay-y-yay! X2
Verse One
Ice Cube:
While y'all niggas think about the papé
I think about which Titanic I'mma sink
The iceberg, with the nice words
I slice verbs and predicets, ghetto etiquette
Y'all better get, this dime-mega shit
The Braniac, the theory be conspiracy
Keep my eye on the birdie, but never get my hands dirty
Verbally call the Maniac and his attack dogs
Signing contracts with automatic jack clause
Mack 10:
I get full of their shit and take flight on these niggas
'Bout to show these so-called
Wig-splitters and nigg-hitters
Who the man be, and what the number one clique is
Let my nuts hang on these busts
And hoes see how big my dick is
Maniac Mack 10 always keep the heat toted
And teflon tips keep the .44 loaded
Straight quoted in nine-trey, by the dime
Now we connected
He said, ""Mack, when you westsidin' and ridin' is expected""
So I...
Cube: Brainiac with Maniac, Mack 10!
Mack: You do the drivin', while I do the jackin'
Cube: Brainiac with Maniac, Mack 10!
Mack: My nigga if you plot it, best believe I got it
Mack: And it's on... feel the chrome
Ice Cube:
You in the Stargate, trying t'escape, it's not an option
Got torture techniques for them lies, don't ever lie
Just put the car in drive, we can go ride- get this money
Determined as the Energized Bunny, make a left
Underground parking, guns start sparkin'
ATF enemies all around start chargin'
Tryin' to fuck up my new suit and my weekend
Ask me what you want, you bitch! I ain't speakin'
Mack 10:
Shit, I gives a fuck what the next nigga think
(?) Gives a fuck how much bitch you say you ain't
It's like this on mine, potna
By all means, I got the ball
So it's your life, not mine nigga, so you make the call
Now, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the fuckin' fool
Or you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool
But know this: I won't hesitate to peel your wig back
I'm off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak
It's Mack the Maniac, nigga
Ice Cube:
What's the plan? Everything thought out
Everything bought out, like Bill Gates
My niggas love steel weights
I'm still great, after 12 muthafuckin' years
I (?) your ass after 12 muthafuckin' beers
I act kind to my peers and everybody that listen
They know when the Brainiac's missin'
The big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk
Got all the haters, claimin' that they wanna talk
Mack 10:
You argue wit 'em and negotiate, and I really wanna kill 'em
I'm tired of the bullshit, man I really wanna peel 'em
Dog, I knew they were scareless
'Cause my brother Snoop told us
So fuck the money and the dope that they punk-ass owe us
Now when I see 'em, it ain't no question it's all the way on
But I'mma wait in front of they momma house
For that one nigga to get home
And when I gun, watch his body jump
And it's all going to amaze me
To see his own self
Layin' there with his own brains on the pavement
Outro: Mack 10
And it's on... keep takin' till it's gone
And it's on... feel the wrath of the chrome
Wessiiide!
Ice Cube the Brainiac
Mack 10 the Maniac"
118,Mental Warfare (insert),2000,War & Peace Vol. 2: The Peace Disc (2000),,Ice Cube,"I love the sound of gangsta shit in the morning.
Bitch you know the size.
World muthafucking wide.
You ain't got to be in the pen to be in prison.
You in the prison of your muthafuckin' mind.
What kinda time we got up here?
3:30 AM.
Everything is real on this concrete and steel.
Everything is real on this concrete and steel.
The Warfare is Mental.
The Warfare is Mental.
Supreme gangsta shit.
We dream of gangsta shit.
Now I wanna see if you punk muthafuckers is paying attention.
I love the sound of gangsta shit in the morning."
119,My Skin Is My Sin,1994,Bootlegs & B-Sides (1994),,Ice Cube,"Motherfucker, you'd better break yourself...
(Ice cube)
My skin is my sin, look at my complexion
Section 8, erection great
Balls like ru paul and a big fat plank
Get you higher than a spike lee joint
See I'm a chicken hawk and I'm hunting chicken and watermelon
It ain't nothing but hard time bailing
Just got a misdomener
'Cause I got a deuce-five, and I'm black as sarafina
Get the hell out somolia, we didn't call y'all
I can't wait till I can kill all y'all
Fuck reggie denton and jimmy (johnny) cochran
Damn I couldn't get close enough to sock him
I plead guilty your honor
'Cause I dissed the pope more times than sinead o'connor
Huh huh, cool, like butthead and beavis
Truer than the mack but I'm downer than he is
And that police chief named willie
Can take his motherfucking ass back to philly
Dropped a bomb on a crew named ""move""
Years ago, here's a hoe
That's ready to stop me, they think I'm khadafi
Rolling in a six-tre jalopy
They want to give me ten in the pen 'cause I'm smelling like hen
My skin is my sin
My s-k-i-n is my s-i-n (""burning our black skin"") (repeat 2x)
(Ice cube)
I get around like tupac, just bought a new glock
And I want what you got
So please give it up so I can live it up
Just like the rich but I still eat grits
I don't know karate
But I can still beat the dog shit out of nazis
You claim you want to put in work
Plotting to blow up a church
See you devils are all the same
You'll gun down a congregation in Jesus' name
Using me as a scapegoat, well cracker don't sleep
Far from a goat, more like a black sheep
Lamb of god, and it's odd
That allah is a man that don't need a tan
And you can't stand when I talk like that
And why do black men have to walk like that?
'Cause we swing low like a chariot
And now I got harriet all on my dick
Cause my shoe size is much bigger than a motherfucking 10
My skin is my sin
My s-k-i-n is my s-i-n (""burning our black skin"") (repeat 2x)
(W.c.)
Who's that janky-ass nigga with last?
Standing like a g pissing on America's flag
Dub c, the nigga from westside
Westide maad circle bailing with a double barrel
Cause uh, my skin is my sin
And all I need is knowledge of self and ammunition is my best friend
When it's time to roll nigga, we ain't calling on Jesus
I'm calling mad dog for the 9 millimeters
'Cause I give the song with those peckerwoods to the fullest
And a bitch by the name of America's on it
The same bitch that jacked my forefathers
And the indians took my motherfucking religion
Place a holy Bible in my hand, but for what?
Like jim kelly said, ""you try to set me up? "" shit...
I'm too slick for your lies in disguise
When will you devils open your eyes and realize?
Like pepsi, niggas got a new generation
And we don't want your American education
Ain't no brain washing this way
Fuck America, tom meztger, and kkk
And to the cracker named j.b. stoner
Don't let me catch you on no corners
I see you on TV talking more shit
But just like your punk-ass anscestors, you's a bitch
You's a bitch if I ever saw one
Grand wizard bring your ass on imperial so we can get physical
And watch God show and prove
Not only mentally but physically the black man rules
So run devil run, you's to best start running
Because the niggas are coming, oh, the niggas are coming
And ain't no way you gon' win
'Cause I come from a tribe of o.g.'s and my skin is my sin
My s-k-i-n is my s-i-n (""burning our black skin"") (repeat 2x)"

This is the final boarding call for flight 1259
Departing from Los Angeles, final destination to St. Louis
Thank you
(Ice Cube)
Damn G, the spot's gettin' hot
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?
Police looking at niggaz through a microscope
In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope
They trying to stop it
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?
Catch a flight to St. Louis
That's cool, cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers
Rented a car at Wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grabbed the 3.80
'Cause where we staying, niggaz look shady
But they can't fade South Central
'Cause busting a cap is fundamental
Peeping out every block close
Seeing which one will clock the most
Yeah, this is the one, no doubt
Bust a U Bone, and let's clear these niggaz out
""Hey! Hey man! Whassup nigga?
This is Lynch Mob nigga"" (tires squeal)
Now clearing them out meant casualties
Still had the L.A. mentality
Bust a cap, and outta there in a hurry
Wouldn't you know, a drive-by in Missouri
Them fools got popped
Took their corner next day, set up shop
And it's better than slanging in the Valley
Triple the profit making more than I did in Cali
Breaking up rocks like Barney Rubble
'Cause them mark-ass niggaz don't want trouble
And we ain't on edge when we do work
Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
Getting bitches and they can't stand a
1991 Tony Montana
Now the shit's like a war - Gang violence
Where it was never seen before
Punks run when the gats bust
4 jheri curled niggaz kicking up dust
And some of them are even looking up to us
Wearing our colors and talking that gang Fuck,
Giving up much much love
Dying for a street that they never heard of
But other motherfuckers want to stand strong
So you know the phrase, ""once again it's on...""
(TV Newscaster)
At the top of the news tonight:
A gang from South Central Los Angeles, which are known for their drive-by shootings,
Have migrated into east St. Louis leaving 3 dead and 2 others injured. No arrests have
Been made. Police say this is a nation-wide trend, with similar incidents occurring in
Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma.
(Female voice repeating in background:
""If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere"")
BOOM, my homie got shot he's a goner black
St. Louis niggaz want they corner back
Shooting in snowy weather
It's illegal business, niggaz still can't stick together
Fuckin' police got the 411
That L.A. ain't all, surf and sun
But we ain't thinking 'bout them boys
Feudin, like the Hatfields and McCoys
Now the shit's gettin' tricky
'Cause now they looking for tha colorz and the Dickies
Damn, the spot's getting hot from the platter
I'm about to pack up and start slinging in Seattle
But the NARCs, raid about six in the morning
Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin
Put his Glock to my chest as I paused
Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers
Tryin' to give me, fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender ain't givin' a fuck
The fool must be sparkin
Talkin' about a double life plea bargain
You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G
Plus the Black Guerilla family
And the white pride don't like Northside
And it's a riot if any more niggaz die
No parole or probation
Now this is a young man's Summer Vacation
No chance for rehabilitation
'Cause look at the muthafucking years that I'm facing
I'mma end it like this 'cause you know what's up
My life is fucked
""Police eat a dick, straight up""

Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nutsac
I'm in a murderous mindsate
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck, buck, lights out
'Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggaz get hauled off
(Ha ha, barrel one)
Touches your motherfuckin' flesh

Shoots your fuckin' heart out your chest

Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head

Decapitatin', I ain't hesitatin'
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver

I touch you with a 44 mag
And your frozen inside a body bag

Cap peeler

Terror illistrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma

When I open you up
'Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
'Cause I'm givin' dirt naps
Comin' with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep
'Cause ever time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin' nose
Ain't seen the sun in 66 days

Migraine
Headache

We the worsest, all purpose
You want murderers?
Well you Serve us, hattin' motherfuckers with curb dust
You heard us, don't shit make us nervous
Not even when these fuckin' feds try to serve us
Mention me, when you write it in your history
As a nigger with the key to the mystery
Grand motta ain word don't mean shit to me
Who gives a fuck what they think, and what they see
Live how I got to live
Give what I got to give
Teach my kids positive, as well as the negative
Hope to raise better kids
The world needs a seditive, pray to god that we let him live

Survive, and 95 'I'll get you paradise
So I tried, nigga had to swallow his pride
But look into my eyes, I'm too wise to cook fries
Twelveth grade graduation, summer vacation
Mama said get the facin' on them applications
Didn't know back then, I was too young
Public school made me dumb as a motherfucker
What should I do in my life
Reverend Price, do you got some advice
Before I roll the dice
A nigga don't wanna shoot craps, 'cause it ain't all fun and games
When you tryin' to get that money mang
Gangbang, maintain or slang cane
TV got a nigga where he can't use his brain
What the fuck you talkin' bout, choose or loose
Bitch I don't know the motherfuckin' rules! (for real)

'Cause you and I got to do, for you and i
Acktin' wild as a jevenile
Now my whole life depends on the outcome of a trial
Wait-pow! these people ain't playin' now
Got to bring 85 percent of the time now
Fuck that, rather roll with the ruff pack
In the jet black, listenin' to ruff rap
See it's quite simple, you bitches ass niggas don't know
What I've been through, the weather's presidential
The warfare's mental, I sell my soul to the lord
For the perfect instrumental
And the number two pencil
And all the hussle found in chromasones of my kinfolk
--'Cause you bad guy!-- I'm the nigga of the century
--The diamond scruff!-- All you niggas better mention me
--Me that's who!-- It ain't no mystery
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me
--You better mention me!-- I'm the nigga of the century
--O - K A Y!-- All you niggas better mention me
--Me that's who!-- It ain't no mystery
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me
--Yeah, ok ok ok ok, call loko take it easy mang, choo got it!
Choo leave it the fuckin' illest nigga to fuckin' shit you!
Dess no problem withs that! gawn'na fuck dat!

Joo know dis motherfucker, O - K A Y ?!
It's over! that's it, die!
Bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!--

And many motherfuckers criticize rappers and what they say
Even though they criticize, secretly they fantasize
But they know they'll never paid be to play
Yeah
I'mma kill one of you young punks
With a old school flow
Though I walk through the shadow of death
I gotta make sure that my shoes and my outfit fresh
You bitches get jealous when you see me coming
Y'all would too if you see my woman
Y'all know what we 'bout to do
This shit here 'bout as sick as the flu
Drunk motherfuckers wanna vomit on my shoe
Niggas can't have shit prolly 'cause of you
Rappers go to jail like Oprah go to Yale
Steffan policy, don't ask, don't tell
Where my water-bees as I go get the mail?
Half black is the new black, can't you tell?
It was blue-black like Wesley Snipes in new jack
Now you got to have a white mama just to do that
Tiger Woods, he used to be a safe nigga
Go ahead and let your daughter have a date with him
He'll make with her prolly in a wife-beater
Tiger 'bout to change his name to cheater
I don't like it when you call me Big Poppa
From South Central and I hate helicopters
If we at school, I'll break in your locker
See me with a water bottle mixed with some vodka
Drink responsibly or drink constantly
Be who you wanna be in this economy
Drunk as Sean Connery at the finery
Can't throw me out, motherfucker, I'm the honoree
Trust me, I'll never be the nominee
I don't kiss enough ass, I'm too honery
Ice Cube, be where the piranhas be
Swimmin' upstream, eatin' all kinda meat
West Coast treat it like hyenas
Take what you want from these lying ass cheaters
Eat the fuck out these big cat beavers
That's how we act when you don't wanna feed us
Crazy motherfucker ever since I was a fetus
Might as well join us, you ain't gonna beat us
Please believe us, you can ask Jesus
I'mma be here 'bout as long as Regis
Understand, I never pledge of allegiance
See this ball of confusion might cause a conclusion, boy
I see you're cruising for a bruising
Fucking with a principal that don't like students
Don't you know that tension is a lynching?
And if I fail to mention then I'm spinning out my pension
(No)
The reason I home in
'Cause this right here ain't no country for young men
Sunny, you done fucked up the churches money
I'm red fox and you that big dummy
This junkyard was a empire
Y'all let it get overran by vampires
Most MCs is God damn liars
Like them supervisors working up McGisors?
Bitch, I'm not a dodger I'm a Laker punk
You's a fucking clipper, you can call me Jack the Ripper, cut you up
By your gizzard then down by your liver
Rooter by the tooter, gut you like flipper
Dipper y'all better treat me like the skipper
Head trigga, the air nigga
Air honkey and air critter
I come thourhg and kill every litter

First you was down with the AK,
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Lookin' like straight bozos?
I saw it comin', that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all muthaphukkaz moved ""Straight outta Compton""
Livin' with the whitez:
One big house, and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo,
Dropped four Niggaz, now I'm makin' all the dough
White man just rulin'
The Niggaz With Attitude -- who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggaz just phony
I put that on my mama and my ""Dead Homiez""
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losin'
Aiyo Dre, stick to producin'
Callin' me Arnold, but you Benedict
Eazy E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company,
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me
Tryin' to sound like AmeriKKKa's Most?
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flown,
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B,

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're gettin' fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick is smellin' like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to ""Let a ho be a ho""
So I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked
Now let's play ""big-bank-take-little-bank""
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause ""the broomstick"" fit your ass so perfect
""Cut my hair"" and I'll cut them balls,
'Cause I heard you're, like, givin' up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella,
Gettin' money out your ass, like a muthaphukkin' Ready Teller
Givin' up the dollar bills,
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say,
'Cause he's goin' out like Kunta Kinte,
But I got a whip for ya Toby;
Used to be my homie,
Now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer,
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga, gotta run and hide!
Yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren,
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfuckin' joke, they let you on the scene
To back up the Verse Team
It ain't my fault one nigga got smart,
And they rippin' your asshole apart
By takin' your green
Oh yeah --- the Villain does get fucked with no vaseline
(Refrain scratched)
I never have dinner with the President---
I never have dinner with the President---
I never have dinner with the President,
And when I see your ass again, I'll be blasting it
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella ---
Fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me,
Eazy-E would be hangin' from a tree
With no Vaseline ---
Just a match, and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on...
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation,
Off the Massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga! What you thinkin' bout?!
Get rid of that Devil real simple:
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the ""Niggaz4Life"" crew
With a white Jew tellin' you what to do
Pullin' wools with your scams;
Now I gotta play the ""Silence of the Lambs""
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but ""I'd rather fuck you""

I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable

Her brother walked in he's into gangbangin
'Cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""

In search of the rich blocks, to lick spots, and kick rocks
From shattered glass, down the pig locks
Want tips by the clock you niggas scramblin for fouyan
And settle for crumbs and croutans
I'm out for armored bucks and armored trucks, with armed killas
Bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos
Ain't no harmin me, the army full honary niggas you can't see
So while you pace bitches and saturns livin' jenky
I hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankey

Sit back and mine stack it multiply

Please listen to my demo {x8}
A nigga told me, the record company's the pimp
The artist is the hoe, The stage is the corner
And the audience is the trip, god damn
(Verse one) {:21}
Incredible young nigga, you can't believe I'm just one nigga
God damn I've gotten bigger
Intellect superior,
Walk in a room and make the whole interior, inferior
If you look me in my eyes
You might fuck around and loose control of your mind body and your soul
Grab ahold
Undisputed on the microphone, what choo think
If you wink, I'll make you ich think
Did you blink, did you ever drink your own brain matter
Shotgun enima, this ain't no cinema
All praises due to the creator
--For this man here, that can't no nigga stand near--
True, inventor of the double-you
What choo wanna do, I got the red and the blue
Show me one nigga dedicated to raps
I'll show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps
Record company death traps settin' decoys
Just to pimp young b-boys
With a cup full of yak, studio contact
Maniac with a contract
Well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble
About to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level
Bullshit points, plus he want to rub it in
And take all my publishin', god damn
Do I take it up the rectum
Just to rock the spectrum
Give up a right arm, just to do a form
Hell no, all you motherfukers goan leave this bitch limpin'
No more, record company pimpin'
No more (No more), record company pimpin'
No more (No more), record company pimpin'
No more (No more), record company pimpin'

(Verse two) {2:01}
I'ma keep it simple, it went from ""please listen to my demo""
To ""get your ass out my limo""
Stretch presidential
It's essential 'cause the record company will have your ass in a rental
If you let 'em, You have to behead 'em
Contracts you never read 'em
CEO's you never met 'em
Sent to an atourney, Burnstein and Burney
Nigga that's his lawyer, ain't got nothin' for ya
Treat ya like they emloy ya, I'm a warrior
Bite you in the ass like a Georgetown Hoya
When they ignore ya cause, you got to hold your balls
Catch a motherfucker slippin' in bathroom stalls
And then you show 'em that you ain't a rookie
Let 'em know that you'd rather have, more points than more pussy
Pimp turned bookie
Now how the fuck I get in so much debt
God damn, we just met
Welcome to the rap game
Motherfucker be confused and broke before he know what's happenin'
You can be the star and fuck women
I'ma just play the back and keep winnin'

No more No more No more No more

Now let's see how big did my balls get?
I brush my teeth - it takes a thief
Swervin, 'cause I'm tryin' to roll up the chronic leaf
At a stop sign, I take a hit and hold it on
I cough (*cough cough*) now I'm off
Drivin' down the two-lane highway
It's all bad, thinkin' bout shit I never had
Pass through the W.S. (neighbor-hood)
Knowin' I can do my best in Westwood
Cut off by a white BM, driven by a yuppie
He sticks up his finger like, ""Fuck me""
Now I gotta to follow him HOME, with my CHROME
Send him to the Twilight ZONE, it's ON
Niggaz say I'm gone 'cause I'm fuckin' with the rich
(Say what?) but they all full of bitch (yeah)
Don't need a snitch, so I'm rollin' solo
In a straight bucket, no it ain't a low-low
He pulls up to a seven bedroom, eight bath
Oh yeah! He's got to feel the wrath
Pistola to the neck, devil turn off the Westec (?)
And when you're rollin' have mo' respect (bitch)
Tied his ass up and took everything I could
A nigga straight robbin, mobbin, back to the hood

Fuck squabbin, 'cause I be +Robin+ like the Boy Wonder

Actin' like your ninety-five Coupe, is headed fo'
Beirut they wanna shoot me like a terrorist
But I don't give a F**K, 'cause I'm takin' care of this
Trigger finger got blisters
Heard from your sisters, you be rollin' on the twisters
Now when we meet, I can make your heart beat...
... And make you feel, so neat
Or you can get us fifteen
Twenties out the ATM, I'll take all of them (give 'em up)
I'm king of the Slim Jim, it's the incredible
Nine-oh-two-one-oh, is where I'm headed foe
Don't need no Merry Men, I fuck around and bury them
(POW!) if they told, what I stole (uh)
Motherfuckers got to know that I'm lethal
Steal from the rich, and slide it to my people
(Ice Cube)
I stalk, rich ass people like Hudson Hawk
Bitch don't talk, let's take a walk
Nigga got nuttin to lose, you know the rules
The purse and the jewels or the eleven o'clock news
Which one? Magnum gun to the titties
Makin' scared devils, move from my city
With the strong-arm, fuck the long arm of the law
Bitch count to ten and forget who you saw (hurry up)
Had to clock her with the handle, cause
Your husband's a thief with an S&L scandal
Don't feel bad if you're stuck up, ah
Nobody move, nobody get - shut the fuck up!
I'm nervous, quick to serve this
Heat in yo' meat, make your blood skeet
A nigga just tryin' to get on his feet
So hurry up rich bitch, before I twitch
She said, ""Don't rape me, and don't kill me""
Nigga don't want to fuck, yo' filthy ass
Just give me the cash and we good
All I wanna do is rob you on my way to the hood

Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night
I got a full tank of unleaded

I see you walkin' and I'm damn near stalkin'
You a chicken head and I'm chicken hawkin'
Now we talkin' 'bout your unlucky background
And how your ex-boyfriend is smokin' crack now
(Why?)
I'm very, very sympathetic
But, baby, where you headed?
I got a full tank of unleaded
She got in and had ass for days
Like boom, bam, God, damn
She ask me would I harm her
No, I'm a charmer
A fuckin' knight in shining armour
We went out and had a blast
Everytime she walked past
Nigga got a quick fast glimpse of that ass
(""What choo wanna do after this?"")
I wanna get your titties in my fist
But you wanna kiss
Your mouth might taste like dick (ewww)
And I grew up on bad Wic, trick
Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night
I got a full tank of unleaded
I got a full tank of unleaded
Niggas that I know don't kiss no hoes
Niggas that I know don't buy no clothes
Niggas that I know don't fuck no pros
Niggas that I know roll foots (?) in fros (yeah)
Pull them panties off your hips
Pussy deep as crypts
And 'bout as wide as my grip
Never ever get me with that wipper feel
They got a pants full of black steel
Am I too real?
You like dick I know you do
Wanna bring out the ho in you
I know what you're goin' through
You already think you're Creol
You should learn to suck this like Vanessa Del Rio
Aww, you thought I was a nice guy
But shit, I was around 8, but, bitch, it's gettin' late
If I wrap my dick in plastic
Now, how wide can that ass get?
It's gettin' drastic
Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night
I got a full tank of unleaded
I got a full tank of unleaded
Should of picked up an old girl that I know
That's what I get for fucking with you young hoes
About to get an attitude, what's hapenin'?
Baby, how you actin'?
Let's get it crackin' (c'mon)
No?
Well then, bitch, you got to go
I put her ass out, on Imperial
Ho slammed my door next to Texico
Kick my Lexo, broke my window
Put out my indo
Jumped out and said ""bitch, are you crazy?""
Fucked around and got lazy
She jumped in my car, took off, now I'm stuck
And all iI want to do was fuck
(Damn...)
I had to stroll all day, I had to walk all night

144,Rollin' Wit the Lench Mob,1990,AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted (1990),,Ice Cube,"You can't fuck with the criminal rapping over gangsta shit
First I load the clip and then I make the hit
I know some y'all can't fade this
Lench mob niggas are the craziest
So you and your boys are ass-out
When I'm rollin' in a seven-deuce glass house
The mob ain't nothing but a menace
When we get the motherfucking dog in us
Playing them old beats
I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies
Ready to peel your cap
You can't believe ""faces of death"" on wax
Some say the mob ain't positive
Man fuck that shit 'cause I gots to live
How I live and you could either give a fuck punk
Yo or get your ass bucked
Some rappers are heaven-sent
But self-destruction don't pay the fucking rent
So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job
I'd rather roll it wit the lench mob
To be down with the mob is simple
Mind your own you want a spot find your own
And take mine if you're badder than the strong man
I do the right thing I do the wrong thing
Do anything 'cause I ain't faking the scene
It's all about how much bacon you bring
And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it
Yo you ain't seen nothing
'Cause if you testify you're living blind
Cause in the city you live and let die
Rolling with the fools one time can't beat
On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet
He said ""i know you"" I said ""you might
My name is ice cube I did a song you didn't like""
So he soaked me up like bounty
Had to do a week in the county
A piece of cake it was just like a party
Cause in the county you know everybody
No I didn't kill or steal or rob
Locked up for what 'cause I'm rollin' wit the lench mob
If you know a female that's rollin' with the lench mob
Watch your step cause the gat is kept
In the purse like my homegirl yo-yo
You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no
'Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out
After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out
Get the picture or bitch
You'll get the eighty-six
If she wanna try and mix
Business and pleasure make up your own mind
You gotta be a hoe on your own time
Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep
Yo the mob is still deep
And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit
You thought you got with the crew you can't get with
So get the noose ready for the lynching
Now 235 is what I'm benching
But nowadays it's still not enough
I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush
Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job
Rolling with the motherfucking lench mob"

Fuck a ghost writer sittin' in the back
Of the studio, tryin' to write a nigga rap
It's the muppet show,
Most niggas need a&r (a&r) to tell them how to fuck a hoe
Ice Cube, true MC,
Write everything I say, even back in the day
I'm a spit it, how I feel it, fuck a gimmick
You can keep your catchy lines, I'm a 'bout to write a rhyme
If you got a backpack, tryin' to act black
Think you know the culture, you's a fuckin' vulture
You never a approached the mic
You dress like a dyke, sayin' what you don't like
Who deserves five mics, who deserves two
But the nigga wit two still can serve you
This West Coast flow is different in the East
But in ain't no different in the streets
I'm spittin' pollaseeds - I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one 'cause I don't want to be greedy
Cause the salt might make it so
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one 'cause I don't want to be greedy
Cause, these niggas is salty
Will make you choke oh oh

When you see him in the hood take it eazy
If you a breezeh, take him to the heezeh

Look like he drinkin' a henesee, and smoke every night

C'mon y'all
Stand tall, live your life to the limit
Cause haterism seem like a fucking epidemic
And look at Ice Cube, I ain't no gimmick
I'm straight from the hood, I got to represent it
Now - every day I think about my color
And all the crazy shit we do to one another
I ain't your blood brother, but I'm your 'cause brother
Let's take it back to the love and how it was brother
If not, we gon' pull these triggers
Show the world we deserve to be called niggaz
I make a fuck-up, like Don Imus
Bow on his knees, and call me yo' highness
You can too, you got the power to
Don't let this motherfuckin system devour you
I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowin' you
But check it out I understand what you goin' through
(Chorus: sung from samples)
But remember, brothers and sisters
You can still, stand, tall
Just be thankful...
For what you got
(Ice Cube)
I know what y'all motherfuckers thinking, heh heh
Here comes another rapper with a song about hope
All you wanna hear is a song about dope
And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope
But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap
No~! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note
Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes
And some of our people used to hang from trees
Now the only thing hangin' muh'fucker is DEEZ
So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right
Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke
I'm the sunlight, too bright to look
When it's all said and done I should write the book
You too cool for school, too old to know?
Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow
I understand, it ain't no love lost
But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus
(Ice Cube)
Yeah, f'real
I was born in the mud but I came out clean
That's till the government tried to intervene
Tried to lock me up when I was only 19
Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream
I make shit raw that piss off the law
If you want some fake shit turn this off
If you want some realness I know you can feel this
Maybe we can heal this just like an illness
Black on black, I got'cho back
People don't think that we know how to act
Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack
And the CIA, won't take it back
Never on top, always on the bottom
Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham
'Cause I can tell you now it's gon' turn out rotten
Keep on pushin, get 'em till we got 'em

Stand up, f'real...
Raise your hand if you sick of this bullshit

Give me the nappy and make me happy

On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?'

Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps
But hoes lickin' us like stamps
One fool brought the music for the yams
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch
'Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Give me the nappy and make me happy
The hoe said 'Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?'
I said yeah, but I don't play sex
When I'm putting on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night, no longer steady mobbin"

Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach
Only you can do it, Imma learn from it
Do what I gotta do, try not to plum it
America used to shoot like reptiles
Don't worry tomorrow, let's get this right now
They wanna run us in the ground
Educate yourself, before they dumb you down
Get your money boy, the legal way
Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may
Now rich white men they got the world fucked up
Why should I give a fuck about a Styrofoam Cup
Environmental saying, but if I go green
You know what I mean bitch

Sorry y'all, I had to fuck a super delicate
Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama
American dream, Ice Cube and yo mama

Too much knowledge kicked then you're lost
In a shuffle of feet, jinx the fiddler
And I control your mind like hitler
You bow and vow to authority
See now, a sucker with a style just boring me
So I show k.n.o.w.
L.e.d.g.e. it might trouble you
Then I transform like a decepticon
With a mic as a bomb
In my right palm
But I don't stay calm
So panic
Others can't flow so they go schizophrenic
You thought I dropped a dud in your face
Until you taste the blood of the bass
Then you faint, or better yet pass out
When I'm on the mic, believe it's ass out
You think you're raw so you draw
You lose, you're hung, you bite your tongue
The whole town saw in awe as you strangle
A noose on your neck, and you dangle
From side to side in the blazing heat
You're beat, you're dead, the fools fell off
You feel you're turning red, it's said
That your head burst
And this is only the first verse
Of the bomb
(Break)
Don't break up the fight let them rumble
Over the years I've watched some go super-bad quick
Now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach
Now ask yourself, who's stupid?
I take funky funky beats and I loop it
And pimp slap you in the face with the bass
And the boom from the bomb that I drop
Stop
You have a flat top as a fashion
I love black women with a passion
But when they gotta go and show their ass in
I gotta clown the hoes, yeah
You gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres
They'll steer you wrong
Ice cube's got it going on, hit me
For the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme
The system ain't wholesome
They want to put a young brother in folsom
And others see me on lockdown
But I come up foul then they get knocked out, word
To the brother that rolls the herb
Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that
Jinx got the gat, and it's a fact
He'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap
Now who's the mack?
Who's the hoe?
Who's the trick?
I got many, many styles won't you take a pick
But don't be alarmed
When I trip and stumble and fumble
And drop the (rewind)
Drop the bomb

I'm solo, you ask how I'm living
Still dropping more shit than a pigeon
With the l, the e, the n, the c, the h,
The m, the o, the b, the great
Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha
It's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers
And if you try to upset the pot son
You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun
I make the beats, I make the breaks
I make the rhymes that make you shake
Make you find
Ice cube never caught in the middle
I make shit to kick you in the ass a little
And still never hesitate to stutter step
Or bust a repitition on the mic
Still dissing all the hype
From left to right
How many left to fight?

It's the curse of money, once you get it, fool you got it
Buy a new pair of drawers and motherfuckers spot it
Niggas plotted, to have me knotted up in basements
Till these cocksuckers see what they're faced with
Their fantasies of a life stress-free
Full of orgies, in the Florida Keys
But this bullshit is so thick, it's like mountains
Sick of threatenin all my lawyers and accountants
The decibals, gold diggers goin' for the testicles
Soon they realise, I don't invest in hoes
Sometimes it's like hell on earth
When everybody tryin' to get your ass for all your worth

I just laugh, the curse everybody wanna have
Before you sell your soul better do the math
I start to scream shit like ""May day, may day""
'Cause motherfuckers think it's all grav-ay wit my pay day
And like I said, it's the curse of money
They start laughin' at your jokes when they ain't that funny (Ha ha ha)
See this ass kissin' yes man
Shakin hands with the left hand, get my weap-an, get to stepp-an
Fuck every phony ass nigga round me
Stick a shaft up your ass like Richie Roundtree (Yeah yeah!)

To relax I smoke a stick, the shit make me sick
Gotta gang of new homies, and relatives on my dick
No time for drama, busters get sprayed
Bitches wanna get laid, and everybody need their bills paid (Everybody)
Motherfuckers, sweat me like a spy
They wanna kick it 'cause I, got the curse of mulah
Make me wanna start scrappin and look at me to make it happen
What the fuck was they doin' before Mack 10 was rappin' ?!? Tell me
(What the fuck?) how can I remain a man of seven figures
When I'm rushed by gold diggers every time I get bigger? (Ch-ching)

And every time I'm seen it's like people start to fiend
It's the curse

And empty wallet, illegal paperwork, first 3 out of the 10.
And the single file on the bench, let's go
Open your mouths, count your tongue, bend your ears one at a time
Okay, bend your heads over, shake 'em out with your fingers
Hands above your head, hands up in front of you
Over
Move those fingers
Reach down and lift your nutsacks
Drop your nutsacks and get back you dick
Turn around
One foot at a time, pick up legal toes
Other foot.
Bend over grab your ass spread your cheeks and give me two big coughs."

Muthafuckin' devils, get straight racist
When they get you in them lonely dark places
Concrete slave ships, never move
Where niggas like us get used like a mule
Don't let 'em catch you, arrest you
Strip and undress you, throw you in a cesspool
You wanna know the crime of the century
A ghetto elementary, a mental penitentiary
Black man, you never been friend of me
Boy you kin to me, why we enemies?
The ghe-tto is a trap
Fuck where you from, nigga look where you at
Where you wanna be? Point it out on a map
Don't be scared to leave homey, we can come back
If you wanna come back to this bullshit
Most of it comin' straight out the pulpit
We got to change our ways in the hood

And it was hell tryin' to bail to the ovary
With nuttin but the Lord lookin' over me
I was white with a tail
But when I reached the finish line, young black male!
One cell made two, and two cells made fo'
And so on, so now I'm a embryo
Then I got a hunch
That I'ma be on lockdown, for nine months
Chillin', with my mother to guide me
And nuttin but a stomach to hide me
From all that worry and bullshit
Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick
Cause my time is up and I don't care
With one big push, I'm outta there
June 15th, it's just my luck
In 1969, a nigga is the product
""Ghetto ass nigga, you ain't shit,
And you ain't gon' never be shit!""
I learned how to walk and talk and all that
They put me in school, but it don't matter
'Cause I'm sittin' in history
Learnin 'bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me
They try to shape us
But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin rapist
So I stopped payin' attention
Ice Cube, headed, straight to detention
Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways
I'm sent home and I don't got all A's
A high school dropout
My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out
But I got tossed, he's the boss
I'm out of there and mad 'cause I lost
Now bein on my own is a factor
So I become, the neighborhood jacker
Gimme your car, run your jewels
Makin' a livin' robbin fools
And if I let my nine rang out
You know, it'll make your brains hang out
So what's your fate?
Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate?
The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled
I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red
And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck
Stuck up by the motherfuckin product
""Uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job
If you wanna stay in my motherfuckin house""
""Many young men reject the traditional values
That are important to their parents.
Church, school and family
Have been replaced by street, turf, and gang.""
Twenty-one now, and paid in full
Feelin' bad, from all the shit I pulled
On people back in the day
Plus, I got a little baby on the way
So I'm tryin' to go straight
I'm with my baby's momma, out on a date
Till the punk ass cops ran my plate
Now I'm on a bus upstate
""Oh, the young nigga done caught a case!""
""Sittin' in the mess hall, sayin' my grace"" -> LL Cool J
Sent to a concrete hoe-house
Where all the products go, no doubt
Yo momma, I gotta do eleven
Livin' in a five by seven
Dear baby, your man's gettin' worn out
Of seein young boys gettin' they assholes torn out
And then he got shanked with a spoon
And he was 'sposed to get out soon
Is it my fault, he was caught in production
Where a young black life means nothin'
Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar
You say I'm better off in the slammer
And it's drivin' me batty
Cause my little boy, is missin' daddy
I'm ashamed, but the fact is
I wish pops let me off on the mattress
Or should I just hang from the top bunk
But that's goin' out like a punk
My life is FUCKED!
But it ain't my fault, 'cause I'm the motherfuckin product
""He ain't shit"""

(Repeat 4X)
The world, belongs to me
Niggaz don't know my pedigree, W-S to the C
We be them hogs, that make it rain cats and dogs
We got the ""Bud"" just like them frogs
Now everybody on the West, show some love
And everybody on the East, respect the Corniche, it's not on lease
Breakin laws, swimmin through the water like Jaws
Gumby's pause, and take they drawers, no balls
God damnit, niggaz take my planet for granted I can't stand it
Catch a flight across the Atlantic
Step off the plane, nuttin but expense of the game
Bitch I'm rich you know my name, show me the cane
Now are you sure? One hundred percent pure
'Cause if it's not, believe me the shit gettin' hot
I got a plot to make your whole family deaf dumb and blind
(Tell 'em one more time) the world is mine
Chorus: Ice Cube
The world is mine nigga, back up
I gots to get mine before I act up
(Repeat 2X)
It's a quarter to eight, I'm not finished my plate
I got a phone call to make, my niggaz tell me it's fake
Oh what a mistake, here's what I want you to break
Tie his feet with some weight, throw his ass in a lake
And then set up a date, between me and his mate
Tell her lobster and steak, and bitch don't be late
Oh the pussy was great, I'm still sealin your fate
Cause you can't imitate, the nigga you love to hate
Can I grin, show my fin, I'm down with mack 10
Dub-C, K-Dee, and Kausion
It don't stop, niggaz get to bowin' a lot
When we enter the spot, look all the niggaz we got
Worldwide, nigga take a look outside
Got a brother named Clyde, he's like Jekyll and Hyde
Ice Cube is the lick, Westside is the click
(Can't get enough of this gangsta shit)
You wanna check our cajones we got the feds up on us
We gotta roll on Daytonas because we know that they want us
And if they catch us in rap, it's a reasonable doubt
My niggaz pointin me out, my momma scream and she shout
But we got enough green, from our triple beam
To hire the prosecution, and the dream team
This world ain't nuttin but a dollar sign (ching ching)
I'm a partner in crime, the world is mine
(Mack 10)
Yeah, you punk ass niggaz know the side, so check it
When you meet us, you better bring your heaters
Cause the only way you could beat us, is if you cheat us nigga

Where you from nigga?
Where you from nigga?

From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black

Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK
Caps gotta get pealed
Cause ""The Nigga Ya Love to hate"" still can ""Kill at Will""
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
And you can New Jack SWING on my nuts
Down wit the niggaz that I bail out
I'm platinum bitch and I didn't have to sell out
Fuck you Ice Cube, that's what the people say

It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from 12 stories up
Now let's see who'll drop
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man

Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin L.M.

Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Punks roll when I put in work

And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
South Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell
Hittin fools up with the big ass L

And hoes can't roll on
Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta ""Hold On""
Don't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
Goin' up against the Zulu
Break his spine like a jellyfish
Kick his ass till I'm smellin shit
Off wit the head, off wit the head I say
And watch the devil start kickin
Run around like a chicken, grand dragon finger lickin'
Yo, turn him over wit a spatula

All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard
The West coast warlord, and the future is today
Cause tomorrow - that shit never come
I worry 'bout today and this urban decay
I worry 'bout hip-hop, when did it flip-flop
Get whack, and turn into gridlock
I don't know is it a government plot?
I don't give a fuck whether you love it or not
That's all we got and if you throw it away
You dumb as OJ, off a for-tay
In your Izod, this the rap God
What'chu gon' put up, in your iPod?
Downloader, what'chu gon' do
When your favorite MC, got to sue you
'Cause he got to eat ain't nuttin taboo
Get your ass beat by Erykah Badu
Cause you wanna steal this good music
Put me out of business, now you lose it
(Chorus: sung with ad libs)
Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout
Tomorrow (that shit never come)
This is very hard to swallow
Keep your hand up on that throttle
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
(Ice Cube)
Tomorrow, I'ma handle my business
But today, I'ma drink this liquor
Cause tomorrow, I might be a little quicker
But today, I'm just the same old nigga
You know that shit is still a day away
Do yo' thang baby put your life on layaway
Cause everybody is Nostradamus
Boy don't you know that tomorrow ain't promised?
To all the lil' mamas
Don't do a nigga, like Isiah Thomas
If you a bitch, please be honest
Actin' like a hoe you're not an an-gel
While you're, daydreamin 'bout your future
Motherfucker come around the corner and shoot you
Don'tcha, get stuck in neutral
Put your shit in drive, while you still alive cause
Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout
Tomorrow (that shit never come)
This is very hard to swallow
Keep your hand up on that throttle
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
(Ice Cube)
Tomorrow~! That shit never come
I know it sounds strange but today is never done
I'm up in the Range when the clock strikes 1
While y'all countin' sheep, I'm countin' Benja-mons
Up on my feet at the break of the sun
President of the Gangster Na-tion
We don't go to war, we go to the store
We rob from the rich, and give to the poor
Hip-Hop, oh what a bore
Lettin college motherfuckers run the front door
(Fuck that!) Let's take it back to the streets
Don't let Viacom, dictate the heat
The nerve of them, I never heard of dem
Askin me about, my urban spins
And if I got about, a thousand of them
I'm a crate MC, accordin to them Fuck that!
(Chorus - repeat 2X)
Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout
Tomorrow (that shit never come)
This is very hard to swallow
Keep your hand up on that throttle
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow

Yes this negro is rather lethal
You about as lethal as a mojito
Be my amigo, eat my burrito
You're a fuckin' seagull up in Francisco
I'm up in a Regal, still in my pea coat
Murder's what she wrote, this is more evil
This is less than zero, don't be a hero
Nigga I'm a pharaoh, with double barrels
Goose bumps, hair rose, when I shoot these arrows
At your Camaro's, rollin' down Melrose
Still down with L coast, till the fuckin' cell close
Nigga don't test me, you're gonna fail those
Ain't should arrest me, blow like Dizzy Gillespie
I don't aim, where your vest be
Bang
(WC)
I'm too hot, to stop, walkin' up with two Glocks
Way more than two shots, that'll make your roof drop
House shoes, blue top, money like I move rocks
Dissin will get you socked, and yo' bitch move wop
Whole crew popped, by this old school new shot
G niggaz still keep my weed in a shoebox
Dippin rollin' through blocks, dippin while the crew pops
Eatin chicken dinners in my cutoffs and tube socks
Play my shit a lot of deejays they do not
Cause me and bitch niggaz don't mix like two cocks
Who knocks with them pocket rockets that'll shoot dots
Have your skull on the news lookin' like goulash
When they ask who the top don't mention us as foolish
Eat yo' ass up like a pack of barracudas
Put the barrel to ya, like we never knew ya
Send the metal through ya, Da Lench Mob shooters
(Maylay)
I know vatos and they get popped most
Niggaz that flip mo' chicken than Bosco's
Squattin down the block low, hop in that hot fo'
And I can spot Poles when they not in cop clothes
Squabble with the combos, Maylay got those
Crates or case, boxloads like they came from Costco's
They be poppin' bottles, we knockin' hollows
Promise by tomorrow I can have the spot closed
Talkin' pronto, somethin' like a lotto
Chips and cheese fuck meat, nigga these nachos
Speakin' on guap' though, cause that's a combo
Keep my green on the side like it was cilantro
Comin' with the honchos, that's in a stock Rolls
And everythang up out they mouth is like the gospel
It won't stop flow oh I'm not though
Lench Mob, big swanger, don't bang is the motto

Punk-ass mark, bitch-made
Punk-ass trick in a basket
You got caught up in the mix...
It's the nigga ya love to hate with a new song
So what really goes on
Nothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch
They hate to see a young nigga rich
But I refuse to switch even though
'Cause I can't move to the snow
Cause soon as y'all get some dough
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
Moving out your neighborhood
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good
Little kids jumping on me
But you, you wanna be white and corny
Living way out
""Nigger go home"" spray-painted on your house
Trying to be white or a jew
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
Get the hell out
Stop being an uncle tom, you little sell-out
House nigga scum
Give something back to the place where you made it from
Before you end up broke
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked
I ain't saying no names, you know who you are
You little punk, be true to the game
Break
Yeah, motherfucker
Yeah, you thought we forgot, huh?
Yeah, get a little money and moves out the neighborhood and shit
But you still ain't shit...
When you first start rhyming
It started off slow and then you start climbing
But it wasn't fast enough I guess
So you gave your other style a test
You was hardcore hip-hop
Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped
Giving our music away to the mainstream
Don't you know they ain't down with the team
They just sent they boss over
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
On mtv but they don't care
They'll have a new nigga next year
You out in the cold
No more white fans and no more soul
And you might have a heart attack
When you find out the black folks don't want you back
And you know what's worse?
You was just like the nigga in the first verse
Stop selling out your race
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
Niggas always gotta show they teeth
Now I'm a be brief
Be true to the game
Break
Yeah motherfucker
I see you got your fancy cars and shit
But you know what?
You still ain't shit
That's right, I caught you slipping
You know I could've gat you
Yeah, but I didn't even trip...
A message to the oreo cookie
Find a mirror and take a look, g
Do you like what you see?
But you're quick to point the finger at me
You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
Black man can't be no yuppie
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
You don't associate with the negroes
You wanna be just like jack
But jack is calling you a nigga behind your back
So back off genius
I don't need you to correct my broken English
You know that's right
You ain't white
So stop holding your ass tight
Cause you can't pass
So why you keep trying to pass?
With your black ass
Mister big
But in reality, you're shorter than a midge
You only got yourself to blame
Get a grip, oreo and be true to the game
And ice cube practices what he preaches
He continues to live in south central los angeles
And he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood...
Be true to the game!"

That r&b love triangle
If you're out there kicking it with the brothers
You don't care about lovers
You wanna hear a young nigga on the mic
Going buck wild
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles
That's where I'm coming from
Reality that's what they're running from
So if you're down with ice cube let me know that you know
Yo turn off the radio
You know what? you know what?
Basically those black guys and those rap guys
They don't know what the fuck they're doing
I hate those fuckers
I hate em
Especially that one guy
The amerikkka's most wanted
Ice cube--i hate that fucker
Get him off the air, get him off, get him off
Get that rap shit out of here!
Just get me a gat so I can smoke this motherfucker!"

And give a great big round of applause to

Ah shit

Or make a nigga rich, or somethin', BITCH
See I come from the place known as the South Park Zone
Talkin' shit ain't into clickin take your punk ass home
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll chuck
Hit you in the chest with a motherfuckin tec and watch you jump
So die motherfuckers die motherfuckers die
Look deep into the eyes of a killer smokin', fry
One nigga you can't fuck wit
'Cause I'm a born killer with the mind of a lunatic
So bring in bodybags when I start bangin'
'Cause I'm leavin' motherfuckers laid out, with they brains hangin'
Straight gettin' down for mine
And I'll fuck up a bitch, 'cause I don't mind dyin'
So feel me drill me, put a bullet in my head, but yo

Scarface goin' psycho, yeah
Play pussy get fucked and take two to your head
(Bushwick Bill)
I'm Bushwick Bill, but call me Chuckie
5th Ward hard bitch, play hero and buck me
'Cause I'm known to pull your skull out
Grip a motherfucker by his neck and gouge his fuckin' eyes out
I'm insane by a longshot, hey
Chuckwick Bill, a.k.a. Charles Libre
A short nigga with some lonnnnng nuts
Drop you dead in your bed now I'm ready for a long fuck
Necromance that ass for a minute
And split that motherfuckin click when I'm finished
You punk bitches be retreatin
Freddy and Jason runnin' home with their mouths bleedin
So welcome to the Slaughterhouse trance
5th Ward Texas Chuckie's Concentration Camp
You punk motherfuckers fled
And those who didn't make it got two to the fuckin' head
(Ice Cube)
Buck him down, buck him down, come again
Two to the chin, Ice Cube'll blast they ass till the end
With my pistol, runnin' from Da Lench Mob
Is How You Survive in South Central
Kick the instrumental, run and get your bigger crew
'Cause it's Judgment Day, and Ice Cube is Terminigga 2
Pow pow buck buck pow buck
Your name is Stucky Mack, now you realize that you're fucked
Two to the brain I leave a migraine
Have you coolin like a vegetable, but you're not edible
It's the incredible, buck your ass from head to toe
Audi 5000, don't wait for the Feds to show
'Cause they'll have me go up up the river
Where the white boys'll try to make a nigga
Walk, walk the plank, got the shank, hide the tape
Around the handle, gotta let 'em know what I stand for
In the chow line, now is the time
See the trustee, walk up from behind
Real quick shank shank, leave his ass red
Motherfucker dead, from two to the head
(Kool G Rap)
See where I come from the crime rate only rises
The murderers disguise in all ages shapes and sizes
Bitches picked up and dicked up, niggaz they gettin' stuck up
Give up what you got, or get your ass shut the fuck up
Run 'em down and gun 'em down yeah that's how we do it
Niggaz get killed, and then filled with embalmin fluid
Step to the niggaz that I'm checkin'
Pull out the tec and I reckon you'll get murdered in a second
Bang with the nine, boom with the pow
Motherfuckers are fallin' and crawlin on the ground
Snitches get stitches, bitches that act snotty
Inside the parties even the hotties get turned to bodies
Now I heard, they got other places that's similar
But I represent, New York you fuck around I'm killin' ya
A whole block of cops patrollin when I'm rollin'
And if my pockets are swollen you know somebody sick I've stolen
Yeah you niggaz get ripped, when my clip, goes in the
S-M-I-T-H W-E-Double-S-O-N
Or the reliable revolver
And like I said before, it's the motherfuckin problem solver
So bring it on nigga, get brave
It's plenty motherfuckers gettin' sent to early graves
'Cause when a nigga gets fed
Then all you motherfuckers get two to the fuckin' head"
183,U Ain't Gonna Take My Life,1994,Bootlegs & B-Sides (1994),,Ice Cube,"* Originally appeared as a B-side to Cube's ""Wicked"" single
Mr. Dirty Harry, you look really scary
With your .357, officer Kevin
Spent 11 years on the force trying to get mine
Head got the flat top, boots got the spit shine
Don't give a fuck about my neighborhood
Just wanna do your eight hours, then hit the showers
Shoot a brother down and you don't send flowers
Goddamn sherrif, can't wait to tarriff
A chunk of a nigga ass, but watch a nigga blast
And get away nigga fast
You ain't gonna have me face down no more
You ain't gonna have a chance to clown no more
To the boys in blue, I got kids too
Ain't going out like a jigaboo, no no no
On my way to the store
You see me in a Range Rover, now you gotta pull me over
But where oh where is the ticket?
You got your hand on your gun 'cause you're wicked
You don't like the face of the original man
But you gotta treat me like an individual man
Talk right and I'll talk right back
Show some goddamn respect to the black
'Cause I gotta get back to my wife
But I'm sorry, you ain't gonna take my life
Just because you got a badge
Did you think Ice Cube was gonna wave the white flag?
Cracker please, you can yell freeze
I'd rather die standing up than die on my knees
You think you can do anything you want to do
To my crew when you come through, man fuck you
Shooting up South Central
Catch your ass slipping at a rent show
Could have popped you off, one dead cop
But I know you got a wife and a dog named Spot
I show a little mercy 'cause I'm civilized
Looking through a nigga's eyes at a much bigger prize
But when I saw Rodney it got me so hot
Made me wanna go out and pop me a cop
Cause every time you see me sagging
Here comes the Grand Dragon, in the motherfucking patty wagon
Try to play me like a trick
Sometimes you act like a dick, Mr. Nightstick
Back then, I used to throw my Mack-10
But nowadays you got the black skin
Back then you don't like the voice of a nigga named Ice
But you ain't gonna take my life
You man let's get an understanding
I know that your job is demanding
But I only got me one life to live
You only got about six shots to give
And I got a big AK with a 50-round clip
So why should we trip?
You ain't gonna punk me, so what you trying for?
Ain't no job worth dying for, is it?
Might pay a visit to Petey Wheatstraw
When you stop me on the shore, officer of the law
And if I did something wrong, you can lock me up
Never never never gonna sock me up
So next time you have the urge, all of the sudden
To fuck with a nigga for nothing
Think about me, a brother that's 23
I got a son and a J-O-B
So before you pull your gun, you'd better think twice
Pig, cause you ain't gonna take my life"

Until We Rich
(Krayzie Bone)
Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle it don't stop, until we drop
(Ice Cube)
Krayzie Bone and Ice Cube...
The best thing in life in life is life (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Get your mind right, and get your grind right (we gotta keep goin')
[Krazyie] Hey young thugs (we gotta keep goin')
Get your mind right, and get your grind right
[Krazyie] Hey young thugs...
Get your mind right, and get your grind right
(Ice Cube)
Look into my eyes if you wanna know me
Before you hypnotized, homey what do you see
A figure that's just a little bigger than dealers
A hustler countin' figures ain't pulled no triggers
Can you dig us, we be the ultimate lick
We's the hitters, that make the ultimate hits
Kinda floss-ey, kinda boss-ey
It's gotta be done my way, do what the {fuck} I say
Top of the pyramid, homey what I tell you
If you leave this Westside umbrella you hit the cellar
Bring me my slippers, black robe, and my globe
And I could rule the world with my eyes closed
(With my eyes closed..)
(Chorus: Krayzie Bone)
See the mission's to get what we don't got
Until we filthy rich and on top --
-- You betta go get it, it's yours

To all the little homies that's watchin TV
I see you tryin' to be a O.G. like me
Chasin dreams, pullin mo' schemes for wealth
But the best thing in life is health, be yourself playa
Television it'll keep yo' ass wishin forever
You'll never get you life together
Don't talk about death, I got too much life to live
Too many orders to give -- what it is, showbiz
Taught you what a trick and a hoe is (WHAT?)
Showed you what a Six-ty Fo' is (WHAT?)
Lord knows, ""In God We Trust""
And everybody in the world wanna be like us (everybody)
(Ice Cube)
To the kids of the world that's waitin for wealth
Waitin for health, you better do for self
Homey that's yo' last cup
Forget about the fast buck; boy, get you ass up
People use yo' brain to gain
Do something that ain't never been done; and we can spend hun's
Wipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones
Throw away the guns, have nuttin but fun
And homey we could do that {shit}!
Police have a fit, when yo' paper's legit
We gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own
Send your baby to school and she'll come back grown
We got to talk to our grandma's
And she'll help us throught them dark halls, and them pitfalls
Everybody know we got the world to gain
We got to stop the pain, lord stop the rain
(Ice Cube)
Keep goin', little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin', little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin', little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

Google me bitch, wanna know what my name is
Don't even ask, stupid ass, am I famous?
Are you famous? My resume is heaven's way
Of tellin' y'all that God will make a way
I rock a motherfuckin' mic 'til the break of day
Darrell Dawkins flow, y'all need to make a breakaway
Microphone fiend with that guillotine killer team
You motherfuckers won't amount to a hill of beans
When I ride by, well over thirty five
Y'all still run and hide, scared of a drive-by

Your little ass is kind of churban and propane
Your little flame is like a flicker
And my bang is off the motherfuckin' Richter
I'm hard liquor, Cirrhosis of the liver
Black lung is what I deliver
That's what you get, if you ever try to smoke the nigga
Don't provoke a nigga, I'm from that urban community
Lookin' for some unity, fuckin' you and me
I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?
Nothin', I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?

186,Us,1991,Death Certificate (1991),,Ice Cube,"Could you tell me who released our animal instinct?
Got the white man sittin' there tickled pink.
Laughin' at us on the avenue
Bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew
We can't enjoy ourselves
Too busy jealous... of each other's wealth
Commin' up is just in me
But the black community is full of envy
Too much back-stabbin'
While I look up the street I see all the japs grabbin'
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood
Build a store, and sell their goods
To the county of sips (?)
You know us po niggas: nappy hair and big lips?
Four or five babies on your crotch
And you expect uncle sam to help us out?
We ain't nothin' but porchmonkeys
To the average bigot, redneck honky
You say comin' up is a must
But before we can come up, take a look at us
Verse two:
And all y'all dope-dealers...
Your as bad as the po-lice- cause ya kill us
You got rich when you started slangin' dope
But you ain't built us a supermarket
So when can spend our money with the blacks
Too busy buyin' gold an' caddilacs
That's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'
Exploitin' us like the caucasians did
For 400 years - I got 400 tears- for 400 peers
Died last year from gang-related crimes
That's why I got gang-related rhymes
But when I do a show ta kick some facts
Us blacks don't know how ta act
Sometimes I believe the hype, man
We're messin' up ourselves and blame the white man
But don't point the finger you jiggaboo
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you
Pretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice
No ice cube, just vannilla ice
And y'all sit and scream and 'cause
But there's no one ta blame- but us
Verse three:
Us ... will always sing the blues
'Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
But if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
""'Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'
Just like a beast
But I'm the first nigga ta holler out {peace, black man}
I beat my wife and children to a pulp
When I get drunk and smoke dope
Got a bad heart condition
Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's
Bet my money on the dice and the horses
Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces
Go to church but they tease us
Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus
They used to call me negro
After all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe
No respect and didn't know it
And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford
In jail 'cause I can't pay the mother
Held back in life because of my color
Now this is just a little summary
Of us, but y'all think it's dumb of me
To put a mirror to ya face, but trust
Nobody gives a fuck about..."

In the back, and it might cause a cardiac
Bitch act like he died and we brought him back
Him screamin for his mama and his sister pack

Better roll on 'fore we split your whole dome

Fuck around, I make your life unbearable
Make you live all scary and careful
Come through my neighborhood, you better tip-toe

Bow down butt-naked

""He has indicated to us that he has sufficient... firepower...
To... blow up the Bradley vehicle...
And in fact his words were,
'We are ready for war... let's get it on'""

War... ""War, and peace""
Sing it!
Chorus: singer interprets No Doubt's ""Don't Speak""
War and peace... (Sing it!)
War and peace, forever!
War and peace, together... always!
Verse One: Ice Cube
I'm at the highest peak, still glad the meak is understandin me
Artillery, thoughts of killin' me is just a fantasy
The man in me is ready for war, like Holyfield/Tyson IV
A gang against you niggaz on the shore
Either or, your whole family is on the floor
Windows breakin all around em, you can't climb this mountain
I'm at the fountain, with my troops
I start screamin at 'em like Patton, we gattin at you fools!
Verse Two: Ice Cube
Negotiate... strategy is the key!
I hope they ain't... exclusively after me!
'Cause if they are... we gots to be who we be!
And make a star... out of a head enemy!
The papers said... that he died tragically!
They found his head... with no legs and bo-dy!
We made a pledge... to the Dub-S-C!
Bloodshed... if they got no love for peace!
Sing it!
Verse Three: Ice Cube
I'd rather break bread than uh, break your head
Break your legs, have 'em broken, I ain't no joke
Don't provoke, the gun smoke from the highest slope
Eternal peace, for my peoples and my folks
My crips and my bloods, criminals and my thugs
Just show a nigga love when I'm rollin' on them dubs
Just, give a nigga hugs, we can ride on this piece
Westside for Life but still down with the East
Sing it!
After the haters attempt to blow up his car
We find our hero, Ice Cube, on the ground
Bruised, but not beaten
He pulls out his cell phone... WITH THE CHIP!
And begins to dial Mack One-Oh
Who's faded and rolling through Inglewood
With Mr. Short KHOP
Words... are spoken"

Brrr (we be clubbin') uh (uh) (we be clubbin' 2X)

Goddamn you fine (my nigga speak on it)
She got ass for days (put a week on it)
Now everybody in the world love to go clubbin'
And after the club it's either breakfast or fuckin'
Hope we ain't duckin' from haters in the parking lot
Who ain't got nothin' tryin' to prove sumthin
Frontin' we be the niggas who be bluntin'
On our way to the Marriott keep 'em very hot
Westside hittin' hairy cock all night long
Get ya club on!

[Cube] Make it rough!
(""We have sporadic fires, throughout the city of Los Angeles."")
Not guilty, the filthy, devils tried to kill me
When the news get to the hood the niggaz will be
Hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust
Kickin up dust is a must
I can't trust, a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a unicorn
Born, wicked, Laurence, Powell, foul
Cut his fuckin' throat and I smile
Go to Simi Valley and surely
Somebody knows the address of the jury
Pay a little visit, ""Who is it?"" (Oh it's Ice Cube)
""Can I talk to the grand wizard,"" then boom!
Make him eat the barrel, modern day feral
Now he's zipped up like leather tuscadero
Pretty soon we'll catch Sergeant Koon
Shoot him in the face, run up in him with a broom-
-Stick, prick, devils ain't shit
Introduce his ass to the AK-40 dick
Two days niggaz laid in the cut
To get some respect we had to tear this muthafucka up
{""Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!""}
[Cube] Make it rough
{""Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!""}
I gotta mac-10 for Officer Wind
Damn his devil ass need to be shipped back to Kansas
In a casket, crew cut faggot
Now he ain't nothin' but food for the maggots
Lunch, punch, Hawaiin, lyin'
Niggas ain't buyin, ya story, bore me
Tearin up shit with fire, shooters, looters
Now I got a laptop computer
I told you it would happened and you heard it, read it
But all you can call me was anti-semitic
Regret it? Nope, said it? Yep
Listen to my big black boots as I step
Niggaz had to break you off somethin', give Bush a push
But your National Guard ain't hard
You had to get Rodney to stop me, cause you know what?
We woulda to' this muthafucka up
{""Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!""}

[Cube] Ay Muggs, make it rough!
{""Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!""}
{""Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!""}
It's on, ""Gone With the Wind""
And I know white men can't dunk, now I'm stealin blunts
And a cake from Betty Crocker, Orville Reddenbacher
Don't fuck with the black-owned stores but hit the Foot Lockers
Steal, motherfuck Fire Marshall Bill
Oh what the hell, throw the cocktail, I smell smoke
Got the fuck out, Ice Cube lucked out
My nigga had his truck out, didn't get stuck out
In front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas
Oh Jesus, Western Surplus got the heaters
Meet us, so we can get the 9's and the what-nots
Got the Mossberg with the double eyed buckshot
Ready for Darryl, and like Beretta would say
Keep your eye on the barrel, a sparrow
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
But I'm rollin', so that's a fucked up slogan
The Hogan's, Heroes, spotted the guerilla
By the Sizzler, hittin up police killer
The super-duper nigga that'll buck
We had to tear this muthafucka up, so what the fuck!?!

Wessyde-fa-life-in-ya!
(""Throwin' up the W"" -- Ice Cube) 2X
Yeah, I'm with this, what we throwin' up?
(""Throwin' up the W"" -- Ice Cube)
All you busta ass niggaz out there
I got my motherfuckin homeboys in the house (""Throwin' up the W"")
My nigga Ice Cube (""Throwin' up the W""), Mack 10
Back to set the record straight for all these busta ass niggaz
Who trip, this how we do it nigga
Chorus: WC
Front back side to side
We be givin' it up, till the day we die
Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have ta erupt
So motherfucker West Up!
(Repeat 2X)
Verse One: WC
Nigga clear the lane, here I come, once again
With this, gangsta click, droppin' this, gangsta shit
Strictly for the riders who ride us I gotta WestSider
Rhymer for them niggaz that's sittin' on them Dayton wires
Pump the bass, hit the switch
Cause Ice Cube, Mack 10, and Dub-C, back up in this b-i-itch
Straight hoodsta for life, ain't no lookin' back
Ink in my flesh, WestSide tattered on my chest
Walkin' with the shadow of death
Through the land of the skanless, South Central Los Angeles
Home of the Crips and the Bloods
Where even the strongest niggaz is drug through the mud
And visitors from outta town best to stay in Hollywood
You get that tourist ass ganked strollin through my hood
West coast till the casket drop
I be throwin' it up, so motherfucker West Up!
Verse Two: Mack 10
It's gun ho Mack one-oh please you can't fuck wit deez
Ice Cubez and Dub-Ceez is my G'z
And hip-hop, top three niggaz the new bosses
Never slippin 'cause we flosses, packin Nina Rosses
Nigga, thought you knew how we do it
Ain't a Damn Thing Changed, always on them thangs
Forever and a day, so back up, gimme room, don't neglect
Just respect and everything I can't check I wreck
Now you can cross out the bustas and snitches
Shit only killers hootchie bitches and hot hydraulic switches allowed
On the turf where the real hogs dwell
Sewed up the hood, the fattest bolas on the block for sale
Inglewood City, the throne I call home
Niggaz be so bright, you might need your locs on
To bail through, it's fin you're in with Mack 10
And I gotta confess up, nigga this West Up! for life
Verse Three: Ice Cube
Now I got ta show you how the West coast rocks
No razor blades, in my mouth, just a glock
And I'm hittin you up, with that W-S
The sun, rises in the East, but it sets in the West
No gold teeth, you gets a wreath
So hand me the goodies, stockin mask, no hoodies
Christmas day, I'm in a tre
While some of you niggaz got the robe reindeer and a sleigh
We don't call it five-oh, we call it one time
It's my life my life my life my life, in the sunshine!
One nine weighs a ton
How the fuck you think that the West was won?
Now shit can be squashed over a forty ounce of backwash
No jokes, the land of locs and hundred spokes
In the East, we can be brothers
But when you come to L.A., watch your motherfuckin colors
West Up! nigga
Verse Four: WC
Give it up, give it up
Like the nigga James Brown, me and my niggaz are puttin' it down
So bustas be wary cause see we represent the city
Where niggaz caught slippin is left with they brains drippin
City of the Angels, more like a concrete jungle
Full of macks Cadillacs and crack sacks
I pledge allegiance to the shit till I die
[Mack 10] So let the five-twenty slide and put it down from the WestSide
WestSide!"
193,What Can I Do?,1993,Lethal Injection (1993),,Ice Cube,"Intro: [sampled announcer]
In any country, prison is where society sends it's failures
But in this country, society itself is failing.
Verse one:
Today, how you like me now, I'm in the mix?
It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota
Got the baking soda, let the water boil, workers all loyal
Dropped out the twelveth
'Cause my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees
Now I slang keys
Infest my hood with crack, 'cause I'm the mack
Take a nation of millions to hold me back
Too big for my britches, and I got bitches
Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches
Used to get 18 when my g was alive, now a key is 13 5
'89s the number, another summer
Police ain't get no dumber
Streets dried up, used to think it would last
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past
They tried to blast me for selling a boulder
Now I got my ass in minnesota
Got my own crew, it's on brand new
Damn what can I do?
Today...
What the fuck can I do?
Verse two:
Already done stack me half a mill ticket
Bought a house next to prince, so now I can kick it
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my benz
Goin' to see the twins, play at the dome
My at&t cell phone
I'm almost home
Gettin' excited, indited, spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest
And everything I own got repossessed
Now take a look at the dust
And I'm happy 'cause I only got 36 months
Never picked up a book
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look
Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew
And see, what can I do?
Today...
Verse three:
Fucked-up in the pen, now it's 94
Back in L.A., and I'm bailin' in the dough
Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch
So where to work at, and niggas smirk at
Me say ain't nuttin' poppin' from here to the L.D.
What you tell me?
No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe
'Cause, they sent in the troops
Even tho I got muscle, that ain't my hustle
Takin' niggas shit in a tussle
No skills to pay the bills
Takin' 'bout education to battle inflashion
No college degree, just a dumb ass g
Yeah you nigga
Who me?
I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess
Have you ever been convicted of a felony? yes
Took some advice from my uncle fester
All dressed up in polyester
Welcome to McDonalds may I please help you?
Shit, what can I do?
Today...
The white man has broke every law known to man to establish amerikkka.
But he'll put you in the state penitentary, he'll put you in the federal
Penitentary for breaking these same laws. now we gonna look and see if
This muthafucker is guilty for the laws he'll put you in jail for:
Drug using, drug selling, armed robbery, strong armed robbery, grand
Larceny, rape, racketering, conspiracy to commit murder, extortion,
Aggravated assault, mayhem, sodomy of the black man, trespassing,
Embezzelment, purgery, kidnapping, smuggling, grand theft, brandishing
A firearm, carrying a conceled weapon, breaking and entering, and

I'm never hitting four-trey no way
You wanna leave but come on hoe stay
Nigga see but that'll work
Poppa needs brand-new shoes and a sweatshirt
Fool you can't even fuck with that
And now that I'm winning I gots to get my gat
'Cause I see your homies starting to look
And broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks
And I'm feeling like a baller
Bucking fools now the circles getting smaller

But are you talkin' to me
I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet
If I should need the swine flesh
Your body is a mess, but you're blessed
With a father, son, spirit and the holy ghost
But my whole neighborhood is comatose
Lookin' for survival
The devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible
400 years gettin' our ass kicked
By so-called christians and catholics
But I watch 'em burn in a fire
See I'm a g, that's why I ain't in your choir
'Cause I see, 'cause I know
The church ain't nothin' but a fashion show
Get the devil to a 187
And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven
Verse Two:
You're waitin' for the devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
A beast in sheep's clothing
But I'm rollin' with that knowledge of self
Cause heaven ain't just wealth
So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe
Do I have to wait outside?
White man, please take another look
'Cause we couldn't be readin' out of the same book
Cause youse a crook and I'm a brother
King James had sex with his mother
Is that your edition? Is that your religion?
Black man, you gotta make a desicion
Cause God is comin' on day number seven
And he won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven
Verse Three:
The same white man that threw me in the slammer
He bombed the church in Alabama
So if I cock the hammer, God won't mind
If I have to kill the human swine
Cause God is a killer from the start
Why you think Noah had to build his ark
And God is a man from his feet to his hair
That's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer
I just stare at the church man
Spendin' more money on the church band
But Elijah's got a plan
Got the white man screamin': 'Damn that Farrakhan!'
Cause one day these babies are uprise
Much more than bowties and bean pies
Kickin' knowledge at 7-11

The devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible
400 years of gettin' our ass kicked
By so-called Christians and Catholics
But I'ma watch 'em burn in the fire
See I'm a G, that's why I ain't in your choir
'Cause I see, 'cause I know
The church ain't nuttin but a fashion show
Get the devil do a one-eighty-seven
And they won't, call me a nigga, when I get to heaven
{They won't call me a nigga}
{When I get to heaven}
{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}
You're waitin for the devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
A beast, in sheep's clothing
But I'm rollin', with that knowledge of self
Cause heaven, ain't just wealth
So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe
Do I have to wait outside?
White man, please take another look
'Cause we couldn't be readin out the same book
'Cause you'se a crook and I'm a brother
King James had sex with his mother
Is that yo' edition? Is that your religion?
Black man, you gotta make a desicion
Cause God is comin' on day number seven
And they won't, call me a nigga, when I get to heaven
{They won't call me a nigga}
{When I get to heaven}
{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}
{They won't call me a nigga}
{When I get to heaven}
{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}
The same white man that threw me in the slammer
He bombed the church in Alabama
So if I cock the hammer, God won't mind
If I have to kill the human swine
Cause God is a killer from the start
Why you think, Noah had to build his Ark?
And God is a man from his feet to his hair
That's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer
I just stare at the church man
Spendin mo' money on the church band
But Elijah's got a plan
Got the white man screamin - Damn that Farrakhan!
Cause one day these babies'll uprise
Much more than bow ties and bean pies
Kickin knowledge at the 7-11
And they won't, call me a nigga, when I get to heaven
{They won't call me a nigga}
{When I get to heaven}
{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}

Them motherfuckers shot but the punks missed
Ice cube is out-gunned, what is the outcome?
Will they do me like malcolm?
'Cause I bust styles, new styles, standing...
Strong... while, others run a hundred miles
But I never run, never will
Deal wit' the devil wit' my mother fucking steel - boom!
Media try to do me
But I was a boy-n-the-hood before the movie, yeah
Call me nigga, bigger than a spook
But you the one that voted for duke, motherfucker
White man is something I tried to study
But I got my hands bloody, yeah.
They say I can sing like a jaybird
But nigga don't say the j-word.
I thought they was bugging...
'Cause to us uncle sam is hitler without an oven
Burning our black skin
Buy my neighborhood - then push the crack in
Doing us wrong from the first day
And don't understand why a nigga got an ak.
Calling me an African-American
Like everything is fair again, shit
Devil you got to get the shit right I'm black
Blacker than a trillion midnights
""Don't believe the hype"" was said in 88 by the great chuck d
Now they're trying to fuck me ...
{Wit' no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline}
It's a great day for genocide
That's the day all the niggas died
They killed jfk in '63
So what the fuck you think they'll do to me?
But I'm the o.g. and I bust back, boom boom
Bust back, boom boom,
Peel a cap, boom boom!
Gimme room in the fire of the sun
Hear the mack come
Hear the black come
Watch jack run
Motherfuckers can't gank me
Fuck a devil, fuck a rebel, and a yankee
Overrun and put the presidency
After needin that, I'm down wit' o.p.p.
I met farrakhan and had dinner
And you ask if I'm a five-percenter, well...
No, but I go where the brothas go
Down with compton mosque, number 54
Made a little dough, still got a sister on my elbow
Did ice cube sell out? you say ""hell no!""
A black woman is my manager, not in the kitchen,
So could you please stop bitchin'?
Verse two:
{Gun shots}
You missed and didn't hit the lench mob either
[Guerillas in the mist] without jungle fever
But I got the fever for the flava of a cracker, not a pringle
Bust a single, here's my new jingle
The kkk has got three-piece suits
Using niggas like turkey shoots
My motto is ""treat 'em like a prostitute.""
If I say no violence devil, you won't respect mine,
Fuck the dumb shit and get my tek-9.
And if they approach us
A-ight, a-ight - I bury those cockroaches.
And if you can't deal wit' my ""kill at will""
Here's a new gift to get
Try my ""death certificate"".
Amerikkka's most, amerikkka's burnt - it's like toast
Like jordan I'm going coast to coast.
Dribbling the funk
Here comes the nigga wit' the mother fucking monster dunk
Get off me punk
{You better eat your wheaties}
Darryl gates got the studio surrounded
'Cause he don't like the niggas that I'm down wit'
Mother fucker wanna do us
'Cause I like nat, huey, malcolm, and louis.
Most got done by a black man's bullet
Give a trigga to a nigga and watch him pull it.
Negro assassin,
I'ma dig a ditch, bitch, and throw your ass in
When they shoot, no, it won't be a cracker
They use somebody much blacker
What I do?
I call up the geto boy crew
'Cause my mind's playing tricks on me too.
Never die, surround my crib
Makin' sure nobody creep when I sleep
Keep a 9 millimeter in my jeep - peep!
When I roll, I gots to roll deep.
Ain't going out cheap
Make the mad circle on cypress hill 'cause it's so steep.
They'll never get me
They'll never hit me
Mother fuck that shit j-dee.
Now I relax
Grab the st. ides brew so I can max.
Sitting on the window 'cause it's so fucking hot,
And then I heard a shot -
Boom."

The flyway. Hey bitch, you goin' my way?
Now I got a passenger
I look at the miniskirt, now I'm askin her
Would you like to hit the fat bud?
Or perhaps should I run your name through the mud?
I mean, are you giving up the nappy dugout?
She said no, well then get the fuck out
'Cause I know where the hoes be feinin'
Plus your bad ass got my six-deuce leanin'
Bust a u on the avenue.
Why oh why there ain't shit to do?
But then sir jinx played his mix
And you thought that beat played out in 86
Lookin' for my dogs
Looked up in the mirror being followed by the hogs
One time's on my motherfuckin line
Why the fuck the swine had to get behind a nigga like me?
They must thind I'm a G
They both walk up with the g. l. o. c.
(Freeze! there was a robbery and the guy looked just like you. now
Get out of the car with your hands up and legs spread.)
Started they investigation
No driver's liscence no registration
When I stepped out the car they slammed me.
Goddamn y'all who got the camera?
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just give me just one more hit
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just give me just one more hit
Who got the camera? [x2]
No lights no camera no action
And the pigs wouldn't believe that my slave name was Jackson
He said don't lie to me
I'm lookin' for john, matt, or spike lee
The muthafucker called for back up
I guess they planned to beat the mack up
He called me a silly ass thug
And pulled out his billy ass club
Tearin' up my coupe lookin' for the chronic
Goddamn nobody got a panasonic
Found an empty can of old gold
Came around and put my ass in a choke hold
Fucked around and broke my pager
Then they hit a nigga with the tazer
The big fat pigs were tryin' to hurt me
I fell to the floor and yelled lord have mercy
Then they hit me in the face y'all
But to them it ain't nuttin but a friendly game of base ball
Crowd stood around I said goddamn ya.
Who got the camera?
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just give me just one more hit
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just give me just one more hit
Who the fuck got the camera?
I knew when I saw that deputy smirkin'
That they was gonna put some work in
Mr. law had to hit me in the jaw
'Cause I called them faggots with guns and badges
They played rat-a-tat-tat on me head
But if I had the gatty-gat-gat they'd be dead
A victim of a big fat 187
And little devils don't go to heaven
Last night there was 11 but they weren't scarin me
So they tried the flashlight therapy
I looked at the black one and called him a traitor
I don't give a fuck if you got a beta
Just take my colored picture
So I can go downtown and bitch and pitch ya?
The one that called me a spook
His name is officer david duke
If the crowd weren't around they would've shot me
Tried to play me out like my name was rodney
Nowadays police gettin' badder
But if I had a camera the shit wouldn't matter.
Bitch who got my 9? Who got my 9?
Y'all done did it this time, uh.

Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?
Rolling in a fucked-up lincoln
Leaning to the side so it looks like he's sinking
Into that leopard interior
This nigga thinks every girl's inferior
To his tongue, get a dumb bitch sprung
As she's selling more butt
Don't even get a cut of the money
His name is sonny
And he know the play
And hope to od that he don't find a runaway
That's looking to become a star
He'll have your ass in and out of every car
With every on and rick, sucking every john's dick
Come short of the money, get your ass kicked
You don't like it but you still call him hunk
Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk
You wanna leave but sonny started talking fast
And it make you wanna go and sell more ass
He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack?
Who's the mack?
It is that fool that wanna pump the gas
Give you a sad story and you give him cash?
He starts macking and macking and you sucking
Quick to say I'm down on my luck
And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way
Then you see his sorry ass the next day
Are you the one getting played like a sucka?
Or do you say, ""get a job, motherfucker""?
Every day, the story gets better
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-assed sweater
He claims he wants to get something to eat
But every day you find yourself getting beat
He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways
'Cause he's in a daze
And almost get his ass hit for the crack
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack?
Who's the mack?
Is it that nigga in that club asking
Have you ever been in a hot tub?
I know the game so I watch it unfold
When I see the boy pinned to your earlobe
He's talking shit and you crack a smile
When he tell you that he can go buck wild
For a girl like you and make it feel good
You know it's drama but it sound real good
He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging
The pussy so he can keep bragging
He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me? ""
The pussy so he can keep bragging
You wanna do it but you feeling like a h-o-e
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over
'Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover
Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack?
Macking is the game and everybody's playing
And as long as you believe what they saying
Consider the a m.a.c.k. and with no delay
They are gonna get all the play
But when it comes to me, save the drama for your momma
It's ice cube and you know that I'm a
Mack in my own right
When it comes to rhyme and rap
'Cause all I do is kick facts
Unlike iceberg slimm
And all of them be claimin' be p.i.m.p.
No, I'm not going out that way
I'm just a straight up n I double g a
Next time you get over on a fool
And you did the shit like real smooth
Thank ice cube for giving up the facts

You wanna take the life God handed to me
Send it back to him, 'cause you ain't a fan to me
Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me

Man lets talk about it, maybe we can walk about it
But just don't be a coward
And take my life 'cause you got the power
Of the white man's gun powder
'Cause you might face a gun tower
And time never run out
They take the fun out, till your life run out
So don't pull the gun out
If you ever want a house, just like Run's house
It's better than a big house
Less four-five some woman we can dig out
Find a place we can pig out
Party all night, till the owner say 'get out'
Why you wanna murder me?

And the first and fifteenth is like christmas
Send me naked pictures but give it a rest
With mrs ice cube tatood on your breast
Now you at the back door of my show
Dressed like a hoe, axin' could you blow (no),
Hell no but it's still delicious
Went from rags to riches
And fuck all my x-bitches
Fuck you, fuck you, especially you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours
(Repeat)
Now I hear you sayin' ""yeah I used to fuck 'em""
Not lettin' 'em know I was a young buck then
Niggaz axin' me ""man, did you love her? ""
Loved her stupid ass enough to fuck her with a rubber (bitch)
Now I hear, I'm your big brother (who?)
Second cousin, friend
Bitch since when?
Incest ain't the way I swing (nah)
Never bought your ass a goddamn thing
That I had to pay for
I was hateful
Ungrateful (uh) and never faithful
Fuckin' everything that I could get my paws on
Walkin' through hell with gasoline draws on
Now I'm on the mic, music is my life
Kids and a wife, heard you was a dite (damn)
It's your thing if you like the switches
But it's my world and fuck all my x-bitches
(Ice cube talking)
Never go down the same road twice
Advice from the big homie ice cube
Hmm, girl you better get away from here
I don't want that shit no more
Na, na ahem, and don't be callin' at my mama' house neither
I'm through wit' you. I'm through wit' you

I ain't fuckin' wit' your daughter"

I know you like to see me doin' bad
But I'm doin' good, fuck the police that's rollin' through my neighborhood
Fuckin' peaker wood see me in the 5 speed
I don't care if his muthafuckin' eyes bleed ""Yeah yeah!""
This is my weed, this is my world
Don't get mad when you see them hundred spokes twirl
Candied out while you spit yo' last on the pearl
The Don Dada, I'm hotter than holly watta
I Wish I was your baby father 'cause I got a fuckin' head on my shoulder
And led in my holster, face on the poster
The kinda nigga that you wanna get close ta'
But you can't so you start the lyin'
Just like that nigga that think he dyin'
Get ta cryin' snitchin' and testifyin'
To all my people if I'm talkin' 'about your baby mama
When she meet Ice Cube tell her save the drama.
Yo Cube, I'm gon' have all the bitches here.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
Yo man fuck them bitches, they ain't call me back
'Cause I just paged my auntie.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
(Ice Cube)
Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell your auntie.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
Tell your cousin, tell your sister, if she want me.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
I'm a be as real as I can with this
Not just the fake analyst on canabis, who only say that the world is
Scandalist, without findin' out a way to handle this
Dismantle this, either with the rhyme or the fist.
How the fuck we get in the belly of this bitch?
I be rich if it wasn't for the snitch
Lyin' to the enemies, wild conspiracies
I'm a say this till the day that I die
7 35's bring on bitches lies
While you bullshitin' I'm hard hittin' like
2Pac, I keep spittin' till my heart stop
Young niggas tryin' to tell me that I'm played
Once they say you played, nigga you must be paid
Pushin' weight since the 10th grade do my thing
Got more plaques than Jordan got rings, nigga sayin'.
Yo Cube, I got the new Biz 9000.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
I got the Playstation in the windshield nigga!
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It---
Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell your auntie.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
Tell your cousin, tell your sister, if she want me.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
I hate to see your ass comin' ""Yep"" with your mouth runnin'
Talkin' 'about somethin' ""What?"" that ain't meanin' nothin'
'About your second cousin who be always buzzin'
Where she was or wasn't, who she now fuckin'
Stories by the dozen Punch you got the sequel ""What?""
To let you tell it Randy Moss is your people
It's evident, your ass lie like the president
But stretch marks on your mouth is the evidence [laugh]
How the fuck can your friends be the benjamins?! ""Punk""
And your little ass car's full of fender benz
There you go on the stand with your hand up ""lyin'""
Testifyin' about a man that's in handcuffs
We should do you like the Mack said
And if he lie like a crackhead pop 'em like a black head
Let him ooze, let him loose
Let him lie by his muthafuckin' ass on the news. ""Yeah yeah""
Yo Cube, check out this ring, 69 karots.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
It's Kryptonite nigga, Kryptonite!
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell your auntie.
--You Ain't Gotta Lie Ta Kick It--
Tell your cousin, tell your sister, if she want me.

What's the date and time it don't matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort
To make a long story short
Ran into this girl named Carla
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala
She said what's up yeah what's the deal
Check the hairdo of course it ain't real
Then I looked down she was fat in the front
I asked how long, well about seven months
Oh how time flies when you're having fun
She said yeah but the damage is done
Where you been, on a little vacation
Oh by the way congratulations
Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue
Then she said the lucky man is you
I dropped my brew
And everything looked fuzzy
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy
She said yeah remember that date
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said damn are you sure it's mine
'Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times
She said that day no I wasn't whoring
Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about giving up the money
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy
Naw 'cause then I'd really get faded
That's murder one cause it was premeditated
So what I'm a do
I don't have a clue
How many months left damn only two
I'm gettin' faded
No cigar, G
Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded
It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her
See the booty and the front was all in place
But the girl had the pitbull face
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid
Oh lord god forbid
My homies see me at the motel
Cause those fools would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept
And hold your big fat butt steady
Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing
That I'm a hate myself in the morning
I got drunk to help me forget
Yo another day another hit shit
I'm gettin' faded
Ay yo you know what time it is
Nine months later she's ready to drop the load
And everybody in the hood already knows
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me
You know Ice Cube can't be having that G
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger
JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up
I'm gettin' fed up bitch
'Cause I know you're tryin' to break me
But if I find out your tryin' to fake me
I'm a buff that duff for a hoot
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is getting kinda major
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver
Looking like my next-door neighbor
She said it was mine that was her best guess
But let's check the results of the blood test
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative
Damn why did I let her live?
After that I should've got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no I just told the hoe who laid me
Excuse me bitch it's a switch
You can't fade me
Naw baby not this way
Yo you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger
I don't fall for the okey-doke
And before I fall for the okey-doke
I let the pistol smoke
Now sing it
Yeah baby you can't fade me
Naw unfadable baby"

You don't wanna fuck wit these
You don't wanna fuck wit these
Run up you big-ass bitch and I'll have you clockin G's
Wit my knockout jab, mess around and stab
Yo' ass in the gut, I don't give a fuck
Down with the brown, clownin these honkies
That got us in the mix with they 666
Tricks get found, stinkin like tuna
Bailin through your hood in my fresh suede Pumas
And I don't hit gates, nigga pump yo' brakes
'Cause I ain't runnin', you better start gunnin
Take your hand off your metal
There's nowhere to hide, cause the world is a ghetto
Want my afro long like Mad Dawg
On a velvet poster, 40 on the coaster
Cause moms don't play that shit
Been hard on a nigga since (?) 8-8-6 (?)
Sayin' you need Jesus, 'cause I got the fresh sweatshirt
With the three fat, creases
And it's on like that, nigga where you at?
At a phone booth, I'm comin' in the Coupe
Beanie pull over, fool there they go
Drive real slow so we can let them hoes know
That G's even bust on L.A.P.D.'s
Make 'em eat cheese, 'cause they don't wanna fuck with these
And he don't wanna fuck wit these
I got mo' flavor than a hoe with a dick
And a stick of gum on her tongue, I get you sprung
With the psycho-alpha-disco, my fist go
In my pocket, grabbin on my pistol
But I won't pull it out till it's time to spit
Make the girls say, ""Damn, niggaz can't have shit""
'Cause I see Satan, waitin in the cut
For this black motherfucker, to bail out his hut
And I don't give a mad-ass fuck
About a sheriff who's tryin' to tear-off a (??)
My chinny chin chin hit him up with the right
And then I bend bend got his ass in my sight
My Chuck's hit the cement, then I bent the corner
Yellin', ""+Cop Killer+, and fuck Time-Warner""
Got the wick-a-tick (??) niggaz say, damn he's so sweet
Hypnotize yo' ass like that shit ""Knee Deep""
And you hate it, gang-affiliated
Niggaz be bumpin, just a little somethin'
From that loc'ed out nigga that cater to the O.G.'s
And let you know, that you don't wanna fuck wit these
And you don't wanna fuck wit these
And you don't wanna fuck wit these
Rollin' through the hood, when I see a bitch
I hit the switch, she's on my dick
Fresh t-shirt, thick like I hangs
They say I got St. Ide's rushin through my veins
From the CRASH units, all the way to Vice
They claimin Ice Cube, ain't nuttin nice
'Cause I keep hittin, fuck Bill Clinton
No repentin, just representin
I can walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun, 'cause I ain't the one
Bang you're dead, brains out your head
I wish I was the nigga that invented infrared
Now I got it poppin' but what's that odor?
Smells like a hot pot of that bakin soda
'Cause I know nigs from A's to Z's slangin ki's
Sayin' you don't wanna fuck wit these
Nigga please"
