0,2 Way Street,1999,The Art of Storytelling (1999),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Well I shot some there, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in west bubblef**k somewhere
Due to raps wider ratio, satellites to nato
Hillbilly draws flew on the stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately wife piece back in new york
And I'm starvin
Being human and open with
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scoping rick
Thought entered how to lean and bent it
Though I'm not gonna lie I was extremely tempted
(To what, rick?) to discharge in a sista
Next thing in the dressing room, ""pardon me, mister""
Yes, I said cautiously
""Crazy, but possibly
You could sign your name on the back of these dazy duke shorts for me""
Try to resist, now girlfriend startin' it
The pen won't write, ""you can press down hard on it"" -
Now my hand browsing her south end
Spun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when
Rring! - loosen the grip my hell had
My girl, she was talking so nice I felt bad
Being untrue, no telling what it might do to her
""I love you"", forced to say I love you back too to her
Any thought of getting pussy was doomed to:""you got a wife? ""
Anniversary comin' up soon too
Got off the phone, cock just got mute
Don't get me wrong it's not like you're not cute (uh-huh)
I'm wrong for mistreating her, the wanting to skeeting her
""I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya""
What an angel overcoming his wrongness
The moral I am trying to get across in this song is
If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid (say what?)
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid
Casually seating with some thick chords eating
With my album playing at a big board meeting
""I love this"", being the coolest and the ruffest
A big willie woman pulls the ruler in her office
And fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went
'Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment -
Pounding was inevitable
She said to me ""rick, I think your album is incredible""
The way the hon' upon i, comin' on a sun i
""You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye""
Well I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya
Means a lot to me, coming from a woman of your stature
I mean, who could resist the don head?
Start caressing rick private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull
Girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats the set me emperor
Put one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya
Fantastic, though I start to act drastic
When I see my wedding band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down, she felt that I tried to diss
I'm like, I can't do this as much as I'd like to miss
An angel overcoming his wrong, kids
The point that I am trying to get across in this song is
If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keep no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid (say what?)
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keep no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid"
1,A Love That's True (Part I),1994,Behind Bars (1994),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"So you get my point son
You just don't trust no bitch, you know what I'm sayin'?
""Okay, daddy, I understand""
Cause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin'?
""Okay, I get your point""
Anyway, listen to this, check it out
1994, as the world gets trifer
I'm wondering, the fuck I need a woman in my life for? (ya know)
'Cause it's like a nigga whole history
With you hoes been nothing but misery
First rater, five-one stood
Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good
Met her at the fever
""What's going on, stranger?""
And like a fool took her in and tried to change her
I don't who I thought I's bluffing
That BITCH wasn't giving up that coke for nothing
""Oh you trying to dis, mister bougeois nigga
Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too
That type shit you ain't admitting""
Because, homegirl, I grew out of it, you didn't
Anyway, dead out of order
Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her
Who gave you that?
""My ex""
I said ""Who?""
Believe she had the nerve to say ""You can wear it too""
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true
(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo
Scooby Doo doo
Then I met Sin,
Sweating the viking
A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like them
""What? Sweating you? Picture that, nerd. Please""
Anyway, the bitch had herpes! (you know)
Imagine me, the fool being the spouse
Doctor said I couldn't catch it unless I got aroused
Found out snooping in her bag what she got
Now why you ain't tell me? You worthless slut!
""Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to""
You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying
Anyway, stayed with the creep
One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep
""Chris, wait,"" the bum bitch said
So loud till a motherfucker fell out the bed
Who the hell is Chris? She putting up resistance
Until I caught her calling the nigga long distance
Had the nerve to dis patch loving
Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true
(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo
Oh gosh, Scooby Doo doo-ooh (doo-ooh)
Though happy I was free
The need for love was still in me
Got to the point where the need for it was killing me
Then I met short here, hanging with my cousin
Found out later how young the bitch was and
Though I done hit it and she opened up a world
And remind me of that song ""Go Away, Little Girl""
It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled
""That's because I had you pussy whipped royal""
You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?
You see the type of attitude the BUM BITCH carry?
Like oil and water, impossible mixture
Then temper tantrums came into the picture
Yelling (ah), carrying on bad and cursing
Complete embarrassment to The Ruler as a person
""Gimme shorts""
Ruler will not permit you
Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture
Flirts too, excuse me, a whore
Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour
So when I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true
(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo
Oh gosh, Scooby Doo doo
Ricky needs a love that's true-hoo-hoo"
2,Adults Only,1999,The Art of Storytelling (1999),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Check (5x)
Well, let us skip the boring foreplay I'm slidin' right in
This girl over my house who had to be about 19
Ass, hoes in my poster
She's sweatin' although she tried to hold her composure
I hoped she'd take it in the ass and suck dick
(Girl) my my what a nice apartment you got rick
On her knees about to make her fall
(Girl) ""all platinum and gold jammies hangin' on the wall too,
You got it goin' on""
Now my mouth start foamin'
The lights dim we're kissin' and my hands start roamin' in her drawers
(Girl) stop!
Knew she was joking
'Cause I ain't even fuck her and her pussy was soaking wet!
Already had her tit out
If I play my cards right, fuck her dead in the hole she shit out
(Girl) rick I gotta go my girls waitin'
She recaps finally when honey drawers down to her kneecaps
Breathed heavy all mushy bitch
Swore up and down I was gonna fuck her in the pussy
Since friends waitin' on subtle
Bout time to make a move upon the hungry little butthole
Meanwhile she acted quite passive
Lickin' the hun neck while she lotionin' that ass with jelly
Tit hung out the frame nigga loco
Surprised honey didn't put up too much of a struggle, at first
Sinkin' in she ain't know how to be the bitch went
(Girl) ah rick it hurts take it out of me!
Knocked my magazine down, bitch threw my papers
You wanna keep it down I mean I do have neighbors!
Squirmin' away although the table was barrin' her
Felt real good my dick was sunk so far in her
She said it felt like a bull dowser barrin her
Sqealin about she couldn't take it anymore in her
My cummed on her straight in the perm in her, (here)
As I drained every last drop of sperm in her (where)
So girls when we kiss and we cuddle, ain't no way to put it subtle
When I want the butt hole!
(Moaning in back round)
Another girl I met, her experience fast because
Most girls wit kids don't been hit in they ass before
Picked her up sunset
(Girl) don't be late for dinner, ma
Bringin' honey home from the date at the cinema
Thinkin' how to fuck the ass so plottin',
Blown in the elevator, hit the stop button
She smiled, by knowin' her butt I wanna bore
I said ""can I have a kiss now instead of in front of your front door""
(Kissing/sex in the back round) (uhhhmmm! oh yeah!)
Although the rule I tried not to push hard,
I'm all over the bitch like an octopus
Deep down I know she also wanna fuck
Though I kept my tongue in her mouth so not to put her on the spot
To have to talk no shit to prevent me from bonin'
Unzap the bra, when the hooker start moanin and
Expose my espresso suck on her and lick on her
Unbucklin' pullin' out mad long dick on her
Panties in the way of that, but I want to check it out
Slipped her wet drawers down her thigh and took her leg out
Her butt was juicy kinda fat,
Spun around start to stick her in the pussy from the back
She came, mad juice dripped out,
Still in the pussy then acted like it slipped out
Cum on the floor, she said ""pardon the puddle""
Spread open her cheeks, pushed hard in her butt hole
Uhhhmmm, wasn't a bad date at all, she went ah ah
Start pullin' at my balls while I'm still penetratin'
Felt fantastic, she said
(Girl) ""rick I'm not really into this ass kick""
Meanwhile rick cummin' by the gallon,
Put your hands on the wall please
And try an' keep your balance
Lickin' the grill in her, meanwhile fillin' her
Till sperm start pourin' out her butt hole while I'm still in her
Then start rammin' the pine in her
I almost picked her up with these final grinds in her
So girls when we kiss and we cuddle,
Ain't no way to put it subtle when I want the butthole!
(Moaning)
Girl: my ass, more, more, more!"
3,All Alone (No One To Be With),1994,Behind Bars (1994),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"As a youth, each Sunday, Dawn went to Church and
Paid her respects and not to mention was a virgin.
Kid pushed up, Dawn lettin' him
Since he made her laugh and all the other girls was sweatin' him.
Then things started to move without cause
And a couple o'months later kid's pushin' for the drawers.
Under pressure while exchangin' glances
Dawn finally gives in to the sexual advances.
Although it was a mad high cost for her
'Cause after the thrill was gone, so was the lust for her.
Eventually he left her for another.
Now feeling alone and betrayed by her lover
She cried--for no longer knew which way she headed.
Once dreamed of actually wearing white at her wedding
And really being pure, now she thought she'd die without.
Still she finds strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Without love...
Without love...
Without love...
Verse two of Dawn's life--the second segment.
What could be worse than to now find out you're pregnant?
Poor Dawn couldn't sleep--laid awake
Not ready for a child and plus her mother's gonna break.
As she doesn't know how she's gonna bring up the subject,
Consequences of being used as an object.
In church though time's runnin' thin
She decides to have the child because the doesn't want to sin.
Props to the girl although it hit hard times;
It was Hell finishin' school and working part-time.
Yet Dawn did it though her youth went to waste.
Little help from the government, she got her own place.
HARD for an indepentant woman and a kid
And as soon as she could get off the assistance, she did.
Without no man who she once thought she'd die without
Still she finds the strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Continue with her life without love...
While Dawn worked two jobs tryin' to meet ends,
Her son was busy cuttin' school and hangin' with his friends.
So when she got words she tried to slap out the taste in his mouth
And explain how important education is.
Under stress, she takes two Bufferin.
Son now tired of seein' his poor mother sufferin'.
Starts to sell drugs though the cops did a raid.
Guess who's in the mix, and being legal age
Could do time, please call her employer
To inform her that her son is gonna' need a lawyer.
Never no good news, just more strife.
Dawn barely havin' enough time to live her own life.
Here's the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'.
Now spends nine hours on the bus to go and see him.
Here's the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'.
Now spends nine hours on the bus to goa nd see him.
Without no man who she once thought she'd die without
Still she finds the strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Continues life without love..."

Mister slick rick let me take it for a second

Jacking for the money, backstab was my mission

Sticking niggas here and sticking niggas there

And in fact, the moment you fear, all of that, you quote snaps
Well in a cell, did the exercises and wrote raps
I be a bigger star than you, no never heard of the nigga
Takes my raps and read aloud, I want to murder the migga
Just kidding, no offend to it, finally he ended it
Case dismissed, but your honor, da kindly prevented it

Back in population, didn't matter that his friends tensed
The phone prints, the years added to the sentence
Still chilling and all of that and I escaped

Thank goodness, failed, call out next, he wail out
Here go the co, ricky walters, back up, bailed out

6,Bond,1991,The Ruler's Back (1991),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Wake it up Slick, ya know what I'm sayin'?
No complaining
Reached the destination and it's rainin'
I'm in Columbia, the Bond steps off the plane and
I hear a holler from a bro with ring around the collar
Here's Chief of Police, greets Bond, tell me to follow
Treated me to everything, no taxin', maxin'
Gives me a hotel suite for me to relax in
Seems everyone was on my silk drawers, McCloud doesn't
Had to bug me he'd have the nerve for jumpin' out the closet
""Word up, dead nigga"", said Chief. ""How do you figure?""
""Tryin' to arrest me, the Double for the murder of the nigga?""
Now in a cell, but not for long, and now I'm out, I hear a weepin'
One asleep, other sleepin', kept creepin'
Bumped into another, my appearance was alarming
""To who?"" Some lady got. God I'm charmin'
Please, the way I rap, I don't even have to say hon'
So who's a Don? You better believe a negro kept girl fond
The name's Bond
Well, I'm outside and it's the chief with twenty deep, psyched the brainiac
Beware because the Double ""0"" was buckin' like a maniac
Till nobody left, so hon', nowhere to do correct
Said ""excuse me babe, but where they hiding the hooker at?""
""Around the block, but chill at least chill till the storm has stopped""
Outside it was a helicopter, sound like it's warmin' up
Grabbed her leg, shot the chief, somebody said ""Stop hawkin'""
Shook me off at twenty-thou, the Bond got up walkin'
They was laughing as they left they grew thinner like a rocket
Got the plans from the dying chief of police it's in her pocket
To make it even worse honey gal was definitely rattin'
Was holding her in a club that was happening in Manhattan
I'm on the plane in the day seemed nothin' wasn't phasin'
Except for this stewardess jockin' the Amazin'
But kept my composure, had another honey hon'
Who the Don? You better believe a nigga kept girl fond
The name's Bond
Back at home in New York, I didn't want to get too overfly
You wonder why I pulled out my 535i? (pimp)
Boy I see some lookouts with some girls that was annoys
It was a private engagement for the dealer and the boys
Double just passed the hoods with their faces painted
Walked in, say a good twenty girls fainted
Though guns was all out but seems everyone was shittin'
And man I was so cool I even carried me a kitten
Trouble for the Double? No, I wouldn't swallow that
Who the man with the Golden Gun and all of that
Heard calls of mercy, left blood on the walls of
Rescued shorty who was all on the balls of
Boss said ""You're late!"" I don't wanna hear none of your dissin'
Upped the cash, made a good twenty million for the mission
Good job, not to mention had that Boss honey hon
So who's a Don?
Better believe a nigga kept girl fond
The name's Bond!

""Yeah, please?""
""Alright, you kids get to bed, I'll get the story book""
""Yeah, alright""
""Y'all tucked in?""
""Yeah""
""Here we go""
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
Where laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought to, good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said
""Me and you, tonight, we're gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another ""stick 'em up, stick 'em up"" 
And a sista and her brotha
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started actin' erratic
He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why'd ya hit me?""
The barrel set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigga""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radio's in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good and from expectations
He decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him, ""sorry""
Then he made his move to an abandoned buildin'
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up a door there, guess who he saw?
""Who?""
Dave the dope fiend, shootin' dope
Who don't know the meanin' of water nor soap
He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doin' 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive, though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran outta bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head, he said the gun was fulla lead
He told the cops, ""back off or honey here's dead""
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
""Uh huh""
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
And before long the little boy got surrounded
He dropped his gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only, what? 
""Seventeen""
In a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
""Uh huh""
Just another case about the wrong path
""Uh huh""
Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Good Night
Talk about the box, Rick
Talk about, Rick...
""Oh boy, that uncle Ricky, he's really weird""
""I know right, what does he mean, straight and narrow or your soul gets cast?""
""I don't know you'd think he'd be crackin' up too""
""Uh huh, I don't know,'night""
""Goodnight""
Talk about the box, Rick
Talk about, Rick
Talk about the box, Rick
Talk about, Rick...
""Another, that's right, Rick the Ruler, presentation""

Sweatin' among 'em was a hon'
""Got a man but we're not gettin' along""
Lick the balls, I know some girls'll lick it, not a rhyme, kick it
""Rick it's amazin' how you rap word up, you sound wicked""
""Do I dig her?"" Silly question picture a jerk and do I trick her
""If you only know how good you be lookin' to a nigga""
Butt perfect, to her car say would I walk her? Not ever
Tell her ""call me later on just to talk or whatever""
Stirrin' it up, learn the digits, to be safe burn it up
""And here's another slick Rick one"" and the man turn it up
Now on my strap and very soon she be all hot and wanna rap
'Sup cap'n over there but Rick ain't nothin' gonna happen
Comes over stuck my toungue in her mouth she gave me a hickey, shocked me
The way she jocked truck me, ""knock me Ricky, knock me""
Don't affect you none you popped your kid and rocked your son
Though you ho's strung now didn't knock or tongue
'Cause it's wrong
Another honey real sneaky lines thrown on the freak
Says ""money works away but he be home on the weekends""
""Wanted to say you're best, out-chargin' the rest though""
Says the guest though now massagin' the breast though
While I'm gettin' info out of her, girlfriend's side of her
Doin' this already, I'll be in that and out of her
Ask her friend ""what poet best?"" Rather not flow
Though know, girlfriend actin' like down to cut throat
""You seem too hard for the rest of them"", met all, been too
Hint to her friend, time to leave so we can get all into
So then friend says ""don't take all day whore I mean""
Drops number on the floor makes sure the dog seen it
Alone asks ""Can you help me rap?"" ""Maybe""... winking
""Think me, you'll go far"", ""oh yeah that's it baby drink me""
Don't affect you none you popped kid and rocked your son
Though you ho's strung now didn't knock or tongue
'Cause it's wrong
""A good look strike ya ho""
""You attack mic as though""
""I wanted to ask you is that really real?""
""Witch, act like you know""
""Give me a line for your joint, been to every store to find you""
""Gettin' noisy everyone leave but you close the door behind you""
""Left your man dressin' room he tried to dis me 'cause you rule in school""
I said ""word, so won't you kiss me you fool""
Shoulder shrug she pop ""why not?"" another fan above, on the luck
Well anyway like a autograph and a hug
Made my move to triple excitement
""Stop Rick you'll flip it""
As I grind against her pussy and I didn't lick her nipple
Less than a minute more progression look at her hide in her dress and
Lights off pull panties to the side and caressin'
Mass roll up playin' her life
Want to keep her in past goal
Bolder now she's sayin' ""more deeper in my asshole""
Don't affect you none you popped kid done rocked your son
Though strung no I didn't knock or tongue
'Cause it's wrong"

One of the baddest come, noddin to a Spanish song
Slung, orange woolridge park and a savannah pump

Severe teaspoons, scary money on the moon
Lampin wit a big goon, keep shit tight like a kid's room
Big bird in the driveway, bullet out Friday
I'm liver that way, I ride only the fly way
Olive-green thinkin', ship sinkin
Deep-dish thinkin', big fish tank, wrist full of franklins
This mock-neck, shark-skin money
Eighty-eight, summer reader dun ? dummeries?
Rock dungarees

11,Get A Job,1994,Behind Bars (1994),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Well, I'm riding round the Benz truck with fake friends
Word, here they come now, yo Ricky lend me couple lenses
For lunch and all of that, I got to listen to this nonsense
What the hell Crumb, don't you have a conscience?
I'll treat the vogue, get the gold, chuck a heat in gear
Don't understand it 'til the blood sucker beat it
I see my doc, I'm said, ""yo, doc, how's the health there?""
Don't worry 'bout these pretzel muthas acting like your welfare
Word to parasites, tell me, hasn't it ever occurred of
Stand on your own two, please, I never heard of
By the window in the bathroom, that one did it
Got a dress like a brother, then both of them will quit it
Potential is intelligent and it's me you wanna rock
Hey, half cent hookers trynna act like snobs, get a job
You want a damn hood? No, here she go
I'mma gonna try, here to try it
Rick, my baby needs pampers, so buy 'em
Come on take me to Pizza Hut, work class cow
What would your man say if he could see your slut ass now
For five bucks, cool window while she drives
Barely missed him, pissed him
Dissed him, turn up the system
You ought of treat, that's the dinner
I'm hungry, said her daughter
She tried to crawl behind home
And heat bread and water
A rich girl, don't like, I said he's always the best
Yea, whatever, no question, project destined
Yo, what the hell is with you people, are you all incoherent?
Fifty years old and still you living with your parent?
Not a break to breathe, yell on the phone
Take all I own, everything, and leave me the hell alone
Word up, now shorty rock steals her ride
For you half cent hookers trynna act like snobs, now get a job
Reserve my hotty, it's the not, used to buying pearls
Please drive me across the whole entire world
My new man still can't work and he ain't too bright in math
Like it's my fault he couldn't manage money like that
Survive with your man, I didn't say grind the strife
And even worse when they never heard of 9 to 5
And you can't be gentle or they get all sentimental
I don't work for white people, well, work for Oriental
Her baby's mother, her friend, that's why plenty get killed
I'm in Peru, kids hurt and I need twenty mil
On man written traps, deaf, dumb, blind too
I lost my wallet, son, sorry grams, lost mine too
Lonely on the step, but still I have a cold heart
So on the spot, is one horny old fart
Word thinking he intelligent, it's me you wanna rock
And all you half cent hookers trynna act like snobs, get a job"

Is it a custom - to what? To provoke out a hostile apostle
And make him smack the coke out your nostril
BAP, the butter cat at gutter rappin' and I'm all man
Whatever gotta happen gotta happen
Boy don't make me put my grown man shoe in you
And I'm sorry father, for any wrongdoing doin' you
Cause dogs barkin and the girl sigh
Here to present myself as the sparkle of the world's eye
Picture I - where Spice Girls chick arrived
England, January 14th, six-five
While you scream out Brannyville
""You old ass rapper!"" You got it, but can he still
Sever, in other words, rap more clever
Like no other younger rapper walkin' could ever?

And really is the black Clark Gable of the rap biz
Racists reactin, hastin for action
The motherfucker got exquisite taste for a black man
What you never know? All clothes come off a hoe
Ever see me with my jewels and toast from off of Mo'?
*Psssh* Past where handsome measures
Like the whole entire Rat Pack, AND some precious
And chartable, such a big spark I pull
Nuns even say ""That motherfucker's remarkable!""
And aliens who came to earth gathering
""Great gosh the man has soul, we must have him""

Hit a lost world, acting like a lunatic *blblblblbl*

Forced good men to pull out and start to murder folk
Tired of the basement placed in
Take responsibility for your action as a race then
Instead of put cheer in our bone, paperhood promote
Negativity, and fear in our own neighbourhood
Since royalty breed to be (uh-huh)

16,I Shouldn't Have Done It,1991,The Ruler's Back (1991),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Warm it up V.
Well I'ma tell you a story and I come out bluntly
Want a ugly child? Hey nobody would want me
I used to walk around and get upset and upsetter
Till I figured out ways to make myself look better
As I got older, my awareness expanded
I met this beautiful girl and my wish was commanded
Didn't hang with fellas, 'cause they started gettin' shady
I'd always be with my girl and y'all could call her my lady
I loved her a lot, word up, not going to front see
The problem did arise is why on earth did she want me?
Couldn't figure it out and to make things worse
I was cursed, with the torment of not being the first
And the first was this fly guy, made me very jealous
Always think she'd cheat on me and talk to other fellas
Two wrongs don't make a right, but any we would fight
I would kindly pick up the phone and call a girl out of spite
I shouldn't have done it, man
I'm feelin' sad and blue
I wanted to make this right, so direct I was admirin'
I tried to stop my love, but no love was not retirin'
To catch her in a lie was near impossible and tricky
Didn't want her in certain clothes, gettin' really picky
We got into it again, this time she got too bright
So me preventin' a fight, I just stayed out for the night
I had to ease up off the pressure, all this heartache pain so
I went up to the Parrot, with Omega, Vance, and Dane
This girl came over, she was trucked down excessive
Started talkin' to me (hi), and she was poppin' quite aggressive
A pretty young thing, she didn't strike me as no ho
So weak minded Rick the Ruler went on with the flow
My joint was gettin' hard, word, without me even knowin'
We stepped back to my van and I could feel it's for her growin'
The girl took off her coat her body was no joke
Well, a rub or two, unzip it, and I went for broke
I shouldn't have done it
Now I've sinned and there's no one to blame
That night when I went home, I felt real guilty and ashamed
Snuck right into bed, I felt just like a shady fella
What made me so self-centered, how am I ever gonna tell her?
I shouldn't have cheated, just because we'd always doubt
Endurance, be a man, that's what I had to learn about
Now me, I guess I'm like there's one [or] two secrets that I hid
I figure, I'd patch things up and then I'll tell her what I did
Then after that, she started actin' heaven sent
I found the house spotless and said she help out with the rent
So, I bought the ring, it was a good 20 Karat
Then word got back about me chillin' at the Parrot
So when I got home, I thought she'd just be out to roast
Instead I found this letter, and I found her overdosed
It said ""I do for you but I guess you didn't care""
All this went and happened 'cause of me and my affair
I shouldn't have done it man"

What's good? Chit-chatter, back to work last week
Had to spit, muthafucka, I ain't doing jack shit
Go ahead, squeeze the trigger, 'cause I don't see how you figure
Two lashes, ok, it can be a good nigga
I'm the last man cooking, I was in heat suppose
Crawl back to the house, the wife cooking pig toes
Life's rough, that's the tore up, peace, but that ain't enough
Had to see master plow her, and my honey pie stuffed
Then trifle like bring her body, had Rick's wife
And she's nice and the kids be like 'daddy, that's life'
Take it like a man, money, try, keep rocking
Then one day, clock the balls, honey drive by and said
I'll do anything for you, kept drinking up
Hero of my wife, tell ya man stop sticking her
Master's coming, I'm not saying you're not attractive
Whip snap, if a nigga run high active, I'm captive...
*Samples scratched up*
(Slick Rick)
One day he was dogging her back, got me mad too
Dish it like you like this, she said, Rick I tried to
Aiding to the problem, master wife, what you wanna do?
Connie was naked and parading in front of me
She said, that's the slut, Rick, and I'm over her
I said chill out sweetheart, because I like life alot
She said, I have sources who will burn you on the cross
You get across, see, don't make me have to force you
Man, I had a decision, so I winked and to the granny
And she said, well you can start by eating my fatty
Change of plans, she said, no Rick, stay here
Quality's a whole, is never seen in a man
Can some change for me, said I attract because I'm handsome
Forgive me Rick, and step back to the mansion
That night be home, I'm finding blood all on my feet
Said shorty got shot for eating an extra piece of meat
I'm not even gonna start, no dad, I didn't budge
Next day master acting feminine like a fuck
Thinking I'm mean benching, no, hands is on the hips
Kept winking at Clinton, tried to kiss me on the lips
And here came master wife, saying I'm attractive
The whip snapped, if a nigga weren't high active, I'm captive...
*Samples scratched up*
(Slick Rick)
Master departs, can have some? You never bought some
Quoting from the bible, telling me to have a heart
So I shove aside the price, 'cause I asked her, I'm above it
Until we asleep, she's like master, I love it
The slut, he suppose to be gay, I figure not
But, here came master trynna squeeze a nigga butt
Look you getting too bold, well ain't you the meanest?
Bang bang, my liver son, he shot him in the penis
I said, chill, son, he chilled at his little Teddy
He said, don't go home, I done killed mom already
You know the half, now my life is full of laughter
Fell in love with granny, lived happily ever after
Due to the fact, the hooker found me attractive
The whip snapped, till the hooker weren't high active, she's captive...

How you gonna move Slick when cats like solo Rick?
Accept, yet no chances that they make plans
To wreck and make a nigga, breakdance the record

Urgent, mad white people like servin'
Interested with, gets congested with
Clowns, haven't made a record, impress the kid
Verse Two:
No entry, let's keep a hood rhymin shit (A-party people)
Are you tryin' to have yourself a good time or what?
No stressin you, type of beat bring out the best in you
Allegeble, ruler came to add a touch of bless onto
Niggas think they bashin me, his majesty
Of garbage and never were no match for me and actually
Many a girl catch the fever
And I don't need anyone else rap with either
If this is based on skill, kill anybody will
Affiliate Rick real to Hicksville
Same ruler movin cowardness out of this
Never out powerless, devour this and now it is
Time for one to leave upon impeach
Help teach all men how to live amongst each (KnowI'msayin?)
Although a lotta creep yet keeps
Every borough, every state, every country in deep check
Verse Three:
The bounce men, S&S sound bend
Listen up kid, an important announcement
There's a rapper I know many interested in
Named Rick, no rapper alive could mess with him
Lace records all audience roar to
Grand of a show, skill on the dancefloor too
Freakin awesome, of course I'm married
High school broads keep your drawers on
'Cause this one in perf' case
Guaranteed to make you break fool at the work place
Diligent, shout as Mr. Militant
Allow me to do my thing, it's all brilliant
Although sometime the reign may slip
Can't skip my part on the hu-man tip

Every borough, every state, every country in deep check

Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier, yeah
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier
Well he's in Indian Town, and what spots his eye?
A nice looking Indian, and honey looked fly
He had to talk because he just couldn't hack it
She wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket
He trotted over and invented a line
He said ""Excuse me, um, do you happen to have the time?""
All was on his mind was sex, sex, sex
So she said ""Why do ask? You got your own Timex""
To poor old Dave that line was cold blooded
He felt that her ego was way over flooded
She started to laugh and then she started to say
""I'm sorry some times I do get carried away
I didn't mean to like ill treat you
My name is Running Rabbit and I'm glad to meet you""
He said ""I'm Dave, with crazy clout""
""Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about
Yeah, you must be, because you look like a winner
Come to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner""
(Singing)
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier
Well, he met her father, Big Chief Beretti
He said ""What's for dinner?""
""Soup and spaghetti""
The dinner was rotten and he swore he's gonna puke it
He never would have took it if he'd known that he had cooked it
Later on they were chilling, in the bedroom
Sitting at the window looking at the moon
Judging from the mood he swore she was hot
He said ""Are you in the mood?""
She said ""No I'm not""
From what he believes and from what he gets
When a girl says no, he really thinks she means yes
So, he started touching her and coming out strong
Whispering sweet nothings and singing a song
He said
(Singing) ""I'm in the mood for love,
Simply because you're near me,
Funny but when you're near me,
I'm in the mood, don't mean to be rude,
But I'm in the mood for love""
She said ""Oh Dave, you've got my poor back hurting
I want you, but first close the curtain""
He closed the curtain and also the doors
The next thing you knew it was off with those drawers
""Take it easy Davy, you're hurting me. Stop""
Well, he was playing with her tits, they were soft not lumpy
And then he cracked the legs like Humpty-Dumpty
He's fucking, sucking, also finger popping
He had, no intention of stopping
Crazy fun, he did not want to leave
His head was between her tits and he could barely breathe
He had to toss, turn, turn, toss
Meanwhile he was riding her with crazy force
She was burning hot, she said ""Stop, stop.""
He said ""Are you talking sex or what?""
I guess she didn't realize what she started
Next thing you knew she was acting retarded
She said to him strangely and kind of merry
""Stop now, or I'll be unable to marry""
He didn't take her warning
He rode her till the morning
He rode that ass till the pussy started yawning
(Yawning sounds)
He said ""What? Wait"" His dick went weak
It said ""Dave, pussies ain't supposed to speak""
He gathered his things he wanted to leave this place
But first he wanted to see the vagina face to face
He opened it up, with his bare two thumbs
He seen crabs with SPEARS AND INDIAN DRUMS!
They's going heya hiya heya hey, hey
Heya hiya heya hey
Heya hey, heya hey
Heya hiya heya hey
Heya hiya heya hey"

And most agree it's kinda amazing folks are born from where we pee at
Though I definitely fiend it, baby no way, chills, clever mean it being
Got to be careful (... be told), commercial ever seen it?
Want a few hot ropes, some ask am I cheatin', do I? Nope
Not a dope, love the mother, also loves me too I hope
So I dig her a lot and although shorty honey break a nigga
How you figure, bein' a big rap money makin' nigga
Cute as a button, he tell 'bout the time we picked for cotton
So it ain't forgotten, hope I don't spoil the nigga rotten
Also, don't discriminate white, he'll be quite bright, if taught him right
If not he like ask heavenly father, help me raise my shorty right
So when I come home with the coil, I say ""yo shorty run to royal""
Seein' as I'm loyal and livin' on soil, it's best when you have someone to spoil
So any toy, he wants he gets, yo kids ain't worth it midst the toys
That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it's a boy
Pictured friends, milk and cookies, when you're done with the boys game

Best of care, best that money can buy is what he'll be wearin'
With these weathers around, protect him, they'll say in a cage I kept him
Though wage you kindergarten probably be another major step and
Lo and behold a star holdin', 'cause yo be loadin' trips and sowin'
You know and... throwin' a fancy home for him to grow in
""He's kinda pleasin' to raise""... so baby say. No thank you... ease in
Sneezin', now what do I do when he cry for no reason?
Though any toy, he want he get, yo kids it ain't worth it, midst the toys
That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it's a boy, yo
Baby mom, under wing, though if dress up, could string
Line of cuties, though cling, don't wanna mess up a good thing
You know how it is when guys that pay girls seem to hog us
Fiend and dog us, scheme for more guts
Goin' into labor date, 18 of August
It's that time tellin' friends, congratulate's yellin'
Gonna be six weeks premature, but thanks to God, he's doin' well
And givin' credit where it is due, while rap's achievin' let it
As for bills forget it, 'cause the way I rap, don't even sweat it
My own when me and my hon son, don't fuss, agree
Though son, I still kinda wish I coulda been there when he was born at 3:01
Bygones be gone, there's nowhere wrong and all
Your son's about and since I didn't and this being the first
You know I had to write a rap about the incident
And the rose is for the squeeze, I would've sent a few no women with the kin in it
Wish us luck world as we enter a new beginning
And like I said, any toy, I'm tryin' to tell ya that midst the toys
That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it's a boy"

You're kinda late ""Flat tire"" Well that'd do it 'cause

Put away your money ""I'll buy that slice!""
She said, ""Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you""
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
It's DJ Run and I'm almost blinded her
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor,
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?,

Hoes ass kiss 'cause I'm like Jason, vision
Releasin' me a basket case from prison - Pissed
Blood feenin', the villain like 'Wassup y'all
Deep down schemin' how to kill 'em
Misleadin' a bit, although proceedin' a hit
I made 'em feel I'd never jeopardise my freedom for shit
Played the empty headed part,
Though the moment they dreaded start, neat
Back of the head and took the credit card
Seen properly decease,
Made it look like an everyday robbery to police
And I's out
Police believed a thief pop for sureity, a jerky
Alert the rest to beef up security
And not to get flashy, although another blast occurred
Another brother deservin' to get massacred
Pleasure in poppin' that flea
Should a heard mister tough guy coppin' mad pleas
Not insane, nor am I biased
Though feels good to watch a motherfucker die before
My fly ass
Ain't nuttin' to blast, fuck it
Then I put some crack vials in the ass pocket and was off
Police said a thug awaited, since I didn't leave no evidence
A drug related incident
I still clock the mil' figures, cock back triggers
Reason why your girlfriends dig us - 'cause I kill niggaz
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy
Well I had it up to here, that's why a brother buckin' trife
And gettin' way with murder, this the motherfucking life
At a jam, nine figure on shelf
While your army a nigger snickering among self - thiefs
Who wanna clock the bread off the next
That's why I'm gonna blow their fucking head off
Maybe the victor get stuck up
Giving these clowns opportunity to fuck up
They knowin' that the kid crew showers, eye cowers
And leaves for 'bout a good two hours
While they're like 'we coulda caught Rick what, for allsort'
That's what the assholes thought
Tough guy mumblin', I thunderin'
Why I had a motherfucking A-K ya wondering
And raise it higher, start giving them the fire
As they scream like high pitch women like Mariah
Blood on the wall like, other brothers ball like they hit
Seein' shots split a motherfuckers skull like lettuce
Run a nigger best bet is for another duck in gage
I'm in a motherfucking rage
Mask 'bout face, Now figure dash
Smash 'bout 10 ta 15 nigger ass out
More enemy dug, deceased, caught
Had not, gave one fuck what police thought (what?)
But first I best provide all brainiacs
With evidence of a suicidal maniac
While I clock the mil' figures, cock back triggers
Reason why your girlfriends dig us - 'cause I kills niggaz"

Sorry, Michael, it's Rick the Ruler, I have to go
Lights, camera, action, you're on,
Get old Ricky D, what's wrong?
The crowd's gone,
So help me out Kit cause this thief has to be caught,
Radio the chief of police, get a report,
Chief of police said ""Well, I'm sorry Ricky D 'cause I really can't
Help,""
Ah drats I think I'll take a long walk,
Kit put your scan on all these rappers in New York,
""But Michael's callin' me Rick, I got to go,
If I get a word you'll definitely be the first to know,""
Well on that night I felt really up tight,
Hello?, ""Rick, it's Vance Wright,
Throw on your clothes, I found 'em, they're down town,""
Word?, ""Someone's havin' a concert and they're using your crown,""
What?, you sure its mine?
""Yo Rick, I know the shape of it,""
You know your scratchers?, ""Yeah, plus I got tape of it,""
Get over my house quick, ride your motorcycle,
Kit, Ricky Rick, pick up, forget old Michael,
Well here came the DJ, trick to say the least,
""Yo let me hear the tape,"" it's a complete masterpiece,
Y'all figure this kinda is, but this I bound to overtake,
I heard a (honk honk), that's Kit, so lets pray,
Here go my rap Kit,
Analyze a hit, so Kit what's the scoop?
""Slick Rick, this one is it""
Well my tummy was growlin while I'se chillin' in my seat,
We stopped by McDonald's so I could somethin' to eat,
Skipped the line, the crowd started to break,
Hey yo, let me get a Big Mac and a strawberry shake,
Someone snatched me by my neck I thought I must be dead,
Injected me with somethin', threw a bag over my head,
I felt real weak, word, I couldn't even stand,
I fell, next thing I'se being thrust inside a van,
Unconscious, who could be this shady?,
When I awoke I was in a room with this lady,
""So your the boss, Rick Rick with all the clout?"",
Uh-huh know why'm I tied up and what's this all about?,
And this she left the room this was my one chance for hope,
I used my watch lighter to burn away the rope,
Then I's free, I's free, an alarm was alerted,
I made a flying leap through the window and it hurted,
Someone threw a knife, who could be this trife,
Then I ran and I ran 'cause I's petro (petrified) for my life,
Stranded and raw I saw a phone not far,
I radioed in to my supadelic car,
Yo, what's with the concert, am I still in it to win it?,
""Yes I'm in Manhattan and I'll be there in a minute,
And oh, by the way, I re-listened to your hit, hey Rick,""
What's the scoop?,
""Oh man, this one is it!""
Tight tight security, man, there was a (?),
Came in with some candles and bum rushed the office,
Grabbed up the one who liked to front and pretend,
No, I don't know who it is, some brother lookin' like a hen,
""Let me go, let me go, please,"" you must be dusted,
Hand cuffed this brother cause the thief could not be trusted,
Grabbed up my money and my crown that's how I dissed 'em,
I went on the mike, and DJ, man, I'm on the system,
I warmed up the techniques to show he ain't soft,
The crowd was up and this is how it started off,
(Who, who, who is the top choice of them all?)
Yo Vance, cut, thanks a lot, who wanna die?,
We up top, somewhat, forget me not,
Class that I have won't last,
Soon as I blast, from out the past, dash fast, and hear a last,
Vance Wright, no man can bring you this,
And Ricky Rick, clean shot, 'cause I'm the king of this"

We rock the mic (Right!).
For all a y'all, keepin' y'all in health.
Just to see ya smile and enjoy ya'self.
'Cause it's cool when you cause a cozy conditionin',
That we create, so that's our mission, so listen,
To what we say because this type of shit happens everyday.
I... woke up around ten o'clock in the mornin',
Gave myself a (strech up), a mornin' yawn and...
Went to the bathroom to wash up,
Had some soap on my face and my hand upon the cup,
I said a (Mirror mirror!) on the wall...
Who is the top choice of them all?
There was a rumble dumble,
Five minutes it lasted... the mirror said,
(You are you conceited bastard!).
Yo that's true, that's why we never have no beef,
So then I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth.
Used ""Oil of Olay"" cause my skin gets pale.
Then I got the files, for my fingernails.
True to the style on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I could have a bubble bath.
Clean, dry, was my body and hair,
I threw on my brand new Gucci underwear.
For all the girls I might take home,
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and the (Polo Colonge).
Fresh dressed like a millions bucks, threw on the Valley shoes
And the fly green socks.
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no!
I went back in I forgot the...
Then I dilly (dally) ran through a (alley),
Bumped into my old girl (Sally) from the (Valley).
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said ""What's wrong?"" 'cause she looked upset
She said uh, (It's all because of you)
Say what? (I'm feeling sad and blue)
She said what? (You went away)
And now, my life is filled with rainy days.
And I love you so, how much you'll never know.
Cause you took your love away from me.
Now what was I to do
She was crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said, ""Don't cry, (dry, your eye)
Here comes your mother with those two little guys""
Her mean mother steps and says to me (""Hi!"")
Hit Sally in the face and decked her in the (eye!)
Punched her in the belly, and stepped on her (feet)
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone.
Something was wrong I said what was going on?
I tried to break it up I said, stop it, leave her
She said, ""If I can't have you (she can't either"")
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out like I had the chicken pox
But uh, she gave chase, she caught up quick
She put a finger in the face of MC Rick, and said
So we can go cruising in my OJ, and what?
I'll give you all my love today.
What? Ricky Ricky Ricky what?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Yo MC Rick my love is here to stay""
And on and on and on she kept on
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, ""Cheer up!"" I gave her a kiss
I said, ""You can't have me I'm too young for you miss""
She said, ""No you're not,"" then she starts crying
I says, ""I'm thirty-four"", she says, (""Stop lying!"")
I said, ""I am -- go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover!""

Happy birthday, what's the word say
To papa smurf, I cover the globe like earth day
Rollin' with G and the Rickster
Flavor full boogie down mixture
We came back to attack with the ruler
You can't get no cooler on our way to the bank
Now do the Patty Duke and then do the Spank
Come from the heart things spark
And keep your eyes glued to the top of the chart
Oh shit, it's the man with the fronts and the jewels
The kids with the blunts and the tools
Sewing up shop like needles
Sellin' more record than The Beetles
So don't be astound
And makes no sense in standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around

'Cause {No one can rule like the ruler Rick can}
Though some like it hot and some may like the shock
So let's get together what I mean is rock
No vanity, insanity {Strictly cloud}

Fine grown Pine-Sol
Heavenly rhyme throne
Remember when you were young in the 70 time zone
Stages, ages about seven I say kid
The dress code of our parents looked awfully outrageous
Not down on em, games and clownin
When soul was at it's highest rate like James Brown 'n' them
??, A groovy era acting
Member seeing Shaft in the movie theater back then?
I feel Richard Roundtree got 'em a fly deal
Black man wearin' bell bottom and high heels
Laughed a lot, some action mass production
Remember when cars were darn near half a block long?
Parents were so into that crap
Bunch a sweet memories to us older rap cats
Muhammad Ali knucklin in tournament
Pimp daddy hats with buckles and ornaments
How we forget snappy
Five people sleepin' in one matress and yet happy
Could even make sex seem sour
As I impress the world with my extreme power, cause
Chorus: repeat 2X
Rick make memories sealed in almanacs
Not to mention the immence appeal the mack hat
When you wake up in the morning (redeem from any crap)
Because I bring that love and feeling back to rap
(Slick Rick)
For situated as poor beneficialator
Kool-Aid couldn't last a hot minute in the 'frigerator
School notes, slidin and stealin, hidin 'em
Bazooka, bubble gum cartoons still inside of 'em

Pimps flyest dressin' muthafuckas, weren't they?
But hood lies, you afraid of a good wine?
I used to love the actor who portrayed one on Good Times
You need a friend to ? a soul, man it kinda slow
One thing 'bout a bro, overflow when it?
Life, a pitiful game
'Member the robot?
That was my shit on Soul Train
Got hyped to, psyched to,
And the feelin's right to chillin' on the fire
Escape on a nice night too
No, I'm not gon' try to hurt the?
Remember ride on blood and dry turkey slang?
Brothers chippin' in for alcoholic money
When you look at old flicks don't we all look funny?
Could even make sex seem sour
As I impress the world with my extreme power, cause

Yo' mama, damn we used to talk improper then
Member when we used to walk bop, walk bop again?
Givin' them the rythym that we bought
Push our hand back like we was swimmin' when we walked
Bad all about, Huggie Bear, Rat all about
Member afros, what the fuck was that all about?
Buenos noches accents too... friends too
Everybody had a lot of roaches back then too
Profusely around us, Loosley?
Fleets wearin' Bruce Lee Bandanas
And kick shit, ballin the hand I stick wit'
?????
Most cases, fatha' away for good
Local Flat Foot was part-of the neighborhood
Standard, and the panthers (Wow)
Used to dress like Erykah Badu and Amanda's now

32,Mistakes Of A Woman In Love With Other Men,1991,The Ruler's Back (1991),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Oh boy, Rick look all sad again.
What's the matter Rick?
It's a long story, check it out
Call me the freaker, I bump it in your speaker
Week of my birthday met this girl named Tameka
Astonishing creature made the rest look tired
Desired, though was it beauty I admired?
Out by the 41, broke, no joke
Can I have a toke, fine hooker so I smiled and smoked
Gave the girl my number, though I still felt rejected
Hectic, called me more than I expected
Months passed by, even lived together and all
Dream come true, until suddenly a call
Oh brother, why do I discover
My honey, Tameka, yeah callin' me another
Broke hearted again, it offend and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
How low can go/Hold it now
Well, tried to block it out my mind, here it was again
Other men, confronted later and she said he was a friend
Didn't believe her, she packed
Brave her, strange behavior, so silly me forgave her
Late again Thursday, alone Rick sat
Left flat, look in the mirror and I wonder where she at
Gave the girl my heart and soul, it's after ten
And again couldn't manage if she slept with other men
Out with my jewelry so you know she looked truck
Struck three o'clock, here she come, fishy like a fuck
""Come here let me smell you"", I wanted to say ""to hell you""
""Hi honey, sorry I'm late, but let me tell you""
It's a fast chat, need the phone, so I'm roped in
""Could you go to the store and get some soda 'cause they open?""
Again it offend and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
How low can go/Hold it now
Strike one, strike two, no exaggeration
Tried to play it off like it was my imagination
Beer mixed with alcohol, help me to forgive
Deal with weak minded and I have no will to live
I deserve honesty, get treated like a pet
Now she's bein' nice but no I still can't forget
Put the cards on the table, don't get loud, cut the bull out
If you slept with another man, I'm strong enough to pull out
She confessed and then she left, smooth
Wanted to kill myself 'cause to live ain't the move
Broke-hearted again, it offend and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend
Mistakes... in love with other men"
33,Mona Lisa,1988,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick (1988),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"(Ricky Walters)
Ladies and gentlemen... and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure
That we are here to present tonight...
Slick Rick the Ruler! And MC Ricky D
Doing their smash hit ""Mona Lisa""
You know like the picture?
Anyway I'd like to take this time out
To bow before his divine majesty
(Ricky) Oh your majesty...
(Slick) Hmm?
(Ricky) Can I kiss your hand?
(Slick) Mm hmm
(Ricky) (kisses his hand loudly)
(Slick) Enough
(Ricky) Come your highness... they await you
(Slick Rick)
Well, it was one of those days -- not much to do
I was chillin' downtown, with my old school crew
I went into a store -- to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona -- what?
Mona Lisa (what?) *singing* Mona Lisa, so men made you
YouknowhatI'msayin? So I said, ""Excuse me, dear
My gosh, you look nice
Put away your money
I'll buy that slice!""
She said, ""Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you""
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (PING!) I almost blinded her
She said, ""Great Scott! Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth""
Ha-ha, hah! Had to find that funny
So I said, ""No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief? Please! Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet""
She almost got cut short -- you know, scissors
She tried to disrespect WHO?! The Grand Wizard
Me! ""Well what's your name, son?""
""MC Ricky D,"" but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
""I'm... sorry and I know that's low class (uh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past""
She said, ""Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin""
A virgin?! Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin -- with her yeah wide gap
I said, ""It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky:
R -- Ravishing
I -- Impress
C -- Courageous; so careless
K -- for the Kangols which I've got
That I wear everyday and
Y -- why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm
Quite polite like Walter Cronkite""
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, ""Hey Rick, don't you know playin' with these snakes is a sin?""
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, ""I don't want to see you playin' with these lowlifes no more
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of her friends""
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it
And as we were leavin' and drivin' along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song
(Excerpt from ""Walk On By"" (D. Warwick))
""If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry... each time we meet
Walk on by... walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide
The pain and the hurt that you gave me
When you said goodbye
You walked on by"""
34,Moses,1991,The Ruler's Back (1991),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"I try to block it out my mind
As you see [at] Ruler show's is inquirin' noses
Goin' into a story about a kid named Moses
Once a prophet was to be born, so for anything else furthered
Pharaoh orders every first-born son murdered
One got away, a girl with profit bound with her
Gently put him in a basket, went floatin' down the river
Then ends up by a Pharaoh relative, ol' honey peeped in
Couldn't breed herself and was determined to keep him
""Don't say a word"", she told her slave who was a real witch
""Snitch, it'll definitely be the last day you breathe bitch""
While kids slaughtered, 'cause they was [in] front of them
Soldiers tellin' the king that they murdered every one of them
""Thanks"" said Pharaoh, guys were a friend to him
Sister showin' her baby sayin' ""[on] the river God sent him""
To her brother who arose and said, ""whoa sis!""
Curious I suppose this, the upward knows about Moses
As time passed he proved he wasn't the type to beg or borrow
Grew to conquer lands like ain't no tomorrow
Made the son King jealous 'cause he couldn't do what Mo' did
""Pops I'm not to happy the way y'all jockin' this Mo' kid""
""Son, this rash behavior ruins every feast or bash""
""And why complain, now where's the temple I asked you to build, you piece of trash?""
""Two of you switch, Mo' you build it and you'll find a supreme hero""
""Built it. Anything else, you need Pharaoh?""
""King here's startin' to share my crown""
One said, ""How can he?""
But sister not takin' any chance and threw the hooker off the balcony
But word still got to King, who then cold cursed Blessed
Stripped him of his honors and dumped him in the desert
But Mo' returned for the people, with his chest stiff out saw
King said, ""You want war? Make brick without straw""
That's a son not being king, the shorty no good [a]rose his
Unhappy I suppose this, the upward knows about Moses
The new king said, ""As for your threats, brother stuff it""
""Boy, what do I do now?"" prayed the Prophet
Then a vision said ""chill"" and prophecy filled
Scorn build, hails the fire, all their first-born killed
It was gettin' scary for the king, this made the sufferin' go by merrier
""You win, take these peasants, get the flock out of my area""
Poor villain, still in heat, didn't want Mo' to fulfill 'em
Wasn't chillin', ""then I'll flat send the troops to go and kill him""
So Mo' parts the sea, went across and said ""run"" and
Did some ol' abracadabra and water fell upon 'em
The soldiers that is, since Moses was suaver
Then Mo' in the mountains havin' a convo with the father
Came back with the tens, seen pantyhose droppin', partner swappin'
Folks wasn't into what poor Mo' was poppin'
So the Earth shook and killed those, bible text closes
Talked about a time when idle worshippin' foes had met Moses"
35,Q Tip & Peter Gunz Skit,1999,The Art of Storytelling (1999),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"He said, ""They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls""
Then a whole bunch of fists just, caved he's world
He was in pain, so ashamed, he wish he had not came
Had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, then
H went to an open store that's where they brought/bought him a quart
Then I went to the park, and I sat and I thought
Got real drunker than a skunk and happy as can be
We went, to the Latin Quarters and we got in free
Scoopin all the girls like nuttin with my trunk jewelry

Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala
I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that
Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that
Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order
To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water!
But because the kid swears love
Though when I see her friend it's like the shit wears off
I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate
Get her friend? Mission Impossible
Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to
The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste
So make music in my basement
Don't cut her off till I find a good replacement
One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's
House, cause the hon was sleeping over
My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched
Wanna diss, I said ""It's over you waste of time BITCH""
Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third
She said ""Stop, Rick"", but didn't tell her friend a word
I went to bed, here come my girl touching me intently
Snuck out early, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before
Because she swore a nigga hit her
""Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?""
But I didn't, now the hon badgering
I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair
(Singing)
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe
Another brother out for one thing, mistook him for
Steady relationship is what I'm really looking for
Sincerity, scoop the hon I done it
I said ""Being straight up, it's you I really wanted""
Though she fucked niggas with money like MAD
I still found myself wanting the honey quite bad
Loyal to her friend, though she wanted wood
Then we did it, boy that pussy was good
""But what if shorty finds out?""
Never be too clever
""Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together""
Chill, then we started to button the strap and
Then my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened
Later on, my girlfriend stormed in
""We going to the supper club, some kid's performing
Bye, see you later"",
Her girlfriend hot, then stopped living, Rick decide to follow
I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can
Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man
Contradicting of words being together
My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather
Back in my Jeep, about 4:11
Popped another can, looked up to the heavens
I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am
And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm...
(Singing)
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe
Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said, you got me waiting
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh,
Lalalala, lalalala, lalalala, lalalala
So you get my point son,
You just don't trust no bitch, you know what I'm sayin'?
""Okay, daddy, I understand""
Cause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin'?
""Okay, I get your point""
Anyway, listen to this, check it out
1994, as the world gets trifer,
I'm wondering, the fuck I need a woman in my life for? (ya know)
'Cause it's like a nigga whole history
With you hoes been nothing but misery
First rater, five-one stood
Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good
Met her at the fever
""What's going on, stranger?""
And like a fool took her in and tried to change her
I don't who I thought I's bluffing
That BITCH wasn't giving up that coke for nothing
""Oh you trying to dis, mister bougeois nigga
Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too,
That type shit you ain't admitting""
Because, homegirl, I grew out of it, you didn't
Anyway, dead out of order
Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her
Who gave you that?
""My ex""
I said ""Who?""
Believe she had the nerve to say ""You can wear it too""
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true
(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Scooby doo doo
Then I met Sin,
Sweating the viking
A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like them
""What? Sweating you? Picture that, nerd. Please""
Anyway, the bitch had herpes! (you know)
Imagine me, the fool being the spouse
Doctor said I couldn't catch it unless I got aroused
Found out snooping in her bag what she got
Now why you ain't tell me? You worthless slut!
""Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to""
You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying
Anyway, stayed with the creep
One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep
""Chris, wait,"" the bum bitch said
So loud till a motherfucker fell out the bed
Who the hell is Chris? She putting up resistance
Until I caught her calling the nigga long distance
Had the nerve to dis patch loving
Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true
(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo-ooh (doo-ooh)
Though happy I was free
The need for love was still in me
Got to the point where the need for it was killing me
Then I met short here, hanging with my cousin
Found out later how young the bitch was and
Though I done hit it and she opened up a world
And remind me of that song ""Go Away, Little Girl""
It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled
""That's because I had you pussy whipped royal""
You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?
You see the type of attitude the BUM BITCH carry?
Like oil and water, impossible mixture
Then temper tantrums came into the picture
Yelling (ah), carrying on bad and cursing
Complete embarrassment to The Ruler as a person
""Gimme shorts""
Ruler will not permit you
Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture
Flirts too, excuse me, a whore
Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour
So when I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true
(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo
Ricky needs a love that's true-hoo-hoo"

40,Street Talkin',1999,The Art of Storytelling (1999),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Chorus: slick rick
Don't try to claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick rick and outkast is on this jam
What kid? diamond on the 2-2 grand
Trying to help raise all youth to man
Slick the ruler rick his space to slam
Help clean up this land
The reputation of this man
Withhold and withstand
Verse one: slick rick
Outkast and slick, the answer is in it
Hon you need to get your ass on the dancefloor this minute
We bruise stuff, knock you out shoes, socks
Show your ass, move your fuck out, we're mad smoove snots
La-di-da-di, mmmmm we like to party
Don't make me get money and platinumize my body
With bright stuff, known to earn a dyke's love
Blind folks be like, ""somebody turned the lights off""
Immense rep, poppin' out a muffin
Make famous artists that's dead hop out a coffin
At the real estate, behavin type choosy
Want a palace with the shit beige and light blue please
Got the kid like watch your manners
Since I came out of jail, it's like the planet gone bananas
Lack of strength a badder fella had
Lady lookin' at me all stink, I had to tell her that
Verse two: big boi
Uh, I went from _player's ball_ to bulldoggin
From bulldoggin to bowhoggin
Now bowhoggin and pimpwalkin
That strictly fresh and street talkin'
And we all last like that there
Ruin them all up like cat hair
We never fall off like hat wear
We some of the dopest MC's out there
Now eat that, outkast and ricky d, bitch can you beat that?
Remember the time I laid them down to teenage love now see that
Just to sport a rhyme and break in new patterns like hymens
Shuckin and jivin was never the style
I'm gon' keep on beatin' this line
Spittin' that king shit, you cling shit
A tailor and a seamstress
New gators for you haters and the penis for all you beatches
Like an addiction 'cause I need it, hip-hop is that I be that
Like a junkie showin your monkey, 'cause I sho' nuff like to beat it
Might just eat it just to skeet it, fold you up like you was pleated
Like some slacks and, relaxin, be strollin like some cats then
I got a, baby daughter, and I feed her with this rappin'
Not trappin, b-boy, but rappin', huh
Verse three: slick rick
Seems everybody's open off the grammar
The white fox pink velvet suit, white cabana
Listen baby girl, genius rick ta...
Dreamboat wish, you shoulda been clicked picture
(Check her out) I don't know what you're tryin' to figure out
Down south, barbecue ribs fly out a nigga mouth
And touchin me the chosen, for such a will opposin
Me and big boi tryin' to give our children clothing
Smokin' love - do we provide dope enough?
Even people unborn kid wide open off
The enginin I'm sendin in
Even make construction workers start actin' kind of feminine
(Hi!) 10%'ll blast this hit from me and big boi
Who represent the outkast click
A jealous cat, lack of strength a badder fella had

Known to the whole world for what (my style of rhyme)

Although they know they won't (never get it right)
Because they have no (class) and they have no (shame)
They'll bite another brother to boost their own (name)
Get paid correct on a one way gimmick
I'm happy for you lowlifes but 'member there's a limit - so say

Please tell us how you organize the words you speak'

Well I remember one night when the world was dead quiet
And out of nowhere some boy starts a riot
He tore my clothes, I had to throw blows
A shotgun barrel was dead on my nose
I froze - it was Big Foot and the Toes
Yup, a bunch of small timers that be it on my shows
Surrounded the ruler with machetes too
They said um 'if you don't teach us how to rap you're through'
I said 'okay, now let me go, please'
I seen an officer - then the officer screamed 'freeze!'
He said 'Slick Rick you okay?'
I had to play it off, some girls were looking my way
So I smacked one in the face and told him 'I won't retire'
And many years from now I'll just be getting higher
For I am the master, set and done
My name is Ricky D and I'm the only one - so say
(...Ricky D) - (...Ricky D)
Now when I was a lad my style was bad
So I had to use what little bit of knowledge that I had
So I quote and I wrote till I was up to par
Some rhymes were (boo-hoo) and some rhymes were (hahahaa!)
I educate myself so I'm able to reach ya
Answering the call of teacher, teacher
Tell us how you do it, it's so easy for me
The creator of the style, emcee Ricky D
Now my only task is to warn all biters
Slimy sluts and fake rhyme writers
Don't try your luck and get the ruler annoyed
For when I'm through with you boy your whole world will be destroyed
So chill mister muscle or I'll come and hunt ya
If you are a girl I'll make no man want ya
So if you wanna rule and no bribes in the way
Pay attention to my syllables and come see me and say hey hey
Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks so easy like there was nothing to it
But they don't understand the ruler will be

Don't, don't hurt me again
(Verse One)
Hey sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
A serious situation we all go through
It deals with your feelins, so hear what I say
It's like a day when nothing seems to go your way
Bust this, two people, they really like each other
He says their's no one else
And she claims there is no other
The feelins the same, and you receive a notion
To reveal your inner thoughts and deeply hidden emotions
(Verse Two)
Precious times, hopin they won't end
Tell your mother bout your lover
Also your best friend
Ya mighty proud while your holdin' their hand
Boys, yeah that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man
This person brings a certain warmth to your heart
And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him, and he also loves her
And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on, problems start to occur
And the bond, which combines, y'all turns into a blur
For the feelins were the same, now here's the score
You love them to much, and they don't love you anymore
Is your attitude a number
Or because your not bein true
Or maybe they're just plain sick of seein you
Word, now it might seem strange
You better take hints quick, and make the right change
See just when you swore the ball was rollin'
They're gone and part of your hearts been stolen
Get back on your feet with a hop and a skip
But no you'd rather go with this dead relationship
Hangin' around and buyin them stuff
You see them every darn day yet don't see them enough
You follow them around and they claim your hawkin
When conversation comes you do all the talkin'
Not to mention attention, we all need a bit
Beind your back their say yeah he's all up in my
They're gtin sick of you and quite annonyed
And if you had plans for the future they're now destroyed
You saw what was happenin' and you still let it
And if you ever let him make love to you girls you can forget it
Sweetheart you been caught
An it'll spread around town faster then you thought
Then breakup time an you receve the word
Yo this is from the heart and I know that part hurts
Get over it from now on don't take short slick
If it's not true love you shouldn't deal with it
Just think of your future and what is to come
And pay attention to the words in this song
They go
Do you know where you're goin' to
Do you like the things life is showin you
Where are you goin' to
Do you know
Don't hurt me again (8x)"
43,The Moment I Feared,1988,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick (1988),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Well I'm sittin' on my lunch break, grinnin my teeth (my teeth)
It's the last day of the week, boy what a relief (relief)
My muscles kind of ache, they felt rigid and stuff
So I looked around, and I smoked this big fat spliff
Now I'm happy as can be I'm in this pothead spell
I put some Visine in my eyes so that no one can tell
It's 12:55 almost time for the bell
Put the breathmints in the mouth so that the mouth don't smell
Now back on the job, I don't bother no one
I keep strictly to myself and all my work gets done
Now the job's finally over it's time to have fun
And I'm hangin' out with Trevor there's a kid named John
Got real drunker than a skunk and happy as can be
We went, to the Latin Quarters and we got in free
Scoopin all the girls like nuttin with my trunk jewelry
'Cause I'ma fly brown brother and you can't school me
Boogie Down was performin hey they ain't no joke
And a bunch of Brooklyn kids was lookin' all down my throat
Was it my big chains with the big plates on em?
Then they rolled on me and told me to run em
This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo homeboy take off your chains man
Bout to hurt you real fuckin' bad, I'm gonna fuck you up""
This was the moment I feared...
""Yo what's the matter stupid? Take the shits off man!
The fuck is up?""
I said, ""They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls""
Then a whole bunch of fists just, caved my world
I was in pain, so ashamed, I wish I had not came
Had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, then
I went to an open store that's where I brought/bought me a quart
Then I went to the park, and I sat and I thought
I seen Danny Boy though he's with his girl named Sarah
In one of his cars, I think this one's a Bravera
She calls out to me, but, I really couldn't hear her
So I went just a little bit closer so I'd hear a little clearer
She said, ""I need Veronica Blades that's right near Tilden""
I said, ""I know where that's at cause that's right next to my building""
I gave 'em the information and they went on their way
I went home, and there I slept till almost three the next day
Then someone knocked on my door, I opened up, no quit!
It was Sarah with some magazines and a bag named Kit
She tried to use me and seduce me and at first I wasn't with it
Then we did it and we did it and we did it and WE DID IT
She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it
The elevator came and Danny Boy was on it
This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo what the fuck's goin' on here?
What you doin' to my girl homeboy?""
This was the moment I feared...
""Oh I just KNOW y'all didn't just finish fuckin'
I just KNOW y'all ain't just finish fuckin""
Well he was huffin and puffin and he swung at me -- word
So I pulled out my jammy and I silenced the nerd
Then he was dead two in the head I took the cash and the Visa's
She said, ""Don't worry about a thing just make sure nobody sees us""
We went back to her apartment, there was blow in the freezers
She said, ""We're rich we're rich we can have whatever will please us""
Now I don't hang with no one who ain't good for my health
So I put the sugarhead out and I went for self
Now I was rich as I was rich I could have whatever would please me
Now I could wear real gold in front of folks that would tease me
Yah me, I'll be a new neighborhood dad
Cats'll roll up on me screamin, ""Yo Rick my man!""
I guess I was too fly word up I'm sorry to say
Ya see a cop rolled up on me and told me, ""Make my day""
I said, ""Relax brother,"" but he had proof that I had done it
Yah they had false hair on underwear with my fingerprints all on it
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
And I was the main event on the TV for a while
But now I'm in jail doin' life and I'm scared
Some kids snuffed me cold and greased me where no one dared
This was the moment I feared...
""Turn around nigga (HAHAHAHA)
Spread your cheeks""
This was the moment I feared...
""Uh, aowwhwhwaa! stop stop! ahaowwhahaooho"""
44,The Ruler's Back,1988,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick (1988),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Hauk, who goes yonder?
It is I, sire, Richard of Nottingham
Well, speak up man, what is it?
News from the east, sire, Rick the Ruler has returned!
Gather 'round party goers as if your still livin'
And get on down to the old Slick rhythm
Now this one here is called the Ruler my dear
It's a mere party booster that will set things clear
It's a hundred percent proof from champions of truth
And if you feel you need spirit I'll bring back your youth
Relax your mind, and folks unwind
And be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find
And off we go, let the trumpets blow
Well hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back
Now in these times, at least to me
There's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like Ricky D
Not tryin' to cause trouble cause its really a small thing
But they're bitin what I'm writin
God it's great being the king
Some sound all right, but then they act illy
Try conquering my crown and that's really very silly
Now I'm not the type that gets upset
Try to disrespect folks just to earn respect
But learn this fact, whether white or black
I can't be conquered in my style of rap
For jealousy and envy are dumb ones tools
So Ricky says nothing, he keeps his cool
Revenge is not a mission that the Ruler's on
Just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back
Now one day when I was chillin' at this outside jam
I seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands
To beats of records that conquer the streets
Like Pee Wee Herman and Clubhouse Treats
Girls was chillin', boys rule as usual
The slacks, the golds, the rings, I hope I'm not confusin y'all
But everyone in the house looks smashin'
Fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion
And just when you thought nothing couldn't get better
A news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter
A kid ran up to the mike and said ""Alert, hear this,""
Cleared his cloggy throat and then began to persist
He said ""Hallelujah, kids hear this
The Ruler's back and he's here to assist""
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back"

46,Tonto,1991,The Ruler's Back (1991),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"One day fishin' heard Indian drums
Saw a brother, listen too, wife kissin' too
Then on another mission to
The city with the sistas, though was a far distance
There's Lone Ranger out of area that needed my assistance
To deliver cash, last man got robbed, pimped
He never returned, I said ""ok"" and put the money in the Fendi
Then bumped into this girl
Looked like that that girl on ""Mork and Mindy"" and
""How"" I said to the white trim, jockin' me the Indian
Comin' in all this heat, the kind for hopin' a chance for ropin' in
""How'd you like to put your Indian teenie in my openin'?""
Said that would be because the nigga wasn't new to this
True to this, double barrel slide out the uterus
Calm, started singin' sad popular songs
Took the money and the hon', screamin' at the top of her lungs
Now on a hunt, ""You carry leaf?"" I was about to smoke a blunt
No, not without frontal, screw girl pronto, mean Tonto
Was extremely pissed, still picturin' screwin' this (woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why the fuck I'm doin' this
Nuisance, brother's/horse tracks, ""whose to choose?""
Saddle loose, both thirsty cuttin' a cactus for the juice and
All of a sudden, these women like model ho's in Paris
Ganged to rape me the Indian, I was so embarrassed
Don't pull a kid a minute, to give in within a minute
Till I seen a shack yonder, or a couple livin' in it
Shook my hand, friendly manner, though she pack her up and ran her
Couldn't stand her, fondle her feathers like she wanted some banana
Led me to the back of the house, the hands that started track
Used it as my marks and then I nearly had a heart attack
Brush it off, deal with the floss, way past disgusted
Said ""what's the matter granny? Is your blind ass dusted""
Back in the hunt, now what do you want, poor granny offered me a blunt
No not without frontal, screw girl pronto, mean Tonto, grandma
Found they're small timers after all, wasn't her intent to brawl
Pulled out my 45, ""How y'all"" up against the wall
Where's the hooker and the money, here she came, sweatin' mine
Then the bitch is pointin' a pistol at my fine behind
Now she a smart ass, should of figured when getting' off the hottie
So the horse busted in, startin lettin' off the shottie
Killed the men, slapped the girl, 'cause he figured I'm stuck trapped in
""Come on Rick, a horse cappin'?"" Yeah, that's what the fuck happened
Grieve the folks, bleedin', sides red, I'm pleased and
Indeed, now I'll let the Apache kill the bitch, no I need her
Playin' the role, better yet, ""well is your pole up?""
Signals from the wife sayin' ""what the hell is the holdup?""
Although he scares the honey, hit the switch dares to run it
Caught and scalp the daffy hooker, said ""bitch where's the money?""
Gave it up hunt done, she wants a blunt and so it's frontal
That's not what I want, so drop drawers pronto mean Tonto
Now turn around
That's not it
Shut up bitch, I know what I'm doin'
But that's my... oh!
Oh that's it
Stop, you're hurting me
Bitch I could have killed...
Oh shit feels so good
Open your mouth
Put it in your mouth
Play with my balls too
Know what I'm sayin' wake it up Slick"
47,Top Cat,1991,The Ruler's Back (1991),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Eatin' a bit and nap, human being make way spittin'
As I'm skippin' through an alley in New York, a stray kitten
Dog chase couple of blocks, shocks, tough being a fox
He in a tux, some good samaritan'll stuff me in a box
""I'll find you a home. Why do you cry? Where went?"" Just like whine
'Cause ASPCA to me a kitten ain't like righted
Constable comes, wonder why? I heard say ""unhand the fly kid""
Because the bitch looked like she needed a home more than I did
Word, bit her off another like, not a committee, hit her off
Not to mention, sweatin' the kitty litter off
Had to do this, ain't no regular, see the loot is
With this rich white lady sayin' ""Ain't he the cutest?""
Clerk said ""all deals are straight"", so when the car wheels away
Although the ho' better know I want four meals a day
The rest is firm bein' a trap as the hon' adopt cat
""Better be a good lil' kitty"", ""hooker don't pop crap""
'Cause I'm Top Cat
""Let me hug him"" for the millionth, and again, great... the zillionth
Huggin' me so much, she almost suffocate the brilliant
Sad eyes, plus she had a bad pad, nice
Said I have to do my share of work, the hooker had mad mice
Was like a fleet of them niggas, though it was kind of fun to be
Ill treatin' them, clean the mess, must've thought I was gonna eat 'em
""Cat food?!"" This ain't none to me, see a rat, you come run
Or like ""hunt"" to me? ""You wanna get this shit from in front of me?""
""Word, Thanksgiving too? Please!"" Now shout for somethin'
""Can a nigga get some air?"", she wouldn't let me out for nothin'
I guess I could be called a brat and now a jolly ball of fat
So let me rub my head against her, so she think she all of that
And every day of the week, sweatin', works like a sinner, stay off
""Would you lay off? I'm watchin' Prince of Bel Aire, you're in the way of!""
Mouse race across the room, should've seen me stop trap
""You're still a hooker snap, didn't I tell you don't pop crap?""
'Cause I'm Top Cat
Male come and the sex triggers, and his penis stiffer, bigger
Said ""boy she sure be sleepin' with a lot of different niggas""
Ten positions as he coaches, do it in the mood above reproaches
I wish the bitch would clean her house, you wouldn't have so many roaches
But still she buggin' and he comin', and the naughty with the hottie
Fall asleep, burglar come, ""up shorty get the shottie!""
Tried meowin', nothin' stirred him
The ho's meal blurred him
Peed on the bitch, got up and chased me till she heard him
""What was that?"" Got her gun, she had a dozen, mad lot
And for a over horny lady, definitely wasn't a bad shot
Police came and all of that and now a hero hops, run to her
So I snuggle up under her, 'cause I've kind of grown fond of her
When a mouse run across, should've seen me stop trap
I Thought the ho' was gonna snap, she better not pop crap
To who? Top Cat"

49,Treat Her Like A Prostitute,1988,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick (1988),Hip Hop,Slick Rick,"Here's an oldie but goodie
Hit it
Excuse me
What?
Can I have your attention?
Mn-hmm
There's just a few things that I've got to mention (Uh-huh)
There's girlies out here that seem appealing
They'll come in your life and cold hurt your feelings
I'm telling you
As sure as Rick is my name
I wouldn't trust not girl unless she feels the same
Treat 'em like a prostitute (Do What?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my first example
Now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while
Plans for the future, she's having your child
Celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts
Tell all your friends about your family thoughts
One friend was drunk so he starts to act wild
He tells the truth about the kid
It's not your child
Acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk
He said, ""Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work""
And she led him on and tried to please him
She didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him
Treat 'em like a prostitue (Do What?)
Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well until
You're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my second example
It's your wife
You buy the tramp jewels and clothes
You get sentimental and bring home a rose
Give her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it
All your friends tell you, ""The bith don't deserve it""
Love is blind, so there goes your wealth
Until one day, you see things for yourself
Home from work early, Mr. Loverman
You had a card and some candy in your right hand
There's the mailman, he was short yet stout
He went inside your house and didn't come back out
Bust it
Just a friendly stop, come on, is it?
The mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?
The thought alone makes your temperature boil
You say to yourself, she might still be loyal
You open up your door and stand in a trance
You see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants
Came home to party
From work had a hard day
Look around your house and you say, ""Where the fuck are they?""
Run upstairs up to your bedroom
You look inside your room, you see something brewin'
Cover your mouth because you almost choke
You see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat
Treat 'em like a prostitute (Mm-hmm)
Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well until
You're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my third example
Now your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot
Today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot
As you open up the door she says, ""Get on the floor""
She wants to try things she's never tried before
She takes off your drawers and works you over
She calls you Twinkles
And you call her Rover
Next thing you know, the ho starts to ill
She says, ""I love you, Harold"" and your name is Will
That's not the half till you start to ride her
Take off your rubber and there's one more inside her
It's not yours-who can it be?
I think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky
Treat 'em like a prostitute
Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well
Treat no girlie well, until you're sure of the scoop"

Bang bang, same thang, game came when I left em
I do it by my lonely now I'm the big homie
(Slick rick)
But I'm his royal slickness, ghetto weakness, come rick is
The one who expose cornball rappers with the quickness
Uh, who bum from and who balls you hung from
Wouldn't give a fuck what part of the country you come from

I'm snoop dogg, I'm smooth and imperial
I wake up every morning to my lucky charms cereal
Times get drastic, yeah I'm a classic
Dogg pound gangsta chokin off that boombastic

Now put my verse on the first one-beat the herds come
So be careful cause my rap will make you eat your words son
(Word to God) scratch i? who the hardest to match (I)
Bright rewrite your still garbage to patch

Haven't you heard? I'm loose, shook the feds like the juice
Snoop dogg is a hundred-and-twenty-first proof
Fool usea deuce-deuce of some genuine, draft
I'm genuine, like vinny's whinin all about cash
Cash, cash, so indeed I got the weed
And keep the lighter for the hash, has it,
Ever been a time when you didn't have a dime
And the only way to get it was to go and do a crime?
Chorus: slick rick (repeat 2x)
Many underclothes hangin' on the hoes
Since (snoop, slick rick) crushed anyone opposed
Lot of ladies - pop cristal, toast to all those
Like (kid capri) helpin to unify both coasts
(Slick rick)
I'm shredding your temple, none, 'head of the emperor
Washed up, gang member? better remember
I wipe my feet upon a rapper like a doormat
I hit 'em -- where they sit around actin' hardcore at
Thank God for the guardians - in light of this
Rappers always beg for me to show them who the mighty is
Gats gonna limp, snaps on a kid
That always wanna start rappin' (boy they're not gonna win)
And wanna dash at lethal or evil
Could a king bring style and class to black people?
Stick a whole log in and he buggin
'Cause I - represent self, with my man snoop dogg and them
I drop a pile of semen on em
Even in a yugo I could take they woman from em
I make the hardest chew the kewl of this
Kid capri, know the part of peasant, who the ruler is?

I'm twenty-six... still in the mix
My hair gettin' longer, my game gettin' stronger
A nigga been on one, I thank god
Cause life in the city of stars is gettin' hard
And it's odd, for a g to get a job
So I'd rather steal and rob, and mob with my squad

Used to read the source
Now all he read is the holy qu'ran
Time brings change and change brings time

I give it to y'all, like you really got to have it

And fuck with my nigga kid capri on this g shit
Dial tail and bail with my nigga slick rick-y

Finest girl, a brother think he ever set eyes on
Nice day, weather sunny, as he made a run for honey
With a warm personality, well it's on the money
I'd have tongued her right there, seemed kinda fun up there
Wonderin' there, as he tellin' me he could get the underwear
Meanwhile, still jockin' her, like a real sucka
Sister which was so fine, she could have AIDS, I'll still knock her
Heart beatin' for her since a brother didn't figure meetin'
As I ask her if she's single, ""yeah, caught my nigga cheatin'""
""Nice to meet ya"". Leaves, she had dope combined features
Watched her walk away and observin' the fine creature
Next day again, went in uninvite[d], super angry with us
Ran into to so much that her and her friends had start to hang with us
They pair and move, though fine, they both swine
""Can I take you out to movies wine, dine, the whole nine?""
She condones, good riddance, nigga slid this on her
Didn't want to get to bone her, though I knew I didn't own her
And I could've made a move, a little will power 'cause although
That she told me she liked him as a friend and that was all
And since hang with us, she already told her, cool he freaked her
The week on my birthday bought me a pair of Gucci sneakers
""Did she like me?"" Racin' the thought. ""Was it a sign?"" Guess it weren't immoral
When she saw me, definitely this is kinda special
Since for this dish, none abate, but everybody wanna play
""How long is money gonna wait?"" So I asked a honey on a date
And she accepts, though thought it wasn't much [of] a plan
Windows of the world, even had the nerve to touch her hand
Though not lookin' at. Bashful? No sir
Supposed I was so shy and then the hon' pulls closer
Thought ""clever hint"", so what she straight, never been so excited
And convinced, kiss in heaven ever since
Holdin' her hand too, chillin', future plan to build
Couldn't believe my dream fulfilled and then that girl began to ill by sayin'
Lady if you will
Say you're the one that sent for me to thrill
Someone that I can hold close in my arms
With all the charms of you
All the charms of you

A soldier, what I do to that hood?
""Are you that slave everybody tellin' me rap good?
Calm down, not goin' ta murder ya
Clean yourself, Pharaoh said he wanna have a word with ya""
My mom, pop, look concerned
After takin' a shower, dress and returned
The soldier, kinda on the dark end
Brought me and the motherfucking palace was barking
In the midst, a poet, dryin'
Pharaoh and his girl being entertained by him
Motherfucker got some nerve
Said ""Bring slave forward, let me observe""
He asked me my name and start badger me
""Ricky, what?"", 'Ricky, your majesty'
And bowed because I had to,
Kick a rap that shit better sound fat too
Who rotten 'em
Plaits swing, but have you forgotten 'em
Biggest big shouts since King Tut and 'em (who rotten 'em)
Kids ville, motherfucker couldn't sit still
All bitches is open off Rick's grill (who rotten 'em)
Definetly exort, any stalkin'
Hawk gawkin' at silk fabrics when I'm walkin' (who rotten 'em)
Fondle with right, yet, spec get delighted
All a that jungle shit, whites rap
""He's fat"" queen said to the pharoah excited and
Did seem obvious the rap delighted him
Then start banging on appliance (Yes your honour?)
""Send this other rapper to the lions"" (Please, no!)
Pleaing with merit, if you kill him for my sake
My raps will do the spirit
'Please let him live, I prefer that'
""OK, well, send him where this slave used to work at""
Do or die jammin' me into
Even was allowed to move the family in too
Any beat better rap good on
Even gave me mad nice outfits to put on
Knowing that my rap style bumped many
And expecting some important company
The king visits where I was put to write
""Slave, you're behind, better rap real good tonight""
In other words, lay your mack down
'Cause these cats not the one to sound wack round
So that night, when they summers be them clapping
Took a deep breath and then began rapping
Who rotten 'em
Tryin' a find out what excite, what I write,
What ignite with
Lion never once tried to bite Rick
Excusely, assumed to meek, refuse to greet
A smoother geek, just move ya feet
Shocked all dippin' and stoppin'
Even slave owner wanted me to whip a man, fucker
Shakin' any prison, kickin' back, sick of crap
And sista breakin' when a nigger rap
Well it was obvious the raps unpluggin'
Dignitaries spat wine out they mouth, buggin'
This they never heard that type a tactic
Gold sandles all over their fat steps
One dignitary over what man said
""I'll give you half the eastern border if you sell him""
Back at the rest spot to nap a bit
Mom! Pop! They delighted with the rapper did
""Son"", my mom said sweepin' up
""That lunatic'll kill you if you don't keep it up""
What's wrong with you, ""Son, I'm not scornin' you
Leave your best for a rainy day, I'm warnin' you""
Ripped my ego apart
So I set upon a mission to change the king heart
'Sire, whippin don't pay off
A lot more done you give a nigger one day off'
He took my advice, 'stead a yell again
Sir noticed that my input was accurate intelligence
That type meant ta stripe, kids
Even after he died, I still write raps like this
Who rotten 'em
All teacher and scholar try proceed me, believe me
I am all culture that you need be
And superior juice to abuse, I choose
Use words racist slave owner used to
Sandwich known crook, redbone hook too
Got his own land, which you're known look to
Not only ass wipes, swept side kick
Shocker and them niggers even try to dress like Rick"

Oh help me make green light furriers
You know in life you can't race around with no worthless
So continue the sequel
You weighed in the scale and we lived as free people

Grown, don't play, growned intelligence
Fix what bother, and another

And uneasiness kept here, even after we made this big giant step here
Womanhood, somewhere in the basement
Slowin down again, so I'm lookin' 'a replacement
Music poundin a slow jam
Wit a girl knowin' and down wit the program
Although the honey aim style king
Wit a took broom and taimin the wild thing
Loud, uneasiness brought out
Still tried to shove my tongue down the bushy broad mouth
Speedin, chasin after vaccine
Tried to string along, but I didn't have the patience
Learned from cussin and confusion
Breakin Commandments wasn't a solution
Though a few minor clicks in relationship
Still time to fix things
I thought you didn't love and didn't need (lay hey hey)
I thought you said forever, to decease (lay hey hey)
I swore you were dishonest, do you believe (lay hey hey)
