Check it
As I grab my pad and pen and begin to talk from within
Oh God, I'm hot as the water, like a preacher who's sinned
I'm only human but
The world has put me on a platform since the day I was born
To only wait for my downfall, but like a brick wall, I'm too hard to break
Ok, I do make mistakes, but I'm the realest from the fake
That's why I'm the hardest to hate
Aaliyah, baby girl, I've learned to love those while they're still awake
Sleep sleep
And prepare a place for those who are good in the projects and hood
Give to those who are misunderstood
I know like Lisa, Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still No1
There will be more of us to come
I am a leader, a teacher, I gotta, like a single parent provider
Put in back those hip hop dividers
Like a priest with a backslider
I've sinned, but I win
And anyone we've lost in life from 9-11
We'll be sure to see again
What you hear is not a test, I'm rockin' to the beat
What you hear is not a test, I'm rockin' to the beat
See me and my crew, and my friends we're gonna try to move our feet
See, I am Mary Blige and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
First you gotta, first you gotta"

And I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Ooh baby, what's your name? {HA?}

You made me change from thinkin' all guys the same
You the type of guy I wanna marry in months
Got exactly what I want {HA?}
And ain't no fakin the funk
Your attitude is funk and you're makin' me crunk (c'mon)
(Chorus: Missy - singing)
Yes it's real baby
Got me so crazy
Light my fire dirty
Like the way you serve me
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Oh, you won't be sorry
My papi, I'm yo' mami
(Missy)
I'm in your life to come and let you explore {HA?}
And take you on a tour
The kind of guys that be talkin' that noise

""He's a rap superstar"" {UH-HA!}
I wanna be the one, you like
I'm sure to do you right
(Method Man + (Missy))
Is it real hon, if it's really real (let's chill)
Maybe pop an X pill (how does sex feel?)
Come and get your next thrill (you the raw deal)
Yo I'm sayin' if your man won't (Mr. Meth will)
That's amore', all day, mind over matter
And my forte' is foreplay, sex on a platter
Have it your way, then who, serve you everything on the menu
And all that freak shit that you into
Sweet lady, you drive me half crazy
Maybe, we can go half on a baby (on a baby?)
Poppa got a brand new bag
Hidden in the stash of his brand new Jag
Lovely, kick your shoes off and get comfy
We can bump uglies if you ain't got your monthly
Yes I, like ""American Pie""
Tell 'em M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter-Y

Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
And pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
And punch a bitch in the nose, till her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches
I'm that vicious to walk up, and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin' through the airport, sluggish, walkin' on crutches
Hit a fuckin' [*pregnant chick*] in her [*stomach*] with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out
I'm lookin' for someone ""of"" to beat the crap ""out""
I'm bringin' you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate in English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speakin' so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically (one more time)
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of earl, head twirls every time the toilet swirls *flush*
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (SHUT UP!)
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse
To give you insults wrote with a pencil (bitch)
And waste the paper on you, choppin down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'
You motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nuttin
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy ... Slim Shady
[Shady] What's the deal?
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy ... Slim motherfuckin Shady

Would a baby girl go this way
Can you give me better words to say
One day she'll see you again
With the same old beautiful smile
Long hair and the voice of a hummingbird
You'll be singing them same old songs
Aalyiah can you hear me
I hope that you're proud of me

It's very necessary, on the contray
No you do not scare me, is you drinkin' Bloody Mary?
But shit, you betta hurry, before I have to bury
My attitude is bitchy, 'cause my period is heavy
I used to drive a Chevy, put twenties on that baby
My nigga was the shit, but then that stupid nigga left me
And now I'm lovin' Larry, but Larry go with Terri
And Terri is a freak, but it's his baby she will carry
The life he live's a fairy, cartoon like ""Tom and Jerry""
My flow is legendary and your style is temporary
Yeah, you need to worry, like Jason, it gets scary
The words that I spit don't fit in that category
Is my vision blurry? My speech is very slurry
Me without Tim is like Jamaicans with no curry
And yes, it's necessary, so hurry, nigga, hurry

Put your raps in a stack
I'll break you and your singer like Jinga
I mean um
I spit like knee
On you this tight thing
Space nine enferno
One verbs be frightening
And for the sword fights tonight
My entourage is in camoflauge
Remove your mask
Let down your visage
But don't slip up
'Cause when I was in my ship
That's when I get ripped up
The whole world
Fuck it

Got your panties shitty
Click you sick
Callosso with itty bitty

Sip my style till your pissy

Chemical gases up your nose
Fade away like ozone
Quazars, moves and shit
Hey yo Missy, where da clip?

Shitty bees up in da place
Wanna be down with whoever
Be all up in his face but ain't even on the level

Let of steam like nasty pools

Melt down, now up in pot
Count down, 3-2-1, lift off
Now over tize, Venus we circlize
And mars we tantalize
Comatize like Hale-Bopp
Smoking trees non stop
Then I send a televize from satellite on Nightline

Lock down like metal bars

No one lifted a hand
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block

Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Steeped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
All around the world on the microphone
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me

Timbo, what they do
They try to be like Missy but they have no clue
On how I'm spittin' over beats the way I move
I move so smooth in my shell toe shoes
Now put the needle on the record, show'n'prove
Since ninety-two I came to win and never lose
They try to stop a chubby chick from comin' through
My belly out and sellin out these venues
My skills, will fulfill, those who drink booze
My attitude is super cool like I'm subdued
And those who fake I take on you and your dudes
I rule the streets I break 'em down with no tools
And Misdemeanor give the finger to y'all fools (HOLLA!)
Whoever doubted that I'm 'bout it check the news
And if you snooze on me this year your ass will lose
'Cause I will bruise, my loose screws is like ooh
When I come out get your release dates moved

This year y'all gon' all lose sleep

And those who try to compete to the wall I throw

While I kill the track, leave your ears decomposed
Fake rappers, this year your lies will be exposed
Like oh oh-oh oh, oh Missy steal the show-ow-ow
Spit on breakbeats, make rappers lose sleep
Make labels unable drop they artists on leak
I keep 'em knee deep, need me, be me

I met a guy named Tommy
Very charming
He was on me like cheese be on macaroni
His game real tight making me so horny
Fine enough for us to fuck and be his baby mommy
You really don't know me
So I moves it slowly
Brush up and let him hold me
Let me spit some baloney
Baby you could call me
If you go down on me
But you got to back up off me
Wearing cubic zirconia
I told him, ""Baby let me fix my weave
I got a hair out of place and use a fake ID.""

Balls the size of ping-pong
I had him souped like won-ton
I put the beat on
And on my ass he skeet on
I put the heat on young gun
Fresh meat he season
Yes, yes we used to creep down the beach
He was insane like Rick James
And with a mask he's Superfreak
I told him, ""Gimme cash to fix my weave
And I don't want no excuses 'bout your baby mommy
'Cause your child support money don't fix my weave
And you know nigga please me no fuck for free.""

Used to ask who I was screwing
Joe was pursuing
Sex was good all ""ooh-in""
Moan he was grown

I used to get vex when he would sex another bitch
Said ""Baby don't trip, just like Ben I'm rich""
Jen don't bitch, then Miss don't bitch
Lopez get rich, call me Miss Affleck

Because my tracks feel whack, I want to hit the party
You want to play like Ben then give me your keys
'Cause even Jen drive a Benz to go fix a weave.""

Always shit talk to my moms and call the cops
Couldn't wait till I was nice and grown
Sick of daddy mouth till six in the morn'
On and on and on till the record scratch
And if I made a few scraps I would never come back (YES!)
Take moms with me and a few ADAT's
And make a song about dad and tell pops he's a rat (YES!)
Oah-KAYYYYY!
[Scratched] hold up
(Chorus 2X: Missy Elliott)
Y'all don't really know my life
Y'all don't really know my struggles and how much liquor I guzzle (YES!)
Y'all don't really know my fears
And how many years to get here but I'm ready to rumble
(Grand Puba)
Yeah, I be that throwback cat, I throwback 'gnac
I spit hot raps, then I check my traps
Pockets stop the bulk, green up like the Hulk
Ram up in somethin' like that nigga Marshall Faulk
I'm a low key nigga, a O.G. nigga
Entertain my guests in ""The Basement"" like Tigger
Grand Puba and the name ring bells
And if it ain't about paper I don't waste my sells
So the new school new school need to learn yo
I burn baby burn like a Hunt's Pointe ho
(Missy Elliott)
Yo yo Puba, hold up
Let's take 'em back on some ""411"" shit
Ma-ry!
(Beat changes)
(Mary J. Blige)
I'm Mary J. Blige, for a fact I don't rap
I'm known around the map to always make a comeback
I went through some struggles fightin with my ex-lovers
Stayed in lots of trouble, blessings then I had recovered
Had to pay them bills, the places I lived
Messin with them cats that's said to get I had to give
I had to tell them back up 'cause I was quick to smack 'em up
I didn't give a WHAT, Mary J. would act up
(Chorus: Missy + (Mary))
Y'all don't really know my struggles
(I had two or three jobs I had to juggle)
And all them liquor shots from the pain I covered
(Strugglin from the break-ups with my lover)
(Y'all don't know the half) Don't know the half
(I'm better off now that was in the past)
I had to take the good stuff with the bad
Now I'm (thankful for the little things that I have)
[Scratched] I'm Mary J. Blige, for a fact I don't rap
[Scratched] Grand Puba, and the name ring bells
[Scratched] I'm Mary J. Blige, for a fact I don't rap

Top model diva but my name not Eva
Yeah I brang fever rockin' classic adidas
I'm srtaight off the heater rippin needles off the meter
Here I go, flip my flow
Back it up then I drop it low
It's a must 'cause I'm dangerous
I'll be a hassle on the busta call me angeldust

You run for cover hide under your covers
Cause you gone need more protection than a magnum rubber

Stick you on the table with a plastic cup
Say grace, then eat ya ass up
Y'all just rookies, virgins, and nookies
Not my competition you skip or play hookie
Ain't nobody here that can tear the track up
And naw I ain't done rappin' so shut the hell up
Keep it simple every time I flow
If you step to me I shall throw blows
Raise up like I's break nose
I ain't about talkin' I'll lay 'em down slow
And for show y'all know
Misdemeanor got 'em by the neck low
Ice cold heart like zero below
If you wanna battle me then playa say so
Let me tell you what I'm all about
About spitting hot rymes on out
Yeah Pharrell did the beat oh yes
And the way he put it down he make it sound so (fresh)
I be the best don't second guess
When it comes to other rappers 'bout it boy get flexed
When I say I'm tight as wife beaters
Missy bout to teach you how to follow the leader
Hit the club in a blue two seater
Lookin' like I'm finna cock a nine millimeter
Get out with my highhill cuffs
Twisting my ass 'cause I know what guys want
Licking my lips like I'm takin' him home
Teasing and teasing I'm fakin the funk
Shaking my titties like I wanna bone
Bend over slow then I tell him I'm gone"

Check it
See I don't want to say that this is the end
I'll end by saying this is where we'll begin
Hip hop is a freedom of expression, not a freedom of depression
Can I make my one suggestion?
Look at how we're labeled gangsta rappers
Is that their only impression? WAKE UP!
Rappers are craft art in a rapper's sport
Someone like a game of basketball can't be taught
But yet we accept the name thug
Like that's fly
See how they covered our eyes?
Give us names to separate us
Sit back and watch us beef and make us hate us! SAY WHAT!?!?!
I'm done talking

A part of the glamour and glitz
Platinum rings and different things
How easy we forget
For it is him, the Lord Almighty
Who allows us our success
When you on top above the charts
How easy we forget
Do you think without him
You would be who you are?
For if he made Heaven and earth
He also made you a star
So as we reach the year two thousand
You know there's one higher than us
And I come to be that tool to tell you
In God we must trust
Love you"

You wasted my valuable time there's money to make
Scared to set foot in another relationship 'cause of the heartache
Heartbreak Hotel no not Faith, Kelly, and Whitney, no it's Brat, Aaliyah and
Missy You miss me 'cause we finished
I'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride with the TVs in it

Kiss my ass like your heart was in it (stupid ass)
Keep stickin' them chickens
Send Peter straight to the clinic nigga
See I'ma give you your props tho
You like a bad ass motherfucker

All the times I've been stung
For you bring the worst out of me

And I can't down these tears I've cried
The heaviness inside
Left me so petrified
Tried ta keep love alive
But I became too tired
'Cause you bring the worst out of me

I wish I could change the way things have gone
And start life anew and now maybe once again
I don't know anywhere but something must've went wrong
And all I can say
Is when I sing this song
I get so teary eyed
'Cause you get under my skin
Can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you,
Stay true to you, live life wit you
But look what you've done to me (me)
And I compromised all my time
And rearranged my life
To make sure you was fine
'Cause our love was on the line
And I became so unkind
'Cause you brought the worst out of me
(You brought the worst out of me)
This is (this is) how the story goes
Those ones who know
When it's out of control
You work (work) and you work (work)
And some one gets hurt

And why I take you back? because I cannot change a man
No use in talkin', better get to walkin'
Better get them chicks who turn tricks
'Cause I'm just too smart, man
I hate men who lies who looks me in my eyes
Come up with alibis for the thousandth time
I won't take bullshit
Leave ya ass with the quickness
Because I'm stable and able to live my life alone

No more to say or do
'Cause you're too confused

93,Why You Hurt Me,1997,Supa Dupa Fly (1997),Hip Hop|R&B,Missy Elliott,"Missy Talking:
I know there somebody out there who had a nasty
Nasty friend who wanna go around humping everybody
Can I get a hoe? You know what I'm saying? So
I'ma talk about this one I had a fewa years ago
Verse One:
I had a friend named Cutie Tootie
Tootie turned tricks to get some Gucci
Known as loose bootie
Truly, she was a freak in the evenin
And if she wasn't teasin, then give me one reason
Why she do dat? Always knew dat
She was hot as da nectar
Hector said he pecked her, direspected her
'Cause he bang bang swang in his dingalang
Broke his back long range
And make the ugly bitch sing
Ooh ooh
Why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more
Ooh ooh
Verse Two:
Cutie Tootie with her sight
And if she humped Ralph
She humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike
Tight, is the way she wore her dresses
Has she learned her lesson
From all the dick testing
Now I'm guessing
She's laying in a casket
In a yellow basket
For a Gucci jacket
Daggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things
'Cause he made the ugly bitch sing
Verse Three:
Tootie didn't know the facts of life
Staying up in clinics
Loosy bootie made trife
Feeling, she got the heeby geebies
Quick to give you freebies
Underneath the staircase in Brooklyn
Neighbors out the window sure was lookin'
She greasy like chicken
I don't give a cotton pick and
She can do her thing
Cause me and her don't hang
The ugly bitch sang
Missy Talking:
So you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody
Who's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank
Once again going around humping everybody
Everybody and anybody and anything
That's why you make the ugly bitch sing"
