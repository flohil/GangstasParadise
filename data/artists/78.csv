I'm in it witch'all (okay)
Hit big cash, I'll spend it witch'all
Win at the casino bitch, I'm spendin it all (hey)
Leave in my Spreewells spinnin for y'all
I'm in it for y'all, fact is (whattup)
My contents have character, plays the background
While I'm listenin to amateurs with no stamina (uh-uh)
Compared to my flow
You're more or less recycled, career's on idle
Keep it comin' though
If there's anyone or anybody that's potent enough, I wanna know
Gorilla, and I'm iller, than a fifth of
Hennessy and Belve', a big bagger killer
Popcorn popper, won't stop till I cop e-nough
Trees to get the whole world fucked up
I'm out of M-I, so when I say ""Whatupdoe""
Y'all niggaz put it on the flow
(Chorus One: MC Breed)
Hey where you gettin' it from, I want... {one too}
Oh you got some of those, I got... {one too}

Shake them haters off as soon as they get on ya
Popcorn, all through my perfecto
All I do is chief, it's hard for me to let go
(Proof)
Tecs blow like Del Rio - from the land
Of Air Force Ones, Detroit scum blow (cuatro cincos!)
If you want it, IF got it, the gettin' is good
The best thing movin like a brick in the hood
I'm wishin you would stumble out the club
Fuck your slack (NIGGA) we can rumble out in floods
We fuck by choice but fight when we can
I'm good with the mic, but I'm nice with my hands
I ain't for bangin', unless the ass hangin'
My last name ain't Kelly, but give me brain bitch, c'mon

(Proof)
This is high octane that bang within block range
Nothin' but cold blood flow in my hot veins
My shot aim with the pistol ain't the issue
Got the title, ""Battle Disciple"" came to diss you
Let's get to The Source with mics all I need black
Cause 5 mics together, only makes feedback
I'm what every rapper +dread+ like beeswax
Snatch a rapper out his Timbs like stems on weed sacks
(He's back!) Bitch, I never left
Every step has been Proof to the fact that I'm evidence
That Detriot co-co locos
The flame slow flow where the snow blow and they roll 'dro
My tendencies to spit, end MC's real quick
Pass they Hennessy sips, enemies get ripped
The penalty in vially, your memory dissolve
The energy is wild, mentally I'm foul
The entity now, howls instead of growl
Already raw, cookin lookin' for shook ones to set 'em down
Don't worry about my record sales
(I know this ain't the same Proof that's in D12!)
Damn skippy, my hands swiftly grab a mic
Any man gifted stand with it, it's battle night
Soon as I get in the booth, spittin' the truth
This ain't for the Billboards, this is strictly for you

La-la la-la la-la la-la, pretend to sharrrrrre...
Da, da-da, ain't nothin', by D-Twellllllve...
Weed no seeds, last year Cannabis Cup
A druggie that mind hasn't been damaged enough
With danglin nuts I lust for angels to fuck
My cannon is tucked, move fast I panic and bust
Brain burnt out like a mechanical clutch
I'm too schizophrenic to touch
A scandalous bunch don't gamble with trust
Scammin for bucks, pink candy deluxe out mishandlin sluts
After a show bring all my fans on the bus
Next city, leave 'em dizzy, stranded and stuck
Hangin' in clubs like blacks in slavery
Gats we aim and squeeze at acts of bravery
Maybe speakers {?} bouncin' off of Shady Lee {?}
Can barely add, but still got A.D.D. (what I say?)
Work the do', make 'em play for keeps
I ain't gotta say shit till the A.K. shall speak
(Chorus: Proof)
To whom it may concern, this planet is fucked
Life ain't hard, so far I just managed to bluff
Scandal and drugs got my hands in some cuffs
Man it's been rough, but shit I don't plan to give up, uh
(Proof)
Speakin' at AA meetings while intoxicated
Trainin a arm-less fighter to box in Vegas
Plot with haters, they kill me on my block for later
Havin' free phone sex with operators
Next Grammy's your man P is rockin' Gators
Leavin' full with rabbit ears, I'm a pocket raider
Every block invaders, all cops is traitors
Any hood thief hands get burnt like hot potatoes
The hardest mayor that boycott garbage sayers
Thinkin' outside the box like Harvard Squares
Wild like Ben Wallace hair
Hate the niggaz that ain't spitters blow up off market favors (you!)
So from now on I'm startin terror
Aiyyo God, here I come, tell 2Pac to wait up
(Proof)
Got young famous that handle any further glory
Fix my son a lunch for school so he'll murder for me
Readin 'Pac and Pun tags up in pergatory
Waitin to get in heaven or ""Grimey,"" that's word to Nore
Anything you heard before me
Hah, it's simple like a street life suburban story
Turn my poor peeps into murkers for beef
Who the fuck is Jerry? I'm searchin for weed
And why did God make all these worthless MC's?
Still tryin' to find out for what purpose they breathe
My pops hit the weed and then he birthed a new breed
I hit bad bitches raw 'cause it's worth the disease
Hate the Ku Klux Klan, they abuse curtains and sheets
And I need 'em at home, but that's a personal peeve
The (Pills) is still (Purple) indeed
And I'm screamin loud as hell ""Fuck the Earth"" when I leave"
3,Black Wrist Bro's,2005,Searching For Jerry Garcia (2005),,Proof,"""Now, we must all fear, evil men
But there is another kind of evil, which we must fear most
And that is, the indifference, of good, men!""
(Proof)
Aiyyo duty, it's all about us, you hear me?
I'm only callin on us, now fear P'll die dumb
Lie none till my dawg lies the gun for my dawg
Have a nigga family run to the morgue
Gotta ID the body, for tryna touch mine
On some Bad Boy, Puffy shit, fuck Shyne
Fuck fame, you hear me? Don't try to touch my co-D
My roll D, protected like my O.G.'s
(1st Born)
So never say never, well forever dawg I'm rock witchu
Watch you hatin', contemplatin, waitin to take a shot at you
It's just me and you plus pistols duty cause niggaz talkin'
Least when we speakin' same dudes that felt the heat, stiff in chalk
We put it down on the block, these niggaz flagrant
Makin' statements indictin extra cases, needin an early placement
First and firm, never duckin and aim
Forever co-defendants Iron Fist, I'll fist out some serious pain
(Proof)
It's easy to be the coldest in life
But can you write your heart in a rhyme and spit your soul in the mic?
The streets talkin' a weak fall
They currently devour the soft but they never eat dawgs
Whether few others, two brothers and two mothers
In a blaze of a light, I bet it's two of us
Don't try to do some slick shit and die without it
'Cause I bet it on your life you gon' die without it
(1st Born)
Peep how I pound that ass and finger-fuck her
Blazin' Cools and market booze, the tools even single suckas
Black Wrist, Iron Fist all day
The S.K. spray, make niggaz move like ""RAY!""
For the fat funny guy, I jerk 'em like Jackie Gleason
Leave 'em standin indecent, wheezin needin a breathin treatment
In the middle of murk season, I flirt like a church deacon with death
Or at least until my last breath
(Chorus: Proof)
(Gun cocks) My dawg is me and you
To them tats on our right wrist we both bein true
Yo' needs is my needs, my seeds is yo' seeds
One hurt and we both bleed
We gon' ride till them wheels fall off
Or God wanna kill us off {*blam*}
I don't duck when you pop that gat
Don't ever doubt that you got my back
(1st Born)
We put our life stories in a song, boast how we pop nines
It's the truth duke and more than just a hot line
I got mine minus yours cause you hate it and squeeze
My niggaz down on they luck, y'all niggaz down on y'all knees
Holla at him, you holla at me
I'm down for whatever forever, however it gotta be
In the clubs or the streets, once these thugs feel this heat
Bats, snubs or the beef, with the love of the D
(Proof)
You want trouble with P then that's trouble with 1st
We carry weight on our back that's doubled this Earth
You know where we at, in the struggle to search
Come thug on my turf, leave your blood in this dirt
With the pride of your manhood I paved the bricks
Livin' life like a movie, it's a gangsta script
With my duty my co-star, been in two so far
Two hearts like rice with no R"

In other words what I'm sayin', don't ever fuck with a man with a match and aerosol cans stuck in his pants
Get a life, get a hustle, get a job, get a meal, get away from me, quite chasin me, get a deal
Girls tell me that I seem conceded, so here's your confidence back, along with some game you seem to need it
I had a fag slapped 'cause he came up to me with his backpack and said my albums was wack
'Cause it wasn't abstract, that's that (??) from before

I said yes you put your ego in check, we don't make threats and hide behind a email address

Name been on bubble since Salam dropped the Pyrex
Out to stack the cake up, my group will never break up
The world been sleep long enough, they better wake up
Don't sport a Jacob, bling just the same
Remain in the D, it's the kingdom I claim
Never leavin' the fame, born to be great
Walk to the door of a quarter till eight
Haters hate but they late with the jump off
I'm in the game to maintain, no reason to jump off, come on

""8 Mile"" was dope, Obie brought heat
Emile on the beat, 50 kept us in the street

Bankin they millions they all wanksters and squealers

Proof is a wolf, shit I told you from jump
In a fast lane, no change of road or the bumps
Game is sold not told so I hold a swollen tongue
In Detroit I don't go by P, I'm Colemen Young
Holdin' one with the tongue flow like Tiger Woods
Christina don't do it for me, shh, but Mya could
I am Suge to the rap game, rulin Purple Gang

My mind is so dark

Hit your body and your bones and not loose the grissle
Proof's official, D12 trademark
A man with no-S-big braveheart
Y'all ain't even listen
No-S-big backwards is Gibson
Mel Gibson bravehearted
Now on to my mission
And since there ain't no failure
I promised God to commit homicide to niggaz wantin a free ride
Like the Amistad
I'm alive
And just starting Anger Management Tour like bionic live
Part of ya mind
Dyin' to ride

Influenced the greatest
Like Ronnie and Todd
It ain't no problem too hard
My solo like Dolo
Been gettin' it
Like I ain't been shittin' it!

In high school of course I was the best in the lunchroom
Don't make me get up out my seat bitch
And punch you
I freestyle for fun but write for wealth
I'm so dope nigga even bite myself
I rap and will rappify you
Blasting iron at a baptist choir
And then at the black Messiah
We gat for hire
To let the techs growl
Put something in your body worse than the West Nile
I was born out of test tube glass
I suggest you blast nigga
Or catch some flesh wound fast
I ain't met a man that could wrestle gats
I'm right behind the top rappers like a Neptune track
Ya L.P.?
I slept through that
Now guess who back
Unless you strapped with a vest and two gats
I suggest you pack
I'll spread you flat then rescue rap
Hit your body so much that your flesh won't match
Mothafucker!
Fuck Osama for bombing in the racing buildings
I'll bust him and hide him like Jason Williams
(I heard Bizarre and D12 be raping children!)
Cut the hype dyke, I'm trying to make a million
Take this pill then call me when you sober up
Turn the dyke from glad to ?? make them hold my nuts
Seldomly seen, Elvis the King
But it's Em that's got these kids nailed to the screen
I held the team, I-F
I got something on my chest that's hard to digest
I hear the streets talk and sing
Offering
I'm checking my weapon
They mad 'cause I'm flossing bling
I lost my steam but a demon in human flesh hyped me up
Now my team is tightly cut
So sugar sugar, salt salt
If you didn't get off it's not my fault

8,Forgive Me,2005,Searching For Jerry Garcia (2005),,Proof,"(Proof)
Barely raised by my dysfunctional fam
Here I stand as a dysfunctional man
Quick-tempered, short-fused, and pissed at God
Demons pullin at my soul till it's ripped apart
Secret's out momma that fire I started it
Fuck the fireman logic of the closet by the wire shit
What's positive about a father that bust nuts then wussed up
And a momma that don't show her son enough love
Shit, that's why I run from my first son
And force these chickenhead bitches to get abortions
I'm married to game, my mistress is fame
My girl Paq the closest, she know I ain't gon' change
Go insane in a world evil as ours
I done shot at houses, people and cars
The deeper the scars, the worst is the history
God you ain't gotta forgive me, just don't forget me, you hear me?
(Chorus: 50 Cent)
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay, on top
I recall memories, filled, with sin
Over and over again... and again
(Proof)
And most importantly I'm tryin' to support my seeds
Can't seem to get away from them courtin fees
Embroidery, on my hood across my heart disorderly
Breakin in houses of people who ain't got more than me
Accordingly, I move in error
Gotta face the fact though I can't fool this mirror
Neglected my daughter and tryin' to blame on how I was brought up
Like I'm a product of this environment, why ain't I shot up?
Got up today like ""Why you let me breathe again?""
And with each breath I feel death is creepin' in
Thinkin' sinners are winners and I'ma finish last
My pen and pad record my life as each minute pass
Passin minutes, I shook sin and shook drugs
I did right by you but still you took Bugz
Then caught me in adultery, fought me
For not knowin' through the dark streets you walked me, talked to me
(Proof)
It's the bliss that's a rush so rush my wrists in the cuffs
It's like a fight for yo' attention and love
Speakin' of Bugz, give me a hint from above
If he not you know I wanna be sent when I'm done
Kid outta wedlock so my lady's frontin
I love Em, 'cause he gave me somethin'
A positive anything is better than a negative nothin'
I was on the edge of death ready to jump in
It's hard when you can't find love anywhere
And just because the reverend listen, don't mean he care
Pops on crack with a sufferin past
I dream in black and white, the world color me bad
Other than sad, painful and stress
Life is good with the webs that, tangle with death
Control the border, control the school
I have sinned amongst men and my soul is yours, yours"

Hella game plus sex, she got the play
""BRRING BRRING!"" (Can I suck your cock today?)
Yes you may babe, do lots of things
What good is havin' a head and not no brains?
She asked me if I know 50 and who made ""Tipsy""
Quick to get with me, quicker to get busy
She dizzy cause the Issey smell good on me
Plus she love to fuck, I mean the hood won't leave
Headed out the door and she pullin on my sleeve
Rubbin on my dick, bitch feelin' that E

Sippin the Moet Rose mixed with pu-ssy
Puffin the loosey, our frames by Gucci
She wanna roll with me 'cause I got major dough
Tell every ho up in here, you my favorite though

I'm really wonderin if you acceptin applications
I like them facin forward chicks with the bar bellies
I pass them young hoes off to Mr. R. Kelly
Gimme a bad bitch, that can make her ass shake
I don't want you nasty, I want you nas-tay
My last day on earth I'll be fuckin' a freak
That spend a half an hour just suckin my meat (yeah)
She don't even know me, said she love me so
She a dimepiece, so far from an ugly ho
If you drop-dead gorgeous I won't stand you up
Yeah you shake it like Beyonce but can you fuck?
(Proof)
I been doin' the Earl Flynt since about '88
A lot of people here wanna trade my place
Got a extra room where your babe can wait

Pop yo' collar, pop yo' collar

Hey that's gonna wrap it up

Hey, we gonna get up out of here
Gotta change the name of this town back to where we found it
We found it at Motown, that's where we gotta leave it!

You know you're on cloud nine fuckin' with me duke
Be sure that I'm the crisp man waitin to see Proof
Some say I'm high on life and I don't need your herbs
I'm gettin' high every time that you speak your words
Well I'm glad that means more for me son
I hit the bong so hard they call me green lungs
They say that I'm the buddah master, ""Rock Superstar""
You know the homie with the weed laced candy bar
Now I'm blazin' it non-stop, you feelin' me fam?

Off on a mission to find bitches for sausage lickin'
Engulfed in liquids, Xena's and perkasets

Nine times outta ten I'm high off the Henn'
Never lie for a trend tryna die on a binge
Biscuits is poppin', ain't no stoppin' like Hendrix and Joplin
Till I find out where Biggie and 'Pac went
Profit of coppin, most often is gobbled
Stackin my chips high till they auction a Pablo
Pills to swallow, momma don't cry I send you drugs
Tryna get my mind stuck ""In the Middle"" like Monie Love - whaaaat?

I semi-automatically spit flows at trash
Anatomically equipped to rip shows in half
If I speak a little fast you get whiplash
Promoters better get the kid cash or get whipped ass
Got some zig-zags and a dutch, let's get smashed
My little zip bags got more riders than Six Flags
And while y'all get gassed, I'm proceedin to get high
Got weed like Mary J. is (All I'm Needin) to get by
Tical motherfucker, run for cover when shit fly
One hand is on the lye, the other hand on yo' bitch thigh
How many wanna try, Mr. Meth and his clique? Yes
That's kinda farfetched like me passin a piss test
Okay, let's (Be-Real), here's the (Proof), we need cash flow

What up Detroit,
I'd like to welcome everybody to the,
First Annual Detroit Hip-Hop Recognition Awards.
Secondly I'd like to thank you for coming out
And supporting all of our events this year,
Especially the Awards show,
That means a lot to us. [Proof 1]
The vision behind the Award show,
Is to recognize our own,
Talents, feats and accomplishments,
Both locally and nationally.
With the community a part of the success of people like,
Eminem, D12, Obie Trice, Slum Village, Fat Cat,
Sick Notes, Fat Killers, Almighty Dreadnaps,
Raw C and Silent Riot, just to touch on a few.
The first award we'll be presenting tonight,
Is the Hip-Hop Recognition Award [Proof 2]
This Award is to recognize
The individual for outstanding support of Detroit Hip-Hop.
When I think of that,
One person stands out without a doubt.
From the days of the Hip-Hop shop,
To the days of multi-platinum record sales,
You'll see this guy on MTV Wednesday night,
Then you'll catch him at St.Andrews Hall Friday night hosting a battle. [Proof 3]
He's been around the world,
And still finds time to get back to the city.
That being said, it's both a pleasure and an honour,
To present the first Annual Hip-Hop Recognition Award [Purple Pills starts playing],
To none other than my man, Big, Proof!
(Proof 1)
Pssh, Damn man,
My city love me, I love my city man.
I feel like I'm lettin' 'em down,
I done so much,
But don't feel like I've accomplished, nothin' at all.
(Proof 2)
Hip-Hop...
I remember when me 'n' Hip-Hop first fell in love man,
Detroit and Hip-Hop, damn, pssh.
(Proof 3)
Psh, eh. 'Cause I ain't changin' for shit.
I'ma always be me"
15,Kurt Kobain,2005,Searching For Jerry Garcia (2005),,Proof,"(Proof Talking)
This my last letter right here
Fuck this world, let's get the fuck outta here
(Proof)
I put my soul through the ink
Bless a path with thoughts at my thoughts
Before I grow extinct
My back-bone disowned by zone
Why roam? called home
But now on I'm all alone
Just Proof, no shine, no friends, just fans
No wonder my hands, tight where the Internet ends
I take back most of the flack
The stress smokes, press me close to the crack
Like my pops, the ghost of my past
Dime and mud, JD and stucky
Lately I'm lucky, I don't hate me to touch me
Maybe I'm ugly inside, but smiling to make it
I love you dawg, and that's how ever you take it
The fame is a illusion, I'm still losing
In this game, with the rules and...
I feel clueless, the streets with the hills blue less
Cops knocking at the door, got me looking real foolish
But I still do this, like I love it, even though I thug it
Keep flossing lights in public, the subject y'all don't know
Stars won't grow, who would dream that scars would show?
Minus the MTV videos with slim
""Up In Smoke"" D-12, and many shows with Em
It's still me dawg, no change for change
It's strange, when it pours it rains
I take it back...
I wish I could take it back, I wish I could take it back
But it's too late
I wish I could take it back, I wish I could take it back
But it's too late
(Proof)
Always talking to snuk coke and he speak back
Wish my first son was here to reach at
Feeling detached
My brother Earl, and Wayne, that bail money for jail, y'all can keep that
I've been in deep before, ask (stalemen?)
My hearts melting, tell the truth, I need help man
I hearts big but by sins bigger
Fuck the world, I don't feel like I can win niggaz
It's like I'm lost and I find only demons
I wanna quit, it's like I'm tired of breathing
So my stress confess to a famous song
Em I love you, don't let this money change us dawg
1st born, when I'm gone, grab the sign
(Leave nothing?) with his cream and his mom
And dear mamma, I use to hate you
Now I relate to, everything you did to make proof
I love you...
Take it back
(Proof)
All y'all see is Free from 106 and park
Y'all don't know I risk my heart with this apart
From the streets, the groups, the friends, the foes
The jewels, the dick lickers and the hoes
What about me?
Sheltered with no guidance
Look at the finest, royal highness on some hot shit
Still living with the liquor and bud
Sometimes I wish for my demise, so I can kick it with Bugz
I wish it was real between us all
In the past, you should have seen us dawg
I die for Em and save Haley, brave maybe
But just let them tears remove my grave Shady
Kunive and Swift, how live is it get?
I meant to teach y'all niggaz to survive in this bitch
If we die to be rich, that makes me happy
And on another note, shit, don't hate me pappy
It's just that we look the same, you let the game take you
Your son came along and took the game
Since I took my own life, y'all feel a killa fo' sho'
Bizarre on the real, you're the realest nigga I know
Strapping and busting ain't real, just tell your man's the truth
And that's why you've always been friends with Proof
Answer to all, I've always lied with truth
And before I pull the trigger tonight, I'm proud of you..."

Drop out, no school
In fascinations and lacerations, assassinations
Threw, broke two
So cool, D12, we shall bank on y'all
No gold for rappin', man, platinum hang on walls
Ain't no bitch in me
You empty one clip, I empty three
Pop more than MTV
Lay a beat down, without an MPC
Them killaz in ya face, they were sent by me
No sympathy, tell ya kids, in ya face, it was meant to be
Big Proof, spit truth, never a lie
No individual get loose, better than I
Forever we high
Sly, but we never slurrin' my words
Occur in the nerves
I'm high? Fine
Bionic Super-Trooper with stamina
My antennas sense pussy in my parameter
The Janitor
I clean houses, in the meanwhile
*This is Guillotine Style*
Ain't nuttin' but dope in here
Like a fiend's mouth
Space Odyssey
I don't know what you've been told
Cross over, rappers hit me, oh!
My beliefs will never fold
I will not sell my soul (x2)
Pimpness, bitch, press, stage an' all
Glock fetish, hot-headed, throw a rage and brawl
Like Asian broad, y'all sucky sucky
My skills nocturnal, they super ugly
Y'all are fictional, I spit the real
I'm difficult
The White Sniff Inhale
Thug creature, teacher
Fill you with rap
Send rocks with my palm, nigga
And just mail you a slap
Smack! You won't listen, no joke
Please say that ain't roll 'fore your heart get broke
Shroom music, humour's Chasm's and Proof's
2 minutes and you finished, Mr. God-in-the-Booth
Lies to the youth, and just lies to the use
Fuck the truth, pass the boo
I'm tryna get high wit' you
I'll tell anyone before you got the gun n' draw
Y'all kill me cause rap ain't fun no more
Space Odyssey
I don't know what you've been told
Cross over, rappers hit me, oh!
My beliefs will never fold
I will not sell my soul (x2)"

(Repeat 2X)
There's nothing, there's nothing
There's nothing, no there's nothing
Won't lose it, can't lose it
There's nothing but this music
(Proof)
My mind is broke, too many lines of coke
Open mind for beefin, no reason I'ma choke
Time to quote somethin' you never heard
Pour my heart when I talk and spit it with every word
We ain't playin' no more, sayin' no more
No games no mourn, on the grind and we came for yours
In a four-double, Billboard trouble
This industry ain't ready for no more rebels
Kill at will, with the will to kill
Keep it real with steel, these pills'll feel
Proof for poppin', they used to joggin
I take out your block cause my future callin
Don't confuse it y'all, I used to brawl
{*Pop pop, pop*} Till your producer fall
Who's involved? They don't wanna do nothin'
Whoop style, I make 'em all move some'n
Clap the mag up, back the gas up
Leave 'em scrapped and smashed up, then wrapped in plastic
Ask the hood, this the platinum classic
Now quit the yackin bitch and pass the acid, c'mon
(Chorus: King Gordy)
What they want right now is a nigga with nothin' to lose
- Oh nothin' to lose
He got no shame in his game about the stuff that he do
- Oh the stuff that he do right now
Jump off stage right now nigga start punchin a fool
- Oh punchin a fool
Y'ALL BITCH, that's why we ain't fuckin' witchu!
- We ain't fuckin' witchu, no no
(Proof)
Hit the metal with devilistic tongues
Just frontin for the ghetto kissin' misfits to hum
Along with red and yellow biscuits to munch
Just think before you was never meant to come
Forever rich and dumb, brawl out any day
You heard Slim, we some all out ""Renagades""
To the end of days, put the scare away
Who better than D12? That's a sin to say
Can you follow this? Y'all swallow shit
Of politics, I like the {?} wrist
Taste the motherfuckin dust in this laced blunt
Take the world with me fool nigga like Pacewon
Ain't none ready slapbox for kicks
Pack box to spit and smack cops with dick
This is narcotics and dark knowledge that's symbolic
Sin sonic demonic and my heart's rotted
Make plans, on insanity sands
I'm like damn, too much in me Incredible Man
And I got a Grammy to chant in enemy land
I'm bustin' off on your block like Yosemity Sam
(Proof)
Uh, sittin' in here with a blunt and a ice cube
Plottin with Satan, to snatch guys light fuse
Didn't like school, I never liked you
I'm burnin Bibles while I'm sniffin on this white glue
Fight, dudes, blacks to white fools
Then act cocky, I'm Rocky, shit I might lose
What I got it I'm 'bout it 'bout it, about it
Lonely in life or see Christ without it
Victory is meant to be
Where my father has been has been a mystery
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma live it up
Gettin' drunk, get in clubs and I'm sellin off prescription drugs
And I miss you Bugz! I'm almost steady now
Proof is here, the world ain't ready now
If you gay you gay, you straight you straight
You violate today in the mistake you make, hey
Are you swallowin? Hey lil' finger pop
Don't need a greasy college to see you drop
Proof the king of bars hit the pretty coffin
I'm like a sucker punch (why?) 'Cause I ain't seen it often
Genius artist, so retarded
Broken hearted, my soul's like a open target
And I'm ready to leave Earth
You step to my death next year on my T-shirt

Aiyyo, she a freak and I love the way she move to the beat
Ass and titties bouncin', she ain't movin her feet
Put 20 in her bra, stiff dick had many in her jaw
Probably hit plenty in the raw (nasty bitch)
I wanna see this bitch naked on my livin' room flo'
And yo bitch, I ain't givin' up no dough, fo'sho'
You can be my best friend but Em might get mad
Don't call me Daddy bitch, I fuck better than your dad
Let me get up in that ass like I'm ridin' horseback
Fuck a sponge, I need a tool to clean my ball sack
I pop my collar, don't pop your bra strap
If you hang up the phone then bitch don't call back
18's on ice, you ain't seen that befo'
Actin' like you ain't seen my bling through the do' (bling)
I move to a ho, just for one reason
Cause bitches need 9-1-1 for no reason

I never treat 'em like they wanna be treated, bitch beat it
Your purpose'll be defeated if you think that you're needed
Now what do you tell a chick who has two black eyes?
You ain't gotta tell her nothin', you just told her twice
And I don't wanna put my hands on ya, I got a plan for ya
Get with my man's, he gon' lay a couple grand on ya
So fresh and so clean, she know the routine
It's such a - wonderful thing, money flow like ravines
They say ""Kuniva, get a clothin line"" but I'ma chill
'Cause when cotton ain't sellin pussy always will
And these women they be knowin' the deal
That's why these niggaz be blowin' a mil' just to keep a ho in they grill
And I ain't never been a pimp, I'm somethin' like one though
I fuck 'em and leave 'em, you always love or like that ho
Cashin 'em out, they never get ahold of my chains
They only get that swollen up thang, I'm showin 'em game

Hah, you was a sucka when you met her, she dogged you cause you let her
See I tell a bitch quick, if you knew better you'd do better (bitch)
They realizin I ain't havin' that shit
Don't be surprised, I'm hypnotizin every tramp that she with
I send 'em out like Vanity 6 and I mean that
I'm doggin they ass, I'm in joggin pants and a V-neck (hah!)
I put my foot up in her ass so fast
That she'll forget how to spell ""cash,"" she hoe'in with a cast on
And I'm knowin' just what happened that day
He didn't pay cause you let him take you to a matinee (I saw you)
You get slapped that way, you can't dodge the drama
I'm pimpin' aunts and mamas, I collect from massage parlors (want my change)
Menage-a-trois is really second nature
I have 88 bitches straight takin' it to the face {Ah!}
And uh, I can give a fuck about a relation
Either open your legs, or get the play, stupid bitch

Hey, you know I gotta say somethin' on this track.
Well I'm not a pimp or a player, see I'm more like the mayor
Grab a bitch up by her hair like I just don't care
And swing her in the air (Ah!) I'm talkin' major ass kick
Toss a bitch out the house like Kwame Kirkpatrick
I'm a PIMP, so I give a fuck about a BITCH
But I don't make 'em trick, I'm RICH (whoo!)
I don't need the chips, they don't walk the strip
But I could spit some game and I could talk some shit
I'm somethin' like a pimp, similar to a mack
I ain't makin' the news, I make my baby mama pick up the slack
Drop Cadillac, truck {*phone rings*} fuck, I gotta go
That's my bottom ho pagin me back - I'm a pimp

It's 7 o'clock, bitch you ain't got my money?
I'ma beat yo' ass {*girl giggles*} you think it's funny?
Bitch get on the block in some dirty tube socks
And get shot by a cop in some Reeboks (yeah!)
Bitch I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Keep suckin dick, till you get a hundred grand

It's your boy DJ Seven-Duece
It's a lot of hoes in here fellas, ha hah!
So why you lookin' at that other nigga?
Ha hah! All the ladies with burgundy hair get in free!
Heh, I got live on stage
Purple Gang and B.U., let's go!
(Verse One)
Feelin' old as ever man I came with a buzz
Two shots, beer in my hand, I'm gettin' drunk
Pills kickin in and my eyes gettin' lowwww
Reek of heat, cologne mixed with hydroooo
Ice grillin niggaz with the Roley on the WRIST
Two steps, hands in the air, this my SHIT
Look at shorty light-skinned, damn she's so thick
How she poppin', I can't wait till she drop it on my DICK
I ain't in the mood for pistol poppin'
But we can get it poppin' if you be gettin' outta pocket I'm good
'Cause when I'm in the club I'm usually off a Bud
With a hundred Purple Gang thug niggaz, I'm Hollyhood
If you can't really handle my team, so think the plan out
You runnin' low on yo' cream, I'm rubber band out
Been gettin' money like the only thing to get
You run up talkin' reckless, dude I tell 'em this
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
I'ma knock you ouuuuut
You keep runnin' yo' mouuuuuth
Here's how it's gon' beeeee
I can't see it no other way, I gotta be me
(Verse Two)
I ain't dancin, I got a cup and I'm posted on the wall
Won't get too drunk cause niggaz might open up a brawl
You holdin' on a broad and you off of some liquor
And she got your mind blown so you offer to lick her
Don't care about flossin my nigga
Reason you see a bitch every day cause you look in the mirror
Spill some beer on my kicks and you catchin a fist
So hold your drink, don't be tough and go mess with a bitch
V.I.P. with somethin' sharp in my boot
Just in case you got beef and wanna start with my group
Hoes eyes on me when I step in the club
They don't fuck with button-up boys, they wanna mess with a thug
Coward niggaz see me comin' so they exit the place
Hundred deep and we don't care about catchin a case
Stop lyin' by the gun that rest on your waist
Before you on the flo' where niggaz two-step on your face
(Verse Three)
Uh, yeah
Anywhere that my crew party the freaks all on us
And valet get the keys with peace signs on 'em
Any club that I'm at, I walk right through
The hoes wanna sexually assault my crew
I ain't handcuffin a bitch, unless it's to a bedpost
But slip up with your chick, we take her
Get buck if you wanna, I throw a couple apes on your heels
And I talkin' 'bout the kicks from Asia
I get a lot of hate cause my clique is major
So I furnished the inside of the boots with razors
The owners get mad, they like
""Fame, we got enough strobe lights, please remove the bracelet""
I'm on the dance floor where the hoes all sweatin
Though I get love from the roped off section
When I pop bottles you can get your whole crew wet
Screamin Purple Gang while we doin' the two-step"
23,Sammy Da Bull,2005,Searching For Jerry Garcia (2005),,Proof,"(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
All these niggaz talkin' 'bout what they gon' kill
Heard you caught a misdemeanor then I heard you squeal
Holdin' hands with the D.A. while you made your deal
Three thousand miles away and I could hear you still
Half these niggaz snitchin yo and that's for real
I know it's hard to swallow, that's a big ol' pill
If I catch you motherfuckers you gon' catch some steel
I know it might sound crazy, that's the way I feel
(Proof)
Uh, trace this to it's basis, no movie script
No yay, no pounds, no uzi clips
Not a car, no bling, know a bougie bitch
You got all of these rappers sayin' they movin bricks
They whole cliques switch with boob and tits
If you're - truly bitch, then they'll - usually snitch
In a roundabout way I say my toolies spit
But if it come to coppin a plea, it includes the fifth!
The mood is flipped cause spirits see the diaphragms
Gangsta rappers with murderers for hired hands
Police and riot vans, callin us pirate clans
Government guide hands, with private plans
To damage the game, it's a shame to survive a scam
'Cause we high off liquor, bitches and Vicadin
Yell out we gon' strike again, so triflin
Got kids idlin the vest to riflin (look Ma!)
Why you make a fake life in pens?
Glorify the hood but never a Bible hymn
And as the streets keep tyin in
Until the Feds indict the fans just for buyin in, where's the violin?
(Swifty McVay)
Hah, are you the guy that told the guy that I'm the guy that gave the guy
A half a P; now the police is after me
Askin me questions, tellin' me shit you only knew
Pulled up on me out the blue, all this shit because of you
Watch to do somethin' cool bitch, snitchin like Samuel Bull
Now yo' life's fucked up, and I'm announcin you responsible
And I'm cut the fuck up, and whatchu gonna do but sit yo' ass there
So what? Ain't nothin' fair
When a nigga like you get carried away without your lips
And they wonderin why Swifty McVay be killin' shit {Ah!}
I drop you off and get lost, come back the same day
Witcho' tongue cut off nigga, it's cursed anyway
You the one who can't count, so give my G's up (straight up)
And when it comes to shootin you the one who freeze up
That's why yo' broke ass could swallow these nuts
And folks ask, tryna follow everything that reads up
On your report you made, I will escort you to your grave
Tryna see me behind bars so you can get paid?
That's negative, you threaten my life? I CAN'T let you live
Then you think that it'll catch up to your momma and your kids snitch {Ah!}
(Proof)
If you aim for slugs that's blazed by killers
Now the game done changed these niggaz out here praisin squealers
Go Proof - my behavior's iller when tellin' the truth
Expunge my gun nigga like any paid felon'll do
My spoken is well in the truth, you in hell and the Proof
From the block to the jail or the booth
Bod boy image shall illuminate in silence
Gangsta, one that communicates through violence
Go Proof - not through yappin or hostile rappin'
All on TV vest up and glocks go flashin
It's all actin' - y'all just
Don't see the director behind the camera that yells out ""Action"" (take one!)
Blowin' off the door hinge to a world in orbit
Where the masses have supportive recorded performance
There's enormous shortage of poor kids
With new deals, they will become distorted and tortured
And I ain't losin like 'Pac, there's rules on my block
I'm from Detroit bitch, it ain't cool to be shot (gunshots)

(Yeah yeah, I think so)
(All right great, let's sign him!)
(Outro: Proof)
Heh, aiyyo dig this
If you tell the masses, you tell the cops
But if that street yappin made you famous, then you a star
Star; hey, write down ""star""
Write down ""star"" on a piece of paper
Hold it up in front of you, right in the mirror
Put it in the mirror
Hold it up in front of you, and that's YOU

I see the Henny and I guess it's aight
Cause it ain't have the bars then take a step of your life
(T-3)
Yeah I stepped out the background when my nigga Dilla left
Didn't see the full picture, maybe just a rough sketch
Didn't know the dude for real, they knew a silhouette
Small portion who I was when I turned and looked back
Had a few tools, had to learn to work that
Plus they cut a nigga out, say I wasn't worth jack
The trials of your man, I'm not complainin
I'm sayin' the truth y'all exactly how it's layin
So when you see me don't think it was easy
Things wasn't fair to me, your man T-Threezy
I had to work to eat, I wasn't supposed to be
I did a flow like boats on seas
Now I'm the captain of my own destiny
I stand at the edge of this shit, control my feats
I rearrange things that could've remained bleak
Cause you ain't doin' the same, don't mean you should hate me
(Mudd)
Damn, it's hard hustlin with your crew
When you the head of your troops and dudes don't wanna grow up
Attitude is so what, nig's out here killin' 'em
Dude's draggin his feet, I ain't got time to deal with him
Look at the time dime, how many years it's been
Since we moved back from Brooklyn?
You lookin' sorry dawg, pardon me I'm your man's, this ain't no diss
But I don't see no good in you if you don't handle yo' biz
Yo' angle is, is bored and stubborn
Quick to say fuck whoever and still want somethin' for nothin'
Streets talked about your loose lips, remember when Proof flipped
Threw a cassette tape at you, you ain't do shit
Exactly, I woulda been scrappin if that was me
When the Feds came to swoop you turned your back on T
I ain't sayin' you snitch but your actions are smellin like fish
You still smackin your bitch, too old to be actin' like this
Man chill
(Proof)
I ain't tryin' to find no blame, or make excuses
I figured y'all slept so long I'll wake the rooster
I love hip-hop and just makin' music
In the ""8 Mile"" flick I was portrayed as Future
On the set I was due, where's the rest of my crew
For the movie, this is truly our destiny dude
I'm like Shady is my team, maybe it's a dream
It seems I'm bein choked like Radio Raheem
P knew it when G-Unit all got deals
Imagine a muscle have to hustle, that's why it feel
I'm walkin' out of different people office still
This ain't a diss, this is just talkin' real

Bitch you off your poor tricks, war with natural ability

I'm smackin' the enemy with accurate agility
Attack your facility then it's back on my killin' spree
Jigga and Nelly is cool, it's the wack ones that's killin' me
While Clinton got head I was in the sack with old Hillary
The fact I'm an ill MC strapped with artillery
Got your family at your funeral clappin' with misery
It could happen to him or me, rather the other way
Baretta bust his face, pillow over the widow watch her suffocate
Doody, you rather tough today
Calm down muh'fucker, you rather rough today
Fuck the dumbness, run this rap shit, clap with the steel
Dump the gun quick, punk lips come back with his grill {*BLAM*}
Half the times rapin' Florida Evans
Kick the door off a church, went in and slaughtered the reverend
It's a quarter to seven

One punch and the further you float, the hurdle the ropes
Slap Jesus five then I ride to murder the Pope
Every word is for dope, don't say you heard it befo'
Once off of that, and get your lip services broke
I preferred it was wrote, D-12 has spoke
That The Source magazine give the unworthiest quotes
I serve you with notes, snares, bass kicks and hi-hats
Punchlines, skills, and Proof with mind raps
I'm a Venus flytrap with a bazooka and shit stains
Huntin' for flies, doin' lines with Rick James
I ain't scared of Suge or Death Row
Ask Bush which is more dangerous, a airplane or a pretzel?
You're reachin' for toast, put three in your coat
For bein' too close like you speakin' to ghosts, and I'm fleein' the coast
When the gat clicks you see blackness
In the darkness your carcass is next to catfish
This is real insanity
So fuck that pilot that crashed Aaliyah, we gon' kill your whole family
