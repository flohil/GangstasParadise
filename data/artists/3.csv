""'Cause when I flow the for the street.."" - "".. who else could it be""
""Nas..""
(Nas)
Yo
Explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, easywider paper
Pops puffin his sess, punchin his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon and Chungo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin
Livin' carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks y'all don't hear me
Yo I'm in my second childhood
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
""'Cause when I flow the for the street.."" - "".. who else could it be""
""N-A-S"" - ""Nas..""
""Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.."" - ""Queensbridge""
""Make everything right.."" - ""Get yours, nigga""
(Nas)
Yo, dude is 31, livin' in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin, got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since, eighty-five well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood
(Nas)
Baby girl she's always talkin' name droppin' hangin' late
Drinkin' smokin' hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin'
E poppin' Ecstasy takin', won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin, stuck with limitations
Lustin men, many hotels, Fendi Chanel
With nothin' in her bank account frontin she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin, mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin she the same person, never matures
All her friends married doin' well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life, guess she's in her second childhood
""Who else could it be.."" - ""N-A-S"" - ""Nas.."""
1,"A Message to the Feds, Sincerely, We the People",2004,Street's Disciple (2004),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"(Verse 1: Nas)
I walk the block like whatever god, my message to y'all feds
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads
Abrochrombie and Finch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Viewmount
Otisville, Newasberg, Fort Dicks, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain till the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though
Stayin' on my hus-tle
(Beat change)
(Verse 2: Nas)
A message to those who trapped us up, from federal guys who backed them up
We never will die, we black and tough, lead in your eye, we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast, look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens, even the Congo needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies pullin' on innocent women and children
It wasn't no ghetto killers who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But I'm not gon' cry, and I'm not gon' just stand and watch you die
I'ma pass you a .9, I'ma grab your hand -- come on let's ride
A message to those who killed the king, who murdered the Christ
The same regime, what God has built you never can break
What God has loved you never can hate, man makes rules and laws
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from
Whenever that day comes, forty-acres, plantations, see every race won
Sincerely yours, Street's Disciple, revelations"
2,A Queens Story,2012,Life Is Good (2012),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica, Queens in his black truck
Timbs was 40 below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you, it's foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money, too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could've died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November thirtieth, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y'all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, 8th Street, twin buildings
Vernon, can't even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap, though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey's ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home, Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for D.U, say what up to Snatch, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through
Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team
On 118, my nigga Ben fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock & Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
(You all know how the story go)
Any other real niggas in the world besides us, I ask?
Probably is, but odds are we'll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you D.U
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patr√≥n, Hennessy, and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real O.G cause back in nine-three
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie's gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now, but you know I'm still mental, but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers
Hold it down, I told ya
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling
Watch the con realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not, it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me, probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went?
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit?
Bo cooking blow, fucking slay that, where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers
Hold it down, I told ya
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rollinExplaing"
3,Accident Murderers,2012,Life Is Good (2012),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"(Featuring: Rick Ross)
(Verse 1: Nas)
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you comin', he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through, but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aiight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standin' next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, cause of a
(Hook- Nas)
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of them, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just a accident murderer
(Verse 2: Rick Ross)
We grew up doin' graffiti
Now hollows is gettin' heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly gettin' weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck 'em all, we ballin' till they come lock us up
Twenty to life, I'm clubbin' blowin' twenty tonight
We the Marlboro, Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a tec off the shelf, live forever that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodgin' my clique
Hundred check, I use your bitch for some bargainin' chips
In a hole, sell your home nigga don't sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't
(Bridge: Nas)
Accident murderer, accident murderer
You just an accident murderer
(Verse 3: Nas)
Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sista?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessin'
Tell me who you impressin'?
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make 'em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playin' wrestlin'
Watch 'em grow to a man, I see them now they reppin'
But they cold-blooded, homie, wonderin' where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they killin', they reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Fake till my nigga draws, what you want a name? Tell me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary"
4,Affirmative Action,1996,It Was Written (1996),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"This is what... this what they want huh?
This is what it's all about...
What? Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, youknowImean?
Niggaz comin' sideways thinkin' stuff is sweet man
Yknahmean?
Niggaz don't understand the four devils:
Lust... Envy... Hate... Jealousy
Wicked niggaz man
Yo, sit back relax catchin contacts, sip your cog-nac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack, a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines, and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who pull the late, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break, undress 'em tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettucini Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politicking daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die - he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin, they found his head on
The couch with his dick in his mouth, I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up on your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with, niggaz that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream, and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggaz to fiends
U-Conn's and ninja black Lexus, 'Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it
Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewellery sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding up-state
And now the projects, is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke, know how to expand coke, and Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
""Life's a Bitch,"" but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at Demars
Movin cars, your top papi Se√±or Escobar
In the black Camaro
Firm deep all my niggaz hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel, I got visions of multi-millions
In the biggest bundle, in the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
He money bags got Moet, Sean Don
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team we shitting hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega, and Escobar
I keep a fat marquis piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the 'Bridge
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jewel, sipping Cristies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh!
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggaz in Marcy
The Gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Papa Chula spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture, the bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper, he had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait it's half and half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half, get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen, now add the other two that 'Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred, cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three, we got three quarters of another key
The Firm baby, volume one uh..."

Verse One: Foxy Brown
Check it, uh
Protect this, nigga for the necklace
I throw the death wish, the pretty slim sex shit
The rep this, remember Fox said this
We on some next shit, we are blessed this
The scares on our backs mean we met this
The lie for them, for 25 sentence
To keep my eyes on 'em, I straight knowin' when the light shine on 'em
Shitty drugs and drama, oppposite three pretty thugs and a don momma
Fillin' the rest, the steel in they chest
And Boogs threw the kiss of death, it was over
And we laid out, chill I was open off the way he ate out
It was real, for real I was fuckin' wit' mills and he was frag-ile
We wowin', the brown stallion
Stay stylin', on the low foulin'
The whole Firm woulin', we lucked it
I know the trick bitch he fuck with, on some duct shit
Heard through the grade that she sucked it, Firm Sos and Esco
Mad loco, Fox and Mega for whatever and through this chedda
We gon' stay family, till we fry though
The fam will never split even if one of us die though
Along with our get go's, we gon' blaze till it brick-o's
Peep the na na, sweet taboo
The Firm tattoo on the tha tha, now tell me what crew
Hold it down like we do da da
Verse Two: Az the Vizuiliza
Till the death of this, murderous moves pursue effortless
Ice neckalce, high priced dressed executives
Peep the grammar, flim built strong stamina
Forty-four nickel plate long with the silencer
Play for keeps in shut eye you stay sleep shit
Remain deep in ???? thrown at ya veins jeeps
Juiliani suite got all the kings goin' up for creek
Devil like biz now, who left his twirl in the streets
No intelligence, stritcly slow niggaz minds with ????
It's evident, Feds mess up paid ya residents
We all for livin', heavyweight Firm division
Mine, I check mine ?Iaswines? is my religion
You know the stees, take aim, cock and squeeze
It's the prophecies, got the philosciphies Socrates
Next up
Verse Three: Cormega
Yo I believe that's me (yo Mega represent for the family)
Aye yo, the Feds fot me in the top ten, 'cause when my door got knocked in
A four four man's hoped in, my sinister mind
Shines like a Dilinger, Mega exhaulted Babyface crime emperor
Yo life is based on cultures and creeds, and feed the way
Be the thug nigga sess, I've seen niggaz tied up
Handcuffed and ????, cold crisis is live when drugs supply driver
The Millennium drives up, rimes and my blinds ya eyes temporarily
Nas and Mega be heavily armed for felony, John you could never see
The next fat cat of NYC, It Was Written like ghetto life heirogriphics
Livin' since my real niggaz bailed me out of prision, a lot of scams
Cause the narcotics beamin', Queens had marked dollars
And the knowledge of thieves, my dream is the legacy
Of my penetentary, fake thugs couldn't even take gloves to burry me
Verse Four: Nas Escobar
To all theroughbreds takin' the corners, y'all need to join us
Firm most powerful nation of rap performers, high class generals
Confidence, payin' lawyers
Swift as Oscar Delaholia, green berett warriors
Fakes I keep them like the John Kennedy tape, in the new with two
Bustin' all in they face, I'm never worried cause your see through
My man built the Sugar Hill from sweet tooth, we all eat
'Cause we I speak truth, uneducated black youth
Street diploma, teach Greeks and Romans but the legacy was stollen
It's a Firm thing, generally green I wrote the theme
On how to sell a million while ya cats are mad at ya promotion team
I roll with the nice as Fox, black ice pushin' whips without a license
Yeah, tight as five strokes, Nas got 19 wifies
Seven sheisty, nine of them Piceses
Three white meats under tight cheese, woulin'
Big links is heavy like bricks, used to want a pitbull
While feedin' them raw steak, it's core take
More cake, I take the time off the so-called king of the town
And lock it down"

Morning to you love
Hey, I say I say
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
The black oasis
Ancient Africa the sacred
Awaken the sleeping giant
Science, Art is your creation
I dreamt that we could visit Old Kemet
Your history is too complex and ridig
For some western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions
We praised bridges that carried us over
The battle front of Sudanic soldiers
The task put before us
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Who are we today?
The slums, deceases, AIDS
We need all that to fade
We cannot be afraid
So who are we today?
We are the morning after
The make shift youth
The slave ship captured
Our Diaspora, is the final chapter
The ancetral lineage built pyramids
Americas first immigrant
The Kings sons and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect, the first philosophers, astronomers
The first prophets and doctors was
Now can we all pray
Each in his own way
Teaching and Learning
And we can work it out
We'll have a warm bed
We'll have some warm bread
And shelter from the storm dread
And we can work it out
Mother Nature feeds all
In famine and drought
Tell those selfish in ways
Not to share us out
What's a tree without root
Lion without tooth
A lie without truth
You hear me out
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Ye lord
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May some more love come
Yesterday we were Kings
I'll tell you young blood
This world is yours today

The radio the news everyday I am -i don't know but that's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of being admired that I just wish that I would die or get
Fired
Just stop with the lables and stop the the fragles I'm tired yes I'm so tired
Of hearing my name oh my name wherever I go I just can't sit or relax when I'm
Eating with my daughter so peacefully
Corus:
Iam whatever you say I am if I wasn't then why wuold I say I am in the paper
The news everyday I am I don't know that's just the way I am
And they ask the same f... question what school do I go to
What hood I grew up in and the why and the where and it's freeking me out
I'm grabing my hair when I'm spitting it out and I'm losing my patience I can't
Take it I'm covering my ears and I'm thankful for everyfan that I get, but i
Can't take a s... in the bathroom without someone standing by it"
9,America,2008,Untitled (2008),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"(Verse One - Nas)
If all I saw was gangsters comin' up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung to
Cling to, I rolled myself up to become one
Ain't you happy I chose rap? I'm a monster
Streets they see me, they can't believe my achievements
Cultural-strata, persona is that of a non-needer
'Cause I don't need nada except for Prada beaver
From cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
Tell my G's don't flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies don't freeze at funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix
Caked up trying to take what I'm eatin'
Came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy mouth, while hardly a man's man
Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebels and Stella McCartneys
For years, all that how can I not be dead?
This old German said I was a thug with a knotty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wondered where I got my bread
Probably all the stones he see, from my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme, my story is: I'm from the home of the thieves

This is not what you think it is
America
Pay attention
This is not what you think it is
(Verese Two - Nas)
Blessed, the Lord is a G, he gotta be
Whose the god of suckers and snitches? The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew a death kiss to Fidel
Castro
He want me to spit this only the strong survive
Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I could see
White cop acquitted for murder
Black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make stop you and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers, athletes and actors
But not enough niggas at NASA
Who gave you the latest dances, trends and fashions?
But when it come to residuals they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even the white tees, blue jeans and red bandanas
(Hook - Nas)
America
Pay attention
Wake up
America
This is not what you think it is
America
Pay attention
This is not what you think it is
America
This is not what you think it is
(Verse Three - Nas)
Assassinations, diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people, built a new nation
Involuntary labor took a nice little women
Even took a premature baby, let a man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700s
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Let her sit on the Senate and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair 
She read about herself in the Bible believin' she the reason sin is here
You played her with an apron like ""bring me my dinner dear""
She the nigga here, ain't we in the free world?
Death penalty in Texas killed young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in a double R casualty
Buggin' how I made it out the hood, dazzle me
How far we really from third world savagery?
When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be

(Vers 1: Nas)
Yeah, check it, uh
Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard lil' longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough, wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin' 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin' is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin' to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice - I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MC's, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MC's on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody as the hood as my councilman, uh

It's rarely men conversatin' on ends, probably businessmen
I sense good taste, and they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm try'na keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Says, ""Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a Black hoe""
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most woman who love Jeevanji of Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve to earn man's purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh

Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit

I don't care about the runaways
I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS
But I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think they're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane
As long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates
They burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way (Nas: Uh)
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight

11,As We Enter,2010,Distant Relatives (2010),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"As we enter
Come now we take you on the biggest adventure
Must be dementia, that you ever thought
You could touch our credentials, what's the initials?
You be Jamrock the lyrical official
Send out the order, laws and the rituals
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth we big news, we hood heroes
Break past the anchor, we come to conquer
Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka
And I got the guns
I got the ganja
And we could blaze it up on your block if you want to
Or haze it up stash box in a Hummer
Or you could run up and get done up
Or get something that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us
Direct from us, street intellectuals
And I'm shrewd about decimals
And my man'll speak Patois
And I can speak rap star
Y'all feel me even if it's in Swahili
Habari gani
Nzuri sana
Switch up the language and move to Ghana
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers
Rhythm piranhas
Like true Obamas, unfold the drama
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
Queens to Kingston
Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom
Rise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes
Realize you can die any instant
And I can hear the sound of a voice
When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen
Snitching, I can see him pissing on hisself
And he's wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it
Switching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly
Come around and be persistent
That's how you end up in a hitlist
Ain't no bad man business
No evidence
Crime scene, fingerprint-less
Flow effortless
Casual like the weekends
No pressure when
We're comfy and decent
We set this off beasting
Hunting season
And, frankly speaking...
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown

Nothing like them eighties summer NY days
Hop on the NB5 days
Mopeds, pro keds, city split five ways
How it all started, fifth floor apartment
A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects
A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners
Now chillin' with ? enjoying massages
Check out the oracle, bred from city housing
Nas, higher risin' dead?
I remember seeing Shan chillin' in his Audi"
13,Big Girl,1999,Nastradamus (1999),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba
I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it in your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today
I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
'Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the law
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
'Cause you're a big girl now
Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking 'bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say ""Oh God""
Every hoe that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, Ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl see the world is yours

Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines

The last time, I swear to y'all
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killas crawl
And snitches call police
All these niggas and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas in cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Betta slow up
Before you get your ass on up
Nigga never gonna grow up
Drinkin' the Henney
But he know he gonna throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? The future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted and ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace chasin' the papas
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things
(1st Chorus)
I ain't fuck with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gonna rhyme wit you
'Cause now I'm into big things
You know I can't do that shit no more
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gonna stand on the corner
I'm into big things
Now the talk is small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style Imma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I'm glad y'all stopped and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga nod
Rocks are glistenin'
Can't stop my mission
Make anotha LP drop
I'm hittin'
With the new shit exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!
(1st Chorus)
I go past y'all
Y'all got the glass jar
And when I hit it, admit it
Y'all on y'all ass y'all
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gun up the dough
You want to score
But you really don't want to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me
Is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out
Where ya clique now
Where you sit now
In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles
And I pack heat
Make you run laps
Like a pro athlete
An' I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
Imma tell you what's real
An' what could stop you from makin' a mil
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high wit you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'
Not for forever
At least to 140
Pray for me
I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown on Berry Gordy
Good God
(2nd Chorus)
Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Now the talk is small talk
'Cause now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things"

A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take him shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishing I could be the one man; but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - following week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up mah, fronting like you naive
Pusherman's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!
Chorus: JoJo Hailey
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs
And there goes... a black girl... lost
(Nas)
Like Isis, she got you heart broke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who's ever getting down and trifeless
To get his mind all you do is give him something priceless
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)
There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice tricking on you, you never listen
To this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home wanting more from a college degree
(Nas)
Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop them off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you being lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost
(JoJo Hailey)
You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong
Black girl... *fades out*"

]
They said this day would never come.
They said our sights were set too high.
They said this country was too divided;
Too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose.
They Said, They Said ...

And though it seems heaven sent,
We ain't ready to have a black President
And though it seems heaven sent,
We ain't ready to have a black President
Yes We Can ... Change the World (Change the World)
(They Said!)
(Verse 1: Nas)
They forgot us on the block
Got us in the box
Solitary confinement
How violent are these cops?
They need an early retirement
How many rallies will I watch?
I ain't got it in me to march
I got a semi to spark
The game's in a drought
Public housing, projects
Cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique
Either getting money
Or running from homicide trial
That's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich
Still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius
To whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge
Now living with my feet up
Never defeated
So a president's needed
Y'know these colored folks and Negroes
Hate to see one of their own succeeding
America, surprised us
And let a black man guide us

What's the black pres. thinkin' on election night
Is it how can I protect my life?
Protect my wife?
Protect my rights?
Every other president was nothin' less than white
'Cept Thomas Jefferson and mixed Indian blood
And Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like 'what the fuck', loadin' they guns up
Loadin' up mines too, Ready to ride
'Cause I'm ridin' with my crew
He dies - we die too
But on a positive side,
I think Obama provides Hope - and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try and love one another, so many political snakes
We in need of a break
I'm thinkin' I can trust this brotha
But will he keep it way real?
Every innocent n!gga in jail - gets out on appeal
When he wins - will he really care still?
I feel ...

I mean
This is what you expected ain't it?
Let's Go
Uh Uh [repeated]
Turn the music up in the headphones
Yah, that's perfect
You gotta take your time by making a nigga wait on this muthafucka
Make a nigga mad and shit like
Niggaz usually start rapping after 4 bars nigga go in
I could start dancin on this muthafucka, yeah
We just come out of nowhere
I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for dem
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly end up back in the hood, like fuck it then
Huddling over the oven, we was like brothers then
Though you was nothing another then the son of my mother's friend
We had governin', who would have thought the love would end
Like ice cold albums, all good things
Never thought we'd sing the same song that all hoods sing
Thought it was all wood grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all of the disaster that one could bring
Could bring? Should blame the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain
Forever be in debt and that's never a good thing
The pressure of success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out of the worst in every person, even the good saint
But though we rehearsed it, it just ain't tha same
When ya put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things like cars, jewelry, and this thing
Jealously, ego and pride and this brings
It all to a head, like a coin, chit ching
The root of all evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the post and the point
This puts the ring in jeopardy. (It definitely).
I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for em
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, I'm like fuck it then
I feel like black militant, taking over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love em
Can't clean up my act up for good, too much thug in em
Probly end up back in the hood, I'm like fuck it then
I'm back in the hood, they're like ""Hey Nas""
Blowin' on purp, reflecting on they lives
Couple of fat cats, couple of A I's
Dreamin' of fly shit, instead of the grey skies
Gray 5's, hate eyes, wishin our reign dies
Pitch sling pies, and niggaz they sing ""why?""
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jailtime
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building,
I'm feeling the whirlwind of beef I inhale in,
Just like an acrobat, ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire
Sippin 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness, against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid turn to illegal for commerce, to get his feet out of them Converse (that's my word).
I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for em
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, I fuck it then
I feel like black militant, taking over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love em
Can't clean up my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, I'm like fuck it then"

(Nas)
Yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be tellin' you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out strugglin, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killin' shorty future, I wonder how do we last it
Underground in they casket? Ancestors turnin'
I'm learnin somethin' every day, there is no Lazareth
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggaz is chillin', gettin' high, relaxin
Envisionin, ownin shit, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give a brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
For reperations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop bein controlled, we black zombies
(Chorus: (sung))
Walkin' talkin' dead, though we think we're livin' (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, followin the system (black zombies)
Walkin' talkin' dead, though we think we're livin' (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, followin the system (black zombies)
(Nas)
Aiyyo we trapped in our own brain, fuck behind bars
We've already gone insane
They've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfillin reality; too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of dem
Can't have one or two guns without squeezin 'em
On our own people and, fuck black leaders
Cause whites ain't got none leadin them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophetless
All get down and get up
Victims walkin' 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Faintin, shoutin, catchin Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doin' it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demostrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies
(Nas)
You scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggaz with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Or from Israel, (?) bish'meal Allah, el-rachman, el-Rahim (?)
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is unGodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
[Roaring] ... that's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie
(Nas)
Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggaz won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggaz..."

When she walked in, she lit up the room, like Las Vegas.
Terrell said our man's a full back for the Raiders.
A drunk whod fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers.
Its easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love.
Next thing you know I'm hugged up wit this bitch in tha tub.
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Sweate washin her feet.
Is this love? somebody's wife fuckin' a thug.
Hittin it raw, tastin it, wildin out on my character, tapin it.
Tyra Banks face is face lift, givin' head like she knew me for years.
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me 'bout her husbands affairs.
Millions, she would get, if his neck got slit.
She rolled the equality, then passed the lye ta me.
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy.
He stays on the golf course, wears Drakkar Sport.
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort.
You can take a man here goes the keys you can slip in the rear.
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere.
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rappin'.

Twelve point five million, he kept his funds in the loines of London.
Goes to his wife and his children.
Yo I thought, what if shorty gets scared, electric chairs all I vision.
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision.

Fake ID, forge his wife name, catch the next flight the same night.
Headed to Spain, nice game, now its back to where we meet again...

Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare.
Fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash.
Took a blast, out of her coke bag.
Snorted it, started screamin yo we almost crashed!
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it wit crushed up glass.
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep.
Overwhelmed by greed, put to death."

Well I'm gonna get blazed before I tell y'all stories,
I saw on TV today this man lost his son, his son died,
So he had him cremated, took his ashes, and made it into a diamond ring
Now he watch his son shine everyday,
I just thought about that, while I sit here ashin in this ash tray
The makin' of a mad man who entered stories of Devante Swing,
Eva Gardner, the crashin of James Dean,
Bobby Brown, influenced by Rick James it goes,
Prince wanted Alexander O' Neill to be Morris Day or Jerome,
But Alex was puttin' coke in his nose nigga while it,
Could be a myth but I swear that the source was close, Phyllis Hyman,
Killed himself it was crazy, mommy was bad, they say,
Donny Hathaway freefall from a balcony, he sways
As a blunt ash falls into the ashtray, I can see my whole life fly past me,
Did I (Did I) keep it gangsta or keep it classy, and will the money and fame outlast me,
The blunt's ash fall down in the ash tray, will I see my whole life fly past me,
I'm askin did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, (did I) anything else you wanna know, just ask me.
Sam trusted Womack with his main lady, he tossin' in the grave like 'this is how you repay me,'
A change goin' come, wish you didn't trust me so much,
Marvin said 'No mountains high enough,' fly stuff,
David Ruffin was punchin' Tammy Tyrell, gave her concussions,
While, the Funk Brothers was layin' down the percussions,
When Flow from the Supremes died, Diana Ross cried,
Many people said that she was laughing inside (Why?).
As a blunt ash falls into the ashtray, I can see my whole life fly past me,

The blunt's ash fall down in the ash tray, will I see my whole life fly past me,
I'm askin did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, (did I) anything else you wanna know, just ask me.
John F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery, it interests me,
Julie Campbell in Gucci sandals, she's what a temptress be,
The death of Anis Cosby, what a mystery,
All of Chicago and Herald Washington, someone is sabotagin' him,
Watch out for the traps, Larry Troutman killed his brother, Roger Troutman, then he killed himself, that's the end of zat,
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats,
This is what came from they pain, from they hurt we gain, an unfair exchange.
As a blunt ash falls into the ashtray, I can see my whole life fly past me,
Did I (Did I) keep it gangsta or keep it classy, and will the money and fame outlast me,

Me and my wife K flyin in the drop-top like Ruby and OZ Davis baby, know what I mean,
Yo man, get smoked out, start thinking about Hadie McDaniels,
Got an Oscar for playing Mamie in ""Gone With the Wind"",
And she didn't even get allowed, wasn't allowed to go to the premier,
You believe that, couldn't go to premier, to her joint,

I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes right on the spot in the studio
Soon as I hear the track; you know what I'm sayin'?
Word but I wanted to bring a couple of books to the studio today
Man I found these shits up in the crib man in boxes man
I don't even remember when I was writing these shits
Or what's in these shits man probably a bunch of bullshit man
Fuck it check it
How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liers all day
Time pass...(Nah lemme start somethin' else)
Soul on ice death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed cursed worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal 'cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is I'ma prince I'ma get slain
Some do minor shit swear they on the top of they game
Ya rhymin' is called ""Vagina Monologue""
It kinda supports theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes
Oh shit Tina - I been lookin' for this bitch number damn.
No this rhyme is weak...
This is week I remember this bullshit right here

Gandhi was a... what the fu..?
Gandhi was a fool, nigga fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach ya plights of conquest

The money's ya religion sky the limit live life
Numbers is big business makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks thiefs murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbin my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and liers and squares...
(Nah that was weak there)
My people be projects or jail never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my 2way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci god poverty's real
I can't fight you cause you would sue me niggas be groupies
I see imitators tryin' to make albums spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealing Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Swoop it's crap this can't be
My book of rhymes
This can't be my book of rhymes writing this bullshit!

Nah neva that fuck that, aw why you laughin' Alchemist?
Huh you a funny nigga... naw yeah

I'm tellin' you I'ma come up with some new shit now
Fuck that I'ma write again now fuck that
I musta been high on some shit mmm what the fuck is this?
Look how we treat pregnancy women in the 'hood
Our values so low our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we shoulda heeded
Cause now we need it
We older almost able t...
I'm jealous of you how come you so beautiful?
Smelling fresh youthful intelligent while I'm stressin' and shit
Aiyo I envy you 'cause all you do is smile and things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset 'cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute we both need ya mother's attention
I must be crazy jealous of my own baby infant

Throw your hands up 'cause we wanna dance
Don't be afraid just take a chance
'Cause this beat will rock your body
Get up on the floor and party
Now y'all tell me what y'all wanna do
Thinkin' while I have a drink or two
Throw your hands up everybody
Get up on the floor and party
[Verse 1] (Nas)
I move at night, respect my gangsta
Ready for whatever you bring, the mood is right
The club is righteous, tight with family
Squeezin on big old bubbles with no panties
Ladies who's sexually free
And once in a while live on the wild side, kinky and nasty
Middle fingers up and say ""Fuck the world""
Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl
And my fellas, two time felons, two nine tote and lethal
Quick to leave you wide open, if you gettin' tore down
Blowin' a blunt cloud, and the DJ's makin' you feel thugged out
Put yo hands up
[Verse 2] (Jungle)
I pull in a V12 drop all red
Look at ma with that cat paw tat on'er leg
Come here girl can I kiss you, let me lick you
Show you what your body made for, you're official
You could be my baby mama lookin' like that
What you drink, champagne or Cognac
What you like dancin diamonds, Dolce Gabbana
Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada
A nigga like Jungle to always come through
Shine in yo hood whenever the fuck you want to
'Cause I'ma B.R.A.V., E.H.E.A.R.T. from QB
Put'em up...
Party all night (Party all night)
Let's drink, no fights (Let's drink, no fights)
Party all night (Whachu wan' do?)
Let's drink, no fights (Drink up... c'mon, yeah, yeah...)
[Verse 3] (Wiz)
I'm blaze, haze for days
Blackout thinkin' of ways to get paid
Mac out corner I got it's all laid
Shorty, with a nice round ass in my face
Now do she want me to touch her?
Or do she want me to see?
Fuck is she comin' wit me
A true BHG Wiz, not complex
Chin checks if it get hectic
Nigga Braveheart respected
Get bent at the bar, talk shit, walk it
And if I can't talk it, the false big cop a case
I'm here to blaze, roll up a dutch and take it to the face
Throw yo hands up"

Grindin', enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shinin' you can see a nigga breathe
Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis
Crews with a hammer, jealous heart I can't stand 'em
Haters are scandalous, damn can't a nigga just breathe?
To all my niggas gettin' money in the streets
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Light up my trees and I just breathe

I twist 'em baby mama be victim
Chronic leaf hittin' all kinds of heat wit' 'em
Wisdom, from pot to piss in to higher position
Intense hustle it's pain like a pinched muscle
Till it rains and my Timbs stain my socks
Till I dodge enough shots and the presiding judge slams the mallet and says life I'm a guap
Then I cop, then I yacht, then I dot
Island hoppin' away from nightmare holders
Cowboy slingers who shoot up any club to see they names ring loud on some FBI poster
Must be on X or he coked up
Suggestin' I post a bail I'm like yes 'cause we soldiers
We just gettin' older and time we still in our prime
I can't afford a new arrest on my folder

I'm fresh out of city housin'
Ain't have too many options
Pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded
Plenty Henny in me envy with simply ???
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me
The high life, the fly life, Pierre Hardy
Imitation of Christ
Ice wear Gaudis since '94 floor seats
The Lex was an excellent choice not fast
The pestilence of the ghetto would form me
As a shorty to push nothin' less than a 740
With fresh linens sip Pellegrino's with Airs on
They sick mix in their water with airborne
Oh they so sick
Look how I got 'em all crazy look at that
You gotta let it out
Stress ain't good man, you gotta breathe"

""The light is there.""
(Intro: Olu Dara singing)
See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
(Verse 1: Nas)
Let's go!... Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --
Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
'Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo
(Olu Dara singing)
Greatest man alive (Nas: Yeah, turn it up!)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!
(Verse 2: Nas)
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
'Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
'Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child
'Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""
(Olu Dara singing)
Greatest man - The great-greatest man alive
(Verse 3: Nas)
Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to
(Olu Dara singing)
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge
(Nas)
Nas, Nas you don't stop
Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop
Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop
Tell 'em Pop

See I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know)
I was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)
Ended up in New York City (Yeah!)
Where I had my first child (That's me)
I named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!)
All the boys call him Nas (Luh ya, boy)
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)
Greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop) Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!

26,Can't Forget About You,2006,Hip Hop Is Dead (2006),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"There comes a day in your life
When you want to kick back
Straw hat on the porch
When you old perhaps
Want to gather your thoughts
Have a cold one, Brag
To your grand kids on how life is golden
So I'ma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's
Of the whole rap pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that could've made you career stop
All that, and your man is still here, and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all, See I almost felt a tear drop
When was the last time you heard real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time.
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me (truly this is what made me)
Break me (not a things gonna break me)
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me (truly this is what made me)
Break me (not a things gonna break me)
Oh, I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my lifelong anthem
Can't forget about you (Can't forget about you)
Can't forget about the old school
Bam, Cas, Mel lie Mel flash,
Rocks steady spinning on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy when to Jazzy
Fresh Prince, Fat Boys broke up,
Rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it mess you up when Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love
When was the last time you heard real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time.
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me (truly this is what made me)
Break me (not a things gonna break me)
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me (truly this is what made me)
Break me (not a things gonna break me)
Oh, I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my lifelong anthem
Can't forget about you (Can't forget about you)
Unforgettable, UnSubmittable I go by N now, just one syllable
It's the N 'cause the game tied is the same vibe
Good times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help records sells more than creative lines
And I don't want to keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past, enough of it aight then
Nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown's 25
When was the last time you heard real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time.
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me (truly this is what made me)
Break me (not a things gonna break me)
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me (truly this is what made me)
Break me (not a things gonna break me)
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I'm unforgettable too"

About this money... 'Bout these cars... these homes... these
Labels, clothes, sneakers... Big money shit... Now e'erybody
Tryna get rich... Then get rich nigga fuck it
Some rap pioneers be them crack heads, when they speak
You see missin' teeth, silver chain wit' a silver piece
Niggas ya grandfather age
They pants still hangin' down they leg talkin' 'bout they ain't paid
And they hate you 'cause they say you ain't paid dues
And - was stealin' and robbin' 'em
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or 'cause MC's skills are loss
It's 'cause we can't see ourselves as a boss
Deep rooted through slavery, self hatred
The Jewish stick toegther, friends in high places
We on some low level shit
We don't want niggas to ever win, see everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper but few flow fatal
It's fucked up it all started from two turntables
When they crown you, and you rise up
To ya position, carry on tradition
When they knight you, and you go to fight, go to war
Don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry, c-carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, when you rep what we rep
You carry on tradition
Now some of these new rappers got they caps flipped backwards
Wit' the fingers intertwined in some gang sign madness
I got an exam to see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers I don't understand ya code
You have ya man shoot you like in that Soprano episode
Do anything to get in the game, mixtapes
You spit hate against bosses, hungry fucks are marvelous
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate
Vocalists, niggas I could have wrote ya shit
I had off time, was bored wit' this, I could have made my double LP
Just by samplin' different parts of the Nautilus
Still came five on the charts wit' zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for ya bricks, it got good to ya
You started tellin' the bigger dogs to call it quits? What?!
Now niggas got the studio poppin' it's mad clearer
Engineers got us ear plugs and still hear us
The live in the park sound
Versus the state of the art sound we on the charts now
From British walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, wit' our black cards now
Fortune 500 listed, brunch at Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, wit' rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
'Cause I'm what, every dime lust
We use to be a ghetto secret, can't make my mind up
If I want that, or the whole world of people
Now I carry on tradition
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead ones gone
We miss 'em, I promise I'mma carry on tradition"

(Hook: Amy Winehouse)
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
(Verse 1: Nas)
I want someone who like the champagne I like
My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain't afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She love or she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herbs, natural medicine, she cooking good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there's no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you're heaven sent
Your smile put me at ease
You're the woman I need, but where is she
(Verse 2: Nas)
I hate when people write me hostile texts on account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question, what are they expecting
I be trying to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever I'm rolling in dough, swimming in a pool of cash
God, wouldn't they know, or am I a fool or ass
I'm well known, got people coming at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don't keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond, I gallivant around the equator
And that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pino Grigio Cris with some lime what is this?
An immaculate version of Me and My Bitch by Biggie
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me
(Bridge: Nas)
Yeah, yeah, let's pour some cherry wine
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, yeah we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, Hey yo Salaam, yeah, I think they know the time
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah
Life is good, life is good, yeah
Life is good, no matter what
Life is good, life is good
Life if good, yeah
No matter what
Life is good"

Yo...
Yo... yo...
Power and crime, the thugs slingin powder and dimes
Twenties of D, is yo' niggaz wilder than mine?
My niggaz bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards
For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Lou Cabrasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's ""Godfather"" shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings
Plaques awards applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way
Niggaz with names, livin' off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothin' changin

If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't runnin'
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunnin
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war
1 - and I'm well prepared
2 - we can take it there
(Nas)
You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shinin - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggaz know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggaz to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers
(What nigga) and they all look clean
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard
(Nas)
You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nuttin
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop frontin
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of 'em dyin'
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flyin, high in the aircraft winin
- And dinin, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
?? To gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm gettin' head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
The Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block

And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings
That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
But by force I'm suggesting
Ya count your blessings
I've got love and assurance
I've got new health insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings
And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
Better count your blessings
Cause yo this year, can't wait till it gets here
7-21-09 my first song will shine
And it's amazing I'm about to be raisin'
Another main man and like his dad they'll praise him
And some will hate him, just 'cause we buildin' a nation
Like Bob did with Damian
The world will embrace him, girls'll chase him
Foresee, they will not break him
And when I'm not around, you look for God and thank him
And I've got somewhere to dress for
And I've got no need to stress for
And so I'll always put my best forth
And count my blessings
And they'll be no need for tissues
'Cause there will be no further issues
If you got someone who miss you
Man, count your blessings

Better count your blessings
You wishin' you were sittin' in the top position
Picture perfect, nothing less 'cause you deserve it
Without the Hermes, you'd have a hurtin'
You knew that you was destined for greatness, for certain
You see the over-zealous, they be thirstin', caught up in emotion
You keepin' your composure like Gershwin
Songs by Earth Wind keep you in the zone, writing verses
So when your pocket's light, know that you have a heavy purpose
We've got preschool and daycare
We've got pension and welfare
And though not all will play the game fair
Still I count my blessings
I've joy in abundance
I've got life full of substance
I've got meetings and functions
So I count my blessings
I've got something to live for
I've got surplus to give more
And we're all welcome through His door
So I count my blessings
And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
So I count my blessings
I think you lookin' too hard for it
With the double R under your garage door
Appreciate the things you work hard for
Hey, count your blessings
Count your blessings
So don't be mad if you ain't fly y'all
You got the means to reach the level I'm on
You should know there's only one Nas y'all
But count your blessings, count your blessings
And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising

31,Dance,2002,God's Son (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"I dream of the day I can go back to when I was born
Laying in your arms wishing you was here today mom
Wish you'd appear just for a second from heaven
My tears would be gone I wouldn't be rapping this song
I'd be happy driving up to your eight bedroom mansion
Up late laughing 'bout the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchanted beyond...
Galileo's understanding pass the milky way and all the planets
There's something out there greater but only god knows
Scientists claim we came from apes but they lies tho
That was part of our conversation
A spark when up and start blazing thinking of how amazing she was
An angel gave me love
I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
I pray when I'm married my wife
I have one of your skills but mom you could never be replaced
I give my life up just to see you one more day and to have
One more dance with you Mama *if I could only have*
One more dance with you Mama *pray wishing I could have*
One more dance with you Mama *if I could only have*
One more dance with you Mama
I wish you were here I miss you more each second I breath
You resting in peace forever I accepted you free
A blessing to me
I see you dressed in all white smiling at me
Happy knowing everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter just one more time
My chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th '02 that when the gates of heaven opened up for you
To stroll through
Beautiful Ann Jones
Job is done raisin ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on and now I'm good
Job well done you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride mommy dance with him
And you been my guide through all the trouble I face
They playing our song the light be
My hand on your waist
I grab your other hand trying not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed dreaming I could have
One more dance with you Mama *if I could only have*
One more dance with you Mama *pray wishing I could have*
One more dance with you Mama *if I could only have*
One more dance with you Mama I love you forever ma
You have always lived through me
Always"
32,Daughters,2012,Life Is Good (2012),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Check it out
I call it
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
I call it ""shit for niggas with daughters""
I call this ""shit for niggas with daughters""
I call this ""shit for niggas with daughters""
I call this ""shit for niggas with daughters""
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it then caught my rage, like
How could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised like
A princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switching women, pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster can't be mad, I love her
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail- dead that
Wait till he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You 17, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure but she rocking with it
This for niggas wit' daughters
I call this, shit for niggas wit' daughters
Yo, not sayin' that our sons are less important
Shit for niggas wit' daughters
I call this, shit for niggas wit' daughters
I call it, not sayin' that our sons are less important
This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said ""nas go and get ya kid""
She's on twitter, I know she ain't gon post no pic
Of herself underdressed, no inappropriate shit, right
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser then she instagrammed it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Shoulda drove on time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they too nurture teen talents
They grow fast
One day she's ya little princess, next day she talking boy business
What is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God get's us back, he makes us have precious little girls
I call it ""shit for niggas with daughters""
I call this ""shit for niggas with daughters""
I call this ""shit for niggas with daughters""
I call this ""shit for niggas with daughters""
And I ain't tryna mess ya thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons, how fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with the sawed off
'Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love"
33,Destroy & Rebuild,2001,Stillmatic (2001),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"This is a journey into the world's most largest And notorious projects, Queensbridge. Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers.
(Nas)
He held a mass appeal and a little boy smile
Depressed, has a complex, his mouth was foul
You need to stay around, I feel like telling some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory
Hung around my man's Like and Big Trevor
Trevor's still locked up, Like's getting his cheddar
Cory changed his name to arr, whatever:
Corn chip? Buckwheat? Look alive, it's Mega!
Right: Mega was his name, sorry about that,
But ""it's so hard"" to put a coward's name in my rap
Always acting tough, a jokester be fronting
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothing
But that's Nas: always looking out for brethren
'Cause when brethren don't return love it don't stress him
'Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughing to the bank and shit
Back to Cor: got him a deal, but his rhymes was whack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid,
Mega, for the record, you can suck my dick!
Bitch, you from around the way; it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
So they say ""the Bridge is over, the Bridge is over""
Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, ""the Bridge is over, the Bridge is over""
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
(Nas)
Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies,
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
It's like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're button ain't gotten back to me!
Asking a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B.
Nature moved to Marcy
Man dick riding Nature, nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy
Backward ass niggas...
Man, fuck them niggas, go head with the progam, man, proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood; anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, it's just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
(Nas)
I put the name on the map after Marly and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleaning up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was busting his gun to get your weak chain back?
They don't respect you; a check's due for me for your fame
Mega, I hope you blow, so I'm saying your name (Mega! Mega!)
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be king
Even Jigga want the crown: ""How's that sound?"" Poor thing!
I'm representing Queensbridge, U.S.A.
Where two SK's go off every day
New flesh lay
All you little roaches and rats:
Besides my man Ricky, Nas, the true ruler, is back
So haters say
(Talking)
""The Bridge is over"", my dick!
The Bridge'll never be over, as long as I'm alive and breathing!
Braveheart to the graveyard!
I'm the William Wallace of this shit.
Ayo P, Prodigy, I got love for you man, I love you man,
You know what I'm saying?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle!
You can't save everybody!
Niggas invited you to the hood, rep it right my nigga!
Be untouchable my nigga, so we can be ""Mobb for life"" for real, and that's real!
Aiyo, Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit, man!
I'm not your father, man!
Be your own man, stand on your own two!
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga, or don't even rep this!
Aiyo Mega, you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets, man!
Young niggas is in the grind! Where you be at, man?
Niggas be bucking! Why you never bucking? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfucking Neo Brown of the fucking hood?
It's disgusting, man!
Stay out the magazines! Keep my name out your motherfucking mouth!
There's no more room for jealousy!
We destroying and rebuilding:
That means the cowards get out, and the real niggas stay!
Niggas been hating me since I been nine,
Shining with suede motherfucking Balis on in silks!
I'ma always be the young don!
Don't be like the niggas on the other side: ""hating me 'cause I'm beautiful!""
Real niggas in Queensbridge:
Y'all niggas come up and get this money and move on, baby!

Fear and desperation, no depression can't tarry ya
This spear, hey
Ayatollah, Idi Amin, Mennelek
Man a Masai Warrior, despair, eh
Fear and desperation, no depression can't tarry ya
This spear
Like burning spear and such and such before me
Who all fought for the cause and this spear, eh
Enforcing all the laws
The master of the masses
One has power, the other one lacks it
Guns are power, controlled by assets
Owned by financial forecasters
Who are the masters? They are the gangsters
They are the bankers, the ones who tax us
The masses, they are us
The sheep, the people, divided in classes
I go off like a Shite bomb and all y'all see I'm on my
War paint on my face, shit, my nine mm on my waist, shit
I'm a problem, shoot up your place, shit
Let a few go then I get low, blazing Haze again
The masters, The Wall Street War Chiefs, the elitists groups
The masses, they pray to Jesus, saying he will see us through
The masters are the aristocratic
The masses ask if the Most High is on his way here
I'm trying to stay clear, my mind is my modern day Spear

This lead into Swiss cheese when the 5th squeeze
Mislead, the media misleads
Scares you to the point where you miss sleep
With that said
This lead with this Ruger and that shooter
Sub-machine gun ratta-tat through you
Copper tops, hollow points will do ya something bad
Our future is
Mislead, three strikes
There's no school when a teacher strikes
This economy, this monopoly
Get no job, just own your property
Now it's back to what comes natural
Must survive any how you have to
Despair, desperation
But I have no fear when I hold this spear
Make some bwoy know mi nah smile
'Cause this spear nah beg friends
Man a run racket, man a run scheme
Man a run race, man a rundown Benz
Can't trust a she nor we nor
Eye in a contact lens
Man a run from police and a rundown wealth
And dollars and nah make sense
So, rise up to my defense
Hollow pointed is my preference
Should have been deterred, don't know what you heard
Get referred by the wrong reference
When this spear start dispense
It a fly and a tear through fence
Dismember your members and all of your limbs
Body bust inna 'nuff segments
Well, man a run drugs, man a run risk
Man all a run out a time and ends
Man a run up and down and a run fi dem life
And a run down this month rent
Nutin' nah gwan a yard and food deh a road
Then man hafi go touch pavement
Despair was a tool that was used to enslave man
And make manservant
Escape from Despair and Desperation
Becomes more urgent
Mankind needs to cleanse and wash out dem soul
With spiritual detergent
A distant army, a distant relative
Controlling the circumference
And any man move with no permission
They're feeling the circumstance of
This spear, hey
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, man a, eh
Man a Mau Mau Warrior, despair, eh
Fear of your recession and depression can't tarry ya
This spear, hey
Inner city youth dem rise it up disguised as AK-47
This spear, eh
And anytime them clap it up the whole city level
This spear
Like Burning spear and such and such before I
Who all fought for the cause and this spear, eh
They can't ignore me, no"
36,Doo Rags,2002,The Lost Tapes (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Uh
Pushin drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants
Yeah X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicide and feds on the blocks where I played, b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause, or be-cause
Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the Devil
Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin niggaz swing razors in the front row, then out in the streets
The car show, 560's, chemical afros
Acuras pumpin Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be, asses bustin' out of they clothes
Wearin lip gloss, big door knockers pealin they earlobes
So where them years go? Where the old gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here doe, so
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; right?
Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
In army boots, yellin' ""Join the armed forces!""
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of naked crawlin in the carpet offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be servin' the beast too long
The murderers wearin police uniforms, confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin to the music I chose
And Peachtree Atlantic crackheads was tootin they nose
In frozen corners of Chicago, loaded up Llama's children
With fo'-fo's, and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates, headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin' us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; right?
Niggaz used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buyin hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin
Till awareness started penetratin
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin' liquor
Just to prove we some creative niggaz
Turnin' nothin' into somethin', is God work
And you get nothin' without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggaz in chains
From Greene to Sing-Sing, I'm wantin y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, he takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got God sun on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected from Henny's and gettin' blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo because of that
I'm still blazin', goin' out for the cause
Still rockin' stockin caps, not for the waves, obeyin no laws
And it's like that
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin', still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs

38,Drunk by Myself,2002,The Lost Tapes (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Uh, Uh, Where am I going?
Where am I? Yo, it's ill
Yo my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
Mack in my right arm, Tequila bottle in
My left arm like Cristian
Watching my life go, keeping myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hells men
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty, who wit' me? My (?) to well
Twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed
I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My deckited lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways, put out the hayes blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in televison
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swigg
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, lost again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all, things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired..."

Brace yourself for the main event
Y'all impatiently waitin
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best? Pac, Nas and Big
Ain't no best, East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts, left chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage?
Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come outta my throne
I got this, locked since '9-1
I am the truest, name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiin Sophie fame, kept my name in his music
Check it
(Talking)
Ay yo, pass me the weed, pour my ashes out on these niggas man (no doubt)
Ay, y'all faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the fuckin' ring
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and fogotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face
Y'all some ""well wishers,"" friendly actin', envy hidin snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin, heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef
Started cockin up my weapon, slowly loadin up this ammo
To explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle
This for dolo and it's manuscript, just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint
First, Biggie's ya man, then you got the nerve to say that you better than Big
Dick suckin lips, whyn't you let the late, great veteran live

""God's son"" across the belly, I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
(Ill... will) Ill Will rest in peace, let's do it niggas
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad, watchin his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin women
Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well life is hard, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatent or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your buildin
Callin my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was gave you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the god
Wearin Jaz chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class
You Tae-bo hoe, tryna' work it out, you tryna' get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna' kick knowledge
Nah, I'm tryna' kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rockafeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas?
Philly's hot rock fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks?
Ne-gro please
You no mustache havin', with whiskers like a rat
Compared to Beans you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Caine, to Herb, to Big
And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons
Ha, R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick
Sean Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics

Blessings in life to the children
They say life is like 5 days
Words of a old man with silver hair in his wheel chair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
'Cause animals and sweetness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job, moved a divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, coppin' the five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war we life stealers
Hollow tip, lead busters there's no heaven or hell
Dead is dead, fuckers
And your soul is with God
Your mind keeps lurkin' to earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur
(Chorus (Repeat 2X))
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga toned in the pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born
And every nigga gone
And for every brotha breathin'
Live to see another mornin'
(Verse 2 (Blitz))
It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality loaded with vast stories
Of lust, greed, and contempt no street is exempt
Extended clip shots hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin' 'em hustlers pitch rocks
All you paintin' pictures of my pain
Illustrate the city in vain
Fallin' deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind
In these fatal times, vesh crimes
Nickel play the nine and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them baby's cry
Still I'm sayin' why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin' high to relieve the pain
Breathin' in the game, exhalin'
Guilts and the shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring
Look at anthrax, I stand back through
Hopin' I make it tomorrow
(Verse 3 (Nas))
My skin is a art gallery, right
With paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benz's and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely...
Hold me, it's gettin' darker"

Nas the Viking fresh from my ankles thankful
Gangster see gangster do I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up gut 'em like fish swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors pellets spraying your familia
You screaming like you love war

Ladies love thugs and my thug love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop

You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqo fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
Cause now Instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggaz get flashier houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but

War plus money man I got too many spots
Hungry niggaz get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me your not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggaz back on the block what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggaz that go t prices on their head so high
Their own my will take the contract surprise
So we play a mental game intimidation
Got pussy niggaz get pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggaz would step up wait for the day an
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying

Tell these niggaz why we here

Nuttin but some real shit, what y'all expected

That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me

Walk up to his face and then gone

Him and whoever standin by, I'll tell these niggaz, ""Let's go""
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwin' up his own blood
With a slug in his motherfuckin mug
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor
(Nas)
A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five machetes
Attack 'em like Freddie, then we toastin over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin' two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin
'Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa

44,Fetus,2002,The Lost Tapes (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
'Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they don't
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind
(Nas)
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down 'cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved 'cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
See how the government will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said ""At least that nigga ain't ugly!""
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me, and I plan to over through the devil
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers..."

What I'm gonna do? (What I'm gonna do?)
Uh, shhh, lawd lawd Jah
Ehahaha
Shit is all true
(Verse 1: NaS)
Mmm, Fried chicken
Fly vixen
Give me
Heart Disease
But need
You in my kitchen
You a bird, but you ain't a key
Got wings but you can't fly away from me
Driving in your bucket seats
All the way from Kentucky
To fuck with me
Look what you done to me
Was number one to me!
After you shower
You and your gold medal flour
Then you rub on with hot oil for half an hour
You in your hot tub, I'm looking at you salivating
Dry you off, I got your paper towel waiting
Lay you down 'cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot
Then I flock
To the bed then, ""Plop""
When we done, I need rest
Don't know a part of you that I love best
Your legs or your breast
Misses Fried Chicken, you gon' be a nigga death
Created by southern black women
To serve massa, guest
You gon' be a nigga death
Misses Fried Chicken
You was my addiction
Dripping with high cholest'
Like Greeks with his falafel
Or Italians with his to-mato
Pasta
Or roti is to a Rasta
Trapping me
You and your friend mac and cheese
Candy yams, collard greens
But you knocking me to my knees
It's killing me when I miss, ah
Nothing I need more than a fish fry
(Verse 2: Busta Rhymes)
Shit, It taste good, I can't lie
It's like you're walking out a tanning saloon
When I pull you out the oven, from baking I got you on my mind
Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing, how you sparkle when I glaze you swine
Hey, my pretty hand hot, it's so feminine
The way you submitted
And how you gave me power
To massaging me to shower
You with lemon water
Marinate you with season you dipping you in chowder
Baby
It's like you at the spa
The way you gently
Lay in the pan
While you enjoying you butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling
On your skin
Despite the funny fragrance
Still I lick my finger frequent
In any event
I'm reflecting on all the signs saying that I got I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you taste made it hard to resist when I put my mouth on you
But that's another issue
Butterflies up in my stomach when I laid EYES on you
Was it infection manifesting?
Confused over the feeling impatiently eating you
Intestinal worm chewing on the walls of my intestine
I'ma eat you until there's nothing left
Till my very last breath
You gon be a nigga death
Despite your good appearance
Cooking swine as a chef
You gon be a nigga death
Who cares if the swine
Is mixed with rat, cat, and dog combined?
Yes, I eat the shit to death
(Outro: Busta Rhymes)
Ain't that some shit?
I'ma eat some shit
Until what I'm eating KILLS ME!
And I choose to do that
Why?
Cause that's just what niggas do"

Uh... uh... uh...
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin
Pushin cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me
""Whatchu up to, the cops gon' bust you""
I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered
If God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls
Showin they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's livin' proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother durin the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is bein replaced
Pre-trial hearin is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out - nobody leavin' everybody
""Get down, get down! Get down, get down!""
Everybody
""Get down, get down! Get down, get down!""
Some niggaz fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggaz are dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this' a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggaz, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them
Southern niggaz ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangstas, we loungin, out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas I got your back - the fools don't play""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and things
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin the hotel room do', to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do, with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' witchu
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers
""Get down, get down! Get down, get down!""
Everybody
""Get down, get down! Get down, get down!""
All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you ain't look at it
My folk is yo' folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody gotta make a change"
48,Getting Married,2004,Street's Disciple (2004),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigolo
It was difficult for me to find a chick I want
(Nas)
This ain't no sucka for love shit
This ain't no Huxtable kisses and hug shit, first night we fuck shit
And don't call the next day, this a thug's wedding day
In love? will we make it? Let us pray...
In a limo, my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard Bottasmov costumes, this ain't no act, though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes, I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenuptial agreement 'cause Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping but then I deaded the thought
'Cause she deserves Cinderella's Ball and the whole shit
But know this, you fuckin' wit a slit ya throat quick
Vehicular explosions, cigar smokin'
Dark-minded, chart climbin, well-spoken
Safer world of broke men to rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away 'cause this is it, hun
Headed to the Chapel, my niggas laughin'
And it's bafflin 'cause just a year ago
It's weird, though, I knew I'd get married
To who? I knew not, thought of snatchin Halle up from the dreadlock
Pumpin' Sade, my head knot
Finally, I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French, rephrase that
Someone who made my heart stop, couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey
HIV spreadin', everybody bump the same bunnies
The game'll put niggas in they graves right before they part ways with the street
I want a son to greet every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin', tellin' me it's time to eat
I'm gettin' married
(Nas)
It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on the ride
Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative ones say
Knew my wedding would be one day but quickly is this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at old photos, sayin', ""Damn, he used to twist me""
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor Party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, knudged me with his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to City Hall, dressed norm'
Said she would love me Oswald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suit up kings
Gov', you got the ring, Jung', you behave
Maxwell, he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky', Mississippi
Family packed in, my nigga, L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cufflinks, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, just all big to thug it out
My girl walked in glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody can touch
I gotta be cool wit' ya crazy aunts and uncles
'Cause I love you much... 'cause you put up wit my shit
Court cases, baby mommas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter, standin'
Heart poundin' out my chest like a cannon
I'm happy, one of my Groom's men
Under the music says, ""Don't do it""
But they just joke, some crew shit
They playin', I'm gleeful, I'm stayin'
I'm stayin' vows that are all true
""Will you take music as your wedded wife?""
""I do.""
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin' to
Gettin' married"

Live for this
Some of y'all don't live at all
Get yours nigga
Get yours baby
Uh, yo... yo...
As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
For Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S.
About to shoot us for revolution, that's how you gotta move
A lotta rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar, or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil, help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
Behold before you, one of those, prophetic MC's
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools, they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners...
Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildin's
Rats crawlin', filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, prayers answered
Dreams turned real, what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men, not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments some real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tried to weaken my spirit, it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learn
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily, I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in us, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise

Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise

You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I so lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A.
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
In a newborn's, first time to be here at last
It shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Read the history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter

God love us hood niggaz (I know)
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggaz (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggaz (I know)
Cause on the streets is the hood niggaz, uh
And I know he feel us, uh
God love us hood niggaz (I know)
'Cause he be wit us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uh
God love us hood niggaz (I know)
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggaz, uh
But he forgive us

He who has ears, let him hear
And he who has sight, let him see
He who has life, let him be
See everything goes through change
Those who know don't talk
And those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggaz
(Nas)
Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today
So long my crimies now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin clips up, countin' bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin me
(Nas)
Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs wit guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood
Little girls have seeds by O.G.'s in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees
Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood
But it's good in the hood
I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood
I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood
Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood
There's AIDS (uh) in the hood (WHAT?)
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God, love us the most"

My, first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoos real with ""God's Son"" across the belly
The boss of rap, you saw me in ""Belly"" with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and Tupac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames should huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads apparel
But the Q.B. don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast, 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody, uh
Yo, I'm the N the A to the S-I-R
And If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a barber's preciseness; Bravehearted for life
It's the return of the Golden Child, son of a blue's player
So who are you playa? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that Vodka too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judists thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"", with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is Nasdaq dough, in my Nascar with this Nas flow
Flip the beat back, now it's all reppin'
Hit the record sto', never let me go, get my whole collection, yo
It's, the, return of the Prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit's soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist gliss, I floss
Stick shift, look sick up in that Boxter Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go? Where he rest at?
Where he shop at and dress at?
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back-twister, lingerie-ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta wit' ya, uh"
52,Halftime,1994,Illmatic (1994),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria
Before I blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front; matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't braver, I'll pull a number like a pager
'Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'mma performer strange, so the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime
(Right) It's halftime
(Right) Ayo it's halftime
(Right) It's halftime
(Right) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
'Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle; now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise 'cause I'm wise
This is exercise till the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps 'cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
'Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format
Explore rap and tell me ""Nas ain't all that""
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime
(Right) It's halftime
(Right) Exhale, check it it's halftime
(Right) It's halftime
(Right) It's real in the field
Word life, check it
I got it going on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
'Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' them fast, doing this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
'Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is living fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out
(Right) It's still halftime
(Right) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right) Ninety-two, it's halftime
(Right) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
Halftime"
53,Hate Me Now,1999,I Am (1999),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Escobar season has returned...
It's been a long time
Been a long time comin'
Its life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turning back now.
This is what makes me.
This is what I am.
Hear me, lets go
Chorus: Puffy
You can hate me now (QB)
But I won't stop now (Real Niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now You gonna hate me I'ma hate you too
'Cause I can't stop now Simple as that
You can hate me now Die motherfucker die motherfucker die
You can hate me nooow You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
About anything that's about to go down
Do it now, Do It now, weak, jealous motherfuckers,
Do it now Fuck y'all
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I dry
Close your eyes, picture me rollin',
Sixes, money foldin
Bitches honeys that swollen
The riches, nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed pulitzer prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators bring aside try watchin my paper
Almost a decade quite impressive
Most of the best N' the sss's
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expanding more to the big screen
Bill gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail
With state dreams
Want me off the scene fast
But good things last
Like your favorite m.c. still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque
Back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest
I suggest
Money is power motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch
Do it now
Chorus I won't stop
Can't stop
You gon'hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
Do it now, I told you do it now lets go
You wanna hate me then hate me
What can I do?
But keep gettin' money
Funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up
Until I made it
Now y'all sayin' that's a clever nigga
Nothing to play with
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood
But can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes
Give 'em to you?
Here's my car and my house
You can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets
Hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that
What you expect hoe
Nickname esco
Took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest
But who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that
Cause niggas feel this right
You think I'm gonna come this far and let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too
Do it now
I like this, I like the way this feels
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates
I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jammin up the border to this game stop
And I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause
While driving, niggas shot out my doors
Plottin, I'm sure to catch me
With they glocks to my jaw
Try stickin me up but I
But I flipped on these ducks You tried
Instead of me
Ambulances were picking them up That's what you get
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer
Guess its just inferior man
Became a monster, atop of the world
Never fallin'
I'm as real as they come
From day one, forever ballin
C'mon
Hey y'all can't see a nigga like me, never in your life
And that's what you can't understand
(Do it now, do it now)
(Do it now, do it now)
(C'mon)
(Hate me now, hate me now)
(C'mon niggas, c'mon niggas)
(Do it now, get the shit over with)

Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Or save it all for you?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I, fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a FLASH
Before reconsidering, this Hell with you
It ain't you it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would of fell with you
To Hell with you
(Nas)
If Heaven was a mile away
And you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder finally believing His power?
Even if you couldn't see, but you could feel would you still doubt him?
How would you start acting?
Would you try to put the ki's down?
Thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets He can see now
Would a fiend even want to get high, would he stop smoking?
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for an atheist
It's hard taking this
Racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff
Even if he innocent nigga get on the car put your motherfucking hands up
Thinking I'm a lose it
My mom's in chemo
Three times a week, yo keep trying but people
Is hard and God, your young soldier's not so bold
But need you

Nigga what you think I'ma stop building
I'ma stop feeling like I'm Amistad's great great grandchildren
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days in the hallways making fake coke
Pass with the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while that same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time to them cats never looked back Cristal blowing dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me
You see the broads and Bentleys is nothing less my nigga spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all I'd buy some new kicks free of any autographs so
Not to be recognized forgive me
It's becoming unbearable
Making hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on the hook there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise
Preachers touching on altar boys
Sodomizing not realizing God is watching before the Lord
How can they do the devil's work?
A man giving another man head in church
Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that I fled the Earth.

Distinguished gentlemen
Crooks and Castles on his back, Maybach-er
Exotic lady eye catcher, holla at ya
Call me the chiropractor
Working like Muay Thai class
Can prespire out ya
And of course I've been the boss since back when
Rockin' D-boy Fila, velour and a 190 black Benz
Now they shut down the stores that I'm shoppin'
Used to be train robbin', face covered in stockin'
I'm him

Rubber grip hold the reloader
Come at me, I'ma rip your soldiers in half
Silverback ape, nickel-plated mag
Young, rich and flashy
Young bitch, I'm nasty
All black clothes, the ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids
I can still see the borough, I can still see the bridge
I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see
Tell 'em angels open the door for me
From nine Berettas and movin' raw
To chillin' in wine cellars, sticks and humidors
That's what I call mature
That's what I call a G
That's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta to the fullest, shit
I'm trying to make more C.R.E.A.M. by every September 14
That's my dream, so I can be more clean
As I grow yearly
I can see things more clearly
That's why they fear me

It's Universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied
The corporate side blockin' y'all from goin' to stores and buyin' it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was ridin' with it
But Newsweek articles startle big wigs
They said, ""Nas, why is he tryin' it?""
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts is winnin', forgettin'
Nas the only true rebel since the beginning
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel they can't sing what's in they soul
So Untitled it is, I never changed nothin'
But people, remember this: if Nas can't say it
Think about these talented kids with new ideas
Bein' told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'ma drop it
Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it
I'm a hustla in the studio, cups of Don Julio
No matter what the CD called, I'm unbeatable, y'all

56,Hey Nas,2002,God's Son (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in ""Set It Off""
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', ""Hi Nas""
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, ""Sorry. I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room""
Nine push-ups... Strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Platron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Fila's
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tails
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know... When will they learn
Nas need a queen not a hoe to...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick- someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?
Take my name... And my number
Meanwhile... We'll be groovin'
But let's take... it... slow
One for the honeys who roll blunts up but don't smoke
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife- play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue... A woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbeque I call Professor and Ock
'Cause u... point out my enemies, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?
Take my name... And my number
Meanwhile... We'll be cruisin'
But let's take... it... slow
Slow is the way
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we... suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billy Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick- someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?

Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it
You'll be givin' up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it
For legal fees in the penal dorm
Screamin' on the horn with 'bout thirty years on your conscience
I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'
Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'
Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence (When the block is hot)
Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates
Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in
Ways spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition aging (I gotta... When the

Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15
Then one-time intervene (I gotta lay...)
My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die
But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die

(I gotta...) Anytime brothers can't get jobs, then they rob
(When the block is hot) A man rather die than live on his knees and starve
Cops steady askin' your man what happened
First he tell then he stop, like he not really rattin'
Guess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off (When the block is hot)
Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star
The rain hurt niggaz bones who been shot
Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop
The streets lie, (When the block is hot) so you better be cautious
Your man'll fry you plus, everybody talkin'
A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in
Make your own path, be a legend in your skin
(Hold down the block, when the block is hot)
Make your own cash, don't stress what I'm forcin'
Don't expect more when you put in less work than all them
Queensbridge projects has taught him, and that's for life
You heard me right, I got the block (When the block is hot)

Mack-10's, you can smell the PCP smoke
Mele Mel told it real in the music he wrote
Those were the days I remember
We used to be close, then I was nine, coldest winter I remember
Was slippin' in December, two feet of snow
Yeah, that's the East Coast, that black ice
Symbolized the rap life
It was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doin' the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowin', didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter Jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she wants shellfish
Red Lobster was poppin', standin' on that line forever
I wish somebody would step on my Bally leather's
Now it's whatever... hip-hop's forever
Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift but niggaz never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn 'em, I was a tornado comin'
He knew from inside, like the eye of a storm
And told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble, retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweepin' leaves, socks to my knees
Homemade shorts cutoff, Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wipin' away eraser of the paper man

Big radio, tape slowin' down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I gotta freeze 'em till they ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm starin' at the speaker
Sunk in them 808's deeper, cleanin' my sneakers
Wit the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoe strings soak in water...

Stay hip-hop stay, stay hip-hop stay

Ain't got nothin' to do wit old school, new school
Dirty South, West Coast, East Coast
This about us, this our thing, 'knaw'sayin'?
This came from the gut, from the blood, from the soul
Right here man, this is our thing man
You know, so I say what I say
And I say what I say, and I mean it
Y'all take it how you wanna take it
'Cause if you're askin' - Why is hip-hop dead?
It's a pretty good chance you're the reason it died, man
It's a pretty good chance your lame ass, corny ass, is the reason it died, man
You don't give a fuck about, you don't know nothin' about it
You want this paper, be a hustler
You a hustler, you ain't a rapper
Get your paper man
YouknowwhatI'msayin, but this rap shit is real
Bitch, this shit is real, bitch, ha-ha
(Chorus: Chrisette Michele)
Live hip-hop live, (Stay) live hip-hop live
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give
Stay hip-hop stay, (Live) stay hip-hop stay (Live)
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays
Live hip-hop live, (Stay) live hip-hop live
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give
Stay hip-hop stay, stay hip-hop stay

Way before The Firm, like back in the day,
Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre,
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face,
The one kid that would have been Aftermath but got away,
But we still get together like, every several years,
To sprinkle, a little bit of heaven for your ears,
Relax, sippin' cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers,
Low key know G's but it's still Gucci luggage,
I love Cape Cod, and watching fly bitches with gray eyes,
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by,
I like to celebrate, why? 'cause I can vision,
Collages of images of my lives with no regrets or hate,
So every breath I take, Is all about the rules,
It's hard for you to breath like you at high altitude,
So crack the Patrone, it's own heavens,
The God's back, hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'!

Illmatic on the top shelf, The Chronic on the left, homie,
Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me,
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub-sack,
Ripped the package of Illmatic and bumped that,
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhyme,
I was the only Compton nigga with a New York state of mind,
Inside the dope house, bottlin' up sherm,
Banging The Firm, Dre was king then so I waited my turn,
Fast-forward now I'm makin' 'em burn,
Endin' my peers careers, holla'd at Nas, a hard lesson was learned,
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga,
I stopped beefin' with niggas, 'cause I'm Ether to niggas,

B, b boys and girls listen up,
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust,
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothin' comes easy it takes much practice,
Like I met a woman who was becoming a star,
She was very beautiful leaving people in awe.
Singin' songs, later on, but the younger version,
Hung wit' the wrong person, got her stunger than heroine,
Cocaine, sniffin' up drugs all in her nose,
Could've died so young, now looks ugly and old,
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold their breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death,
Watch the company you keep, and the crowd you bring,
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing,
So if you gonna be the best I'm'a tell you how,
Put your hands in the air and take the vow
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)

B, b, boys and girls listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten.
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the clubs with fake ID.
Careful 'fore you meet a man with HIV.
You can host a TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow,
You're thinking he can give you wealth but so
Young boy, you could use a lot of help you know
Ya thinkin' life's all about smokin' weed and ice.
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write,
Beggin' different women for a place to sleep at night.
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish.
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be what I wanna be)

[I'll be where I wanna be] (I'll be where I wanna be)
B, be'fore we came to this country,
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys.
There was empires in Africa called Kush,
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans,
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold; When
Gold was converted to money it all changed,
Money then became empowerment for Europeans.
The Persian military invaded,
They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked,
Slavery was money, so they began making slaveships.
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was in shock that in the mountains were black faces.
Shot off their nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today you see.
If the truth is told the youth can grow.
They'll learn to survive, until they gain control.
Nobody says you have to be gangsters, hoes.
Read more, learn more, change the globe.
Ghetto children do your thing.
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king.
Young princess when you get your wedding ring,
Your man is saying, ""She's my queen!""
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)

Damn! Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggaz just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me right?
Like I'm a f... I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfuckin gun
I can't believe this shit...
Word up... (word up..)
I seen some cold nights and bloody days, they grab me, bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song till this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered, they pull me out
I watch as niggaz scattered, making me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves
Under beds, so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keep me full up with hollow heads
Chorus: Nas (repeat 2X)
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child, scarred your life, crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck wild
(Nas)
Always I'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip
The barrel is my dick, uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me, I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggaz shock me
I see niggaz bleeding running from me in fear, stunningly tears
Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, giving niggaz heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up teck with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day, police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand
(Nas)
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a .9
There's a grenade in a box, and that Teck that kept crying
'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear
He's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody coming in, open the shelf
His eyes bubbling, he said, ""It was on""
I felt his palm troubled him shaking
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for blacks to kill blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally, go off, making niggaz memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat, cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggaz running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!"

64,If I Ruled the World (Imagine That),1996,It Was Written (1996),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Intro: Nas (Lauryn Hill singing in the background)
Life
I wonder
Will it take me under
I don't know
Verse One: Nas
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing, fashion
Designer clothes, lacing your clique up with diamond Role's
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Going raw imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time, watch the blimp read ""The World is Mine""
Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas
If I ruled the world
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still living for today, in these last days and times
Verse Two: Nas
Yo, it'll be, paradise life relaxing, black, Latino and Anglo-saxon
Armani exchange the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa houses for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Opening eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse fiends to Willie's
It sounds foul but every girl I meet will go down town
I'd open every cell in Attica send 'em to Africa
Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas
If I ruled the world
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin' for today, in these last days and times
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
Verse Three: Nas
You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infiniti
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?
Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas
If I ruled the world
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin' for today, in these last days and times
If I ruled the world
(If I ruled, if I ruled)
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons
(If I ruled, if I ruled)
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls

To guide you through this cold world

Two steps away from death, a vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession, they was checking the Rover
Inspecting the tattoos on my neck and my shoulder
How many times I'm one of six coffin-holders
Or I'm sitting with goons in a visiting room?
Flip it, I could've been you behind state walls bidding
These are the things that a G pray for, acquit us
A little stash in the safe or a little shorty to wait for
Or a shorty to take the weight from
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw God's face on the design on my vintage Claiborne
Swear I see 'em every day in the bus or the train
Or the billboards out there that hang tall
I still give thanks for him, have faith for him
No matter what his name's called
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
Hey, can you think of a color that you've never seen?
Can you reminisce on places you've never been?
Well, is many are called but them never deemed
Worthy for the cause 'cause them never clean
Help who help themselves, Jah nuh raffle dream
That's why me chummy with Jah, Jah like a cherubim
Keep us strong through the winter like an evergreen
And all of us are more connected than it ever seems
All things are related and creation is a package
Generate together and we increase the wattage
A how them a go manage? Tell Babylon them can't do Rasta damage
Nor stop we through the passage
Jah did make a promise, God is always honest
Always keep His word, don't care what the plan is
Don't be astonished, stumbling blocks vanish
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace, woah
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
Some people ask me if I feel the Zionists are real
And in my songs do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb that's under these chrome wheels
My homies is only ones I'm taking care of
But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers have become more weird
As if they were superior and fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of
Collegiate literature, I hold mirrors up
Give combination of pain, joy, fear and love
Through my perspective I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition getting high with my brethren
Could've asked us why Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons, suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom
It's like it's been exchanged for this penicillin
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world

Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
'Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong

Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up

End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, giving mics menstrual cycles

And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra

Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin

(Verse 1: Quan)
Can we please have a moment of silence?
That's for my niggaz doin' years in confinement
And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor?
Symobolizin', let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep till slugs kill us here
This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle tryin' to gain
Smokin' trauma, sniffin' Ra while sellin' cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowin' how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace?
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Bloodin' and thuggin', folkin' and lokin'
Crypin' and creepin', Latin and kingin'
Or just for poor righteous teachin'
(Chorus: Quan sings)
As days goes and nights fall
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishin' y'all were home
(Verse 2: Nas)
Yeah, and can we have another moment of silence?
For brothers who died from black-on-black violence
From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dyin'
And can we please pour some more liquors?
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggaz
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth?
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you
Let's take 'em home
(Verse 3: Quan)
And can we please have a moment to mourn?
For Pac, Biggie and Pun 'cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Ty and Alliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we wish to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children?
Who got raped or murdered, or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Bustin' her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggaz in the pen hopin' rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For very mother that held a son in the street bleedin'
Cryin' a song of sorow to dark and deep for speakin'
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em"

1st Verse:
She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how excitin' life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met must have been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that. I dropped you off home
I call, you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids at
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious, more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hopin' we can stay together
2nd Verse:
I see you dressed up in white, face covered in vail
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwin' rice
And it's today that your father give you away
To a real man, I gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say ""I do""
Drivin' off in the Rolls Royce, ""Just Married"" on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the states
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Somethin' in the back of my head say
For us two, maybe 'cause I love you
Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop till I tell you me to beautiful
Deeper and harder love layin' nude with you
Runnin' my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by
While I'm wit you and I won't even care, word
3rd Verse:
She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pa's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby, shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
Till one day she decided to flip
It was nuttin' I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talkin' this divorcin' shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With her fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too
You my queen, God bless you

Basquiat Portraits
Pinky Rings realistic princesses
Heiresses bunch a Kings and Queens
Plus I picture fortunes for kids out in Port-Au-Prince
Powerless they not allowed to fit
But not about to slip
Vision Promised Land with fashion like
Madison Ave Manhattan
Saks 5th Ave and
Rodeo
Relaxing popping labels
Promise Land no fables
This where the truth's told
Use them two holes
Above your nose
To see the proof yo!
Imagine a contraption that could take us back when
The world was run by black men
Back to the future
Anything can happen
If these are the last days
And 100-food waves come crashing down
I get some hash and pounds
Pass around the bud then watch the flood
Can't stop apocalypse

If satellites is causing earthquakes

Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
(Nas)
Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought 'Kick In The Door' was for?
But that's my heart, y'all still trippin' of this Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'mma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin' at the Fever, streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues, droppin' our schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin new rules
So I, got in 'em shoes, tried 'em wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit, so I couldn't sport em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warring
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island
And Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changing
I had a baby, I was making my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticing my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in with more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thang
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit
BIG and I hit blunts performing at the Arc
Next thing you knew, BIG blew and all the balling starts
He had Kim and his crew, I found Fox, only niggas in New York with number
One charts
BIG was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon my niggas
But dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on the Purple tape
Bad Boy biting Nas album cover way (?)
BIG told me Rae was stealing my slang
And Rae told me out in Shaolin BIG would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with 'Ain't No Niggas'
Had much Versace swagger
BIG admired the Brooklyn knight and it took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today don't know nothing, about this bullshit
There's more shit than wanting to be this King of New York shit
(Nas)
Rap became a version of Malcolm and Martin
Rest In Peace Will, Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
I had lot trust for Steve Stoute
At some point till I got to know him
We old friends, but what's loyal?
Puff soaked Interscope offices
With champagne bottles on Steve, and Steve thought the drama is on me
Cause previously it would have been, against whoever
Friends forever
However, I learn, with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
To diss niggas with Jigga too much, he used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone planning
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets, later on she hittin the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinking he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars that might follow
Tauht her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But that's her, I ain't mad baby, it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss
It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LPs ever to hit stores
In the Firm I learned I am Nastradamus
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with mama
She was getting old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not till I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assasinate my character, degrade my hood
Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What you want, see, I already had
The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first shall be last
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
G-O-D S-O-N, they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo (for dolo

Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on

Rap cats be real frontin
Fuck shootin legs
Cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how bout that
Close range with the gadge get paid
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn quarters when you turn quarters know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimmy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside

Livin' hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you wit me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin' apart
Call for the gods and let them out when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin)
I make it hotter in the summer colder in the winter
If the court paroal ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen 'em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunning when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is coming
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal"

He reps N.Y., yo, gives C notes to winos
Not church, it's how he tithe though
He walks the tenement sleeps at his super fly condo

No certificate for this misfit who handle business
The odds stacked against him, he fights back mack'n Benzes

Infectious charisma of those who gave us direction
The anti-sexes, resistance against oppression
Progressive thinking, ghetto speakers
Protestors against the colored only section to the Jena 6 and
The Frost Nixon, the contradiction, the cross, the crucifixion
The loss we took for sinning on Esau's back inscription

What's all this talk that Nas got brought?
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Ain't nobody been where I been they at standstill
This is all overseen by my man Will!
As I walk through the valley of shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
?? And all my business all my sin is straight ??
And thank the hood for all the love they gave
?? Forgive 'em all for all they did their best to hate ??
Oh let their be light
This ain't to glorify just painting a street picture
There's no goddess or bibles just blunts and swishers
Gillette's cut caine in the kitchen
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth ""Supreme"" Griffin
It's like the same difference except when nigga's get arranged
They don't want the same sentence, nigga's get to snitching
If I could reverse the minds and turn falls to rises and bring back nigga's who livest
Old hustlers reminiscing on better days they home
Doing nothing might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers one foot in the grave
They used to love us until we found our own way through the maze
New York set trippin' and flagging west coast laughing
Now Esco's asking, what happened?
My home girl from Upper Manhattan she remembers the quarters that's Latin
A lot of rat-a-tat-tatting
The son of the audio cassette era, tech wearer
Bullets and burgettes Benz Bo speak a terror
Demand I get mine till I'm dead so I can drop something red
Like that horse standing on its hind legs
Since Arnold and Willis in there bunk beds
I went and bread like wonder
Not Ned the wineo like the parents of Lionel
Nas is the ghetto American idol
No matter what you do your never getting my title
I can't sound smart because you'll run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about yay
Like there's no other way for an ex hustler, cake getter,
Ex rich splitter to touch ya
I beg to differ

Eight years in the game I'll invite you on vacation
Ten years in the game

Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my man's trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be Bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, strapped, prepared for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life I can say I did the right thing
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gonna take it

See how funny it is when your kids ain't got no father
Cause you played it sweet, now you floating in the harbor (for real)
Shit is hectic, so respect it for your health (what)
Didn't think it was right, you shoulda checked it yourself (come on)

You wack and cheap with the dough, my heat could blow
Payin' doctors when I'm born, a preacher when I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life deminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit

Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Child both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dyin'
'Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealin' with science

Till they kid's on the phone sayin', ""Please daddy pay it""
Till they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement

You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggaz want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, comin' out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico

He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rollin' wit you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the air?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a hoe
And you don't even let him know, cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they separate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claimin he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggaz don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with 'em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggaz get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Till you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret bein grimy
What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs, till he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop tickin, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You gettin' older player, look at those who gave up"

Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from

Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels, and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto, 'stead of saying, ""Fuck tomorrow""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a four-matic to crack your whole cabbage

Won't you turn those flow shoes into your ho shoes, ya dig. yeah check this out. This universe fine as your royal highness. You know what, I can do a whole lotta things for you. Guess Why? 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' pimp.
Like Me
Hustlin' and gridning baby

Stayin' on that paper chase
In this life, there's pimp's and ho's
Tell me which one are you, you little
Like Me
Hustlin' and gridning baby
I be
Stayin' on that paper chase
The good man in me say get money and stay on the path.
But the pimp shit in me say, yo, keep looking for ass
But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow.
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait till you're grown, when they love you, you'll know.
Everybody's got a dream, I hope and wish to own a six times two
Chill in the whip a fantasy a bone to pick to get against who I don't know
To one who said you won't blow
You won't eat, you want cake, they mistake.
Blamin me for they failures I'm fresh.
Getting tailored, single breasted.
A lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit.
A woman hates a man and stay with him for many years. Tell him she loves then be jealous of him. Now lame is how the ghetto judge him. 'Cause he still with her. She take his cash and give it to some other real nigger.

Yo NYC, U-N-I-verse, se-riously
Havoc and P, Queens niggaz so it seem to be
Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise, mega
Got word back from Noreaga
The D.A. got video cassette taper
The God with the God-U-Now, pulling a caper
Running up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig tied they motherfuckin wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas in-to
Peep the issue situation like this, we sticking him too
JFK on our way to L.A.
Got links with big cats down to Santa Barbre (Barbara)
My crew do it the Mobb way, everyday
Crime pay, who wanted gunplay? Drill me
Niggaz kill me, thrilling me, you wanna look?
Peep the nine milli, now undress, you know the drill-y
Niggaz suspect, weak links pose threats, I have yet
To met challenger who go against my set
Gem stars razor sharp like Gillette, shaving closely on
Any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burglars trying to sneak peep the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5,000 a plate
(Havoc)
No doubt kid, I hit them niggas like a bid
The prosecutor, running up in your crib
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely
It's only me, and the gat that's holding me
We got it locked beyond measure, the click's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure smack you with the undresser
Represent your click, go ahead, get that ass whipped
(Floating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic)
Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talking
QB represent fuck that, it can happen
While you rapping, I'm busy tryna sneak the gat in
Could tear men, cut the party while you jamming
We think smarter, reach harder, got the 44
Bodyguard of something you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me
(Nas)
Niggaz thinking shit sweet, I carry big heat
Wavy hair chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep
Queens murder clicks meet, yellow tapes on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones, that's irregular
Why debate on a phone, I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600, you just a crumb inside a world
Where the rich run it, curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists
I preserve in my dome, niggas' mics is full of silicone
Spot's blown, guerilla ice on this killer's life
I put my word on it
Now you can sleep on or rock a swerve on it
Nas is m√©nage √† trois' on Mount Aire lodges
We like a smooth fam', but rougher than how DeBarge is
Catching charges, of marksmen, living heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit
We mobbing, putting niggas in mausoleums
Put Queens across the Throggs Neck, heads bop, I see 'em

We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, we spending
Not under the ground yet, we enjoying every second yo
Live now, don't forget to bro, yeah
'Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro
Picture my last days will be so grim
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it
Sex, I dropped pearl necklaces on necks and tits
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it
From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with
So live now nigga
(Scarlett)
It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis
Gotta respect you 'cause you never tied to smash
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack
Now I see that you a man after all you been through
A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, ""Me a victim?"", could never be my character
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him
Just happy it didn't get in our kid
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless
Remember days of diamond cuts
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggaz I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggaz, rich niggaz, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces
Critics and fans, they need to get a life
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now
I grew with you so you know you make me proud
And most of all you gotta live now
(Chorus: Scarlett)
Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending
Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo
Gotta live it up to the limit yo
'Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, ""Nas did this""
Pointin' to they scars like, ""Right here, baby, really Nas did this""
Like a badge of honor, not braggin' I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothin's realer than karma

So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smilin', I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back

Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floors
Weekends at the Venetian pull up in that black horse
Top down new fashion
Seein' me's like seein' me through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera lights flashin'
And I'm laughin' my plaques from album sales
Y'all just ringtone platinum but ninety-nine cents adds up
I don't hate 'em I congratulate 'em
The new young prince, young Mike Jackson on the same track

Now let's toast to the hustlas
""We make the world go round""
Tell the hustlas to toast to the gangstas
""We make the world go round""
Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballas
""We make the world go round""
Tell the ballas to pour a glass for all us
""We make the world go round"""
88,Mastermind,2002,God's Son (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"A mastermind
Sees it coming before it comes
A mastermind
Before he go to war he count his ones
A mastermind
Everything planned out perfect-incase you niggas got to get murdered
A mastermind
Sleeps at night real easy
A mastermind
Cause everything he does is by the book
A mastermind
Never do a thing irrational-live forever these tales are classical
Velvet bowtie
Bulletproofs in the tux when I roll by
In the car similar to Osama's
In my diamonds, and my principle is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan a couple of, years ago when guns started clapping
Two of my dogs fell
Two of my niggas ran
They were amateurs in beef with a grown man
They taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak end up in the coffin
Play it cool that's the old school rule man
Keep your ears to the street you'll never loose man
Make you enemies believe there's love there
Because in war believe it's all fair
Rock 'em to sleep
Shots in your jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was for me
Its for my masterind
It ain't a game it's the life
Think it's a game you lame and I'm nice
On the Blackstone Marlowe
Tobes to me hair robe mad turn up
Weather below zero-gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her ear lobe 'drive home'
'Cause she the wife and they the freaks
They underneath my girl calliber
They smiled at her said goodbye with niggas
They thugged out they wild as us
My bodyguards in my Danali truck
Knowing I'm surrounded by Old Gs that I don't really get down with
They got a separate table for they freaks
Brought 'em drinks
So we can talk
So real niggas can relate
I knew
They kelt Hose too
Like Ray Peru
They used to spray troops
But now they managing groups
The main nigga Sonny had big money since '82
Had two of my dogs wacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew
I swithced that
Now I'm strong with niggas that feel Sonny was wrong
My moneys long, his money is weak
Hes losing sleep trying to fill me out
To see what its gone be, but I'ma MASTERMIND
I live the clean life
I don't need to steal cable
I speak for myself my niggas'll slay you
Lucky for me this rap done worked out fine
FEDs, check me out, its no dirt drop finds
This King of New York shit only last'd 15 minutes
Every nigga get burn'd but it's what you did wi it
Niggas who brilliant came in and killed it, made million
Every 3 months, new jewelry
I'm low
Smoking blueberry wit a hoe that know a few scary individuals is airy
As she get into it, spread the inner voodoo
She says a Hail Mary then she said she knew who, would come and try to kill you too"

Hennessey holders and old school niggas, then I be dissing a
Unofficial that smoke woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the liver
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented, with formality
My duration's infinite, money wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip hop, straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Childhood lesson make me see him drop in my weed smoke 
It's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines
The hype vice, murderous night times, and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, hold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rolling mats for craps to cee-lo
With side bets, I roll a deuce, nothing below (Peace God)
Peace God, now the shit is explained
I'm taking niggas on a trip straight through memory lane

One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Aliz√©, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis, is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
Your telephone blown, black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down popo when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustling brothers who keep the same rank
Pumping for something, some will prosper, some fail
Judges hanging niggas, incorrect bails, for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hanging cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo
Fuck ""Rap is real"", watch the herbs stand still
Never talking to snakes cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

I love you so much, don't never leave me, I won't let you leave
The ho turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love wit her
I saved that ho 'cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heart-broken she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna loose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her c.r.e.a.m. I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act
When she not around, I'm heated, bout' to lay somethin' flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped

Oh money you my honey

Oh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich

Oh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich
All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us 2 together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup,
'Cause when we hump we do it up, make sure we both will bust a doller sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slingin' all night long, fienin' to stroke ya
Seeing niggas wit' you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note

I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you
Before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me 'cause I'm wit you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
Its hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat wit' government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I like'd you better when you where illegal
But you had to get professional
Musical
Now when we fuck we use profalactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxuary, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya ASSets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Oh money you my honey

Rats get they tail snapped and trapped
It's snitches in the streets and it's snitches in rap
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya
Coroner choruses, some from the Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of fallin' in a elevator passin' flows
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers
Picture ya tarot cards and bodyguards gettin' sprayed up
Sabotagin' my make-up, my watches get laced up
Even if they indited Jacob
Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off
The frivolated shock to ya chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from a iron
I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit
Got bitches high as Hell and they fuckin' like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to ya hotel or made in this shit
Put a barrel in the capo mouth, till his scalp come out
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about
Came poetic, too many haters to count
Too much paper to count, QB bitch
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money over bullshit, pistols over brawlin'
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper black carpet
Thinkin' 'bout which nigga to target
You kill a nigga today, he lives forever
So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no martyrs
Black tech on the table, mag four-four
Black negligee on my bitch, she's at the door
Black fish eggs nigga, that's the caviar
You niggas is fish made, y'all niggas is fifth grade niggas
It's fifty ways to die said the general
I give you the top five, you will not survive
Rule 1 cocksucker keep my name from ya tongue
Rule 2 thought you knew don't fuck wit' God's Son
Rule 3, see, matter fact I'll just wait
If y'all reach top five then I'mma eat y'all alive
Each one of you guys that claim hip-hop is still alive
Like y'all ain't in agreement wit' Nas
I said it's dead muthafucka, it's dead bitch
From crack pushers to 'Lac pushers, and ambushers
And morticians to fortresses, case dismisses
Laced in riches, cake ridiculous, from nickel and dimin'
To trickin' them diamonds, Vegas, places in Switzerland
From nine blast to the auto, have to blast mine
They blast mine, black nine, you flatline, my cash climb
Buy rare art, antique pieces, Mona Lisas
Own, no leases, five star restaurant eaters
Don't forget who ya peeps is, 'pose to dyin' wit' you
Sip that good wine wit' you, only if they grind wit' you
Or slang for ya, seen niggas live, laugh, party and
Die on that very same corner
Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable
Private planes landed out in ???, weed I twirl
Once even gave me a phobia, that I'll be in the spot
Trapped like a Madam Zenobias wit' this kid eyein' my Rolly, yo

Cause the things I seen (We know too much)
Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)
(Verse 1 (Nas))
It was packed on the Ryker's bus
The tight cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killa
Mothers of dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shortiez gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry
(Verse 2 (Millennium Thug))
It is I that step up
Me that don't give a fuck, you that bold, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Range's through the desert
Fuck a 20 inch, long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter
I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max
S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back
But yo
(Verse 3 (Nas + Millennium Thug))
Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns
Clean fun shootin' dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe
[MT] But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business
Courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in this system, I'm bout to rebel
(Verse 4 (Millennium Thug))
There's not a bitch in sight
All block bench, all block gates
All gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown man cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Everytime I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the news flash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say

Add some bravado
Get wealthy likes Wells Fargo

Surviving through

I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose draws
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under beds, mask and a flashlight
Living my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mama told me from weed, I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack-on
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Bopping to the supremes, smoking joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want
I did it my way, from crumbs and roaches and rats
I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps
I did it my way, from break dancing, back spins on the cardboard
I did it my way, to bullet proof bentleys, gats in the car's door
I did it my way, never gave a fuck what nobody said
I did it my way, they hope that I fail and wished I was dead
I did it my way, if I fucked op it falls on me
I did it my way, I'm lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat

Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Juzzi's, gucci soap, throwing cash in the air
Though I, still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get with I got
They think its alot, the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, coming if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder till I seen my man get popped
No blood soaking, laying there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was looking right through me, Yo staring beyond
I wonder what he saw, the limoes, movies and tours
Did he die in vain and represent for the cause
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game, Y'all can't relate, fuck y'all (Ill Will)
I did it my way, from crumbs, roaches and rats
I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps
I did it my way, I call it how I see it niggas
I did it my way, if you don't like it so be it niggas
I did it my way, I make my own rules, I do my own plans
I did it my way, gangstas do what they want
Suckers do what they can't
I did it my way, taking sacrifices kid
I did it my way, but now you only getting one life to live

Yo, hoes in my fold can slow me, roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scolding my foes who phony
From blocks where coke can feed you and cops are over evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesil
Here on and blow it rurals, its mine, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappear
Snitches and bitches, smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminiscence and remember, sitting on wood benches
Gave me splinters, just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, moving

I'm the nigga that ain't loud
Throw C-low, never ace out
Only move out wit a particular crew, I hate crowds
The observer, money and murder the hood praise it
I was raised in it, early age
Was presented with the ultimatum
Be a boss with a army, drop the Atari games
Hard cocaine that had my neighborhood strung out
Brains numb out, guns out
I was smart high hopes in my heart
But dope cartels would emerge
Bloody shirts on niggaz while they hollerin'
Till their lungs don't work
Figures I end up with a scarred memory of my youth
With dudes in the drug loot, feelin' henny ""SHOOT""
My nigga Will still here, man I wish it was truth
Buried in his favorite shit, FILA sneakers and FILA suit
My eyes are the window of my soul
My niggaz let the Indo roll
Thinkin' time flies we gettin' old
That's the words of my right hand man, my main dawg
We been rollin' since day one, he down for the cause
All he talk is extortion, kidnap shit, big gat shit
I'm like - ""yo think positive"", but he act sick
He only think about lettin' his Mac spit
He like fuck who he hit
Me it bothers, 'cause he know I'm rent 'em it regardless
If he keep wildin' out he's makin' both of us targets
So I pull him, tell him on some deep shit, try to school 'em
We already lost niggaz by how we was movin'
We still livin', but our lives need much improvin'
I think I'm gonna lose 'em

I was blind in this world
All I thought about was diamonds and pearls
I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl
Nappin' his kids, ransack and run through his rib
Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live
It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror
Like all this time, it's just a fragment of my mind
Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be
In reality +My Worst Enemy+ was me
(Verse Two: Nas)
Feelin' like I got the dons clout
Trigger pawn cocked glocks spray up your moms spot
I ain't playin' wit you, war, fuck pistols
Bring machines, icy bell buckles, ten guns, M-1'S with ice muzzles
Life's a struggle, get your wifey touch too, everybody involved
Homicide, doctors patchin' up your war scars
Task Force chargin' at us, news flash, thug crews blast at officers
Coroners pick you up from the grass
Livin' fast till somebody tries meltin' my chest
I'm high losin' it, could of hit my own self with the tec
Refuse to quit, but I tried tellin' me to relax
It's like I can't hear my words till I'm trapped to the max
Even then I blame everybody else except me, pops left me
I was just three, I cried for help, moms was busy
That don't mean nigga's stupid
But I got a habit wit - makin' up excuses
Was born ruthless, hated school, they ain't teach me I'm a bad seed
Planted in this ghetto, where my niggaz can't read
Multiply, subtract; only knowin' how to count cracks and count stacks
Now what y'all know about that
One side of me wanted out of this life
Glue traps on the floor for the mice
Till the nigga saw the light
I wanted money when I got it, I would spend it
I wanted jewels, but when I heard it, yo I wouldn't listen
All of the drama in my life I got my self into
All the toxins my body took in, faded my mental
I let these niggaz words get to me
But I'm tired of my ice, tired of Bentley
It's the end of the century
I recognized the world is a beautiful place
Niggaz opinions ruinin' my musical taste
'Cause every time I caught a case, could of got me in jail
If you wasn't scared of jail, you more likely to fail
I thought the whole world was cursed, from the hand I was dealt
And +My Worst Enemy+ was my self
Word to my self... word to my self... word to my self...
(Chorus: Nas)
I was blind to the world
All I thought about was diamonds and pearls
I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl
Nappin' his kids, ransack, run through his rib
Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live
It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror
'Cause all this time, it was a fragment in my mind
Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be
In reality +My Worst Enemy+ was me"

Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you lookin' for? You the question and the answer
We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
Summers, coolin' off by the fire hydrant
Yeah I'm from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level - it's not unusual
To see photos of dead homie's funerals
Aluminum foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners
Girls dye their hair with Kool-Aid
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade
But this nigger's paid, ancestry of slaves
Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling
Put rims on everything, where Timbs on every scene
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you lookin' for? You the question and the answer
Do I mean it like a slave master, nigger?
No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes, take off the bracelets
Savers went broke, smokes, our diesel, need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Thought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses' lost commandments like a growth sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peepin' us, every week I must
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreamin' of
Between cuttin' hard coke with new razors slicin' my fingers up
They used to string us up, we wanted everything
But the one bringin' us cake be the snakes like the
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistake, tryna get it like Medellin
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you lookin' for? You the question and the answer
{My nig', what up my nig'? Yep!}
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I ain't just rappin' for fame
I got my old homie, half-sister's father askin' for chains
Yep, I get it cash up, this paper don't matter
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
'Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
They callin' it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'
I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me
You'll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So let's keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I-double-G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master

98,N.Y. State of Mind,1994,Illmatic (1994),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Yeah yeah
Hey yo, black, it's time,
Word, word is timing?
It is time, man
A'ight, nigga, begin
Yeah, straight out the fuckin dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo, now
Rappers, I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin
Musician, inflictin composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin cocaine
Holdin an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peep holes
I'm suited up with street clothes
Hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner, bettin Grants with the Cee-lo champs
Laughing at baseheads trying to sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin about the last time the Task Force flipped
Niggas be runnin through the block, shootin
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""back up,"" the MAC spit
Lead was hittin niggas, one ran, I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, yo my shit is stuck
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now I'm jettin to the buildin lobby
And it was full of children, probably couldn't see as high as I be
(So what you saying?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin the triggers, bringing fame to they name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight stickup kids, they run up on us
.45s and gauges, MACs in fact
Same niggas'll catch a back to back
Snatchin your cracks in black
Yo theres a snitch on the block gettin niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drops
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring ya customers and measurin pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin and they wives basin'
It drops deep, as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Be havin dreams that I'm a gangster, drinkin Mo√´ts, holdin TECs
Makin sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock, sewin up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin gunfights with mega cops
But just a nigga, walkin with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin
Thinkin of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the P.J.'s, my blend tape plays, bullets and strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back black
I'm livin where the nights is jet black
The fiends fight to get crack I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain and be prosperous
Though we live dangerous, cops could just
Arrest me, blaming us, we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dice
I'm takin rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin is a vitamin, held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, twenties of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I could greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words in my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothin's equivalent to the New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Yo, yo-yo, y'all
Whattup? Whattup
It's time man (Word, it's time?)
Straight up, it's time man
Aight, set that shit off
(Set it off then nigga, set it off)
Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors, look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma shoulda cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin
Stitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark -- NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve; they bust a U-e I jog
To my building -- come out later wearin camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain -- strangle men
Niggaz gaspin for air; till they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes -- tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sister's pregnant
Father's on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested
Had eight partners growin' up, eight turned to seven
Seven turned to six niggaz, got two in heaven
Six of us, holdin' it, now it's five rollin' thick
The sixth one's parole flipped; five niggaz, went to fo' quick
When he went O.T., college life, converted into gangbangin
Four niggaz still hangin', years passed and slang changin
Three of us now, fourth nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real -- he did the snake shit
Fake shit -- beat his ass down, yo his mouth
Could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown
All I got left in the end is two of my best friends
And we all goin' out, to the death for these ends, WHAT?
New York, New York (""New York state of mind"" -> [Rakim])

You heard about it, you see about it
You read about it, it's in your papers
It's in your daily news (""Get money!"")

The crime rate, the murder rate
The money rate, the paper chase, youknowhatImean?
New York state of mind baby, check it out

I'm at the, gamblin spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home, to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggaz sing along
All the ciggarette smoke's cloggin my lungs, hoodrats flashin they tongue
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggaz both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggaz got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in the lead
'Cause I ain't playin', niggaz'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggaz'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggaz, just New York niggaz
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on em, you knew 'em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggaz is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggaz that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggaz, that relocated down South
Comin' back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
Runnin' round quick to split your mug, it's ea-sy to score
But it's hard to get the shit off
Niggaz fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggaz, mad 'cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggaz scheamin, some real, some niggaz frontin
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin'

A provocative plan, can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said, we need atonement

I didn't get touched checking my nuts, I stood up and lit a Dutch

My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin your life

Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spendin' your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggaz in jail
Slingin for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sportin' Gators, gettin' thrills
Our honies wearin' Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar, sunset, and the sex is so high-tech
Uh
Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne
We gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you see over from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Tow G's, we got the type fam with Mac 11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, DRJ watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eyes, can understand that I'm...

(Queensbridge, y'all ready to see Nasty Nas?)
(Uh huh, they ready)
Yeah, word
Got some Remy Martin
Some good-ass cigars
Check it out
Ayo, late night, candlelight
Fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand dollar bottles of scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cuttered
Count how many bad honeys I slutted
It's a high number, name a nigga under
The same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah I wonder
Eyes flutter as love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo
Cigars, drop robes, hoes, drop clothes
Louis XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown, and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semiautomatic weapons I brought
The world Crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince 'em, all appraise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and State Key, my jewelry in HD
Silent rage, ristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage
I am the dragon, Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high, I Neverland like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack your rib
Sacrilege, talk trash about the Nasty Kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceiling, the safe, bitch I got it
You envy but don't offend me
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me
Too godly to be a Bugatti
You honestly must design me
Somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the '90s
Drug dealer car, rush to the bar
Move niggas, we don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet, in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact
Haha
(Nasty) Nasty Kid
(Nasty) Yeah
(Nasty) The Kid
(Nasty) Yeah
(Nasty) Nasty Kid
(Nasty)
For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin'
Sayin', It was Nas I used to hustle with
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashes
Guns on my waist, pass this
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joining the blunt passin', you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in the wars, in the streets cops kickin' in doors
For my deen, nigga, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
I'm no fake rap CD listener
Sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my G's, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga"

Yo yo yo
I gots no birth records, no next of kin
Know a lot of mothafuckers, got no best friends
Know the weather checkin' ten-ten winds a.m.
First and fifteenth I'm layin at the check cashing
Think I'm playin', blink and I'm sprayin
Wrong move, ask yourself what leg you wanna lose 'cause you gon' lose
I cripple niggas, from the complex to simple niggas
Keep showin y'all what difficult is
Half the world sayin' ""Dunn"" but never been to the Bridge
What type of shit is that, fraudulence, what's the cause of it
Nature came threw erasing all of it, stop the presses
Goofy niggas ask a lot of questions
I repeat this is not a question
If you don't reply quick enough I gotta press em
Keep the glock by the intestines, .38 waist
Wit a belt, regardless of your stats you can catch a shell
Believe me when I tell you this (Believe me when I tell you this)
There's nuttin y'all can do for me (There's nuttin y'all can do for me)
I don't believe in selfishness, this time I want my crew to eat (My crew)

We comin' wit a hundred miles (A hundred miles)
Bumpin shit all summer long (Bump that)
We want it dead and want it now (We want it now)
Yo aiyyo I rap for my niggas and rap for the hoes
Rap when I'm gettin' dressed, when I iron my clothes
Depressed, I kick raps that change your whole mood
And somehow stick to your ribs like soul food
Rap for wheelchairs, rap for canes
Ace bandages and niggas wit sprain, stay limpin in pain
I rap for math, English, even rap for science
Gotta try to laugh, keep myself from cryin
I rap for Giants, the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets
It's New York New York, from Clue to Flex
New cassettes stay poppin' up, your boo let me throw my cock in her
Rappin' got me two proper nuts
It's crazy, I even rap for high school coach
White folks fiend out like in Michael Doates
Creamed out, dope stashin
For those askin, I flow for TV, HBO and closed caption
Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo
Don't go to Texas, don't go to Watts
Don't go to Queensbridge, nigga don't go to cops
Don't snitch when you're gettin' bagged
In the penns, don't bitch when you gettin' stabbed
Just hold that, I pose for Kodak's, rose to stardom
Hoes in Harvard, sophmores get knocked off, nigga watch yours
I watch the game like it's Saint John's
It ain't wrong, take a blank piece of paper, a pen paint songs
Type colorful, writin that shit a thug'll do
In the heat of the moment, type to make a sudden move
Some'll snooze, some'll snore, they won't admit that dunn is pure
Once I quit, niggas wanted more
Cop my shit once it come in store
The first week be at the top of the charts, got it jumpin' off
Hot verses wit a hundred thoughts
One theme, gettin' caught in my zone you'll become a corpse"

I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum
Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days
In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze
I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke
That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off
The infrastructure caves in, amazin'
I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men
Serve niggaz, bird niggaz speakin' reckless
When their momma love the kid's records I made
You gutless, you don't know struggle
Throw a couple slugs at you, hell grabs you
Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine
I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen
Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand
I'ma guide you like the OG, but don't talk, don't get it confused
'Cause none'a y'all can fit in my shoes
Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions
God'll forgive you bastards
Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage
(Verse 2: Nas)
I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?
Form a crew, swallow forty cal' bullets after dinner's finished
Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full'a scrilla
Can't come close to, Francis Copala, Samson -- no Delilah
You're pint-sized, I'm mic's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it
You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap
Tell you a story shorty, spicy like lories
Chickenheads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties
Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours
Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes
Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys
Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage
You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage
(Verse 3: Nas)
Son's backward flows, they say mine is very scary
Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies
And all of y'all wear that same aroma
How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya
You're wack nigga, face it
In the history of the game, you have no placement
Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity
Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth
But when the sun go south, them comes come out
My cavalry woulda been threw ten in your skin
Casualty you don't wanna be, don't want it with me

It's a new world, it's a new world
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world
Yo, celebrate the new life
New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin gold
Solar-energized rides, no steering wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve, computers takin' over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin
New life for man, children, and women
Yo, the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones
Bill Clinton's the new JFK, without the hole in his dome
The new Don Trump is Bill Gates
Not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake
And cake mean his stock, net gross
Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars takin' pictures
New hustlas gettin' new street figures
And US embassies overseas
Almost every foreign country's under siege
Covertly startin wars, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
Oil in the earth spills
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage
Say goodbye to the brainwashed
Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart
Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts
Yo, it's real
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal
Say hello to the one world
Say hello to the sky, somethin's out there watchin you and I
More enticin than Star Trek, StarTec phones
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones
You got CD-Rom, everythang operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks
Y2K's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrare
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothin' make me more happier than seein today"

Uh, uh, uh
(Intro: repeat 2X)
No idea's original, there's nothin' new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major
(Nas)
If niggaz could look inside my mind, you'll find
Where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the braincell graveyard
Where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
""No Half Steppin'"" with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin' on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork and Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
On a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
Your part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them, treacherous rocksters in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin for paint chips, don't want no led in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin since Roxanne Shante' made ""Runaway""; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist
I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things like
Somebody's always watchin, my life
Before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled

We was kids hungry, Mom's working I was famished, she getting home late
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full of starve, corner store like Mr. SpareAQuarter
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
15 I got a gun, 16 I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun, what's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, 'til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the mist of
Dudes who switch up and change
They want to carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them know, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow
I remember early mornings - syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth 200 million now, bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing 40, she only 21
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion black motherfuckers
To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back
1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him, I spread them, hit them and dead them
She says, ""third leg from a legend is sheer heaven""
She says, ""it is the greatest loving""
The tales you hear is the truth, on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis - this goes to her with love
Also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha Explain"

So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot

Just 'cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit my nigga
I know who died before the body dropped
I know the guns that were used how much money the shooter got
Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all
The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time
Is all we talk when we talk of New York y'all
Who to call and who to stay away from
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe son
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up

Heated-up marble floors with ja'causezis in it
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
All those things you still ain't really doin' shit kid
Cause in reality I'll earn my salary
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
It kinda make me wanna hate bling it's a race thing
How they sell blacks to bootleg shit infact
Real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
Whores charge niggas with raping
'Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
Watch us make bets on race tracks smokin' cigars
So they counter the laws to take what's ours
Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars

But, yo if you got a plan, believe me you gon' get there
You gon' get everything you ever wanted baby
That's my word
Trust, my niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tour in
Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
Guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood mb cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a le tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up
From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot willin'
Look at the chain I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'
Half of the crew probably on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought
Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife
For steppin' on the next man's nikes my motto look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
Be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better

Nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin'
Poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin'
Gucci iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs
One for your wife, one for your freak silver spurs
Rolls Royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
Pool parties beautiful view
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin' damn wish my niggas could afford this
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments
Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried will your familia
Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum
You should live, there's only one life that's the physical
Rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you, the shit you use to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turn 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real
Everything must eventually come to an end
So try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever, ya know
I said everything eventually comes to an end
So try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Ya know, ya now, nothin' lasts forever ya know"
113,On the Real,1994,Illmatic (1994),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Yeah yeah.
On the... On the... On the.
On the real, all you crab niggaz know the deal
Finally up in this nigga
Let's pay homage to Illmatic
Let's put the crown where it's at
10 years
Never been done this real by nobody
To my seed, May I lead you into no greed or evil
In the categories of stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, Monkey do
Shorty sipping sunny dew
Now it's V.S.O.P. in a Phantom, mad smoky
Murder trees, cruisin gat in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Trump Plaza, Suite 3010, don't make no noise 'cause we dirty
Tell them hoes hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom
And there's video taping bloomin ass's on the zoomin lens
Rollin' on you nondescript niggaz
You're marked for death like Colombians with bad coke that gyp niggaz
Tilt the dutch, twisted up the uwee if you're skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts
That verse is 10 years old, 9¬Ω years old
Street's Disciple
The Rebirth comin' at you this year baby
It's on baby
Yeah
To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles
This is mandatory, what if there's not tomorrow?
You know the murder rate, jealousy, you heard 'em say
He say, she say, I'm bout cheddar, he don't deserve to make
Sippin clear liquor with niggaz, that talk sideways
Listenin close, to every word in case they violate
Up in the projects Apartment 5D
Spark a lea' it's bout da reed, countin' everything the block see
We bout to need to take the corners from them cowards
Get it on so y'all can move more coke powder, by the hour
Hold in case we gotta rip niggaz
Loaded - Teflon coated projectiles'll flip niggaz
From ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my man's with guns in hand
Police vans, they missed the summers again
Yeah, power to the people
Death to the phonies
This beast to the mic 1 2 check
Y'all fed-e-rallies on me
And they look like you
Approachin me like ""How you, Homie?""
The F.B.I. see only one problem, they try to slump me
After the young black male 'cause he makes a lot of money
So hustlers make crack sales 'cause they deprived and hungry
My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies
While makin' cake with real golded plate rims on Hum-V's
The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga
Just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders
I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow
Motto no stress, smokin' less than I did befo'
You see the kid was broke till I spitted vivid expressions of hard livin'
Ghetto children, of a lesser god, religion was fast women, expensive cars
Y'all witnessin over 10 years - THE BEST OF NAS"

You know I got to check this, what is that?
Yo, this some letter I've got from my man Nas, man, word is bond

What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should have slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flipping, talking 'bout he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest

Out in New York the same shit is going on

Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurting something, word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'mma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wilding on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwilding in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, till he come home he'll play it low key
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad
For the weekend hittin L's while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rolling two phillies together, in the Bridge we called 'em ooh-wops
He said, ""Nas, niggas could be busting off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black trey-deuce""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'm ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

One time... yeah... yeah...
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit
Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics
Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his heineken
Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in
Blackin out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it
Till everybody come home, little niggaz is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sip from the star sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die, with nines out
This is what nas is bout, nigga the time is now!
(Whispering again)
Yo, all I need is one mic...
All I need is one mic... that's all I need
All I need is one mic... all I need niggaz
All I need is one mic... yeah
(Gradually getting louder)
All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one, look back
At all the hatred against me, fuck alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots
From twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my guns was holdin' 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs
My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
If y'all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust
Led flyin, feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now!
(Whispering again)
All I need is one mic... that's all I need, that's all I need
All I need is one mic... there's nuttin else in the world
All I need is one mic... that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know
All I need is one mic...
(Starting loud this time, getting quieter)
All I need is one life, one try, one breath I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you
Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns I'm blastin 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? fooled you niggaz
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my range, niggaz throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes
Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real
Heard he was, tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searchin, the time is now
All I need is one mic... yeah, yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic... that's all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash
All I need is one mic... fuck the cars, the jewelry
All I need is one mic... to spread my voice to the whole world"

Check it out
When I'm chilling, I grab the buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexing
Keep lubrication, lifestyle protection
Hitting up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well acappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes

But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a nine, fine, see now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on and off 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make ya heads bop, pa
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I raided
I hold a Mac-11, and attack a reverend
I contact 11 L's and max in heaven
(Yo, one time for your mind, one time) It sound clever
(But one time for your mind, one time) Yeah whatever
(One time for your mind, one time) Yo, from '92 to '99
Yeah that shit was crazy fat Paul, know what I'm sayin'?
But check it, you gotta another verse for me
I want you to kick it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Kick that shit for the projects"

This one right here is for the people

Ay yo D. Let's go all the way on this one
Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a fly go a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
'Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the west
Will never move east
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord
Yeah, Sabali. That's patience. That's what the old folks told me...
Discovering the World before this World. A World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer
Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round if the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things that he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out the root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze and that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wed mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive, Against All Odds, Now?
It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react
You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant
You're scared of the truth, be patient for now
Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hue? what's man? what's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch n-ggas play the game like the lakers
In a world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day 'cause
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'pardon me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless... I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn
This goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World
Sabali, Patience, yeah"

Uh, light somethin', stop frontin'...
How much money's enough? Think maybe like the trillion figures
Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton sisters
That'd kill me yo, filthy rich
My daughter pass it on to the next generation
Throwing carnations at my tombstone
In my new home
Meet moms in my Yves St. Laurent suit on
Then we do a dance like my man Luther jam
But my verse came first
I stole change out her purse
Now I wanna dig her up outta the earth
Too morbid, lean forward toward a new paragraph
Blue carats, D-Class
Strictly that cush in the weed bag
Tryna figure out what Berry Gordy had put in production
Studio smoky now, hard like David Ruffin
Hit a spliff through a s√©ance, and I, play on playa
(Hook: Snoop Dogg)
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta get your papes on, play on playa
Before it's all gone, sip Dom, tip waiters
Do the yacht thing, m√©nage swing, baby
Spendin' dubs on your buzz, gotta live crazy
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Get your papes on, play on playa
Get your papes on, play on playa
Get your papes on
(Verse 2: Nas)
Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose
Rubies in Hey-Zeus piece
Pimped out like Snoop be, but an East Coast thing
My girl stock-ing tied up in a knot, top of my bean head
Billion dollar dream hear
Went from triple beams to digital
Serving fiends, the minimal
60 G's, no criminal
No mo', Just mo' doe
Mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings on fingers
While your girl performs cunnilingus
'Cause this big money aroma lingers
Barber cleans his blade, then he give me a fade
Hot towel on the face
Hot models who vomit after they eat so they can stay lightweight
Swallowing my protein like an Ovaltine shake
Come through like Moe Green from Godfather, so clean
Where I step, I Clorox it
Keep 20 G's on both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets
Eighty thousand, browse for the nicest price
But we ain't into buying Conflict Ice
That's the shit they stole from the Congo and other black soil
True mack for you
Nappy hair, just spinnin'
Honey gave me a massage with the happy ending
Finest females I just came on, and sprayed her
Gotta get your papes on, play on playa

Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her

Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Get your papes on, play on playa
(Verse 3: Snoop Dogg)
It's kinda hard for a playa like you
But let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue
What you never do
Is punk out, what you better do
Never let the game get ahead of you
Get a better view
Better yet a better crew
Praise God, I'ma marry you
Get your homie, carry you, bury you
Slowly, roll me another blunt stuff it
Lick it, puff it, tuck it - fuck it
That man, that gang, that bang it was
In D-O double G we trust
Yep yep, young loc with the two step
He creepin' with two Tecs
He's sleepin' with two chicks
Right before he blast, all you heard was two clicks (blaw)
End of existence, for instance
Rewind it, replay it, re-chop it, remix it
Re-twist it, god damn D-O double G, 'cause we missed it
Travel slow, I'm a Indian but not a Navajo
I smoke the big leaf in all the big deef's
My hair in two braids, I'm the big Chief
Ladahdah be dahdadah
Yeah break that down, how fresh ya are
The king from Queens, Mr. Escobar
Connect with the best from the west, yes yes ya are
Oh my God, it's Snoop Dogg and Nas

122,Poppa Was a Playa,2002,The Lost Tapes (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"To My Nigger who brought me in this world
Taught us right Nigger
My old dad imported to the family structure
Provide her God
My moms a queen at university civaliza
My pops maybe was late but always came home
My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
Soon as he walk in the door she barking
I turned out the Jonny Carson
Jumped out the bed
We grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother
Not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting yelling at each other
My papa played the street all day
Mama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone pepping out the window heeding
But still I didn't see it
Mama hid it from us
We was kids younger
Till we got bigger, on to
Bigger things that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving the crib and moms love
Papa was player, player wasn't papa
Papa loved the ladies
Never got enough of
Pretty brown round
Running round town (Shhhhh)
Don't tell your mother what's going down
(Repeat 2x)
So many kids I knew, never knew what Pap was
That's why I show my pop love
He was still around when I fucked up
He could have left
My moms pregnant shock to death but stayed
Watch me crawl till I took my first step, to the first grade
To my first fist fight
Right behind me he would stand
No matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in your eye, swing my right scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches and weed all over my crib him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing
So then I asked him
What's this white shit on that plate and your facing?
Papa why you butt ass from the waist
And who's this lady I'm facing
Dark skin you're not my mommy
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promise things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth close and don't tell mommy
He said one day I'll understand little me
Was in you to side me
Papa was player, player wasn't papa
Papa loved the ladies
Never got enough of
Pretty brown round
Running round town (Shhhhh)
Don't tell your mother what's going down
(Repeat 2x)
Pop's told me hold my own
Pop's told me value home
Could I help it papa was a rolling stone
Who loved the pretty brown round
Out of town bound
Jumping in his jazz Benz he touring
At home I play his latest recordings
And it's strange now how, I do my thing now
I'm in the game now
And heard of it his brain pow
To pull strings and gain power
From weed habits are same now
No white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes
And beats that be pumping
Before he left he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed till we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life next day they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together then someone will get killed
I love you still
Always will
Cause that's my nigger
Although you felt you was wrong
I still feel you kid
Life goes on"

""What we need to be thinkin' about is the future!
We don't know what's in store tomorrow!
All we can do is just guess! We want the best for tomorrow;
For our family, for our children, for our future
But if we don't get up andact like we want it,
We gotta pray to somebody! We ain't to tough to pray!
You walkin' around like a gangsta, gangstas pray! Thugs pray!
Tell me somethin'; if you ain't prayin', where would y'all be today?
Where would y'all momma be today? How would you be here?
Somebody prayin' for you, nigga!""
(Horse)
I never thought bein' a man you could hang in the end
Facin' life with no parol and consecut' sentencin'
Got people witnessin', your co-defendant snitchin',
Your back against the wall, your left eye is twitchin'
Loyal ladies usual, a D-and A's the mutual
Scared to face the light of a courtroom site
Racist cops on each side 'cause the know I just might
Make a break for the door but I give it my all
If I die in this struggle, give my momma a call
'Cause she always left these jewels: what goes up must fall
Since I fell dead broke, landed in jail
Refused to face the facts, how wifey skipped to town with the bail
I'm on my own now, V8, far away from home now
Palmer wealth state, the law changes each date
Secret inditements got me knocked, there ain't no price I can pay
To get me the fuck up out this shit, so to Allah I pray
For forgiveness - Yes, I sinned and I need to be held
And jail ain't no place a black man wanna be killed
Amen
I only pray when shit is fucked up!
I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!
I only pray when I'm in mothafuckin' handcuffs!
Callin' out for someone, somewhere!
Is there anybody out there?
(Wiz)
I look up at the sky, why do young niggas die?
Felt the stray hit me, somebody stay with me
Fallin' to the ground with the sound of a four-pound near me
Bitches screamin', wish I was dreamin'
I fought a thousand gun fights, near one bullet skipped me
On the morning run to get my little sisters Rice Krispies
Played the numbers knowin' that I got my lucky dice wit' me
See some niggas I know I can roll - Uh, uh!
Get them bitches, left all of them broke, left what they smoke
Hoes yellin', 'Watch ya back!'
But before I could turn around, before I could I react,
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Would you look at me now?
Is this blood that I feel as I fell to the ground?
Feel like a head shot but maybe just grazed my temple
Niggas diggin' in my pockets, sayin' I just rolled a pimple
Yo, my mouth was movin' but it was nothin' I was sayin'
Only if they knew deep inside my mind, I was prayin'
Amen
I only pray when shit is fucked up!
I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!
I only pray when I need his help the most, what?!
Callin' out to someone, somewhere!
Yo, is anybody out there?
(Jungle)
Ain't nothin' stoppin' me - Untouchable - Hoes, I fucked a few
Style like The Greatest, Ali - Check what the knuckle do
Rock bubblegoose to mink, big links,
Yellow ice, live the ghetto life, 'fuck y'all think?
Bravehearted; fuck around, get graveyarded
Dearly departed - The word on the street, I'm a target
I ain't runnin', I ain't hidin', I'm ridin'
I be gunnin', y'all be duckin' and divin'
When I come through buckin' this four-fivin'
Revenge you sayin' you gettin'
But shit is gettin' too wild, this lifestyle of sprayin' weapons
So I check out the preacher - Life is off the meter
Thoughts of homicide, tryin' to dodge the reaper
Confessions in a church 'cause it hurts, behind a curtain
Nigga talkin' to me, but I ain't certain
Voice sound familiar so I pulled the shade back
It was this stupid nigga that I popped way back
He set me up, he just got to the preist
I tried to reach but he had his heat pointed my way
And said, 'Pray'
(Nas)
""You've got to pray, huh! I mean pray, pray,
And when you pray, you got to look up to the lord, huh!
You got to look up and you got to pray for your children, huh!
You got to pray for that man in front of the liquor store, huh!
You got to pray for that man on the corner! He know he doin' wrong,
But somebody gotta pray for him, huh! You know we doin' wrong,
But we gotta pray for ourselves! You know we are headin'
To this new millennium, goddamnit! They say a comet is comin'
To this world by the year two-thousand, I say it's God! It's up to you
To pray to that higher power higher than yourself and humble yourself
And, and, and beg for forgiveness 'cause it comes back to you!
A man told me that while he was in jail, all he did was pray.
All he did was stay in his jail cell and pray to God..."""

My whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners
Satin's bombardin me with propositions, but I decline
I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in
I overcame all the opposition
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not bathe in napes
But we still filthy, Supreme Court say we still guilty
This is the Genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis
I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac
Now I'm defendin Vic, and free that nigger TIP
I'd take the grave or a bid
To let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's goin' to church
Plants packs on the man that's goin' to work
And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruitin all my brothers and cousins to fill bases
The nerve of y'all to call Escobar racist

In your sink and your toilet
I'll be drinking from your spit
Anything 'cause I'm more less an insect with 4 legs
People come and I fake dead
Correction I got 8 legs
Climbin on top your plate bed
Where ever I smell food
It could even be jail food
Stale food that's molded
A roach is what I am fool
The ghetto is my land fool
I'm a never be able to fly like a bumblebee
Try not to be underneath

Pitiful creature
I'm not afraid of your pesticide
Or Raid
Cause in heavens my creator
I love it when the lights off
Eating from same knives forks
From any man's dinner
See my antennas

Doors kicked off, drunks stag off smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare
Vision blurry, 'cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era
Finished for the rest of his life, till he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood but no signs say out
Mental slavehouse where gats go off, I show off
Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, till they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on

They lit it up, *puff* *puff*, hit it up, *puff*
Now they dismantled, think the whole world is crazy, got a 9
Watch where you walk, 2 dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hi Satan, United Nations quietly taken, to own your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation
Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, 'cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow
Perishin', brain dead from a Erickson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune
Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla

Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
Sang the rules, guitar strings he played smokin' his?
? Hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' 'cause somebody pulled a knife out
So I look at this poem, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, ?????
Reading's what I should've done, 'cause my imagination would run
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustlas and hoes, drugs and fo-fos
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows
Oh, outta my window

Hate it or love it, like it bump it or dump it
Writing, across the stomach spell GOD son
Life is like a jungle black it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggaz packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, mack strong, couple of shots
May the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that, be possible
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle

You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind his shoulder

Everybody's under six feet of ground but you
Still standin, still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You've got a bunch of thugs witchu even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you but behind your back they've prayed for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you've killed, and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars, holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tier in jail, makin' weapons that kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes nigga pour more Henny

Light it up... light it up, light it up, uh

Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin, in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggaz rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward, to blow up so what's the science?
People shoutin, police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier, with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of, suspect faces
It's usually, two or three niggaz who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide and fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair

And there ain't to many niggas like Nas I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheatin'
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life even
Happy for James cause real bitches hard to come by
This nigga found one, I told him he was lucky an clown something
Rollin' up duckies while watching Roy Jones in round one
He froze put his to the TV about an inch close
Move outa the way nigga what the fuck the matter with you, you blind
He pointed to the front row, thought he was losing his mind
She was supposed to be with her sick mother
Left for the weekend, stress when she was leaving, now she next to some nigga cheesin
He's having trouble breathing (breathing)
He pictured them making noises, grindin 'em and kissin' em
Yellin', ain't no telling where her lips have bin
Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser then
Ten minutes later and they start wrestling, and screamin
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left, she wasn't at the fight you speakin'
That's Vegas this is New York you bugin
I held up my hand for dat, but he wouldn't touch it
I was like when you started actin' like that, this is dumbness
Gave me a crazy look and started swingin' punches
I ducked couldn't believe it, the niggas so wet
He got his gad and started squeezin, hit two police men
Neighbors dialed 911 they heard the thumpin
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumpin
Me and his wife hit to the floor she smelt strange
My comrade was breathing no more they killed James
O what a thrill inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong and handle, it is real
Pussy killz
Mad shots keep a nigga open
Bitch have a nigga's gun smoking
Pussy killz"

Queens get the money, niggas steal screamin' paperchasin'
Presidential candidates is plannin' wars with other nations over steak with masons
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangstas they daddy's faceless
Play this by your stoamch let my words massage it and rub it
I'll be his daddy if there is nobody there to love it
Tell him his name Nasir, tell him how he got here
Mama was just havin' fun with someone above her years
Niggas is still hatin',
Talkin' that Nas done fell off of rhymin'
He rather floss with diamonds
They pray ""please God let him spit that uzi in the army linin'
That shorty doo-wop, rollin' ooh-wops in the park reclinin'""
Take 27 emcees, put 'em in a line and they out of alignment
My assignment since he said retirement hidin' behind 8 mile and the chronic
Get rich but dies rhymin', this is high science
Now add 23 more for Queens to B-more
I'm over they heads, like a bulimic on a see-saw
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time
Nasty Nasdaq, y'all gonna bow homes, this Dow Jones
80-cal chrome, needed time alone to zone
The mac left his iPhone and his nine at home
My queen used her milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughterhouses
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses
This that nigga shit that's on the album
For them niggas inside the chalk line and forty houses
Bring back Arsenio
Hip-hop was aborted so Nas breathes life back into the embryo
Let us make men in our image, spit it I'm Huey P. and Louis V. at the eulogy throwin' Molotovs for Emmitt
You ain't as hot as I is
All of these false prophets is not messiahs
You don't know how high the sky is
The square mileage of earth or what pi is
I'm the shaky hand that touched George Foreman in Zaire
The same hand that punched down devils that brought down the towers"

There's a lot of real niggas out there
There's a lot of real niggas everywhere
That's why you don't fuck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin'
Not botherin nobody, until one motha fucka fuck with em
And then all hell break loose
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones that get killed
It's wild where we walk kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Well known gangstas, in trust
That we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motha fucka beggin for more
It's the reason
Standin here shakin, hatin' the haters
They watchin my paper
Realize, a 4 5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop
Nigga standin there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show yawl motha fucka's respect
Plans connect
The twinkle and diamonds upon my neck
More jazz than Hornecek
I blast and leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya
Spittin' like the trench coat mafia
In a school yard we make it hard
Was poppin' yawl
We made our change was stoppin' yawl
They spray your names rest in peace on the ??? wall
I wave gang signs at the youth, that's down for the cause
Cling them things in the ??? you betta get yours
Time is runnin' out
Your streets is gettin' smaller as we speak
Juliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit of days we did this
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eatin, not killin' everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is deaf, umpires keep ice grilles
There's no tomorrow it's the bottom of the 9 9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My hearts full of braveness so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen star and chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You can find us in the hood; thuggin' and regulatin
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You can find us in the hood; thuggin' and regulatin
We here to eat food, my peoples, be lethal
Shots in your body make you see through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life, big never cry niggas
Floss when they up north
Chest gettin' bigger
Celebs on the V I respect that nigga
Rege on the regular chops is up; like a editor
Come through on man gang like the predator
If yawl wake I'll wet it up
Jungle set it up
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin' at you
Air out your area, Queens Bridge forever, what
Ill will the label
Bravehearts yawl scared of us
Yo when those niggas ran these niggas stayed
With these niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick 'cause we paid
Don't even rep Q B
You ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you frontin
And its good night
Know how much force this is
Juggle horse and whiz
Notin but horses kid
We go to war for this"

(Hook: Mary J. Blige)
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime cruise
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you
I see you standing there so lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you're home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself
(Verse 1: Nas)
3:45 am can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive, guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep makin' my millions
Can see myself in presidential campaign dinners
But I'm gassin' blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And out grow women you love and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mill
All you need is some skill, then it's grindtime
Imagination better than knowledge, say's Einstein
It's all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all excited, you all repeat it
So call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I force you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moet
When you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me, Olu's son
Now he Nas father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener
(Hook: Mary J. Blige)
(Verse 2: Nas)
Beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don't understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood'll change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out of gangsta business seen in me you basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, gold any different faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbours, growing up I've seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my bread is nice, can rival your foamposites
Don't make me pull my lotto's out the closet

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
(Verse 1: Nas)
By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggaz pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said ""My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum""
They judged us, thinking that we dumb 'cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
Young niggaz wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)
(Chorus: Woman singing)
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?
(Verse 2: Nas)
Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Caribbean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know
(Chorus: Woman singing)
I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
'Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
What's the reason?
Ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa
(Verse 3: Nas)
I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
She called the cops 'cause she hated his mother
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover
How many niggaz gon' die this summer?
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? 'Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
In her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next
(Chorus: Woman singing)
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?
Woman harmonizes as Nas talks:
""Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what
Try to conquer all. So what? To all my niggaz with they
Kids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there
To all the niggaz that died tryin'a figure out what's what
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah
Ladies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what
We do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and
Shit. Just man... man."""

I think I can remember some...
Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy till we played catch a screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you
(Nas)
Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you
(Nas)
Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
Are we tempted
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few

Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
At the out-of-towners (Ayo who that?), they better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryna watch us and knock us
And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about Gods

Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause

Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness, in all them

Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
Where Arian nations ain't having integration, we so blind
The beauty of life, was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right, ""Jesus""!
What is he like? I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in, difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool
But chronic's a fool; got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out

My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's, I build
With dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill, in dix hills
For fish scale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef I'll snatch your seed, from chuckie cheese
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's
Black fatigues and r15 on the sofa
50 inch flat screen Louie Vitton holdsters
My motions don't appeal to repel at divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler, black gorilla, crip and blood in one nigga
Only killas know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake

Pull up a chair hon' and put it in the air son
Dog, whatever they call you, god, just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the ending
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet hole's closin this chest of a nigga
Now he back to square one
Screamin, ""Shoot don't please""
I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewindin a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch
My caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, ""Go he there""
Sittin' in back of this chair, we hittin the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""Outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for ya
'Cause Jungle said, ""Block your on enemies the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed thinkin' 'bout this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""No hell""
She talkin' 'bout, ""Me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick
Started suckin with no hands, a whole lotta spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""Stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left her nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited Vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three, to two, to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, ""Son we found that nigga we gotta kill""
(Message Beep)
Ay yo son, ay yo son, you hear me, you hear me?
Listen man, this dude right on the block, right now, man
I found him, right now, I see him right now!
Let's kill him)

Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I have no time to give you guidance
Barely have any fuck time either
Hefner minded like I think you're fine, but
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it
Who should I date --
Project chick or Cuban actress?
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that
You'll be mad forever
Never played you
I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams
Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions
They some silent killers, that stress shit
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas
I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper
I done went to hell and back
You always think you right
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song
You want to kill 'em right
You resent me every time I make a million right
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz
Your own house, everything, me I understand
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on to Martin Scorsese Mean Streets
The first movie he made, thought that was fly
I thought you was flyer, you a fucking liar"

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nas, uh
Yo, yo, life, they wonder. 
Can they take me under? Nah, never that!
Yo, yo, I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
Well, survival of the fittest every day as a child
I would think I'm a part of USA and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars, but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ain't your king from Fiji, welcome Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
There was Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanistan
Yo there was Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
Cut since the beginning of time, it's been man with arms fighting
Lost lives in the towers and Pentagons
Why then must it on, we must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children
All this hate can't last forever
It's time that we stand together
Everybody wants to rule the world
Come on (World, world, world)
Peace (World, world, world)
Peace (World, world, world)
Peace (World, world, world)
All those brothers on the block posted up like they own it
That's Daytona from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, dog, you safe whenever you with me
See, this is my town
So the youngstas, pros and ghettos goes to prison
At a early age, already know it's against them
So in order for him to survive one day
He must open up his eyes to the set backs
'Cause everybody wants a shot in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the President fix all the problems when he ain't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources own its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by secret service
I guess attempts at my life are loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell, just throw in a towel, yo
All this hate can't last forever
It's time that we stand together
Everybody wants to rule the world
Come on (World, world, world)
Peace (World, world, world)
Peace (World, world, world)
Peace (World, world, world)
Y'all know that's my style and hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain to cause
You alive right now
There's so many that dead or locked up inside the beast
I'ma holler it now
It's whatever man think'll manifest to be real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gonna see you again
Hoping I'll reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In hip hop the weapons are lyrical
To be the best, you challenge the best, and the blessing is spiritual
Top of the world for the kid none less
Popping any Rappers head off his shoulders, no contest
I know the most high hear me, so far you can't hear me
You scared of a mirror
My theory is that knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner
We gotta get out of this now
All this hating lasts forever
It's time that we stand together
Everybody wants to rule the world"

(Verse 1: Nas)
Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red ferari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, ""Nas, roll with us""
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Don, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's till tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him ""Here keep that""
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
*Beat changes*
She said
(Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X)
""Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now""
(Nas as Scarlett)
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
'Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on this 'cain, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a hoe has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Haitian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all
Nas: ""Di-sci-ple"" *scratched by DJ 3X*
Scarlett: ""You remind me of my dude, help me get them all""

They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em [X7]
Yeah
(Verse 1: Nas)
They dug me out the soil in the Mines of the Motherland
Now I'm misplaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yeah, guess that's how we got here
Slave Trade then the Diamond Trade
Every child's afraid
When his Mother and Father get sprayed
Forced in the Army, young killer Brigade
Gets a new name and then he give his nose glue
Till his mind can't take what he's gon' through
Lookin' in that dirt for that ice so blue
Then The Royal Family, the ice goes to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half-ashamed
As I rap with my Platinum chain
When you shop for a gift for me
You think about the misery?
The same way we made Apartheid History
We can do the same thing to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine, right?
(HooK: Nas)
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna Shine on 'em

My VVS glimmers on my chest
200-thou-encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how people starve to death
When God bless the land that lacks the harvest
The stone's equality, but they homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks when she's mad at me
Tear-drop shaped, uh, perfect Clarity
It shocks, so many are killed annually
'Cause of greed, lust, and pure Vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every Holiday Season, Jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from their homes, Mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives, keep a Jesus piece to be fly
But back in the day there was a time when they called us shine
(HooK: Nas)
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em

500 Benz, 6 reasons why
This kid should die
We shootin' every motherfucker outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car, guns in our hands
At the same time every body ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, 7 shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor
Then we shot some more
Niggas he was with
2 niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tryed to run, go get him son
Make sure hes done before we bail, I ain't tryin' to go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street
Load up the heat, if these niggas think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things
By all means, niggas know how we get down... it goes...
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, What...
(Whispering)
Kill Kill Kill, Murder Murder Murder
Driving throught the roads Suburban Chevrolet
6 tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringin' the bell, where in the hell
Could they be at, I'm about to leave
Steppin' slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that?
Could it be a jack?
Now I pull my strap, it's my man
And we have the same plan
There them bitches go
Civic '94, looking funny though
Open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck 2 already, 3rd ass was heavy
""Nas this is Sherri, Sherri this is Nas, and his man, Ready?""
Walked in the house, snatched of they clothes
Ran through them hoes
Plenty ice that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a BLAM BLAM
Now I'm wondering, ""In this scam, do I even stand a chance?""
He killed them hoes, took all they doe
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky
Comin' down the stairs
Now he wantin' mine, reachin' for my nine
Aiming with our guns at eachothers face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
""Put your gun down, we can skip town""
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain
Took his shit, emptied out close range...

144,Shootouts,1996,It Was Written (1996),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, looking for Rambo, the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasing niggas through my project maze
That cop he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday he making ten arrests, shit
My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it
(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde Caesar
Vetacini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She do be looking weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speaking loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolving, like cotton candy in a mouth that's starving
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
'Cause she's a nympho, sucking dick and coughing up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he vest up, we blazing from the neck up
(Yo let me knock first) Soon as he open it your glock burst
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first
We busted in the cop jerked
Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors
They eyeing us (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down, aiyo the bitch is saved now
She's living in a snitch grave now
Chorus: Nas
Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God to save the life that the Devil sold
See 'It Was Written' but was never told
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
Trying to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot

Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man going up creek
To do his two to four, niggas show love, from all around the board
Peace Lord, Sony Handi-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, 'cause when you come home we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank loss, about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own the hill
Couldn't take losing his cash, and I could feel
Something in the air yeah, Frank returned with Pierre
A gun slinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holding - 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reaching
They had gats in each others faces, with kids
And grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waiting for that to set off
Running the static, it got me mad 'cause they a bunch of faggots
Starting shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo High, get the 40-cali stainless, Jake is still out
Let's make it real and still make them niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearing Jake retaliating, and Wiz was up the alley waiting
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleeding inside, and ain't been back since '95"

Silent, silent
Murder

It's sort of like the conclusion, the colour purple
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block, shorties in school quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in the palace of Persia.
The cognac plurger plus the trees,
But whose the foul one to make his nose take a freeze,
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype.
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress
Since I got a problem with the law-writers,
I kick some more items just to explore horizons,
The palm lady dreamt of this day so I'ma play,
The crib close smoking with the big toast and lay
They say the arms of Nicki Barnes would be enough to blast,
A lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas
Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz
Fuck what they teach in class I'ma reach the mass
Strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics
Living practice, out of line niggas get smacked backwards
So wear it if the cap fits, fold it up money and mad clips
A stack right under my mattress
To smoke a nigga like a Hugh Bros. motion picture
Niggas getting open cruise, whooping older niggas
April fools they laugh the jokes on the benches
Cease outside my nigga spoke on his sentence
Silent
Silent, silent
Murder
My right handers never play too close to cameras
It's night time scanners circle the loud gamblers
Peace-making niggas pep talk
The peace-making niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew.
Time to get this loot countless, 'cause sun it ain't no youth fountains
Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and Pakistanians is took hostage
Locked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up
What's the flavour when your neighbours do jake favours?
Lock them real niggas down and letting fake players
Roam around the project this lyrical logic I dilute,
The weak can object the right composite
We're plotting all murderous schemes,
It seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of Queens
The palm lady dreamt of this day, so I'ma play
The crib close smoking with the big toast and lay
And Cain killed his brother Abel when God accepted Abel's
Offering and not his.
Abel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God,
And Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder -
Drove him to murder"

Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month, and deaded his P.O.
Started robbin' niggas till he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starvin' niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, ""Don't knock hard""
Layin' with his bitch, niggas is rich, is what he told her
Played the block, holdin' cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossin' fast
His old man had crossed his ass, for the laws of this fast cash

If you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a... small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again nigga
It's a small world, no doubt (""It's a... small world.."")
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
It's a small world
Watch what you do... (""It's a... small world.."")
I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
We let the slugs fly, enter your brain, through your skull
Another thug died, pitchin' your soul, into that infinite
Black hole, where many souls go cause of a fo'-fo' blast
Snook was one of em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore, got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her, ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dopefiend OD-ed, eighty-five
He went crazy, stuck up banks, to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried?
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God (peace God)
He starin' at me hard
Two of his man's with him, I got to hit em
I'm reachin' for my Roscoe, cocked it back on, and get my blast on
At the gas station, bunch of Arabs racin'
Out the way, as my Torah spray, jump in the whip
Hit the highway, you know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out who's who, keep it true
Shit is cool now, put the tools down? Never
Cause everyday it's on, livin' this life, out for this cheddar
It's a small world (""It's a... small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you won't know
A very small world (""It's a... small world.."")
Where beef, never ends
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a... small world.."")
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
It's a small world
Watch what you do... (""It's a... small world.."")

Uh-huh... I'm going to see you again... nigga...
Uh-huh... going to see you again nigga... yeah.."")"

Some of us have angels -- the kingdom, the power
Some of us have angels -- the power, the glory
Some of us have demons -- greed, and lust
Some of us have demons -- lust, temptation
(Nas)
Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the jooks at?
These are your niggaz, creepin' they be leavin' niggaz sleep witchu
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin' on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin lonely homey chickens
All the homies stick em, you think you own 'em man listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin'
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled till you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices
Two sides of us, negative or positive
(Nas)
Now this is your mom, your good luck charm
Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin' for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin, ""God take me!""
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops seperatin
Spittin' image of a gangster the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
Niggaz around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangster, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit
(Nas)
Now once again this is you, entertainin your desires
Bitches money and guns, aimin and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin your seed
Tryin' to eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin up niggaz, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggaz
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the ? motivate my spirit
And now the body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will till permanently, my eyes are closed"

For niggaz up in they mom's crib listenin
To this unadulterated Nas shit wishin it was then
Instead a, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package
And they would send the dope back then
Numbers, pimpin' and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin'
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin'
Trips expensive gift shoppin' whip drivin'
Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin you thinkin' naw it's just rhymin
But all this time it's like organized crimin
For instance, there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper
Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
The government watchin all of those who thuggin' it
They wanna lock us up 'cause they kids are lovin' it
Not knowin' that most rappers are straight ass
The shots ring out, whenever we clash it's Star Wars
We call it Star Wars
What happens when the shots ring out, Star Wars
We call it Star Wars
Caviar never, I rather the Cajun blacken
Catfish no snails simple nigga to please
Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks
She remembers Busy B battles when it was peace
Caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different I thought
Niggaz was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shan and Scott LaRock in the jams
Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin' mother had a motherfucker
I don't think about it niggaz talkin' there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a plant yes
Do trees grow from a forest MC's y'all are clitoris
Y'all niggaz roll with any click that's winnin' any crew
Doin' whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
Ain't enough room in this town
What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out
This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police
Not what you read in tabloid seats
These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
Because the game was supposed to be sold we livid
Came from the streets we the voice of the youth
America's nightmare was given a the mic booth
Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
Rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs
Entertainment, this is our world this is our language
Different regions speakin' east and west gang shit
You got your positive shit like, Common Sense
But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube
Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
Fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggaz who tell you your all of that
Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin' it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin the place
Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in Kay Bee Toys store
Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggaz check you
You 'gon let that nigga play you, you know we 'gon rep you
Next mornin every news channel and front page
Headlines another rapper was slayed, this is Star Wars"

Shout to them niggas, family men, bringin' home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt ya happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a knight from England, that's what I named my son: Knight
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Beamer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm livin' dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watchin', she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind decidin' which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim (?), but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'mma just...
Stay
Even though I don't like you, next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait, do I got love for you?
I might kill you, but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under 6 feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other, but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the heart of a slain enemy
We enemies, but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame 'cause they need validation
Some say hatin' is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushin' a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to...

He pulled up at 6:30 in his 745
As he wavin' his shorty hi, you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl call, feelin' she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out, she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be goin' through problems you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep, what do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull ya mink out
Or grab ya roller skates and, turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out, doin' the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make ya scream out

Dwellin' on the past when you was all right
When you was gettin' cash but wasn't too bright
Now ya luck down you feel like, bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggaz to show you, how to come up wit' green
I scheme since I'm fourteens, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, sayin' you was seen
Wit' little niggaz wit' a chain you was doin' ya thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye
We on a different echelon, coulda got bread together
Now you gets deaded on

Would need a cash rule, who could blast tools
And I'm eatin' cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school
Grew up wit' my dudes, like one of my crews
She worked for Fox News
One of her man's that she lent her drop to
Won't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it
Sheets was recordin had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards

But it's always forward I'm movin', never backwards stupid
Here's another classic, C-notes are fallin' from the sky
By now the credits rollin' starrin' Nas executive poet
Produced-directed by the kid slash Escobar
Narration descibes the lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to suvive
The feature opens wit this young black child
Fingers scratch, cigarette burns in the sofa
Turnin' the TV down while Mary Jane Girls 45's playin'
Soft in the backround, food from C-Town, mornings was hashbrowns
Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door
All of us poor/ I learned the difference between the snitches
The real ones and who's soft and the murderous
Hungriest crews, people jumpin' from roofs, shotguns pumpin'
Made it through my youth/ walk a very thin line
Ages seven to nine/ that's the age I was on my album cover
This is the rebirth, I know the streets thirst
Water like Moses, walkin' through the hot desert
Searchin' to be free, this is my ending and my new beginning
Nostalgia, alpha and omega places, it's like a glitch in the Matrix
I seen it all and did it all, most of y'all pop for a minute,
Spit a sentence then the game will get rid of y'all,
Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all
I want my style back, hate to cease ya plan, it's the rap repo man

Street dreams are made of these
Niggaz push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for somethin'...
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggaz with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something...
(Nas)
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent till proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'ma fulfil my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God's sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
Without the FBI catching feelings
(Nas)
From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the Nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this
(Nas)
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early '80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope rocking niggaz gave me
The street raised me up, giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out"

Low profile, rap style, slick as Nu Nile
Give the crew pounds every time we cover new grounds
Still surviving but there's a few down, back in the essence
I'm asking questions on the phone, with jail adolescents
Quiet confession, the system's applying the pressure
My mind is guessing, is living and dying a lesson?
But not to be obliged with the mirage
Of cars taking you off track
From with the gods focus on hard
Laid up smoking cigars
Motioning maids to bring me toast and eggs
Kosher, ice chokers and wolves to smoke ya
My wisdom culture lives in ultra madness
Devoted coach bag bitch
Broke the average nigga's hopes to get mad rich
But what's the purpose
Only the Gods can watch the Earth twist
I'm physically trapped down on the surface
With all the crack merchants
Snakes and serpents
Foul jakes the searches
Clowns with four pounds this ain't a circus
(Chorus: R. Kelly)
Street dreamer
Oh mercy mercy me
Ain't nothing I got for ya
Situations gettin' heavy
Heavy, heavy
Trying to be a gangster
(Nas)
The black clouds over the hood, I'm on the corner with the thugs
Late night under the moon as they assume I'm slanging drugs
'Cause I'm hooded up, thought a G a night wasn't good enough
Pushed my luck, yo they had a brother put in cuffs
Luckily, made it out of court comfortably
Judge said I need a job ain't nothing coming free
Could've got a one to three
I try to school these shorties under me
But they can't see
From life to death
So know we back to where we never left the ghetto
It's a damn shame, knowing it's a man's game
Shorty thinks it's time to make ya plans change
All that running round trying to chase
What's already here - been there, it's going nowhere
Pops told me knuckle up - no fear
I wish some of these killings
They could be prevented
Whatever happens it was written
Meaning God meant it
But during ya life you put ya heart in it
Even though it seems we being targeted
Let that brother R hit it
[Chorus] (extended)
(Nas)
Sort of wild, since a child, hope was all we had
Drip the bust out past
Complaning the mental straining
How many in my crew is into gaining
Subtract the weak links about the chaining
Rise it start raining
Blasphemy using Nas name in vain
Some claim supreme being yet they lied in his name
I tried to learn the game
And the only thing I found incredible
Everything I tried to learn see, I already knew (that's right)
And it's embedded in my heart now
So I can sit back, count a stack
And play my part now
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes, he wore disguise
Put a gun to me hungry he went on to chastize
That's Nas ain't it, made it rich from entertainment
Fresh Wally's painted, as he told the kid he came with
My first thought was how the game flip
Yo perhaps it was somebody I smacked drunk in a party on yak
Or was I marked for a contract for some foul act
I did a while back or beyond that
You got me laying face flat
Saying my grace black, woke up in a cold sweat
Yo, I hate that
Nightmares, feeling real, word to Will
My A-Alike I lost in the battlefield
That's why I hit the mic with mad appeal
Grab ya shield and meet ya maker
Queens niggaz die for paper
These the things the street dreams will take ya

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes
Did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid
Crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you
Look around it might hit you
No joke, I wanna pistol fight with you
Shit comes around faster than you think
Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?
Become a creature of habitat, the average cat
Won't see where it's at, or where it's going
The hood waits for no one
I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings
Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations
From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration
Imagination is what they lack
It stops niggaz from getting stacks
Feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks

That's compliments of a fast spliff in the night life
In my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin Tyson
After watchin him cut up Razor Ruddock
In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
Lookin' back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts
Older Gods wantin no static, told some lil' niggaz they can have it
Coke baggin and toe-taggin
They took Will, let me describe him, a live one
I think that he was the true +God's Son+ - not Jesus, but fearless
His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin'
Not to his likin, and say 'Son they bitin you""
He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered
But wild with them hammers, niggaz frontin couldn't stand it
Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2
With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple
(Nas)
Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking
Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen
Captain Hook to these infants
It's like my folks is still on the benches
Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid
Rhyming to music all this time
Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it
Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
From the block, where the world was forever freezing
Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again
Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them
Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats
Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope
He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke
Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's, young stretch mark bellies
Babies born in a cycle, future disciples"
157,Strong Will Continue,2010,Distant Relatives (2010),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"All I do is stay focused looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go man. Let's go...
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
Hey... The victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self defeat is your own dispute
And man you put yourself in a ya own shoeses Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
Tay you starring in a ya own movie
Playing of a role you choose so
Stand up and fight if you know say you're right and no you won't ever fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail and the boat shall forever sail
(Hey) There ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Hold gun all di sprinklers and he tell him bust my gat tougher than Zeus
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death New York to Cali for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind 'cause in life you cannot press rewind
Get it right
You only have one first chance to make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputations to proceed itself do you believe in hell?
Babylon, greed for wealth Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell
And disregard those who most need your help
Thick skinned, the dark won't take my soul Survived spiritual wars, see my welts
And the evils felt but faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clenched my fist
Ready to go against whoever Tie my Timb's and rise in the end
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
No man live forever
But never say never
Every goodie want better
Just be a go getter
And always be clever
In every endeavour
'Cause drastic time call for drastic measure
Your girl try to pleasure
From ya neighbours things severe
The land and the treasure
Work for whatever
Jah say don't be a beggar
The alpha omega
Will bless every soul no matter
Which name you prefer
The immortal stepper
Believe in every skin
No matter which colour they are
Will never let you down no matter
Which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the son of Rebecca don't stop for a second
Every man reckon
It sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
As the weak shall fall to the sideline
I get my kid
I protect mine with a tech 9
Haters want me to side with em
Gangsters want me to ride with em
Ladies want me to make brides with em
I'm on a low I'm in the zone every evening
I'm in the zone every evening walk through the valley of death
I'm still breathing
Give a bit of life to your ethylene
Thief in the night like
America seen
Coming through in the zone every evening
In the zone every evening
I know the strong will survive"

Ay fellas
I think you might wanna s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put your petroleum jelly on your face
Yo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets
That you knock they ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
Get 'em!
(Verse One: Nas)
Sittin' up drunk, shufflin thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losin focus what a nigga still hustlin for
My seed is straight, the fam is settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin, my life get boring
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin, but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, leavin' behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two 9's
Next to me in the Phantom, who lyin'?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Gotta, try to stay away from creeps
With they bullshit, tryin' to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where feds be layin from a dreadful slayin
Body viewing's at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dude just Mar-salis than Branford
Thinkin' you're too rich, they wanna gun ya
Kidnap ya cause of they hunger, but you fuckin' with hunters
Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggaz die over dumb shit
Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggaz die over dumb shit
(Chorus 2X: Busta Rhymes)
Fight, fists, dance, suckah
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch yo', big, ass, momma
(Verse Two: Nas)
To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitchin shit, all up in your body language
Mean muggin your bitch, 'cause she leans over
To look closer told you y'all sloppy gangsters sayin'
""Nas is this and Nas is that""
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foamin at the mouth, losin breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Cause the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, fo' to the stomach
Call more security 'cause I come off
Anywhere you at you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude that kick it to me
We possess, the recipes for death, cause jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say, ""That's the way you kill a man, avoid the shooting""
Hey...
You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waitin on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
You wanna come cut my throat, you wanna get rid of me
But before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe

Life is good, life is good

Ciroc on splash, summer on smash
Top all gone, got the on summer on smash
Tank top on, summer on smash
My neck got a whole lot of glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)
Look at baby girl showing that ass
She let the world know the summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Everybody get the summer on smash
We got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)
(Verse 1: Nas)
Got the summer on smash, eighteen karats
Little overweight, hit the gym, let's go get the abs in
Louis belt hangs on the waist, it ain't even fastened
I'm trying to get every number from every woman passing me by
She's fly; black, Asian, Boriqua
Italian, mixed chicks, Middle Eastern
Eritrean, Ethiopian, how you opening?
Just rolled four with them, bout to smoke again
Rose-gold Rollie, riding the top down
How does Pucci bathing suits on a yacht sound?
Send a massive e-mail to the females
Tell 'em where to meet us, give 'em the details
(Verse 2: Nas)
It's the jam here, check it (?)
It's the summertime, women damn near naked
It's single season, they choosing who to mess with
I just smashed another belt for the record, respect it
Nas get you out your seats, play this in your Jeeps
My people in the streets, I make it feel like it's the beach
My goons close by, I'm daring one of y'all to reach
I'm protected like the President, ain't gotta give a speech
Got a compass on the wrist, Illmatic on the feets
And they ain't even out yet; she like Ciroc peach
Chain-smoke cigars, count a whole lot of cash
And y'all already know who got the summer on smash
(Verse 3: Miguel)
I gotta do something kinda unexpected, huh?
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only, baby -- let me take pictures
Skin, sin; wait -- do you know whose pool you're in?
Beaches in Brazil, steaks on a grill
Your body is a weapon that you can't conceal
Real, make money when the freaks call
Summer on Mars, it's totally Total Recall
Like
Uda vida, she butterfly
Caliente
Bayame vente, vente comego, ayo?"

It was a murder Jake just hit the corner people swarming
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like ""Fuck,
Niggaz is buck,"" mega bloodshed, the tapes red
I heard some bird whisper, ""Yo he should have ducked""
I puffed the lilla, just before I hit the scene for rilla
I'm all high it's late I'm looking down at the feller
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop your life, plot
The beast in time yeah, cell to cell suspect ass nigga you fell
First time locked in crime stop my mind blocks the frail
Bursting blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch why tell
We roll with no regrets, destiny's, fifty's and equities
Queens'll be the death of me
To the suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)

Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested
Giving the jealous niggas sickness, the witness
My crew dresses, in vest-es, feel the essence
Try to test this, scientist, able and reckless
Slaughter, Nautica'd down, frames look petite
Ten millis, mix designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang low while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Rolling two Phillies together make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Ten glocks, Armani in small print, upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon, the wetting
Never freaking the beast, seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the setting
Comprehend the grammar, Manfrione -- are you the type of nigga
To shoot a leg to get your name known? I flip the brain tome
Niggaz get hit and wrap the plastic
The mic I strike in vain giving the pain of what a Mack is
What you with? Luchi or drama, no sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets are timin you
(Nas)
It justifies, Nas Escobar's leavin' shit mesmerized
Mega live, like the third world
Decipher my deceiver make him a believer
Spitting jim stars, words in my mic ttype receiver
Bond is my life so I live by my word
Never fraudulent Queensbridge don't make no herbs
Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin'
Rebel to America civilization caught you sleepin'

Yo; I never brag, how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest, prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watching Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A teck squeezing - executioner, winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular, center of attraction
Climaxin, my bitches they be laughin' g
They high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tachinni flipping mad pies
Low price, I blow dice and throw em
Forty-five by my scrotum, manifest the ""Do or Die"" slogan
My niggaz roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasaki's
Hip-Hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drumroll
Blanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate, watching crab niggaz marinate
I'm all about tecks and good jucks and sex
Israelite books, holding government names from Ness
Emcees are crawling out, every hole in the slum
You be all right like blood money in a pimp's cum
""I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that""
""I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that...
... For, you wack MC's""

Currency is made the trusted in Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
'Earth, Wind, and Fire' singing reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill
Remi on imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around, who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, getting niggaz wigs sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tuneproof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shitting like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
In the basement - chilling on the via with Mumia
For wearing chrome - I told the judge snakes slither like Sharon Stone
But like Capone I'm thrown (yo)
""I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that""
""I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that...
... For, you wack MC's""

Lyrical, ly-lyrical mission...
Lyrical...
Yo the time is wasting, I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacing, court pen pacing
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We living in, dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle where bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dopefiend, named Detroit is still dealing boy
Coke suppliers actin' gbiased
Cause rumours say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the fat Kani, it's --
-- Just the killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough holes for cracked out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses
Instead of the fake medallions
Rich niggas transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amounting to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the tecks you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug,
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood

And sent three cracker Nazis to hell and I'm sad
Uh, I'm loading tifs in my mag
To send these red neck bigots some death in a bag
Choke him out with his confederate flag; I know these devils are mad
Little rap fans that live way out in safe suburbia
Would you stand with me, a United States murderer?
Huh?

Would you testify?
You buy my songs
You buy my songs
But would you ride with me?
You understand my struggle
That's what you claim, right?
Well get your aim right
And get your game tight
Don't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it
Come into concerts, singing hoe and shit
Fuck y'all little little hoe bitches,
I don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it

Proletarian chicks sparking
Convo weak and I don't really care for her jargon
Balcony is windy
Looking at the stars and
I be in the Henny, woozy in the head, wobbling
Gucci pillow on the bed, while she giving noggin
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album
Thinking I should leave to a European island
Bristol and Spain, bring a book about Stalin
Dinner serenaded with a violin
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
Fine dining Olive Garden, naw bitch Nas is
In the real deal, food spots on the constant
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it
Lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches
Rolexes synonymous shit I'm copping
Ask her has she been around duffle bags full of that fuck you cash
Get off the jet with me in heels
I'll cup your ass
Looking in my eyes
Saying Nas you're one lucky bastard
Grip your clutch, you'll get finger fucked in the passenger
I hit the dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter
See us in the coupe flying past you
Esco, dress code, it changes
Harrod's in England
Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging
Counting wonder in the tundra
Can't humble the disgruntled when I come through, confront ya
Let nothing slide, sly remarks
You must wanna die but you frontin', why?
When we all know you pumpkin pie
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates
To Dubai, to the Chi
I'm a crucial conflict
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out
You are what a thug about
I'm a fuckin' juggernaut
Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up
Who don't speak, she quiet
So I can think, conspire
On my feet's a ?, and sometimes sneakers
Wear ties at the Setai Miami
Time-pieces are from Zurich
It's like I'm allergic

Give it to you raw so you can feel it"

Y'all can keep y'all weak beats, from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggaz Against Society
Noisy I aim not silently, noose all surroundin me
I hang 'em I string 'em up ain't no thing I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped and you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit it's hard to see R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
Cause, I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him but he's blinded I see
Jealousy he love me to death am I buggin I love him for life
We both still mournin on our mother's, life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas, diary, get out my path

I can't keep a bitch cause none of them come up for a little less
I can't be too rich, too many hoes, lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggaz in houses with pretty maids
Water and flowers in 'em while my niggaz walk around in they trousers grinnin
Gotta keep a lot of heat;
30 cals 10 millimeters 40 cals plus the heckler,
To set y'all straight You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the tec about
Huh? I'm stressin out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks, who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast, give coats to the po'
And give hope to the broke that live low
But that ain't reality, I look happy but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women 2 out of 3
Will love you but lead you to they own, hidden evil
BITCH! You the reason niggaz be beefin, hoe get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on, it's a new day Million dollars ain't,
What it was yesterday - many problems, many niggaz,
Most involved but they fake hope y'all relate
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary woulda had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
I had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

Since born knowledge like prophet Muhammad
Say the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr
So I'mma
Keep it on till I see billion dollar
Keep your friends close and ya enemies closer
Love model chocha mommy pop it like she suppose to
Eyes red shot like I'm never sober
Big time smoker Indonesian doja
Minis you can hold up before you get all wet up from my soldiers
Don shit
Under fire I remain on some calm shit
This for every ghetto and the hood
Nas the Don and Supercat the Don Dotta

To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin, evil be gone, say it

Hey hey hey hey
In the papers you read that Nas is crazy
Lost his mind as he leavin' Sony
The INC got him signed
It's only a figment of your imagination
Went to way with New York's Hot radio station
Lost my patience, had to zone out
Rappers blown out, I have the throne now
The real shall reign, I feel your pain
You R&B, follow me, spell my name
God's Son across the belly
Pardon, I'm hardly a bully
But what y'all done to hip hop is scary
Nas'll be truly the, last soldier to roll with
Holdin' it down, my proteges are over with now
A producer like Swizz Beats, on fire
So is the control room, soon as my vocals are down
Nas - God's Son, and y'all my little children

169,The Makings of a Perfect Bitch,2004,Street's Disciple (2004),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch
(Nas)
A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggaz in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress
(Nas)
I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do
My taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god
'Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath
(Nas)
Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem
Body from Ketoi Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms
Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words form a pimp was, ""Nas, it just don't exist""
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt"
170,The Message,1996,It Was Written (1996),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"(Nas)
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug cb4 gutso
Your luck low, I didn't know till I was drunk though
You freak niggaz played out, get fucked then ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out Montana way
The Goodf-e-l-l-a verbal AK spray
Dipped attach√© jumped out the range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Z√© make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes 32 shotguns
Regulate with my dunns 17 rocks gleam
From one ring, yo let me let y'all niggaz know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of living, Vegas style roll dice in linen
Antera's spinning on millenniums
20G bets I'm winning them, threats I'm sending them
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of demi-sec to chase the henny
Wet any clique with the semi-tech who want it
Diamonds I flaunt them, chicken heads flock I lace them
Fried broiled with basil taste them
Crack your legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have them fucking me in the Benz wagon
Can it be vanity from last dragon
Grab gun it's on though, shit is grimy, real niggaz buck in broad daylight
With the broke mac it won't spray right
Don't give a fuck what they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo overnight thugs, bug because they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit
(Nas)
I peeped you fronting, I was in the jeep sunk in
The seat, tinted with heat beats bumping
Across the street you was wilding
Talking bout how you ran the island in '89, laying up playing the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga gave me mine, click
What was he thinking on my corner when it pay me time
Dug 'em you owe me cousin something told me plug them
So dumb felt my leg burn then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit before the cops come
Then they came asking me my name, what the fuck
I got stitched up and went through the left hospital that same night
What I got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had to drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watching all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through blazing out his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely hear me
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours be lighting L's sipping Coors
On all floors in project halls
Contemplating war with niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together Uptown copping the raw
But a, a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up
(Outro: Nas)
Yo to them thug niggas getting it on in the world ya know
To them thug niggas that locked down doing their thing
Surviving know what I'm saying?
To my thorough niggas New York and world wide
Yo to the Queens Bridge militia 9-6 shit the firm clique
The 'Illmatic' nigga 'It Was Written' though
Been a long time coming
Y'all fake niggas trying to copy
Better come with the reload!"
171,The Outcome,1999,Nastradamus (1999),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"(Jessica Care Moore)
Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves
Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water
My skin layered in diamonds and sage
Left alone and confused, forces enslaved by days
Time keeps on whorin us
Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us
Flowers and flames, flutes from her fingers
Rifles pointed from her sac
Or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones
Either way, she wore a compass on her head
Rains don't stop the grass from turnin' red
Her hair was half perm, half dread
We gave up walking in a past-life and so we dance
Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life
A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice
Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run
Time travelling was late
Watching was a blind man's mistake
All his assets melted right in front of his face
His right leg drabbed with demon paste
Shoes stayed angel laced
Never count your blessings with haste
Even a prophet can catch a case
Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste
Telepathically cutting through mental gates
Words were weapons against their hate
Shepherds search for stars in her hair
Her chest grew fermented like yeast
She broke her body like aged bread
He gave her truth from all the books he'd read
She wrote her poems inside the mud
Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
Named their boys and spit truth inside his mouth
Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
Resurrected from bones and dirt
She made hard niggaz smile
Left her seeds inside the Earth
Gave hustlers and killers life's worth
This is the life we chose, remember who was here first
Find a reason why you curse
Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose
Sporting electronic nooses
Hoeing humanity love-ticks over lust
Despite the damage to destiny you can't take the best of me
In God We Still Trust"

What's happenin' brothers and sisters?
Welcome to our time
(Jessica Care Moore)
Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles
Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write
In spite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight
Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right
We the assassins laughin' while the New World's collapsin
Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armored carways I'm blastin
As the Earth rebels now womb swells
The birth of Black Magic, savin' my people force of habit
You can't find if you ain't never had it
Spiritually crafted blackness and hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted
Power-shiftin comb-fistin I predict Goddesses you runnin' after witches
I kiss my fourteen stitches
Keep all my baby girl wishes
I predict all the oceans turn dry
Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert
We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers
Wash your face between our legs
While recreating humanity, we will summon yem and yaw
Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills
Ban all pink and yellow pills
I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch
Hate groups will be bombed
Childbirth becomes outlawed
Always will be branded numbered and barred
All paper money is gone
Though few scholars can interpret our scrolls
Your sky has holes
We know the young is old
Nastradamus tell us how the story gets told"

Check the shit
My mindset, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggaz actin' illy word to Will he bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt wit it
Them niggas sour, they put to much flour in they coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE
While we was gleaming, niggaz was scheaming
Seen the ill Beamers beaming
Triple-beam and doubling cream, had 'em fiending
To get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
Sosa, these niggaz hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the 'Bridge I'm bout to go loca
Left my 'rat begging me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
Wit two macs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn' to bend me over
My nigga Hav got a soldier
It's getting down it's going down kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holding back tears
Told these broads, to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile digging they style yo
Whattup son, these niggas done started something wild
You know the clique well, Ramel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name holding the steel, I paid attention to the females
Maintain bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel, spray shots and reload
And still handle the wheel, point 'em out smoke a Phil' then chill
I laid back Escobar status, knowing The Firm got it cornered
We on it, shit we was born wit

I knew he'd be right here, I told ya
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rocking boulders
He's stunting, after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, BUT I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
He never seen us, Sos' gave the mac to Venus
And Vicious, looking delicious, handle yo' bidness
And step to him, shake yo' ass try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco, with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco, of all ages, they was amused
By the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York
If they had to, heard him ask Venus, ""Could I have you?""
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him, ""Don't grab Boo""
They started chatting, was only 'bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughing
We followed them pollying, he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably wanted to hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches moving too slow
We both holding, what if them wild hoes started folding?
Sosa, said say no more, we started rolling
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wilding
There the girls go, hurry up we out in
The 940, me Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy

Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic, I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facing
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruising in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me falling asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)

Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days we sell it: smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jes√∫s, soakin' their sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction

I'm the young city bandit hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, one thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
'Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burning dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

My insight enlights vision
Words of wisdom
Niggaz pay me a tuition to listen
The murder paragraphs of mysticism
Man plant seeds that brings forth multiple breeds so many cultures on one
Planet but one culture's free.
Son, I need Weed to proceed
Change the flow speed and I'm getting vex Giuliani you 6-6-6.
There's no days for broke days selling smoke pays
I toke the chocolate potent philles never roach-sprayed.
Shit is a hassle, the bridge is like a haunted castle
The mic my religion and the system is the Devil's lasso
And yo, the trife life is the most influential
The colors on mink skins and pens is coincidental
How ya living large you broke,
You're wasting time extortin papers from smokers
Catching court papers getting broker

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana stabbin bitches like the Phantom
The crew is lampin Ill Will style
Check the gold toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burnin dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin' Danes plus the games
People play, I check the games plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today

Yeah you, y'all know who y'all are. These are our
Heroes.""
(Chorus: Nas)
Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB
Who 'Yes Massa' on TV, what ever happened to Wheezy? The Red Fox's?
Never got Emmy's but were real to me
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels
'Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel
Whitey always tell him, ""Ooh, he speak so well""
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?
The acceptable Negro -- hell nah
But they say, ""These are our heroes""
(Verse 1: Nas)
Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud
But there's somethin' they don't say
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe
First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you
You turn around then you shit on Shaq
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof
But you let them use you as an example
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full
(Verse 2: Nas)
You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through
But what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black
But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque
You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked
These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks
Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout
Tavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson
Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them
Nicky Giovanni poetical black female
Jim Brown to the people who sing well from
Fela to Miriam Makeba
The mirror says you are the next American leader
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records
'Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC
But next year, who knows what we'll see?
Ha-Ha, these are our heroes
[Nas:] ""Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know
The crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard
Big up to Tiger Woods. Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up
To Cuba Gooding Jr. Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs
What up my nigga. Yeah, ha-ha. And you don't quit
And ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit.""
[Male Heckler:] ""Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though
Homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at
All that paper. Drivin' around like a playboy in
My hood. What type of shit is that?""
(Overlapping dialogue)
[Nas:] ""I'm outta here. Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please
Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here. I know, I
Got a plane to catch. And I love you back. Ha-Ha

Leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires

Cops see them and run, don't want no drama

Mortar, hood haunted like the Dakota

Street dream chasing young hungry thugs that seek cream
Crack fiends and hatch schemes, knife-point robbery
Broad day blindeys, night-time thuggery
Sun down shinanigins, move without shadow...
...Like ninjas, cat burglars, no fiasco
No commotion, make moves like locomotion
Crack-sport ambush, get the man bringing the coke in
Warehouse crime rate, man's throw they vans up
Bang job, ""Freeze, everybody put your hands up""
Cash is nightmare, gun in ya faceplate
""It's not even ya money, don't make me put one in ya face, mate""
Thieves running this place, world trade, eight fare
Slave rift flashbacks; Bush killer, hate Blair!
Wish Mars was a mile away, 'cause I would escape there
On a Skyway railroad, to stick you from my tray fair, bitch...

179,Thugz Mansion (N.Y.),2002,God's Son (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"I want you to close ur eyes, n' invision
The most beautiful place in tha world,
If you in the hood, the ghetto street corner,
Come on this journey, the best journey, it's a mansion
Acres of land, swimmin pools and all that, check it out
[Verse 1] - Nas
I'm capable of anything, my imagination could give me wings,
To fly like doves over the streets watchin' many things,
Kids walkin' home from school, on drug blocks, missionaries
Pass out papers that read love god.
I see faces cases, judges 'n' jurors, masons lawyers 'n' cops,
I watch 'cause every thugs face is my mirror,
But this was one imparticular,
This kid he was the vintage stick 'em up pro,
16 years old did his jail since there was no where to go.
Every mornin' calls his commrad to come 'n' get em' a smoke,
He insane already gone mad, blames himself for his setbacks,
Dangerous street corners where his sets at,
Sling from dusk till dawn, detectives act like they maniacs,
Chasin him, his ass was flarin,
Smokin' like a chimney on remy of course he not carin,
He needs a place to go to keep his mind expandin,
I give 'em a helpin hand, bring 'em out to Thugz Mansion.
Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy,
Lil hennesey, lay back and cool, every hour 'cause it's all good.
Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done
Will be all right, nothin' but peace, love 'n' street passion,
Every ghetto needs a Thugs Mansion
[Verse 2] - Tupac
Dear mama don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the hommies I'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
It had me shook drinking
Peppermint schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cook
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin it with Malcolm till the day game
Lil' Latasha sure grown, tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
So come home
Maybe in time you'll understand, only God can save us
Where Miles Davis cutting lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
They in heaven found peace that last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place
In Thugz Mansion.
[Hook] (Wanna go... wanna go)
[Verse 3] - Nas
A place where death doesn't reside, jus' thugz who collide
Not to start beef but to spark trees, no cops rollin' by,
No policemen, no homicide, No chalk on the streets,
No reason for no body's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis grey hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw to much sufferin
I'm just 20 some odd years I done lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Anne Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone, she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
Where angels soar, with golden rings, in Thugz Mansion."

Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars
BM, Jaguars, they cash was large
Since he was wild, they let him in
He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin
Drivin' they cars, robbin connects
Drivin' his Lex, keys was movin
Young don, now they know they weakness
They never seen it comin'
Son was on some real take over the streets hit
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?
Dudes be, comin' from bids thinkin' shit is different
Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin my years, jet black, blunt in my ear
Real relaxed, readin real loves stories like
Ceaser and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin to later hours, only
Fuckin' with kings, niggas official
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you
We converse on the state of hip hop
We share the same views and feelings
He sling cain, crib costin 2 million
He plan to leave the streets forever
But niggas that wanted him left him
Dead in the streets 'fore I can tell him"

In the winters of my mind
This shit be real man
Shit's crazy out here
Yo yo, yo what up y'all
That's my niggas over there
Word
If you scared to take chances
You'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gonna cock it and pop it
His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him
Slanging just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumping, fronting
'Cause he feel a way
My niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga looking
Laying with the milli
Who that over there, creeping
Who homie by the tree
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell fore they creep on me
It's a lesson every premonition
Lotta niggas killed 'cause they wasn't paying attention
Listen
I want a bitch I can trust
Some niggas I can trust
Accountants looking over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fighting for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga trust
I can never get enough
A Ruger I can trust
Shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for
Some of you niggas' true colors becoming clear more
It's been so long
Can't remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm
Cause guns went off
I see your mom's she still speak
She don't know I ain't cool with her son no more
It's old shit, see forever we holding this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef
End it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years
Why should I worry 'bout him
Constantly watching my back
Plus niggas telling I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right
Cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt
It's quite redundant
Whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mother's cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas' names
I wonder will it change
Let's ride
It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down little man
Let me school you in hood business
Seen a lotta niggas blow
Lotta dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy
Bought it I'm loaded I guess
Lear jets
I ask myself do I need love or success
They say the artist that truly suffers
His stuff is the best
Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve
Pain pistols and sex
Remember spray painting the word Fresh and then staring at it
Older folks angry, pointing, swearing at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the Mclaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric
Trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it"

The whole block singing the same theme ""Don it""
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If its ice work, I'm gonna truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it

Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Get pulsive with malice insentitives, the foulest of bitches
Hung up my riches, her childest wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip in a new fo'
So when your click roll, I let my clips go, Niggas on opposite polls
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhuman, living hostile opposed
To living on the streets, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, frantically foul niggas
See niggas in blast, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you and chill, chrome objects
Hit you in your projects, its street anomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger painting
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting
While you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment
Now back in the hood, certain cats they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it, you gotta love it
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want) (it's what they want) (it's what they want)"

The world is yours. Acknowledgements: First off, I wanna
Thank God. And I wanna thank everybody for helping me out
With this. Couldn't do it without you. Chapter 1.
January 28, 1968
Born into this world as William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyndanch Long Island
Scientific rhymin' invented a new sound when he met with
Eric Barrier from East Sandhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene, 1986 with Clap To This
'87 dropped a classic disc
The facts is the tracklist was like four
The vocals, the beats -- according to Marly Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative
This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
'Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock
Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearin' Curtis Blow saying
""It can't get better than this""
Till Run DMC blew my brains to bits
From leather coats to shell toes to the stan smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap, 18th Letter did that
From 41st and Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre
Supreme rapped and the 50 that don't rap
Forte Green, Queens, Long Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn
With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote ""Smack me and I smack you back""
Sounded like the answer to the I Ain't No Joke track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzin' from Wyndanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot by sixteen when I met Freddy Foxx
Totin' burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How was Rakim's flow, made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one, before similar voices were King Son
A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, son was watchin' him, mesmorized
Respect, not jockin' him, was so amazin', besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now
(Nas talking)
""Unauthorized biography of Rakim. Epilogue: Mother was
A jazz singer. Nephew to R & B legend Ruth Brown
Discography: Paid In Full, Follow The Leader, Let
The Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique. That's
The end of the group. Went off to solo. Dropped the R, then the 18th Letter, and I think, somethin', The
Master. Was signed to Aftermath, scheduled to release
An album with my guy Dr. Dre. The album was
Dismantled because of creative differences. Thee end
To the new beginning. Yeah. Next book, KRS-One. Peace."""

Uh...
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin cigars, couples and stars
Flashin cameras, dealers, shufflin cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the four-five
Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin, duckin, our bitches in the club cluckin
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beamin
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs peace, kept in movin, I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceilin fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower...
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughin'
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin with some nigga
Mumblin shit, he had one hand on her ass
And she was rubbin his dick, toastin wine glasses
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
Searchin for some words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin, whylin, what I'm gon do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through
{Nas singing}
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Didn't you believe in me? * repeat 2X *
(Nas)
Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
""Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?""
I said, ""Nah,"" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, ""Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' -- and probably still is
Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin' my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me""
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had junk
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out we out like kamikazes
We surrounded, red lights flashin, who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin suicide
Horse asked me for the Mac, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger cocked the glock, and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said ""Amen""
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, ""Now unto God, we elope""
... We elope ...

No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told
Your left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
I heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name
I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came
'Cause I stood in the face of damnation
Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em
He want my blood, why me?
Why not the fake ones who deserve death man?
Fuck it, I'll take one
'Cause stop me but can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
They believe in reparation makes it even
So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
We getting it in son, another bullet pass by, miss me
Wondering who plotting to get me?
Alphabet boys still plotting against me
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
You won't remember why they came to clip me
When time go by you'll soon forget me
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentleys
Then I use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty
Don't let' 'em kill me...

Some revolutionaries do live long
Am I one of them? Guess we'll know in due time
Everybody has rights, can I use mine?
Can I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine?
Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine?
Every time I turn around somebody new dying
Let's start living, alecart, Escargo, Escobar invest my millions
Mansion for the wife the rest for the children
Knowing that they coming anytime
But until then I'ma at large till they shoot me
Million dollar stones in my camouflage Gucci
Giving you this crack like Pookie
To question the system, be the resistance
No matter what color you are everybody niggas
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us
(Chorus) Nas 2x
Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me"

And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be all right

Briefcases, silk ties, slick as them older folks

Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creepin' in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her
And I'm late to a dite with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walkin' through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire pride stop

There's a war in the streets tonight
And all this drama's got me feelin' uptight
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo

Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight

Yeah, Nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's cryin'
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashin'
New come, I caught verbal assassin runnin' with
Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight
But we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib
Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment
Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers,
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world,
Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy
I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me
(Chorus - singing)
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' all right
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down

And give it back

They too fake to come kill me
Think they faith this was Satan
They mistake me I'm filthy
Rich off the ghetto madness, so now they wanna dare me
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty
Middle Passage I made it
I'm from the land of David
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
That bunch of backward gangsters
That sign of Alpha Davis
Snitches with smile-like faces got you blowin' trial I hear this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind o' waitin' is scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I see clear to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart
I'm still alive how did I make it this far
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way

Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still
I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to embody somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold

This is the song, of my warriors, A warrior song, my lord
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (Uh, warriors)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of our own beatin' drum

Fight till the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful
If you was me all this pain I'm feelin' would bend and killed you (I'm a
Warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause (I'm a Warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go

And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found

This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!

A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, y'know keep marchin'
Yeah yeah yeah, you never give up

It's just the likeness, of Israelites mist, that made me write this
A slight twist, of lime rhyme, be chasing down your prime time
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan, features the freak shit, my thesis
On how we creep quick, fucking your wife that ain't so secret
It's mandatory - see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggaz never handle for me
My gator brand is Maurry, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face, hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really it's papers I'm addicted to, wasn't for rap then I'll be sticking you
The mag inside the triple goose
Face down on the floors, the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam, just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that - that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant
Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown (repeat 2X)

And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to Mona Lisa brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing ninety on the Franklin-D-Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one son, niggaz is frightened
Secret indictments, adds on to one seeking enlightenment
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo

Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow

Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat, getting the dough
Them old timers, advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening just bobbing your head
Your Roley shining, thinking to yourself nobody's taking mine
At the same time, your hoe is getting snatched from behind
Put in the van, where's the hundred grand, script in her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know -
- You knew these niggaz all your life
What made them mark you victim, you fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen sick of yapping
Dump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffin ganja get to your crib, can't find her
Just a reminder shit and have your stash house where you crash out

Ain't too many real ones out there; I feel some
But doubt they're, capable, to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake
'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin
Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die
You was like God to us in the form of Allah
Still somehow I believe, we always survive... but why?
(Nas)
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Thug Life never die...
Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop -- and use teeth
To bite off beer tops, and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor
You was more than just the wildest nigga
+2Pacalypse+, I understand your style nigga
It's goin' on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin' on
The industry be talkin', offendin me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
+All Eyez on You+, niggaz in your face invadin your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride, before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could Never Be Peace I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on ""the realest shit you ever wrote""
We had words cause the best supposed to clash at the top
But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
In NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggaz would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?
Still somehow I believe, we always survive... but why?
(Nas)
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs -- put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
A plan and pursue my dream turn my life around
'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi riding through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said ""Baby bless""
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's, and finally it's lookin' good
Hip-hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game, could lose or gain
A couple pounds tryin' to maintain -- one day you here
The next you not; when you around niggaz, check 'em out
Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots
And run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than fifty percent of us
Endin up with holes through the chest
Through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothing left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way outta this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin crack
To my deceased Gods wishin I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that
... Always survive... but why?
(Nas)
Always survive, always
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my niggaz just stay alive"

Doctors injecting our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison

In hospitals, shots rittle the block
Little children and elderly women run for their lives
Drizzling rain come out the sky every time somebody dies,
Must be out my fucking mind, what is this, the hundreth time?
Sending flowers to funerals, reading rest in peace
You know the usual, death comes in threes
Life is short is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
Its funny how these black killer companies is making money off us
Fast food, cola sodas, skull and bone crossers
Sisters up in my hood trying to do good given choices
When pregnant drop out of school or have abortions
Stop working hoping that they find a man that will support them
Up late night on they mothers cordless, thinking a perm or
Bleaching cream will make better when they gorgeous
White girls tanning, lypo suction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips that's life destruction
Lightskin women, bi-racial hateful toward themselves
Denying even they blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods but I overstand the mental poison
That's even worser than drugs
Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison

Slay bitches and party everyday like this is the last

Drives in Benz, hangs in all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rocking their shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
What's your name, where you from, chain blinging
Thinking girls everywheres dumb, taking pride in ruining their lives
So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives
He never used a condom, give him head he got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDs
I contemplate, believing in karma
Those on top could just break and wont be eating tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleeping on niggas dreams
They leave when they nigga blow she the first bitch on her knees
Knowing dudes that's neglecting their seeds
Instead of taking care of 'em they spending money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies
'Cause when them kids get grown it's too late for you

Snow setting in the bezzle
Mo' sipping, phantom bumping Aaron Neville
Polo black scented, eyes squinted
Air Force One's, with my own patent in it
Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy
Pagan holidays, are way far from my reality
Far through Evisu jeans, lethal green
Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart.
Lotta blood gonna splash in war
Task force homicide, federalies gonna arrest
But y'all ain't never seen nothing
Not a word not a hint, on the kid from the Project Bench
That went Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate
Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent
To get the best man, y'all niggaz ain't silencing shit
Ya bench been wanna police the dick
The big Benz, Imma model ya chick
Was that posing, cash froze her
Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over
Cold like ice, more chains than slaves
Dangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel
Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble
I could sell sand to a Arab, hot and my gun handle

The ill whip pusher, my spit wet ya
If you stand close to the woofer
Betcha get sprayed by my lecture
Any club with ladies or dimes, I'm a regular
Give it up smooth, I ain't beggin ya
Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac
Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that
Eat with my elbows top of the table
Street etiquette with speech impediments
And still see presidents, no matter who paid
Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it
Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate
Ask about Nashwan, could ask about Jung
Ask about Bravehearts, and ask where I'm from
Q Boro, specifically The Bridge
Don't ask no more question, ya know what it is

Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financer, skull doo wrapped up
Mob life, prizefights, plasma tvs or first floor
Diversified all my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit to wet this
That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars
Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock And Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in, in my mommy casket
Seen more green than St. Patrick-trick"

Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?
Mind of a shooter, CFO also
Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful
Money is attractive, honey dress strapless
Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic
Stroll up in the party: titanium black card
Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah
'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours
You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star
These old heads got stories, the days they was kings
I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
You 16, you could do 20, come home young
Catch 20 years when you 40? Holmes, you're done
What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars
Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies
A 360 in the streets real grizzly
Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning
Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with
Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
This ain't the Truman Show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?
(Hook: Cocaine 80s)
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung? It's not love
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul
Roll that up

Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game
Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name
Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim
To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank
'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think
It's crazy how many brothers come where I come from
Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung
Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up
Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us
Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like
""Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous""
Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble
One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle
Now we having babies, cause growing up it was just us
No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up
But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual
Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral
I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you
Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to
The G is in your genes, already you tuck
Inherit your dad's swag, his George Jefferson's strut
Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet
Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise
No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor
I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist
Corona sipper, pass it, I'mma blow it with you
It ain't the Truman show; it's the human show

Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you

Tell Shaniro play it again Sham, damn, that was my jam 
Now she's on the lam, she made it out wit' two hundred grand 
What a scam! While these two compete on who's the star of the show 
Golden Legs there makes off wit' the dough 
I read the paper there wit' Joe the Butcher 
He says ""one glance is all it took ya"" she's a real looker 
They say her old man's a bootlegger, transport in any weather 
And at this rate we'll never get her 
Fellas, think it's time I call it a night 
All this talk of mystery dames gettin' me tight 
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right 
Hate to spoil the party, what are you guys havin'? 
The same? Waiter, another round for the gang 
It's strange how I always felt out of place 
Joe the Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckleface 
So I said ""see ya later"" 
Before I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers 
He met them in Louisiana wrestlin' gators 
An idiot can tell they're involved in the caper 
So I pulled the revolver out my waist up 
Between a patrol car and a gray truck 
Behind the streetlamp was a silhouette 
White gloves and a real long cigarette 
Whaddaya know? All this time she's got me in the scope 
She spoke, says ""the devil got you guys by the choke 
""Your conspiracy theories won't work wit'out evidence 
That's the reason why Eric B. is not President""

How'd you kill a man out in Cypress? 
One-Eyed Charlie, he only hangs out wit' the Criminal Minded 
Says you guys did it Doggystyle, is he lyin'? 
She says ""Walk This Way I'll tell you a Children's Story"" 
We hit the bodega, got her a few forties 
We jumped in my ride, we drove and she cried 
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide 
Swalllowed It! Whole bottle's half empty 
Drinks like a fish, now she's past tipsy 
The truth came out as we got to her Suave House 
Chopped-N-Screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch 
I said ""it's gettin' late c'mon, give it to me straight 
Who's your sponsor, lady?"" She says ""Bill Gates"" 
""What are you born, '77 or '78?"" 
She said ""nah goes way to an earlier date"" 
Slave times, played for slave said rhymes 
But she fell in love wit' some fella named Clive 
Who? Clive Campbell from Cedrick Ave 
The Bronx, now she shows me the cash 
I said ""who's Clive, don't play with me skirt"" 
She said ""Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc"" 
Ah-ha! Ah-ha! 
Listen up sweetheart, now we're gettin' somewhere 
As she's talkin', she starts vanishin' in thin air 
But before she drops the money bag on the flow & died 
She said ""if you really love me I'll come back alive""

Lies and the pain
Betrayal; life
(Bridge: Anthony Hamilton)
In danger's face
Look what you're facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn't ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for
(Refrain: Anthony Hamilton)
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me
(Verse 1: Nas)
Snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that
They know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat stretched out
Letter T
It's better to dead a beef than let it breathe
Then we don't succeed
'Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood
We can thug and get out of hand
What's the options
Only conclusion is shooting
Bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous
Asking myself what's my purpose
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops can't relate to me
Death to prison, empty vacancy
(Verse 2: Nas)
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
Guess how angry this man gets
Had so many bad chicks in his bed
Strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that are sadistic
Chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he's into bestiality porn
And it's wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high so they find dough
To mainline dope, and y'all know
(Verse 3: Nas)
So many vices, habits
Mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, that's cars, cigars
A vintage bottle on ice that's priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate 'cause he's newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application 'cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation
Calling up his travel agent
Same time, premedidating murdering his ex wife
Life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining

But they ain't help me get this porcsh two seater
A lawyer left the hood he never looked back
To be a fortune 500 ceo it took rap
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies that's hiring blacks
Fresh hip hop lingo for your campaign ads
The controversy surrounds who could say it and win
Some niggas are full time some play and pretend

It's meant to

Everybody bleedin
The cops or the demons
Courtrooms full of goons
Jailbrushers leanin
Handcuffs squeezed too tight

If you fight they just give in
People used to do sit ins
They got Nigeria and Niger two different countries
Somehow niger turned to nigger
And shit got ugly
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists

Started droppin' that consciousness

Speak my name and breath life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me (y'all give me life)
Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it)
And I love it especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject
Cause y'all my niggas
My father was not a banker
Neither was my neighbor when it came to getting paper
Who the hell was gonna train us
A pressure couldn't escape us through the ages
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases
And I say it's quite amazing
The use the ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
It's celebrated now people are mad it they ain't one
Tryin' to erase me from y'all memory
Too late I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas)
Speak my name and breath life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me (y'all give me life)
Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it)
And I love it especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject
Cause y'all my niggas"

Where I'mma go tonight... The most famous town in the
Whole fuckin' world... The other night, nigga was at Lotus...
I hit P and them I was Dom P'ed up in there, you know... But I
Found this new spot we went to the other night, yo, check it out
Check it out how it went
It was just cool like, smooth night wit' my jewels bright
Goons left goons right, coupe wit' blue lights
Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls
Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off
In the loft mixin' hash and 'dro
Honey spread that asshole like a wide mouth bass
Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast
When the phone ring, the house lights flash
Turned down the sound, let's get down to bidness
Shit about to go down wit' some foul niggas
What the voice said, ""what up pop? Who want it?""
I put the guap up, get the boy popped
He say ""son stop, it's dudes you feedin'
Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'""
Dog, why you callin' me? This our food
You, handle the mouths that it trickles down to
Niggas want beef, I want some of that cow too
But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich
Don't bother me wit' silly shit, call Rico
He said ""it IS Rico, of all people
Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor
To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather""
Said the nigga shot up my cars
Last night he laid for me to come out my doors?
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
You can't kill me
High, fly, send a fella loaf or glass?
Fold up cash, you ain't heard the soldier's half
You speakin' hogwash, silly shit, ??? to dash
I got the live sparked, Phillies lit, smoker's jacket on
The son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don
What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah
Packed the nines, yo this nigga's asinine
Smack ya mom, relaxed and calm, then mack ya mom
In a casket, you'll get ya fashion on
You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die
You'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' wit' Nas
Remember anyone can get it at anytime
Lames'll swear by ya name, when they lie
Get hit wit' the lone star, ripped where ya bones are
So tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-O-1?
In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser
Merk you wit'cha own shooters
All you want is a name, pissed and insane
My security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen
Then it goin' off, start spittin'
Niggas try to bring it where I live in
Trustin' you, knew where all of the cribs at
So we waited wit' the cigs blat, blat, blat!"
201,You Can't Stop Us Now,2008,Untitled (2008),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"(Verse One - Nas)
From Willie Lynch to Willie Hutch, right on!
We Supafly, made Gucci the shit, Louis too, suits and ties,
Playa trophies, pray to goldie
Picture wax museums full of black pimps and triple O.G.'s
Aunt Jemima hoes, historic horseshit, girls from long time ago
Stagecoach with the horse kid
Witchdoctors, good ol' pickpockets, sip moonshine
So called coon, shines and darkies
I love y'all
Pyramids to cotton fields to Wrigley Fields
Forgotten men who did get kill
Crispus Attucks the first blasted
Peace to the rich lady purse snatcher shot in the back
I know you're hungry kid
I know they hung your dad, burnt your mama crib
I know that hurt ya bad
Minstrel shows from gold to shackles and back to gold
We act like we home, matter fact we are home
Bad attitudes, octoroon skin tones
Slave food turn to soul food, collards and neckbones
Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag
Bet she had a nigga with her to help her old ass
(Last Poets)
As James Baldwin says, you can only be destroyed by believing that you really are what the white world considers a ""nigger""
(Chorus - Eban Thomas)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
(Verse Two - Nas)
Yo on Dateline the other night they showed hate crimes
Gave a blood time 'cause he fought with his K9
Beastiality, humane society
Go to China see how they dine, see what they eat
Better yet asks PETA whoever what animal makes suede
If not for suede would you survive the Dark Ages?
Cannibal ways of the anti-caucasians
Slay ya like a steak tartar on pinot noir
David star on the chain, Sammy Davis he helped pave the way for Southern crankers and them Harlem shakers
Now we gettin' our papers
They try to censor the words that stop our money comin' but you can't escape us, haters
(Chorus - Eban Thomas)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now"
202,You Don't Know Me,2002,The Lost Tapes (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"(Verse One: Nas)
Girls I got 'em locked so similar to a prison
Hear this monster jam, I be callin' it 'GANGSTERISM'
I murder you for dope, I'm the street distributor
I'm homicidal, pointin' the pump, scope to shoot you
Street connects, Mob ties on East and West
We gouge out your eye balls if you seen too much
Hopin' out drops wit blings and stuff
Wit ball players wives, Mercedes 5
Dangerous lives and haters die rollin' with convicts
Conscience who tolerate no nonsense
Fake rappers in doo-rags, get shot-up at their concert
Your bitch bleed, bitin' her nipples with my chipped tooth
I drink her blood, like I'm Dracula, mack in the 6-Coupe
The sky becomes red, heard y'all niggaz work with the feds
Doesn't matter, blood'll splatter, everybody must dead
I got urge for self-reinvention, but I'm old-fashioned
From the corner's with the winos laughin'
Dealers and five-o blastin'
Capitalist thoughts like Presidents
I'm burnin' Bush's, Nas the realest, it's nuttin' to fuck wit
(Chorus: Uncredited Female (Nas))
You think you know me but I... (Tell 'em Ma)
...Don't think so (Don't think so)
It takes a 'lil more than... (What?, what?)
What do you know about me?
(See what you don't know me you'll never will)
(And what you don't know will get yourself killed)
About me
(See what you don't know me you'll never will)
(And what you don't know will get yourself killed)
You'll never know
(Verse Two: Nas)
I smoke weed like them sixties rebellions, hippies on heroin
Spliffs inhalin', what I speak strictly for felons
Dippin' in their 6-4, hittin' the switches
Or sittin' in their Bentley Azure's, feelin' the riches
Or just ridin', truck drivin' Impalas, Denali's
I fuck with those but I lust for silver Ferrari's
I fuck hoes with the ceilings, have mirrors to watch me
My bed shaped like a pyramid, feelin' the dry heat
Spillin' Courvoisi', I'm half slave-master
Half Apache, half African, much is what I call us Black men
Lead astray, drugs and cups of alcohol, 'cause back when
They let us off ships; the soul of man was lost or trapped in
But every ghetto, every hood, no matter where the town
It's all haunted, all on top slave burial grounds
Dead cooks, workers and maids, under this Earth in rage
Ancient whore houses that explain my sexual ways
Money and murder: interprets the American dream
The world loves a gangsta, I found my place in this thing
Royce's, diamonds and bosses, woman who're gorgeous
Traitors, killers and enemies, remorseless, we live this
(Chorus: Uncredited Female (Nas))
(Verse Three: Nas)
Gypsies, preachers, choirs, churches, liquor stores
The world is full of liars, curses, people rich or poor
Without God to worship, see we would be more lost
Gotta believe in somethin', or their would be no laws
A ghetto child occasionally blunted in Mansions
My cup overflow with Cristal, hundred exotic dancers
Niggaz is plastic, ass gets jealous and passive
My pistol blast at; cowards, leechers, and rappers
Niggaz I fuck with is 'Bravehearts', make G's
Before rap music to me, was wind blowin' the trees
Birds chirpin', rain fallin', perfect and free
But bitches saw my video and think they know me
These niggaz bad talkin', claimin' they gon' do me
Stay out my path homey, you fuckin' wit a true G
Bitch +You Don't Know Me+

White chain, colored watch on the wrist
Switch lanes in monster whips, ambience
Specially dressed, guess who? -- Nas, it's obvious
Step to bars, we just ordered dark liquors
Clear liquors, y'all niggaz are s3x
Yes we get respected, eclectic messages
Left our brains, get into a female's estrogen
She feels electric, her breasts she touchin' them
Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction
N-a-s, then they ass, over-spank it
Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas
Call fatties 'bubbles', call head 'skull'
Before I get either I need some Red Bull
She'll scream as I pushed in her freezing cold pool
When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool
That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing
Won't pluck no chicken wing, don't fuck with just anything
Gotta come up, run up and get touched up
Suicide, that's if you confront us
Don't talk, just hold your breath
Been here a while, s'only one nigga left
And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang
You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song
Uh, from a boy to a king
Love to rock diamonds and fancy rings
I'm a thoroughbred, real heavy mang
I'm fuckin' something tonight that's on everything
Fellas who beat bodies with me
Kidnappers and stick-up kids, they all poli' with me
Pop bottles with me, button-up shirts and throwbacks
Those cats only roll when I'm in the city
And the dance floor is disgustin'
Move your waistline to the basic percussion
I'm that, cool laid-back don who won't say nuttin'
And laugh when a nigga start frontin'
And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang
You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song
Bass beat bang (2X)
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song
Rock Tims, rock Chucks, rock Bapes
I like eyes, pretty lips, fly face
First you said you would spread for me in an instant
See me with the next chick, now you act different
Power of the stick shift, now I embarrass her
Play your position, you're way outta character
Do the knowledge, graduated hood college with honors
Pay homage to Nas, Dickies and Converse
On her eyes shades in the nighttime regardless
The army's so thick you can't harm us
And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang
You put it on and on and on and on

My jams bump out to the borderline
UK hot with it, blew spots with it
Every continent love when I spit it
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothas on lockdown on their cock feel it
It's real in the field the Last Mohegan
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood
Legit' now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge
I make hits now, money I flip now
Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now

Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

Repeat 2

Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion

We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
You thought I was a boxer -- Prince Nasim
But I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you ridin' with me
You keep askin, ""When do you have time for me?""
I'm never free always on the move, bidness oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit tryin'
Before you find what you lookin' for and get to cryin
You always sayin' what you gon' do if you catch me lyin'
You won't see me tonight [Yeah right] (Say what? Say what?)
You won't see me tomorrow [uh-huh] (uh-huh)

No you won't see me tomorrow
Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister
I feel no guilt when I twist ya
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha
You got your name on his lease, copy his key
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig piece
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
But I be out with my peeps in them system jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doin' his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely

Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy
Tell your friends you in love with Nas not his money
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs
Iceberg - everything on this planet Earth a woman desires

(Verse: Nas)
You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with black Jason, '89 with a bottle
Jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty no tint
Rollie on wrist, gleamin' he rock the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, louis, and hallsey
Cop chocolate tie, burnin' style and burn it down
Got hype in the federal joint, verdict out
20 years gettin' money in the dirty south
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude
So I'm yellin' free my nigga
My nephew..."
207,You're da Man,2001,Stillmatic (2001),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Nas,"Uh uh, yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flames
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas - too real, Nas - true king
It's however you feel, g'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with god
I don't kill soloists only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it comin'
Soon as I popped my first bottle I spotted my enemies tryna' do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changin on the world since ""...Barbeque""
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said...
If I, ever make a record
I take a check and put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since in the project, crack in my socks weep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna' learn the traps of the streets
But look at me now
""You're the man"" ""You're the man""
""You're the man"" ""You're the man""
""You're the man"" ""You're the man""
""You're the man"" ""You're the man""
""You're the man"" ""You're the man""
Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
It's suicidal, how I smoke in so much la'
I saw a dead bird flyin through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings and Ghana stay
So I could get on my flesh right away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimmin in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurtin' me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't I must've been Escobar
Forty-five in my waist, starin' at my reflection
In the mirror, sittin' still in the chair like my conception
When everything around me got cloudy, the chair became a king's throne
My destiny found me
It's clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket
Here come the Bravehearts straight out the projects
We live the life where the blood spills
Same thing that get you cash nigga, get you killed
Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him
Pull out, {*shooting sound*}, four head yawnin'
Sloppy, droppin' you herbs
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit
Back of your head vomit
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals
Tryin' to wild nowadays sold crack, bust guns at Bow Wow's age
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell
Fuckin' 'em hos, boilin' coke since I was 12
Way too foul walk around all the time
With a gray Mack 10 and a pocket full o' dimes
Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas
Scared straight, but FUCK them hos
Keep it, dead serious
Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin',
Now you sleep with them fishes
G-W-I-Z, so delicious
To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts
I'm movin on past you chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son
And this is the military turn it up
My uzi weighs a ton, your son let's thump nah
Heat talk feet walk you run uh
Rat ta-tat, Hear them shots come
Drop son, pull out
You better send 'em back son, or feel that casket
The peeps be like one (one)
I'm movin on past you chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son

With my testosterone, male hormone
Enough for a giant's body, science S-C-I-E-N-C-E
Don't tempt me, EMS will get you, me I'm just, invincible
Like Mike Jack said, for me and Al Sharpton won't be Broke in Harlem
That's dead, who made this style, solo or X
Or UTFO's doctor or Mo Dee
Whoever, I freaked it yes, so meet ya death
I never wear Esco, I got a New Line comin' like cinemas
Remember the, original, y'all still tryina show niggas you're rich
Town house niggas
I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries
Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired
While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up
A million of us, each nigga itchin' to bust
You got a house in Virginia
The only way you sicker than us
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck
No need for the gun play, it's ok, 'cause you dyin' anyway (faggot)
Yo, this is for them High school drop outs
Niggas in court who copped out
If you prefer shots over knockouts
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' and you ain't turnin' back
Braveheart's gettin' money ruthless till the world end
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend
I used to have the bike on a bench
Now I got the jeep on the strip
Coke in the pot, heat on my hip
Nigga don't stop blazin' 'cause ya target's movin'
Shoot till the gun's empty stupid, Queens
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is
Useless to these swift executioners
And that's Queensbridge nigga, all day
Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze
Runnin' from D's quick to knockout rookies
G Wiz you know what I'm 'bout
