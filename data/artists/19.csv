DTP nigga!
I started with ten mack tens
And ten clips and ten pens
Got ten times richer in the span of ten years
Bitch I'm ten times two on a scale of one to ten
I'll battle ten crews with the strength of ten men
At nine, I was into crime, sex, and drugs
Pushin' an '89 Box Chevy sittin' on dubs
Nine thugs all ski masks, black suited with gloves
Break the imprinted chest with at least nine slugs
Man I ate eight clips with eight chicks
Watching eight flicks
You's 8-6 if you ate pussy with fake lips
I figure eight when my mind goes in circles
DID I DO THAT or was it Mystikal and Urkel?
On to 7 Ak 47, so what?
I got seven hoes stoppin' by at seven to fuck
Then put seven in your chest seven days a week
And add a foot for good measure you'll be seven feet deep
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score
I got six hoes distributing on six blocks
It's blistering from cops tryna stop these rocks from distributing
Six gun shots left
One pint of Vodka before this pimp will hit
It's street justice, now it's six hole in your casket
Give me a high five and I'll put that nine lower than your esophagus
Then smack you so hard that you have to come with 2Pacalypse
Five stars, twenty rims, five cars
I'd add more but I had to subtract one from five bars
I got four forty-fours on a rip on the floor
For you niggas talkin' shit
I'm fixin' to show you what for
I did four months in the bing instead of a hearst
Now it's DTP for life, dog for better or worse
I fuck three best friends
Ran on all three the same game
In these streets I'm a murderer
I got three alias names
I'm three times insane
Three shots will cave your brain
On 3 fire and ready, cock back and aim
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score
I'm packing two twenty-twos and twice the ammunition
But at Friday the 13th
What's up now superstition?
I'm a two timer with a couple of twins
Double jeopardy
With a pair of two deuces in the two seater Benz
I got one motto get dough till you're gone
I got one main lady the rest of y'all is hoes
I'm numero uno with one more before I go
If you think I ain't the one bitch you too slow
And all you zero ass niggas ain't nothin' to me
Because I chop up O's, move dro', and chop keys
0-6 is my clique along with PC
Pretty Rick, Calil, V-Slim and Shondrez
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1
Ludacris, Fake Feeze, and that nigga I-Twain
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1
Ludacris, Fake Feeze, and that nigga I-Twain
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4

2,9 Times Out Of 10,2013,#IDGAF (2013),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"9 time out of 10 I'm probably fuckin' with some hoes
At the strip club playin' Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Walk in side the booty club, I'm pickin' any one I want
9 times out of 10 I'm probably fuckin' with some hoes
9 time out of 10 I'm probably fuckin' with some hoes
At the strip club playing Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Walk in side the booty club, I'm pickin' any one I want

Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Luda!
50 thousand hangin' from my earlobe
With a bank account that most niggas would kill for
Stupid retarded crib, and all my whips clean
Rockin' some Jays that don't come out till 2015
I'm moonwalking bitch,
Yeah, I'm Michael Jackson thriller fresh
Slipped inside the mirror, saw a pimp nigga in the flesh
Spray some Polo cologne, to match my Polo socks
Now Coke bottle bitches, make your soda pop
And drop it like I ain't ever seen you drop it before ho
Drop it for a legend or this DTP logo
Drop it for a little free marketing and promo
And let me Instagram this photo
9 time out of 10 I'm probably fuckin' with some hoes
At the strip club playing Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Walk in side the booty club, I'm pickin' any one I want

Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Scrolling through my Ho-lledex
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, let's see what ho is next
So many to choose from, I can't make up my mind
But whoever I pick better get up on the dick
Real quick, don't waste my time
'Cause I got shit to do, so I'm just bout to smash
Soon as I'm through with you, back to countin' this cash
I'm hung low to all these women, I'm their antidote
And when they on my dick look like they riding a banana boat
But on they period, I don't want them mislead
So it's a sign by my bed that say ""No turn on red""
Treating women like spades, I'm so unstoppable
Just tying to leave the club with 'bout 3 and I'm possible
9 time out of 10 I'm probably fuckin' with some hoes
At the strip club playing Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Walk in side the booty club, I'm pickin' any one I want
9 times out of 10 I'm probably fucking with some hoes

Coke Boys in the house, that cost a house
Disturbing the peace, smoking that loud
Throw up 50 like nothin'
Cause bitch I'm worth 20 Ms
Brick throwing got your bitch jumping like Sean Penn
Got a neck full of gold, fresh out the 'lympics
Stack never fold, pussy clap on the pole
Louis tax counting mills, Louis on that field
Coming fresh out the corner, now he on that hill
With your bitch blowing smoke nigga
I ain't gang banging, but Luda that's my folk nigga
9 times out of ten, house money I spend
Take your bitch and her friends
9 time out of 10 I'm probably fuckin' with some hoes
At the strip club playing Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Walk in side the booty club, I'm pickin' any one I want
9 times out of 10 I'm probably fucking with some hoes

Ho,

Aw, you just came home from doing a bid
Tell me what you gonna do?
Act a fool
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me what you gonna do?
Act a fool
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
Talkin' about gats, traps, cops, and robbers
It's 911 please call the doctor
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece of me, we gon' split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped their boundaries
You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck from around me
Ya peeps talkin' 'bout what kinds of shits he on
You dissapear like poof bitch be gone
You think you 12 gon' catch me, gimmie a break
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, golden grain on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side
Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me what you gonna do?
Act a fool
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me what you gonna do?
Act a fool
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
Let's take it to the street cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With my pedal to the floor, radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in my trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I roll up to da club, I get all the affection
Cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, fuck what you heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And for the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
Cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
Now them girls up the block still running their mouth
Boy whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
If anybody talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'm gonna do?
Act a fool
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the street still smokin'
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
On the off ramp doin' about 150
Rollin' through East Pernium, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a 5 to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' some shit
I even got a trailer hitched with the barbeque pit
And now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and bees, that's fantastic
So girls hold ya weaves while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like Lil' John Q and get a change of heart
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
Man, that ain't sticky, that's just sticks and stems
Boy whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
Catch a man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
If the bottles all gone and your eyes are red
Boy whatcha gonna do?
Act a fool
Act a fool
Act a fool

Act a fool

Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot
Think not, I'm the thrilla in Manilla,
Schlong in Hong Kong
Pimp 'em like Bishop Magic Don Juan.
Man, after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the motherfuckin' phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big ass sack
I'm slingin' this dick like a New Jack, bi-atch!

Is it 'cause they like my gangsta walk? (Gansta walk)
Is it 'cause they like my gangsta talk? (Gangsta talk)
Is it 'cause they like my handsome face? (Handsome face)
Is it 'cause they like my gangsta ways? (Gansta ways, ooh)
Whatever it is?
They love it and they just won't let me be.

Don't rush me, just relax and let me be free.

Where it is 12:45 in the A.M. and Disturbing Tha Peace is our in-studio guest
Our hotline is lit the fuck up with people with relationship issues
Caller #1, you're on the air
Yeah man, y'all tell me if I'm crazy cause this girl in here trippin'
Y'knowmsayin? I'm a real man, I take care of home
I take care of my kids, I'll pay all my bills
I mean I ain't gon' lie, I may check a lil' female from time to time on the side
Y'knowmtalkinbout, but what man don't? So how can I break this down to her?
Ludacris, how do you feel about this particular situation?
(Ludacris)
Yeah, get your money right ladies, learn to sign your own checks
But don't call me after midnight, unless we havin' sex
Don't ever assume nothin', a man gon' be a man
A groupie gon' be a groupie, a fan gon' be a fan
These tricks gon' keep trickin so hustlers gon' keep hustlin
Long as there's new coochie then dogs gon' keep fuckin'
So don't be all up in my phone replyin to women's pages
I thought your momma told you you should NEVER talk to strangers!
Don't ever ask no questions that you really don't want the answers to
Stop poppin' off at the mouth or like Nino Brown I'll have to cancel you
Handle you, stop the ride, leave you on the avenue
Half of you, always seem to want some nigga to pamper you
And that'll do for him but not for me, I'll probably baffle you
And if he wants to act a fool I'll show him what the gat'll do
Run along, go find somebody to snitch or go chit-chatter to
Then your name will follow with ""Ay! Whatever happened to..?""
(Exactly, that's just what she need to hear)
You damn right playa, aight thank you for callin man
Next caller
Yeah I hear you but let's talk about the fake-ass brothers
With the 24's but can't pay the note on they lease
And my nigga with his iced-out chain
But I can't get him to pay his damn child support
That's why we makin' mo' money, ownin our own property and ride just as nice
So now, I guess if we want to, we can bail y'all too now, huh?
Interesting, Shawnna you wanna speak on this one?
(Shawnna)
Uh, yo, get your mind right niggaz get a bitch that can keep up wit'chu
I'm tired of thinkin' to myself why in the hell did I ever fuck wit'chu
I'm stuck wit'chu, sick of yo' childish games and all the stuff you do
I'll probably mention yo' name but true to the game I've had enough of you
I've seen yo' type befo', throwin' yo' funds all over the flo'
He flashin his chains and flashin his dough, he drinkin' the fifths and drinkin' the Mo'
But what you don't know this nigga broke, he can't even afford to smoke
And back in the hood all the hustlers and G's know he's a joke
That's why I cheat a nigga, just when he eat it I tell him beat it nigga
Real bitches true to the game, that's how you G a nigga
D.T.P. stay in the zone like we on PCP
Chrome on the SS, Shawnna blow there recently
Y'all niggaz ain't on my level, I do it so hood
Pineapple and Belve', we feelin' so good
Lightning is so wood, I get my own stack
That's why I leave him 200 and never call back
(That's right Shawnna, pussy rule the world!)
Yes it does, next caller what's up?
Man what's up, this is Marcus
I wanna know do y'all got somebody to talk to these triflin-ass women?
Like me, I'm a good man, but all these good men get treated like shit!
All friends callin at 3:30 in the mornin
Marcus don't wanna talk about no numbers
Marcus wanna talk about that ass, and I ain't havin' it!
Y'all got somebody to talk to these women?
'Cause they need to be TAUGHT!
I-20 you better talk to 'em!
(I-20)
Yo, get your money right ladies, tell the man to get gone
But you don't you show up to my crib with your period on
This is lesson one baby, listen, how should I begin?
Um, ain't no such thing as a plutonic friend
You're lying to yourself if you don't think you want mo'
So don't you call me insecure when he show up at your do'
You all claim to have substance, self-respect and some class
But half naked in the club and steady shakin yo' ass
Screamin I ain't done enough to touch you under your skirt
But who the hell are you to tell me what my money is worth?
I run the streets, and you trippin' I don't make you feel safe
I stay at home and you complainin that I think we need space
I'm not sayin' that it's fair but it's the way that it is
Ain't no nigga tryin' to marry you with four or five kids
It may sound a little harsh but it's straight from the heart
A nigga didn't write the scripts so I'm just doin' my part, yeah
(Preach my brother, preach! I hope you women out there heard that!)
And you better believe they did, it's millions of people listening
But that's our show for this evening ladies and gentlemen
I gotta go get a piece of ass my damn self, all right? (c'mon baby)
Check us same time, same place tomorrow
""Battle of the Sexes Radio"" signing off
Good niiiiight"

Pussy niggas clear the room
I came through the door, I said it before
I'm the truth in this bitch and you niggas all hoes
Counterfeit rappers say I'm stealing their flows,
But I can't steal what you never made up bitch
Y'all some duplicate rap cloning niggas
I manufacture you hoes put on your makeup Bitch
Let me explain, nothing's been new since Big Daddy Kane
Flows will get recycled passed around to different names
But what's the same, that every verse I spit is insane
Got more styles than any rapper in the game, 11 years and still counting
And y'all get a couple hit records, make some noise and have the nerve to start shouting
Who's gassing 'em, they blowing smoke up your ass, you fired up but I'm just puff puff passin' 'em
Until they roaches, buried in my ashtray
Nigga burn slow, better pray like it's your last day
You lying to yourself, just admit it
May not like the way I use it but you know you ain't invent it boy
Do your research before you make a claim so bogus
That's disrespecting pioneers in the game
Fuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes
Then you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants (sir, yes sir)
See I'm ya past, I'm ya future and ya present
So watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend
16 times platinum, 6 number 1′s
So I can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week
You's weak, softer than the Pillsbury dough boy
Don't make me expose the truth, you's a hoe boy
Don't make me get on that Stomp shit and get back at it
You rappers ain't even in my fucking tax bracket
Why am I wasting my time
Yeah I admit I get a little Ludacris with my rhymes, sometimes
But my fans know the difference because ""My Chick Bad"" went platinum still winning muthafucka
The nerve of you niggas man, you ain't got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy
Fall back in formation, y'all outta line
I was told not to kill a mosquito with a cannon
So the next time you nats got a real problem
Don't be a coward like a nigga that used to be signed to be going on twitter rants and shit
Nigga say it to my face"

Listen close, nigga, yeah
Uh, if rappers want it, they can get it
Flow tighter than four fat bitches sittin' in a Civic
My flows are unimaginable, Hannibal Lecter shit
Eatin' emcees for breakfast, bitch
Since I was born to touch the mic
The first time it's been a problem
Your life was a mistake
Your pops should've wore a condom
You niggas think you hard
I think you better come harder (Go hard)
I leave rappers confused like will.i.am barber
Ah, fuckin' with Luda's not a great look
A verse'll make your fans unfriend you on Facebook
Click, my styles are goin' into labor
So if stars won a war, I made daddy like Darth Vader
And since I'm always high, it's kind of hard to overlook me
For over a hundred stacks, it's kind of hard to overbook me
And a whole 'nother house for my cars is on my checklist
'Cause to fit 'em in one garage is like a nigga playin' Tetris
But they say patience is a virtue
'Cause I got your bitch stayin' out way past her curfew
Guess I was a thief that got away with these words
Slangin' chickens out my whip like I been playin' Angry Birds
In a black Rolls Royce, Dark Knight like Batman
Everywhere you turn, the Ghost follows like Pac-Man
And I sleep with the John Dillinger
And always keep an eye half-open like Forest Whitaker
No, you boys ain't ready for combat
Be more worried if I renew my Def Jam contract
What path is he on? Opponents, I laugh and be gone
They handin' in the towels like they work in Bed, Bath & Beyond
But in the midst of all the melee
Y'all niggas just bitches with dicks like Sheneneh
Your rap styles are phony, your lines are just dead
And I be on them lines like a nigga just played
Guess I'm tryin' to say I'm advanced, you intermediate
You wouldn't know the real me if your bitch Wikipedia'd it
Just know that I never tried to be hard
Probably 'cause Mr. Glock 40's my security guard
You'll get chopped like judo
Gangs in my hood make you reverse
And change your color like the block's playin' Uno
And, yes, some of my friends is still sellin' them drugs
But I just say they Weight Watchers like Jennifer Hud
They show me love
That's why I'll always stay reppin' until the death of me
Rappers talk shit, but ain't nobody ever stepped to me
I hereby command all my fans' to inject it
Overdose on Red Bull in your veins if you ever slept on me
Yeah, my mind is sharper than a guillotine
All the nines extended from the knuckles of Wolverine
Not a X-Man, but, man, I got that X
I'm on my hardest, switch labels, but I still get a cheque
The more albums they sell, the more we all win
And I can be seen in thirty rocks like Alec Baldwin
Or watchin' CBS in a Cadillac DTS
I plan to reach the world, man, your plan is MetroPCS
I changed my music up 'cause I was gettin' bored
You may not like the way I shoot, but my points go on the board
My name still engrained and these books will be the outcome
And this one verse is harder than a lot of niggas' albums
Peace, fuck out of here, rewind that shit
Ha-ha-ha, Luda, ain't shit changed"

Oh it's my turn? Aiight...
I got permission to put ya mamma in a headlock (what?)
She tried to jook me in a figure-fo' leg lock (oh)
She said she like the way I stick and make the bed rock
Or how I lick and leave her twisted like a dreadlock, and it's on
So stop the sweatin like a wristband
And get some balance like a bike without the kickstand
I think I changed the definition of a hit man
'Cause I could really give a fuck about that bitch man, c'mon!
We puttin' holes in your residence
And lose anybody for the right president
We thugged out street niggaz with intelligence
So all that bullshit you yappin is irrelevant
Oh yeah, I represent the Dirty Southside
I'm a dentist makin' women open they mouth wide
You be in jail still runnin' it on the outside
Thank not then won't ya open up ya mouth riiiight, but who cares?

Uuh buddah-laa ah, uh uh uh buddah-laa
UHH BUDDAH-LAA Ah uh oh uh oh uh oh
Comin' to Shady Park is like a peep show
It's some respectable ladies and there some freak hoes
I know killers that go to church up in they street clothes
You'll end up missin' more than Shaq when shootin free throws
They packin and bout to open up the dope spot
My neighborhood is stoppin' cars like a roadblock
They movin' weight like Atlanta was movin boat rock
And catchin ums like seeun Muslims eatin pork chops - never happen
And meanwhile I been thinkin' man
Niggaz been slangin tapes like they slangin 'caine
'Cause in the hood its gettin' ugly like orangutang
So if you tryin' to stop the hustle get the dangalang
Okay, we tryin' to make our own White House
Paint it black and start yellin' our fuckin' pipes out
You try to tackle some players and you'll get psyched out
They can't fuck with us niggaz you think they dyked out, so don't play
Disturbin The Peace, we do that funky shit
Hey, what can I say? We got a monkey clique
See Dre'll throw on them shades, and make that funky shit
And keep y'all women away if they got funky clit
Understand, we got that dough and it get rolled up
You pay the price and still we got the block sold up
Ain't nothin' nice a full house don't make you fold up
You full of heist and try to jet and I'm like -
Hold up, god damn - I need to say it on a megaphone
And tell your sister get the fuck up off the telephone
These fools is tickin me off like fifty metronome
I'm takin' all of ya money just call me Pebbletone!
All right? I got the pistol and the safe key
You betta tell your bitch to follow you to safety
How dare you wanna be heroes and chase me
It's Ludacris wont leave no evidence to trace me, you know why?

Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it
And y'all think I'm gon' stop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
In one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast
But bein broke with no food is just a thing of the past
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass
And y'all prayin' that I flop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
In New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green
In Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean
All these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin' for sixteens
Try 80, want a discount? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
See in just six months I infiltrated the system
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him
Niggaz hate givin' me props 'cause I might use it against them
C'mon, get Ludacris out! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
(Chorus 2X: Ludacris)
If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone

And if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong
But after your three wishes - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

I'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law
Any charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall
Next year I'm lookin' in to buyin Green Briar mall{?}
You probably own a lot of property! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
C'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls
Plus his money keeps flowin like Niagara Falls
We all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws
I'm 'bout to go on vacation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'ma throw you a curve
You mad 'cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words
I'ma start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves
Pepsi's the New Generation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

My black people show me love when I'm up on the block
And Latinos always waitin for my CD's to drop
White people love the flow, they say, ""Dude, you fuckin' rock!""
Yo' fans are my fans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
So find my album in the stores and look for the white steam
Rip it open, play it and yo' momma might scream
It's hard, other albums are softer than ice cream
Yo' scans are my scans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Now Luda's throwin' up A's, and I'm lightin up L's
Around the globe gettin' paid, you home bitin yo' nails

We probably gettin' on your nerves, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
I been eatin and gettin' FAT while y'all dyin' of hunger

Or give me one more reason to go?
Yeah, I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
Matter of fact - fuck you, don't need you in my life (no)
You done did so much wrong I hope you get right
But not at my expense, I did all I could do
You just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool (nah)
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
But I don't know you no more - fuck it, I caught amnesia! (woo!)
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm tryin' to carry (yeah)
And niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga you's a grown man, get yourself together
Forget about the past, now's a better time than never
Matter of fact, it's time to start makin' better decisions

In my Ferrari partner thought he saw a spaceship
'Cause I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smilin' in my face when I'm around y'all
But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my downfall (Lord)
Is it 'cause you'll never sell as many records?
My bitches always look better? You fail at business endeavours?
Or that people thought you were clever but now they know you stupid?
And misery loves company now that you're goin' through it? (yeah)
Somebody tell these rappers I worked hard in these Louis
So get out of here, you don't want no parts in this shit, do we?
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
That's why you find me in the club every once in a blue moon
So while you contemplate makin' your first million
I'll be somewhere contemplatin' on makin' my first billion
Hah, and then trillion

Is thinkin' everyone lives by the same principles (okay)
But when I talk by the same teachers and principals (nope)
For you to know it's not the money, it's the principle (woo!)
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout (nah)

I'm tryin' to ease back and get my head in the zone
(Then where the fuck you tryin' to go?) Nigga this yo' city
Anywhere, I'm just tryin' to see some ass and titties
So fool mash the gas, the night is young
All bullshit aside I'm tryin' to have some fun
Hit the hop in Lakewood, or ride down Slausson
Or the casino, they say it's just like Compton (ha ha)
Really doesn't matter, long as shots don't rang out
(Nigga I stay strapped, I don't wanna pull the thang out)
Well keep the heat heat right up under the seat
And let's roll to Roscoe's and grab somethin' to eat
But check your rearview mirror, I swear somebody's followin
Rollin' in that dark blue SS Impala and
All up on the bumper, man I'm just sayin'
Tell me you know this nigga (nah, they better stop playin')
He sped up around and drove right in front of us
Could be one-time just tryin' to bust one of us
Till he smashed the brakes and we almost hit him
Throwin' signs out the window like somethin' was wrong wit him
Before we jump out and get ready to clown

And I got the A-Town pump
It'll make your whole body do the A-Town stomp (woo!)

My town, but I still got Phoenix enemies (yup)
Haters wanna stop 'em and I really wanna pop 'em
But it's hard to fight back when you got an album droppin' (connects)
We in South Phoenix, niggaz Africa bang
Matter fact, Chris, tuck in your Africa chain (what?)
'Cause I see some niggaz starin' at us with a lame frown

Fucked up off head shots

19,Charge It to the Rap Game,2015,Ludaversal (2015),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"Everybody wants the fortune and fame
The more things change, the more they stay the same
This industry is like a crap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
This industry is like a crap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
Where do I begin
Well, the industry shady not everybody is your friend
I had to learn that shit the hard way
In and out bogus contracts since before I was rapping in the hallway
Everyone out for money, executives out for blood
If you don't keep the music current then labels'll pull the plug (Get it)
Hard to admit when shit don't go the way you plan
While everybody's on Instagram just fronting like life is brand
Take it back to one of my first tours
Fuckin' everything movin' thinkin' groupies will never do nothing back to us
Kick 'em out the hotel swearing I hit my finer things
Lost a bunch of jewelry from a Rolex to a diamond chain (Bitch)
How in the hell did I get caught slippin'
Meanwhile on all my records, nigga talkin' bout he pimpin'
Maybe I exaggerated a lil bit
You know fake it till you make it every one of us rappers gotta talk a little shit
Yeah I done smashed some video vixens and some actresses
But brand name pussy don't feel no different on my matresses
Insecure hoes with brest jobs and butt shots
Blaming on us rich niggas sponsoring shit and what not
Now guys are just as big as groupies as these women is
Till you break up and a bitch wonder where her percentage is
While these regular hoes are trying to play the trap game
And now is the time I blame it on the rap game
Everybody wants the fortune and fame
The more things change, the more they stay the same
This industry is like a crap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
This industry is like a crap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
Listen, this ain't scripted this reality
It take some drugs for us to conquer this is sanity
Thieves using our name promoting these fake appearances
Publicists overcharging taking years for these clearances
I got sued some rappers said I stole their joint nigga
Spend half a million just to prove a fucking point nigga
We got the fans thinking rappers never lose
Gave a producer a hundred grand for a beat I never use (Damn)
The false stories and being misquoted in magazines
Got a nigga wanting to go and load a couple magazines
Head to your office and shoot up the whole fucking staff
Post that on your website and burn while I fucking laugh
You protesters at my concerts y'all make me sick
I thought I told y'all I would never disrespect a bitch
It's clear to see that Hip Hop's under attack man
Or is it 'cause that no one wants to see a rich black man
Really they want us with no money
Hungover and missing flights and cutting our show money
Hip Hop cops still looking and trying to catch us slippin'
And put us in a position to make some real life decisions (Hmmm)
Or do we just be doing dumb shit
Emptying out these gun clips and always on the run shit
Lifestyles of us entertaining hood niggas
If it's bad to be a rapper what's good nigga
Everybody wants the fortune and fame
The more things change, the more they stay the same
This industry is like a crap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
This industry is like a crap game

(Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg)
It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
... And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
... Get my hustle on
(Ludacris)
Look here!
Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word
But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
It's all a part of growin' up and seein life at it's worst
Then tryin' to iron out my wrinkles, puttin' family first
It seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat
But with God as my navigator I'll be stayin afloat
And I admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions
Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions
I'm battlin with MYSELF and every DAY it's a war
Curiosity killed the cat, why am I Curious George?
Gotta keep my nose up outta thangs that ain't none of my biz
And just cause somethin' looks don't really mean that it is
Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife
And take the necessary steps to try to change my life
I got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood
So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?
(Ludacris)
Now I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways
I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today
Oh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it
Is from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin'
Dodgin and duckin everybody tryin' to hammer me down
A self-made millionaire, baby look at me now
Can't tell me nothin' still hungry as the day I began
Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand
And a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact
Me and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that
Was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12
Tryin' to get in where I fit, streets givin' me hell
But yet I give it right - back, so how you like - that
Continue doin' wrong till I was on the right - track
Tell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a PUSH
But a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Come on
(Ludacris)
No matter how much older we get man, we all still children at heart
We all make mistakes, it's all good
Now I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits
Livin' life on the cuttin' edge, takin' a stab at it
And learnin from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice
Just admittin when I'm wrong, tryin' hard to make it right
And baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours
There's plenty people gettin' stitches in this world of scars
But over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds
Try to love and love again until they seal your tomb
Cause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by
That's why my head is in the clouds tryin' to pass the sky
Never blinkin for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes
They wanna catch me in the open, bring my life to a close
Meanwhile that's why I'm bringin' so much life to my shows
I've seen smiles I'm makin' changes turnin' glitter to gold
Don't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul
Just be happy with yo'self and it's so simple to grow
Come on
(Chorus - to fade w/ ad libs)"

And I got to make sure that I take care of my family
And it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (

And to my niggas on the block
On the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks
You hear the voices say it's cold outside (

I'm hidin' out and smokin' herb
'Cause my boss is gettin' on my motherfuckin' nerves
But I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (

See rappin' is my only way
My mama told me just to save it for another day
But I got to make it 'cause it's cold outside (

Man, I can hear that wind blowin'
You say it don't get cold in CP well niggas it's been snowin'
Even though some might disagree when business is still slowin'
Even if we subject to change
Come up out them diamonds and rings
Even all them dollars and change
Nigga we home-grown
And to those that couldn't take the pressure nigga they long gone
Skeet 25 lighters on dressers or you'll get zoned on
They be puttin' them bodies in bags
They be cuttin' them bodies on slabs
Then go to somebody and brag
Got to keep a straight face
Better keep inside with your know got to find a safe place
Better stay in silence or go or end up a waste case
Pigs figure it's more stuff to do
Pigs figure there's more folks than you
Pigs never come close to a clue
I put my life on it
Want to disrespect give me your neck and I'll put a knife on it
Some say it's slippery when wet but my Roll got ice on it
It's all about supply and demand
It's all about me buyin' some land
You folks just don't understand, that uh
It ain't no one to trust but me

Y'all see a man on the moon walkin' I see a crowd runnin'
And the APD steadily talkin' 'cause we done found somethin'
And it's not as good as it seems
Oh I wish I could get some cream
And get up out of the hood with some dreams
I'm peepin' hard crimes
See the system's fucked up and they givin' out some hard times
Heard that one of these ??? up and my people snortin' hard lines
Locked up and they didn't do a thang
Locked up because of the pressure and pain
Locked up because they wouldn't do the same
And I see the case close
I can't ask no questions, and it's over 'cause they say so
I ain't learned no lessons, but these snitches better lay low
Or we gonna be choppin' some heads
And we gonna be rockin' some beds
And we gonna be droppin' some ends
We walk a long road
Tryin' to find the essence of self but I picked the wrong clothes
Do-rag with a gat under my belt 'cause life's throwin' strong blows
But I keep a little hope and some dreams
And I try to stay focused and clean

Man, y'all look at me like y'all grew up in the same places
Scams and dirty work came up on a day to day basis
Now they got to re-up and re-bag
And they got to re-up and re-slab
Then they got to be up and be bad
This game'll never end
Excuse my French, but Goddammit I got some clever friends
They might get set back by some wench but that bitch'll never win
It's all about the way of the world
It's all about the way of them girls
It's all about them diamonds and pearls
We waitin' too long
But the DEC in Southwest Atlanta is too strong
We might bring that soap out and wash up and throw them suits on
Comin' in the court with some pride
'Cause we ain't got nothin' to hide
Just didn't know what laws to abide
I play the cards dealt
And I bought a full house and I watched a woman's heart melt
See my mama's cooled out and she's cryin' 'cause it's heart-felt
It's all about supply and demand
It's all about me buyin' some land
You folks just don't understand, that uh

I'm talking Monte Carlos, Crown Vics, Cadillacs and Regals
If I get pulled over, everything I got's illegal
But I ain't got no worries I got Jesus riding shotgun
Knowing that I need a meal ticket and I can't stop until I got one
Shit, I'm whippin' cutty bubble bucket busty, bitches love to ride too
Hanging out the window front and central serving niggas like a late-night Wendy's drive through
Tweeters, speakers, jeekers fiendin', diamond in the back my nigga
I got two white girls, think I oughta have a curl in return of the mack, my nigga
It's the return of the 'Lac
Riding on so many horses they think I'm playing polo
Candy paint drippin' like a Jheri curl, nigga, I'mma let my soul glo
Fleet, flickin', screaming, bitches, pitchin', counter, past fate
And all of the women get jealous 'cause of the way my car can make its ass shake
Last to base, in the face
The law's right beside me, my window tint, dawg
My rims are too large
As soon as I hit the back road bet the law can't find me
Ridin', candy paint with two poles in the trunk
Popped up twice with two hoes in the trunk
Disturb your peace with fifteens that thump
Duck my slab get sawed off with the pump

I charge at the door them hoes hit the floor, we have club nights in my trunk
'Cause it's an earthquake when I park, I keep a UFO in my yard
My wheels so big when I swing my whip I can high five God, lord
I could skydive off of the top of the roof, rims taller than King Kong
Riding around looking for an ass that I could sit my drink on
My seats warm, my drink cold, my paint dry, but her mouth wet
Suffocate that ho till that bitch look like Smurfette
007 pressin' more buttons, I got all these gadgets, ho
I got all these alpine, it could turn a square chick ratchet, ho
Neon lights shine neon bright that I could direct all this traffic, ho
Young and wise my 9 to 5 would be a vortex if I crash it, ho
Like a head on collision with a red bone mouth colder than Michigan
Reach in that glove box and I got more rubbers than Michelin
I'm feeling like Yao Ming in the whip (why?) I need more leg room
So I hit a switch and the whole back seat turned into a god damn bedroom

And my car never talked back to me
It just turned up and played this track to me
And my girl getting jealous trying to wild on her
Calling her used 'cause I actually got so many miles on her
And try to make her feel inferior
Since I'm rubbing on my Acura's interior
Whenever I'm with either of my ladies I just love her
See 'cause one rides me while I ride in the other mane
I'm bout to go get in trouble mane
With the one that's like my sidekick the other thinks she my mother mane
And I ain't with that
They both got mean bodies but with this Maserati see how I trip that
Pretty feat with nice painting they both drop the top
And both stressing everythang in the parking lot

Luda, throw some grapes on these peasants!

These bitches throwin' rose petals at my feet mayne!
They wanna spoil me, treatin' me like royalty;
What I'm 'sposed to do? It's such a sweet thang
Work that track, whip 'em like Kunta
That's why they stay down, they loyal citizens of Zamunda
By way of A-T-L; if you disagree
Don't even look at me ho don't pass go just go straight to jail
With no probation or bail, but this ain't Monopoly
It's Jolly Green Giants 'cause we smoke so much broccoli
Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's! Luda's oodles of noodles
And testing me, is like pitbulls put up to poodles
My rap career goes back further than your father hairline
It's ludicrous - I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines

And even got my coach bumped up to first class

With five strippers, four wives and three amigos
I go scuba divin in Bays at Montego
I find gold links and snatch 'em, like I'm Deebo
But I'm the light-skinte-ted version, of Mandingo
I've seen more Beatles and Jagged Edges than Ringo
I used to run numbers in line they caled me BINGO

Ooh that's what you are (hey)

Luda! I must admit that you are truly somethin' special
So hop up in my vessel, let's wrestle like I'm The Rock (Rock)
Deep in your ocean I'ma find your buried treasure
So hop up on the dresser, throw your legs up to the top (top)
Stretch it out like calisthenics
Bet it that Luda wet it and get it and have somebody call the medic (medic!)
My head is in the right direction
My quarter's in your jukebox, girl you are my #1 selection
I play you over and over, put your head on my shoulder
Slide down and give me head in the Rover (Rover)
And I'm a soldier, see it ain't no limits to the things we could do
And I made this record for you
So that we could break it down to the nitty-gritty one time
And when it comes to the sexin I get busy with mine
So you get busy with yours, I guess we destined to see
Baby girl, you are destined to be
(Ludacris)
Yeah, uh
Uh, so supernatural, wonderful and miraculous
You got me buggin off yo' attractiveness like Whoa (whoa)
So precise, so fine in yo' position
That my unanimous decision is to never say no (no)
You got me strung like a guitar
Playin' the sweetest melody is definitely heavenly by far (far)
Further than the moon - and I never fake it
But I take it when you get naked cause your body's like BOOM! (boom!)
How could I resist it? I'll be there in an instant
When you call like tornadoes you got me twisted
I know you missed it, so I'ma give it good
You'll go ballistic, because I give it hood
Just like a nigga would, and like a nigga should
If you hear screamin then Luda's up yo' neighborhood
Good gracious, yeah I do it right
And all night, you are
(Jamie Foxx)
Yeah, it's courageous how you drop the phone and rush over
Crazy how you make me high when I'm sober
Just when I thought, I've seen it all
You put it down on meeeee
It's contagious how your lips make me lose composure
Addicted to the kisses, your blow got me swoll up
There's only one, my champion
That's what you are to meeee, yeah
Ooh yeah

(Word Of Mouf)
(Chorus: Ludacris - repeat 2X)
(Oh No!) I caught him with a blow to the chest
(Oh No!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh No!) I'm bout to send two to his dome
(Oh No!) Cry babies go home!
(Verse One: Ludacris)
I got people scared as FUCK like when condoms break
Or how your heart deals with eatin' eighty pounds of steak
So put your belly on a plate and watch your weight
You frostin' like a flake and Ludacris feels grrreat!
Who want come face me, face come want who?
And women give me face until they're face turns blue
They can't breathe, dick to mouth recessatation
A tight squeeze witch stops the length to conversations
I Playstations, duck cops and lose agents
I'm Doctor Love, I close curtains and fuck patients
When I kick and rip and flip an indispensable rhyme
My black ass is so hungry I'll take a bite out of crime
And it'll hurt if I swallow, but even more if I choke
Neighbors called the fire station off the blunt that I smoke
You see I crush cowards, funerals I'll send flowers
And I'm on the overpass flick pennies at rush hour
(Verse Two: Ludacris)
You see I'm ambidextrous I slap ass with both hands
Delete your first steps, but I'll save the last dance
I just bought some new guns my mama said ""it ain't worth it""
But I'm at the shooting range just 'cause practice makes perferct
Bullseye, I stunt growth and stop lives
You run with niggas that's more chicken then pot pies
Bok bok bok I'm shakin your tale feathers
I got big balls, I'm a SAC King like Chris Webber
Luda' will take you back to duck hunt and double dribble
When niggas sold quarters and dimes and smoked nickels
My cars got big TVs and satellites
I got a Wheel of Fortune 'cause I flipped O's like Vanna White
And the servey says? (Kill a mutha fucka now)
Could it be off with his head? (Or shoot a mutha fucka down)
Ground round, ground chuck your ground beef
Bullets gather round then I shoot rounds around teeth
(Verse Three: Ludacris)
I kick niggas in they're ass reboot 'em like laptops
And they wouldn't even box if I gave 'em a flat top
You punks pucker and pout, bicker and babble
Now they all lost for words like I beat 'em in Scrabble
You see I'm from a small town called ""Fresh out a cop's ass""
Where Mr. Head-Potatoes are skinned they get mashed
I smell puss from fifty yards
Y'all not playin' with full decks as if I jacked out ya Jacks and left fifty cards
Catch me in Vegas spinnin' the green
I re-up with more chips than a vending machine
Then you can catch me in Rome maggots in brauds and sticking 'em
And you'll be at home picking your bougars and flicking 'em
A drug dealer's dream, so fresh and I'm so clean
I'm a grown ass man and you're sweeter than sixteen
So go and kick rocks peons you're just rookies
Headed down stairs to get you some milk and cookies"

But please, stay away from the hoes and snithes
And I was always reached for the sky, I don't know why

Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin' a fuss
My older cousin need some cheddar too
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick
It involves that local corner store
I overheard him say he knew who works there
And whatever they do, don't let the owner know
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
And if he don't let me borrow nothin', but ask me what I want

But it's a new day, she want a MacBook
So I showed her how the backseat of a 'Lac look

Talking about she needs some gas money
You better hop upon that pole and shake that ass for me
Oh, hoe stop acting all boogie

Yeah, she says she needs some rent money
I told her hop upon this dick for me
She says she need to pay her condo
Yeah, well I need some daddy long stroke
She asked me about her phone bill
I asked her to show me just how that dope feel
She says she need to pay tuition
Well drop down to the floor and assume the fucking position

Do something strange for a little piece of change
Do something strange for a little piece of change

Fuck the bed, we bout to stay right on this couch bitch

Spray the Chevrolet red like it's from Cincinnati
Baby giving me head with superior talent

You lookin' at a man that would die for his daughter, jus to let her breathe.
And I'll defininetely die for Jesus couse he died for me.
Give my eyes to Stevie Wonder jus to see what he seen
But then I'd take 'em right back to see Martin Luther dream.
I Dreamed that I could tell Martin Luther we made it
But half of my black brothers are still incarcerated.
Locked up in a cell block, Lost from da shell shock
Some sold they soul, others used to sell rocks.
Look up in my mail box
I get letters from my cousin every week
Sayin' he wanna hit the street
But he never struck a deal
'Cause his mouth will never squeal
Put some money on his books, And help him out with his appeals
Send some pictures of the fam, and nasty pix of Shawnna
If you ever have to leav I got ya mother and ya daughter
Born in dis way of livin' and da youth is stuck
To be safe, its safe to say the justice systems fucked up.
If you doin' 25 to life, stay up homie
I got ya money on ice so, stay up homie
If you locked in a box keep makin' it through
Do ya time, don't let ya time do you

Got dem damn jailhouse barbers pushin back on ya hairline
Them fuckin' center guards will hav stuck in appeal line
Ya bitch missed da VI dis weekend
Da food in locker keep shrinkin, ya cellie feet stinkin
Da canteen ran out of menthols
Can't see how grown men wash other men draws
Niggas play da phone room wreckless and get hit wit new enditements
Talkin' bout old connects and new prices
Stress wil take a young nigga and give 'em an old face
Stress wil take a dumb nigga and give 'em a new case
The shit I used to talk I walk it

And when them folks let me go I made sho that his books was on
Then 3 months later that nigga came home too

I've been in this 'ere since we were drinkin' beers
Years we've spent together, used to break up, get together, split a fight
Every night, gettin' cheddar, movin white
Our thang, so we had to ""Do it Right"" like Spike
Holdin' 40s, gettin' green on acres, these broads were our mules
That's when we used to serve in front of Commonwealth School
Fuel for cars and jewels, chains and tools
It was organized crime but we remained confused
Mom in the pews, singin', Lord, protect 'em
You might not agree with our views, but you had to respect 'em
Diamonds in the rough, but were we reflectin' a system that's abrupt,
The streets, or no pressure one morning in the mirror
I seen my reflection a young man with good spirits, but needed direction
I guess my man's death, was my resurrection
'Cause now I hear him sayin' from heaven,
""Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up

'Cause I make 'em erupt like volcanoes, you just shake and you shiver
Get 'em up, get down, turn around and put your face in the pillow
Cut 'em up like Jason, just face it that boy Luda's a killer
Half man, half gorilla, beatin' all on my chest
Pleasin all of your flesh, squeezin all on your breast
Givin' you reasons to rest, and ain't never say no to papi
Wake 'em up like Folgers 'cause I fold 'em like origami
Hey mami let's get it poppin' like Orville Redenbacher
The way you move once you started nothin' could ever stop ya
Sweeter than Betty Crocker, and I'm ready to belly flop ya
Just mention today but for now I forever gotcha
(Ludacris)
(Whoo!) Verse two, it's like this
Gotta get 'em up out of them clothes, if I throw a couple dollars then pose
We could drink a couple bottles and go, and ride off in the Impala on vogues
And Rolls, gold is all on my neck, all on my wrist
So just let go of yo' hoe, don't hog her to death, lend her to Chris
Just for a little while for a little bit
Just wanna see her smile and get the bigger fish
She said that you had a little dick
Now how in the hell can she benefit from somethin' like that?
I be up in that cat, make her put a hump in that back
Black, I swing low and sweet chariot, meet me at the Marriott
Key access, I'll be at the very top
Don't hesitate to stop the elevator either
I'll show you the ups and downs, you'll be my elevator diva
(Ludacris)
All I need is a couple hours baby, for real
Come up out that Prada, Chanel, Chloe, Loius and Gucci
Escada, Dior, Fendi, that Masconi and Juicy
Rockin' Republic, True Religions and Citizen's jeans
Your Jimmy Choo's are so sexy but Giseppi's is mean
La Pearla lingerie, ya panties and bra matchin'
Put down your clothes and I'll put you UP on the latest fashions
'Cause with cameras and action, I'm a deadly assassin
I love your clothes but what's underneath I love with a passion
(Ludacris - over Chorus)
Gotta get you outta them clothes baby
Somethin' about the way you move
I cannot let go, whoo!
You know you got me open
I just wanna make you mine, haha
By the end of the night, you gon' be mine
Luda! And Valentin' the dream
(Bobby Vasquez + (Ludacris))
Don't leave your girl round me (guard your women fellas)
Said don't leave your girl round me (Disturbin' Tha Peace)
Don't leave your girl round me (yeah, whoo!)
True playa for real, for real, for real, for real
Don't leave your girl round me
Said don't leave your girl round me
Don't leave your girl round me
True playa for real, for real, for real, for real"

(Chris Rock - Intro)
2010, that's right, we in the future
Atlanta, Georgia
MILLIONS of albums sold, MILLIONS of moneys rolled
I see why +Everybody Hates Chris+ - YA LIGHT-SKINNED BIATCH!
(SING ALONG WITH MEEEEEE...) {Cannon...}
Say, ""FUCK you, Luda!"" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Say, ""FUCK you, Luda!"" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Say, ""FUCK you, Luda!"" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Yeah, I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+
Say, ""FUCK you, Luda!"" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Say, ""FUCK you, Luda!"" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Say, ""FUCK you, Luda!"" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Yeah, I guess that's why +Everybody Hates 'Cris+
(Ludacris - Verse 1ne)
Hey! Okay now, this is for the Gs' and this is for the hustlers
This is for the diamonds and the WATCH all clustered
Spread 'em like mustard (yep!), canary yellow
Now women in my face like ""HELLO?"" (Waddup?)
Yeah, I'm sort of a big deal (deal)
These Giovanni rims are sort of a big wheel (wheel)
This five course dinner is sort of a big meal (meal)
This Bentley GT can make Luda disappear
Faster than David COPPERFIELD, mutha-FUCKA!
...Hahaha
I'm talkin' five star tellys, and Penthouse Suites
Yeah, I'm just a +Playboy+ between +Penthouse+ sheets (okay!)
Hit the club and go and party with some Penthouse freaks (say what?)
Party with Britney, Lindsay and Paris together
Get in line and buyin bottles that's taller than Chris Webber
And makin' haters sneeze from diamonds and sick leathers
'Cause my ice gives 'em cold as if they under the weather (cool!)
But my women keep me warmer than a POLO sweater - they better
(I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+)
(Ludacris - Verse 2wo)
Hey, now I stay fresh to death draped in gangsta fits (okay)
Over twelve million sold, I drop gangsta hits (yes sir!)
Live in mansions and drive around in gangsta whips
You would swear I'm 'bout to get into some gangsta shit
Oh no! Here comes trouble, my vision is skewed
I can only see in doubles, two models, two bottles
That'll pop like bubbles, and when I get home {Two... one... zero..}
The girls' tops lift off like air space shuttles {Liftoff (*rocket flies*)}
(And I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+)
It's sixty seconds till BLAST off!
My car got a face lift and took its mask off
Tint so dark it look like I took the glass off
The body was white for eight weeks
Befo' I finally decided to take its cast off (whoo!)
Now it's blacker than a bottomless pit
You talk shit you'll end up, wit bottomless lip (BLAOW!)
I hit a nigga so hard, I'll make him swallow his spit (BLAOW!)
Then I be wit Bobby V. on that +Anonymous+ shit - ya hear me?
(And I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+)
(Ludacris - Verse 3hree)
Hey... (Let's go!)
I go for BROKE like TLC
The hottest nigga on the mic - yeah, I believe that's me (Me, bay-bay!)
Now all the ladies wanna give a lil' T.L.C. (C'mon, girl)
'Cause Luda was set for LIFE after three LPs' (Ching!) - Yep!
Still countin', still climbin the charts
And rappers still talkin' shit like they was rhymin in farts (Waddup?)
I cross the finish line twice, they still tryin' to start (Nope!)
But my infrared beam will make 'em shine in the dark (BLAOW!)
(And I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+)

I never did like this motherfucker...
The only rapper that, goes to the airport without a gun in his bag {*audience laughs*}

37,Eyebrows Down,2003,Chicken-N-Beer (2003),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"(Ludacris)
Yeah
Gotta feel me on this one
Ain't none of this shit happen overnight
We talking about a long time coming motherfucker
(Chorus 2X: Dolla Boy + (Tity Boi))
It ain't clean on these streets (uh, uh)
It's mean on these streets (yeah)
Blocks up, hats down
Fiends on these these streets
(So please pay attention when you coming around
Cause the blocks got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me)
(Verse One: Ludacris)
I'm still back for the first damn time
So grab a hold of your seat while I OPEN YOUR MIND
And take you back from when I dropped down from heaven
And I came on my moms and I had a MIC as my fucking weapon
When I was three I was just a little G
But if you looked in my eyes you would see the future of a real MC
And at the age of nine I wrote my first ryhme
Soon rapping became one of my favorite pasttimes
Everywhere that I went spitting and dabbling
Showing my ass growing up and started traveling
From one city to the next luda landed in the ATL
Where the pimps and the players dwell
I made a tape did shows and got EX-PO-SURE
And kept learning as my black ass got OLDER
No matter what I just kept at my trade
I made mistakes but still stayed sharper than a GINSUI BLADE
(Verse Two: Ludacris)
Age 14, my talent show, a beast out of cage
Would have won, but got disqualified for JUMPING OFF STAGE
But I didn't care cause this game started to open it's arms
When I was at Banaker High School pulling fire alarms
So I could get a crowd around me make a name for my BLOCK
People told me keep flowing they didn't want me to STOP
Back when big nose John was my human beatbox
Skipped out on school hit open campus and look out for street COPS
Now I'm known around the town as that ""Nigga that raps""
From the hill of Maze high to them G roll traps
And I was still making demos perfecting the craft
Some said I wouldn't make it they would giggle and laugh
So I picked up a couple books from DONALD GOINES
About the busimess of this shit and how to FLIP A FEW COINS
By the age of eighteen I was destined to MAKE IT
My bank account read DISTURBING THE PEACE INCORPORATED
(Verse Three: Ludacris)
Age 18, I'm struggling just to survive
But I got a gig working for change at 97.5
Now I'm rapping on the radio increasing their NUMBERS
Still Ludacris, but Alias was Chris LOVA, LOVA
Late nights I'm in the studio using they tools
Me and Poon was smoking weed and breaking all of they rules
And I was krunk, ALL THE BIG WIGS WAS HEARING MY SONGS
But nobody did SHIT and they was taking too long
Three years went past and I saved enough cash
To make my own record company and put my self on BLAST
The album was independent it was just for the streets
I sold one thousand albums in my first fucking week
Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand
All the record companies biting, but I chose Def Jam
The main reason that I made it and I love the A town
Was because the BLOCK had it's EYEBROWS DOWN, ya heard me
(Outro: Ludacris)
Yah, I've' been waiting a lifetime to get what the fuck I got
It's real man
Hardest working nigga in show business
Believe that
Shout out to Lil fate, I dub, Titi Boi, Chaka Zulu
Yah Woo
The people's music I used to play some happy and some jealous
'Cause I'm showered with cash and they can't remove they umbrellas
The people's music I used to play some happy and some jealous
'Cause I'm showered with cash and they can't remove they umbrellas
Uh

You hear it raining don't ya
You hear it rain"

Go on and testify

Lord, please forgive me for the mistakes I've made
And thanks for keepin' my momma safe when she wrecked my Escalade
See I could replace a Cadillac but I can't replace my momma
I'm sorry for the hip-hop beefs, we sorry for the drama
But you gotta understand us rappers ain't never had nothin'
And one's loss is another's gain so we gotta grab somethin'
Lord, got so many questions I need the answers to
And sorry for the thangs I put my baby's mama through
I feel that women are really the strongest human beings
But why do you make 'em so emotional, and other minor things
I guess it's your way of sayin' we gotta love 'em and gotta praise 'em
Cause without 'em we'd be nothin', plus our kids they gotta raise 'em
While we, out and about and seein what life has to offer
But if you offer a new life then what we need is better fathers
Either I'm smarter cause of my daughter or I'm just too dense
I'm 28 years old, it just now started makin' sense

Lord, forgive me for anytime a fan said I was bein rude
I'm only human, I'm not always in the best of moods
But thanks for givin' the gift of rap to write my feelings down
And sorry for cursin sometimes but feelings make me shout 'em out
Forgive the people that wanna blame everything on rap music
If they didn't live it they can't relate or even adapt to it
Forgive those who don't think I'm great and wanna see me go
Forgive Oprah for editin most my comments off her show
Don't get me wrong, I know some people got a image to hold
But those who criticize the youth might just be gettin' too old
We still travellin through life, findin what's right or wrong
I know some folks may not agree or even like this song
But I'm just speakin' MY truth, 'cause I heard it sets you free
And my conversation's with God, even though he speaks through me
I'm smarter cause of my daughter, and I'm NOT too dense
I'm 28 years old, it just now started makin' sense
And I've been...

(Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest in the house tonight
Came with some words of encouragement, Bishop Eddie Long)
(Chorus Two - repeat 2X, minus ad libs)
(Outro: Bishop Eddie Lee Long)
What you just heard is real life
It's real life for you, it's real life for many
It's about where you been, yet at the same time you
Ay, you find yourself, in the midst of conflict and turmoil
Yes I'm talkin' to you, in the midst of conflict and turmoil
Cause you realize HEY - it's, time to change right now
And in the middle of that I wanna say this
The Bible says that when I was a child, I spoke as a child
I understood as a child, I fought as a child
Hey, but when I became a man
I put away those, childish things
Did you not know that your environment has shaped you?
Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghettoes
In the upper downtown, wherever it was
The people around you, the things around you
Cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn
But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book
God called you a prophet
When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out
And it commands attention, it commands change
I'm talking about the power, that's inside of you
And in the midst when you're, starting to understand
That I caught the wrong message, and now it's time
I'm hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God
He said, ""Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation""
Old things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold
Everything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you
It's time to stop the killing
I said it's time to stop the stealing
It's time to stop disrespecting our women
It's time for us to come home and raise our children
It's time for us, to really mold our communities
It's time for us, not to get hooked up in religion
But to get hooked up in relationship, with God
And the amazing thing about it
Is wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess
And you can tell God ""I'm sorry;
I had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing
I was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasn't right
And now that I'm getting it right, I'm asking you to forgive me
And I may have done the things, that they said I did
But I'm not, who they say I am; I am who you made me to be
And I'm changing in that, and it takes a few moments
But every time I fall down, I'll get right back up
And every time I make a wrong turn, I'll get myself back in line
Because I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this!""
You can't resist the change
And you're not condemned by your yesterday
If you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny
Move, change, and be, now!

Tryin' to stay strooooong, and make you prouuuuud - make you proud!

I hate it when it's too many niggaz, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my diock, BIATCH!
I got a whip like Miracle Ludacris lyrical FOOLS
We dirty south shut yo' mouth we rock jewels
No holds barred but obey the block rules
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools
Are there anyone like ya? (HELL NAW!)
I treat humans like students (FAIL Y'ALL)
So turn ya books to page 69 and start suckin'
When Organized drop the tracks then start duckin'
When Ludacris get in the bed start fuckin'
[Girl:] You wanna be startin some'n
Get out the booth
And lemme tell y'all the truth, we kick down doors
Save all the H20 for front rows
Live in the bank and watch for stank hoes
Stay chromed out and that's on or off road
If you know what I mean proceed to stay clean
Light skinded nigga turn red but get green
Inhale some of that 'dro but blow steam
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans
[Girl:] Boy you done lost yo' mind
No I've lost my virginity
And I shot quick like that fool shot Kennedy
What's the remedy Hennessey Coke
If you cut all your money you'd still be half broke
Ashes to ashes smoke or get smoked
We come by the masses you come and get choked
If you take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
So now we eatin lobster shrimp and things
And watch for imposters that's been in the game
We invented the game and y'all just got hip
[Dude:] Man what's that smell
Probably yo upper lip
'Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank
Even if it's cigars and that purple color dank
Chillin' in the Gump with no trace of Tom Hanks
So put this in yo' jaw like weiners and beef franks
I put too much sugar in my Kool... Aid
And party like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I like to get paid
Arrive to a hoe and I like to get laid
Ride up on my back like rugs and floormats
I'm on the right page but what's my format
I wave to the ocean 'cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bozack
Did you know that? Man I'm the gift of change
Electric stoves so give me the keys to the Range
Shagadelic, beautiful but strange
Went to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flames
Rearrange, same broad different night
Pass the E&J and let a nigga get right
The bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight
The highlight's that I live a high ass life

Hanging with women that's loving them drugs
Neighborhood call me the plug of the plug
Poppin' a pill and then jump in the tub

Got a black, AMX, I left home, no Visa
Talk money, and my money, talk back, like Caesar

Fifty to a hundred, then a hundred to a grand
Then a grand to a milli, nigga really what's good
Its wood in the whip the wood like a wood shop
Neighbor's all think that I cook rocks
No peace in the streets
Really got me thinking ain't no such thing as a good cop
My neck froze and my ice steel
Flows, rappers just bite still
Platinum plaques, three Grammy's
I'd said I Made It like Mike Will
With coupes all on that freeway
Pockets on Gabby Sidibe
Got cake and women blowing like everyday is my b-day
We be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)

With her legs sprawled out like the Air Jordan's symbols
She be twenty thousand feet in my apartment in the sky
Y'all hoes just drink and drive, my woman just drink and fly
She a lady in the street ain't nothing fake about her booty
She call me for special ops, I told her that's my Call of Duty

I got QP's and halves - if we beefin' I blast
You sleepin' I laugh, ask Tit (Titi boi), I'm off the rip
I had this hoe who talked too much; I had to off the bitch
2-0, Mr. Crayola; niggas know what I mean
'Cause I slang brown, white, yellow, purple and green
And all you faggot-muthafuckas gotta know the routine
(Crunchy Black)
Bitch it's me again, kickin' in your fuckin' doors
I look for div-idends - I ain't lookin' for you hoes
You bitch can't com-prehend; let me put one in ya bro
Let me put one in ya bro, so you niggas can go to sleep
So, lay down bitch; gimme all that you dreamed for
Gimme fancy cars, gimme bling-bling-bling, boi
It don't mean a thing, boi, for me that ain't gon' swing, boi
Them god damn toys; do you know what I mean, boi?
(DJ Paul)
Now if you warrin' and runnin' from them Three-Six niggas
This forty-five gon' give a reason to sleep, nigga
Or bustin' massive 'round some S.K.
My last trip to A-T-L I fucked yo' cascade
I'm strippin' bitches and I'ma ball fucker with a limp
They call me infer-stripper, sexy, red hoe's pimp
And quick to sink her on the nigga 'cause this what it's 'bout
We rob that trick and stick his dick off in his fuckin' mouth
We Memphis niggas
(Juicy J)
North, north, south, south, Westwood, Orange Mound
Nigga we be smokin' light; never Cha Cha Charlie Brown
Memphis niggas in this bitch; pockets full, ya know we bail
Hooked up with my nigga 'Cris, then we head to A-T-L
Playas wild, throwin' bows, tellin' chickens, ""Fuck you hoe!""
Niggas rollin' Optimo, snortin' that white shit up they nose
Mayne this town is like my town, so we stayed and hung around
Juicy J be high as fuck; catch me in the lost and found
(Lil' Fate)
Better use common sense checkin' me out for bitch I can stand for
And up, get yaself in this clique
Without my tongue licks, behind me gettin' handcuffed by a slut
Look, I'm from Gittero what?
Southside niggas throw it up when it's time to get buck
Niggas in the back of the club postin' up
Waitin' for a nigga that's new to make it up
As in, ain't no askin'; it's no tolerance as long bitch check in
She wit' me, comments will only get'chu basically eternally resting
So abide by the code of the streets
If ya got a bitch better keep her on a leash
'Cause Lil' Fate gonna creep in ya home while you gone
Have you comin' back findin' nutt on yo' sheets"
50,Good Lovin,2015,Ludaversal (2015),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout ""that's supposed to be you, girl""
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
'Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me"
51,Grass Is Always Greener,2015,Ludaversal (2015),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"Yeah
Did some movies and started missing this rap shit
Back to rap and starting missing them movies
Left these hoes to settle down with just one chick
Get with one chick started missing them groupies
Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober
Next year I got drunk and did it all over
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
I got rich and learned life was a bitch
Now everybody's after all of my ends
(Get yo hand out my pocket!)
When I was broke all love from my folks
But nowadays I'm losing all of my friends let the story begin
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Yeah
Start exercising and winning got me a six pack
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back
My six pack reverted back to a gut
When I'm at the crib I'm mad I'm not at the club lit
When I'm at the club I'm mad I'm not at the crib
I used to be out partying every damn night
Now sometimes I'd rather be with my kids
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name (Luda!)
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
Guess what I'm really saying
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
Yeah
Last year got the Ferrari that I always wanted
Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade (Give me my Ac'!)
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
Grew it back then started missing my fade
I got hits start trippin' I wasn't underground
Got underground start trippin' I need hits (We outta here!)
When you down and people give you the runaround
But feels great to know who really gives a shit
You cut the grass and the snakes will show
And know your neighbor's fertilizer is fake (Don't let it fool ya!)
We always searching what we never had
Always ignoring what's in front of our face
We've been conditioned to think
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly"

Whether getting money legally or illegally
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man!
Yeah! Grew up a screw up baby
Got introduced to the game, I ain't took a breath yet
Let's go!
Ever since I was an embryo, waiting to shape up and ship out
Something in my brain said, ""Wake up and kick out!""
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out
'Cause when I came I was draped up and dripped out
Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out
Peace up, A-Town gone and then I dipped out
And oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out
I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out
Somebody get him, the lil' nigga's out of control
Put a lil' bit of rum in my bottle I'll dream about diamonds and gold (Gold gold)
To grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent
The essence of adolescence got my body feeling fresh'n
Fresh'n fresh'n, and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping
I was the best in my section with flows hard than erections
Still the best but now I'm grown with more range than a Texan
And I'm a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion

Y'all already know what it is
I'ma tell you nigga
C.T., know what it is, 'bout 17-5
Homey fronted me a sip, shit I made it a bird
That's seventeen and a half, all I need is the word
Say the, ice is cool but them pots is hot
You better cook slow but that money come fast
I got what you need I hope you brought all the cash
You know the kid pimping all over the world
A hundred carats got me all over your girl
(Yeah) Five freaks and my Gucci duffle bag
A corporate thug I run with a Playaz Circle
I got a Field Mob that'll disturb your peace
Blowing Sean Jay, all we do is smoke
Finish counting my bread and I was getting some head

I'ma be all the way real with cha, look
When I came into the game they ain't do nothing but doubt me
Now the whole game's changed and it ain't nothing without me
Picking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown
Only reason you on that song is 'cause I turned that down
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's
From all right to handsome, from one room to mansions
From hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons
From, broke as a joke to rich as a bitch,
I bought a plane and a boat and six other whips, no MARTA
From dice on the curb to stacking up chips, but harder
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK!
Guard your women dawg I went from ashy to classy
Went from a, kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty
Reach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars
It's not the hand that you're dealt
But how you're playing your cards
Boy!"

Okay, I remember the days
High Rights, Low Lefts, Even Stevens and Fades
Troops Lotto and BK's those was the days
High tech boots spray painted wit'cha name
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
Thick Herring Bone's chain
One gold wit your initial
Harris photos group shots can you remember
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed had North Clayton craze
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
'Fore da invasions of hatas man crews from all around
Use to get down at True Flavas bumpin Kilo
Walkin' damage cross colored and Paco
While playboy step through talent shows
Prom nights tux and kangol was so cool
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school)
(Chorus - Keon Bryce)
We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids
(Fate Wilson)
In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
We was lovin' that
Before they started jackin jacks
'Fore notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark
Crown Victoria's police unmarked cars
Be aware... Wayne Williams was out there
But we ain't care kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there
To busy playin'...
Double Dare
You touch shorty on the ass that's a bet
Want ya Kool-Aid and sugar smack ya hands and say sweat
It's mine now place it in my Louis Vitton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
Slouch socks box Chevy Caprice
Hot knees cut da holes Disturbing Tha Peace
Wit no conscience broke niggas call 'em nonsense
No comments this lil' Fate payin' homage to College Park

Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids
(Ludacris)
I had a Long John but no Silver
No gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With 2 sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barb wire clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my click turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddys
I brush teef brush naps and cold streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and the moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with all the people makin' all that goddamn noise
(Chorus - Keon Bryce (x2))
We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how we win
When we were kids"

Like to hear it? Hear it go, I'm rehearsing, gotta sing my song
I know I've done some wrong, but I can't get right
Cause life is like a big fight
I'm stickin-and-movin, tryin' to get my shit right
My family's been houndin me, friends they done turned against me
Kinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty
And they say I've changed, but like twins I'm just the same
It's because of my job, mo' money mo' prob in this dirty game
This industry FUCKED UP
That's right I said it, and it's fake as ever
Keep real niggaz around me, stay ""Space Age 4 Eva""
Po-ppa never went and jumped the broom, never got that one degree
But if you looked down from heaven, you'd still be proud of me

Babies doin' dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
Everybody wanna blame music for they bad kids
Sittin' up in the court talkin' 'bout Eminem made me do what I did
My own hard times rolled in like the fog
Try to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts
My momma, in 1967, pickin' cotton
While other blacks was gettin' liberated, boycottin
My old man was a player, ain't no hidin that
He started tootin then he graduated to smokin' crack
I never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker
He left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin' gutter

In the middle of, 1988, in a corner cafe
We made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night
Do talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life
My momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me
Knowin' without a, household father, things could get crazy
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all
But nevertheless, momma was with me through it all
I graduated out of nothin', not out of school, it was like
12, 13, 14 years I'm thinkin' cool
I might as well, be focusin on me tryin' to get paid
Usin' these rhymes I've been writin since in the 7th grade
Our team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage
It was just like a piece of pussy
It fucked me long as I stayed

I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids actin' a fool from the traps to the burbs.
My filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy (ah!) and took my old teeth back.
I'll take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader
It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
But no pork on my fork, I don't even speak Pig Latin.
I go fishin' on my lake, with your bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MC's, but I don't gain no weight.
The number ONE chief rocker, clean out your rap lockers.
I'm as stiff as a board, you're more shook than maracas.
But my tricks ain't for kids, if you dig em' you'll get smacked
I'll clock ya, I'll spring forward, you fall back (woo)
Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers (yeah)
That's 'cause I'm a shot caller, y'all fools are crank yankers (bells)

I hit the cleaners and tell em' ""I want a full court press"" (ow)
So mama toast ya glass while I'm countin' my cash
Cause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camel's ass (ha)
The competition never just wanna admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in ""The Wash""
From your car to crap game, no one rolls with you
One of Mini-Me's shoes got more soul than you (ok)
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
I'm in the strip club smokin', with President Clinton (cough cough cough)
So stand clear of the long side-burns and gold teeth (teeth)
They make the mold of the penis enlarger off me (me)
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back (back)
Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq (yeah)
So yippie ki ay, yippie yi yi yo (yo)
If you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro (dro)
I've been lookin' for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are more stuck up than tampons (whoo)
So wash all your sins away and stop playin' (yeah)
If God's line is busy you might have to two-way him (uh hmm)
And catch me in your back yard, playin' croquet
And when I'm drunk, tellin' kids: ""drugs are bad, mmm-kay?""
Or watch me swing my chains at the Rascals of Peko
Got seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think I'm bad, they say ""oh he's so evil""
'Cause I go on blind dates, with actual blind people (ow)
But my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf (uh huh)
I heard you masturbate alot, so y'all keep to yourself
Cause these women want a man to stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home
All that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them
Cause Ludacris will beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I'll put my foot so deep in your ass that you can smell it
And your breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellent
I'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see
And I'm in a group I split dough with me me and me
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry
So I'mma trade my earrings in, and get a Ferrari (whoo)
I buy cars wit straight cash, have meetings wit Donald Trump
Y'all meet wit Honda, no payments for 12 months (uh huh)
Take a look at your life and no wonder you're so sad
Y'all put up wit more shit than a colostomy bag
Ha ha ha (fool)"

Hey! Thank all y'all for comin' out tonight
It was a beautiful night tonight and The Shizznit
Where pimpin' and dead, these hoes just scared
Thanks Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, all the players from the LBC
It was a beautiful night tonight
Oh, look at these fools, Ay! Security! Come get these niggaz!
(Verse 1 - Luda (Snoop))
Fresh off the streets, just finished a show in Long Beach
Ready to relax, kick up my feet
Maybe smoke a blunt or two, that's what I wanna do
Broke out and called up the homeboy Snoop (What happenin' nephew?)
Oh, nothin' just called, lookin' for some women that can fondle my balls
(Well you hit the right dogg, I can help you with that
Gimme 15 minutes, and I'll hit you rite back)
Off to the hotel, I was ready indeed
Slapped the button in the 'llac to control the speed
Put one up in the air, the cops just stared
Waved my hands out the roof like I just ain't care
Got to the tele and I slid through the do'
On to the elevator, hit the penthouse flo'
And what would happen next only time could tell
'Cause I got up to my room, and I was mad as hell (Ah! Damn!)
Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Verse 2 - Luda)
Now it was five B.A.P hoes and they look like trash
But one was midget, so we'll just say four and a half
I was stuck speechless, couldn't believe my eyes
What'd I do to deserve this unpleasant surprise?
And I was thinkin' to myself, ""This is just my luck""
Then my nigga bust in like ""What the fuck!?""
(Oh shit it's Snoop!)
(Snoop (Luda))
Who in the hell let them booger bears out they cell (Not me)
And what they doin' in ya' room? Nigga make 'em bail (Yeah)
Got some fine bitches, dime bitches on they way (Okay)
And told security, ""Let 'em in, with no delay"" (Ha Ha!)
So when they get here, they'll probably be like half naked
Don't mean to trip out, but bitch y'all got to dip out (Dip Out!)
Catch the elevator on more floor
Presidential with the slidin' key for the door (Oh No!)
What the fuck goin' on? Shit, all around the world Luda, then it's the same song
Them bitches was so ugly, I told 'em to go home
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Man who let these hoes in my room?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Oh no!)
(Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Well who let 'em in then?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Get out!)
(Verse 3 - Luda (Snoop))
Now, these chicks wouldn't leave, they was ready to clown
One was 5'6 and weighed three hundred pounds
(No she didn't come through with a thong on
She did for the hell of it, big fat whale of it)
You can't separate me, Ima separate you
Bitch ya' pussy smell like Pepe Le Pew
(You filthy, nasty, sick in the head
Sittin' in my dressin room with dick on ya' bread)
She said ""I want you to climb in this underwear, silly""
But I was turned off by her tupper-ware titties
(Fake bitches, break bitches, make bitches
Kick rocks, when they fucked up in they face
Tick-tock, you gots to get up out my space
Hey Ludacris let's get the fuck up out this place, let's bounce)
Then it got to my head, and somethin' reminded me
I know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly (Faggot)
(Ya' white bread, chicken-shit nigga!)
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Who let these hoes in my room?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?
(I need to know, who let these hoes in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Snoop, Talking)
Ay, ay y'all gotta go
Y'all gotta get the fuck up outta here, ugly ass bitches
I don't understand how these bitches always get in my dressin' room
You know what I'm sayin'?
Soon as I get off stage, it's 7 or 8 ugly ass bitches posyed up in my dressin room
And security act like they don't know who did it
I know you feel what I'm sayin', I'm my nigga around the whole world
We need to form a society or somethin'
Fat, gorilla, monkey mouth bitches can't get in our mothafuckin' dressin room or backstage
And if they do, we kindly put our foot up their asses
And re-direct them bitches to security dressin' room, you dig?
Sick of these ugly ass bitches bein' my dressin' room"

Man ever since life's been a gamble, my life's been in shambles
Double edge sword burnin' both sides of the candle
But Cris you can't handle the truth
Don't wanna face reality, so Lord accept my apology
Please, like when police say freeze
And I ain't do shit, but I'm down on my knees 
It's a crooked system, but gin straight take the pain away
I charge the game, and put my problems on layaway
A black man but I feel so blue
So I smoke green and purple till my dreams come true
Then my eyes turn red, the sky turns grey 
Children slingin' white in the hood, we call it yay
Drinkin' old gold down my yellow brick road 
Then rewrite my script until my story's untold 
See I got a little money and my life sped up

And it's strange 'cause he can barely write or read but seems to get folks just about anything
Curious about him, I wanted to talk to him
Said he was too busy fo' that, but I was more then welcome to walk with him
As we walked, he talked and I just listened
He said there's a big difference between, crackers and niggas
See he said white folks look out fo' the white folks, but uhh
Black folks blame otha' black folks when they ain't enough black roakz
When you ooh to make a long story short
We need pay more attention and do things that's way more convincin'
And he told me, you know, I wouldn't sell you somethin' that wasn't workin'
And I, damn sure wouldn't waste my time, tellin' ya somethin' that'll hurt you
But you'll fall for anything, if you don't stand for somethin'
That's for certain, but niggas don't be listen, and that shit be hurtin'
Not all of us, but some of us, and if we don't hurry up
They going to bury each and every one of us

Life's a bitch and I can't control her
I wish I could, and sometimes to cry on we need a shoulder
The government stand us up to run us over
And in the hood, they don't seem to understand, goddamn
What's really got me wonderin' if it's part of a bigger plan
Man, I smell somethin' fishy goin' on
And it's way beyond blowin' away the smoke from all these swishers goin' on
It ain't much I can do about it, but preach the word
Tell my people to spend ya money wisely, don't be absurd
Buy some things that appreciate, like what, like a home
Wake up, and open ya eyes to what the fucks is goings on
'Cause they constantly gettin' rid of us, one by one
Whether it's drugs or diseases or it's, gun by gun
I ain't no saint either, I feel I'm even doin' wrong

Baby, pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doing it on the dance floor
Mad 'cause I can't get wit ya chick just show me how to dance (OH!)
I may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib
Then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar wit a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big
There's just one thing that I gotta know
How low can you go? (x8)
Go low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)
I be like Nick-nac-paddywac
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone
How many licks does it takes till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home
I could make me show stop
Soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really gettin' low then Ima shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel
But when it comes to chocolate
I know that very well
Asian persuasion
No discrimination
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butterican pecan peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces

Moving packages like UPS trucks
Paraphernalia in my stash box
I hear the botton in the Bentley makes this ass drop
Your rims too small gone shoe fly
These 24's that's Ronald Mcdonalds shoe size
Fresh pair of J's I brought the Mikes' out
And some ammo that'll knock a nigga lights out

Pull a double shift I'm on my grind

Ha! I do it all night, my whip is all white
I done had a couple drinks and I got a little buzz so I'm feelin' all right
But the night's just gettin' started, haters get disregarded
Roll up them sweets, creep-creep let's hit these streets and get retarded
I pop a bunch of bottles, my bitch be poppin' too
Keep talkin' out yo' face, and she might be poppin' you
She might be pop lock and droppin' down to the flo' wit it
Meanwhile all my dogs chasin paper, that's right we go get it
So get it right (get it right) kill the lights (kill the lights!)
I'm feelin' like I might just pop a pill tonight (pill tonight)
Cause the feeling's right (the feeling's right) pass me a Miller Light
Then grab that girl with the Coke bottle shape, she's my type (woo!)
I'll take her home (take her home) and do the do (do the do!)
I know the Kama Sutra, think what I'll do to you
Stick to you like super glue, maybe even like bubblegum (okay!)
Don't go to sleep woman (why not) no matter how many times I cum

Ay, ay
I do it all night, and I ride them logs high
Baby lil' crib good, I'ma ask his shawty what that mouth like
Tell me if it's out of sight, tell me if he's slow and long
Then he made his tongue above his nose, I said ""You know you wrong""
But I'm really like sho' you right, tell me where you wanna go tonight
Anywhere, any place, I can see it in your face you are the prototype
To the ceiling I'm so so high, so-so feelin' like I'm so so right
Please tell me why the 'dro so fire, I can't stop zonin and I don't know why
Ay look - beep beep get up out my lane, y'all hoes can't do it like me
If you're thinkin' I'm 'bout the game, take a look at my U-N-I-T
That's right I'm back on deck, but don't get it twisted the strap on deck
The mac on deck, the pack on deck, and e'ry damn day keep a rack on deck
And that's on Jeff, that's on we, that's on Hoover and that's on me
That's that wood that match them seats, and that's in the Caddy and that's on 3's
No matter what they said I been gettin' my bread, get my paper, get my check
But anybody wanna try to ask I've been gettin' some heeeead

How many women can I fit up in my Cadillac?
So high I can't SEE, feelin' like I got cataracts
Some in the middle of the night say I get drunk and don't know how to act
I don't know how to act
(Shawnna)
He don't know how to act
And I don't know how to stop, and I don't know how to quit
Blowin' on a couple zone, now we need another fifth
And I mean I'm out my mind, not I mean I'm out my body
See we do this all night, is you comin' with me shawty?"
73,I Do It for Hip Hop,2008,Theater of the Mind (2008),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"(Ludacris)
Now this is what they call poetry in motion
My soul bleeds on the paper, heart screams with emotion
It's my daily devotion that verses stay deeper then the ocean
So hip hop you owe me a promotion
Yeah I do a little boastin' and braggin'
What's all the commotion and naggin' about
'Cause I'm still the champ in the south
Cause rappers get in the booth and I keep draggin' 'em out
Where they firin' these pink slips I'm handin' 'em out
Cause this is Theater of the Mind
Consider it a sign of what's to come next
My moneys just fine, bank filled with dumb checks
Terrorist threat flow, proceed to drop bombs like Mr. Funk Flex
But I don't do it for the money, I do it from the heart
I do it with the beatbox, I did it from the start
I do it for the DJs, I do it for the charts
The Van Gogh flow, Luda do it 'cause it's art
I do it for the fans, I do it on command
I do it for the front row, I do it for the stands
I spit it for the hood, I do it for the block
And since nine years old, I did it for hip hop!
I don't do for the cars and the fancy drops
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
And I don't do for the chains and the flashin' rocks
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
(Nas)
They say I'm so low key, I'm socially awkward
Only niggas who really know me who I talk with
They smile in the light, hate in the dark
You call it beef to me it's just a fuckin' walk in the park
Because you are who you are when nobody's lookin'
That's who you are so when the cash and the cars is gone
The day after tomorrow, don't be askin' to borrow
Ski maskin' it hard like the way you rap in your bars
I could ride on you and whoever, devise new endeavors
I'm as live as a hive full of predators
Twenty thousands different species of bees
Some have poisonous sting, some just pollinate leafs
Like rap, some just buzz some will attack
Compromise their own life in fact
Sixteen years since my first sixteen
Pardon the rest of my niggas
But I'm the best whoever did it
(Ludacris)
I don't do for the cars and the fancy drops

I do it for hip-hop

(Jay-Z)
Hip-hop, started out in the park
We used to do it to avoid the Narcs
I used to do it so the homeboy Clark can get the fuck off my back while I knocked off these packs
I used to rap to impress my friends
To pass the time while I was gettin' it in
Just so happens I'm so illegal with the pen they ain't want me doing anything illegal again
I lost a lot of dogs to these streets
I got Grammy awards on these beats
Thank God for Cool Herc
Without this shit I probably woulda got murked
Shout outs to Grandmaster Flash and the cash
And even Jaz bum ass
Hip hop helped me wash my rocks
These other rappers couldn't wash my socks
That's why I took the number one slot
The realest shit in rap comes from my voice box
Lord knows when I was on my clock
I probably never woulda stopped
Thank God for hip-hop

I don't do for the cars and the fancy drops

Cause the nigga don't really know how to do ya
Who's your daddy rollin' all up in the Caddy
Sunroof top with the diamond in the back? (back)
Comin' to get some of the bomb in the sack
Like a bomb in Iraq, I'ma come and attack
Every inch, of yo' body after the af-terparty
And then on to the hotel lobby ridin' me like a Ducati
Faster than a, Bugatti I'm like, whoa kemosabe
Good golly shawty a freak, well she been practicin Pilates (woo!)
I'm probably just trippin', tongue sk-skippin like the track, broke
But if she think I'm frontin just wait till she see my backstroke (hah!)
I'll be yo' side piece, but what's our future plans?
'Cause I be on ya like DAAAAMN!

Hey, okay okay
So that's yo' man's and dem, damn I ain't tellin' you to cancel him
Damn d-do yo' thang, look shawty I gotta respect yo' antonym
Damn d-dere yo' boyfriend, I just wanna be yo' toy friend
Yo' other other man, not yo' l-l-lover man, a undercover man
How many rubberbands it would take for you lil' mama to be apart of my plan?
What do you need in advance? I can see both of us showin in France
I got the back of yo' thong in my hand, Louis Vuitton, no more Donna Karan
Couple of stacks, s-so what is you sayin'? Like Denzel Washington, ""My man""
I don't wanna hear no mo'-mo' 'bout him, what he gotta do with me?
You a grown-ass woman, I'm a grown-ass man
So we both know a lot about the birds and the bees
Hold up shawty let's conversate, conjugate, constipate
Get stuck on each other, you comin' up out of yo' lingerie
Hey, I know you got a man
(Ludacris)
Not a, not a, not a damn thang
He wouldn't know what to do if he tried and I ain't hatin'
You need some room to breathe and I could be yo' ventilation
You need a lil' love and just a lil' stimulation
A hug, a lil' kiss and then a lil' penetration
Give it to you like you never had it befo'
And you ain't never gonna think about his ass again
Lips, hips, eyes, thighs, yeah I'm gonna have to give that ass a ten
And they can get a five, even though one of 'em kinda fine
But ain't none of 'em got nothin' on you, you
So let's go somewhere to dine and sip some expensive wine
Later on tell me what we gon' do, do
We gon' bump and we gon' grind, so good it should be a crime
And next time tell yo' friends to come too, too (woo!)"

Look, I make my own decisions
Learn from my own mistakes
My enemies they want beef but don't know what's at stake
I started out with nothing, just a dream and some hope
I fiend for the riches like them crackheads fiend for the dope
I went from freeze tag to holding some weed bags
To a clown of hoes juggling my bean bag
I went from spin the bottle to kiss the model
To 3 more seconds we gone find out if she spits or swallows
I heard it's a recession, while you hardly survive
The hardest decision of my day is which car I'ma drive
Roll's Royce Phantom, maybe the gold Ac'
Or the origami Ferrari the way it fold back
This ain't no 760, bitch this an Alpiner
Custom kicks chrome lips as deep as vagina
And women lost for words, guess they don't know English
No matter what language they speak they all know dinglish
Don't you understand with this blunt in my hand
(I'm fire) smoke smoke smoke sumthin;
And don't you understand with the World in my hand
If I ain't the shit
Don't you understand with this blunt in my hand
(I'm fire) smoke smoke smoke sumthin;
And don't you understand with the World in my hand
If I ain't the shit
(Ludacris)
Now as the World turns spinning on its axis
My dick be brushing women's lips like chapstick
They say it's cold on the outside
So like a dentist I'm tryna keep the mouth wide
Reminiscing on my days on the southside
I made many leak and I ain't talkin' 'bout no housewives
From eating canned tuna, to shoe hills with puma
From women saying ""hey chris"" to ""GODDAMN LUDA!""
From playing slap box to making the 'Lac drop
To white neighbours swear I'm selling crack rock
Eyes so low they think I'm Asian when I'm blazing
Cause that purples on my chest like I'm playing for the Ravens
Cadillac Devilles still rolling till the tires flat
Not from Arizona but I swear I want that diamond back
Sunroof tar, wood grain wheel
I sign for millions, y'all would never get the same deal
(Big K.R.I.T.)
I got a candy coated fetish, hoe don't you forget it
But big big big let me wet it, it's that K-R-I-T stay besides me
We can go get this dough, then we mind if you show me dime
I promise you won't let go
I got an old school and that bass big
If it ain't on chrome than it ain't me
And my mouthpiece colder than the ice season
Call me father Winter in the peak of summer I spit December
Breaking backs as they cracking limber
If that's your bitch than she can't remember
I give her wood, she holla timber
And the paint I play the sum or attention
Television of a player with an intention to be rich?
Well I hate to mention?
Back again, one more time for the buck niggas
And the thoroughbread that won't fuck with 'em
And hanged on 'cause I stuck with 'em
I ain't got time to waste hoe
Didn't have shit now I make more than I can barely count
Keep the thoroughbread shaking what the Good Lord gave 'em
Yo chick ass been a bounce
We still live from the underground
Ain't nothing changed to me
I put it down from the south, and body everything these lames claim to be

Top notch, top tier, I'm a top nigga
Slap her bottom while your girlfriend give me top nigga
Told her listen, you should gargle more, and speak less
We took some shots
And turned that shit into a drink fest
I been drinkin' all night
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel right
If I
Ain't fucked up I don't feel right
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel

Take a smoke break

Goin', goin'

Smoke somethin'

78,In My Life,2015,Ludaversal (2015),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"Yeah, I used to care so much what people thought about me
Now I really could give a fuck
Not when I own over $15 million in real estate
And bought all the Fast and Furious trucks, haha
See, everyday I put in work and my salary grows
So excuse me I'm not caught up on reality shows
See the Bridges Family values on the southside
I live in Atlanta but do not have an Atlanta house, why?
I'm not married, I've never been engaged
But yo dumb-ass believes whatever's on the front page
See some of these bloggers don't even believe their own lies
Turn the computer screen into a mirror, look at'cha own lives
'Cause technology exceeds all humanity
But there's a thin line between genius and insanity
Now private pics on my private no longer private, mane
Hope I can gets some privacy up on my private plane
Oh-whoa, livin' in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight, I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be all right (all right) I'ma be all right (I'ma be all right)
Let me live, till I die - oh I
I'm doin' interviews, gettin' asked the same questions from 10 years ago
Wonderin' to myself what the fuck I'm there for
Now that my daughter's a CEO at the age of 10
And I got restaurants inside Atlanta's airport
That repetition will drive any human being nutty
I'd rather be in my own crib, on my own couch
Thinkin' I got that ""do what the fuck I wanna do"" money
Yeah, and then I went to Quincy Jones' house
Realize I didn't have shit, got some work to do
Soon as you get some money, it's gon' be someone with more than you
Sci-fi movies, the fans said ""This album's overdue
And if you don't put some music out, these niggas gon' be over you""
Talkin' 'bout ""Where that old Luda for the rapper's sake?""
But Ursher told me if I don't evolve, I'll evaporate
I've gotten better, motherfucker if you listen
If you're smart and went to college better use your intuition
Oh-whoa, livin' in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight, I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be all right (all right) I'ma be all right (I'ma be all right)
Let me live, till I die - oh I
Yeah, my own expectations I exceeded them
And when people say Luda's underrated, I'd agree with 'em
They said I'm so visual, they overlook the lyrics
But every verse you get a sample if your mind can clear it
Then steer it in the direction of your memory
And I'll be satisfied when I'm celebrated for centuries
Wrote a song for my girl, she couldn't stand straight
My man said, ""Don't release it, you'll ruin your female fan base""
I said, ""Man, my female fan base gon' be here for forever""
'Cause even though I'm with one, to them we're still together
And who am I to tell 'em different if my voice can freak 'em?
Long as I can continue coming through all of that speakers
I'm a man of choice words but I speak the truth
And I ain't scared of shit except God in a life jail suit
Especially when all of my bills are paid for
And God answered everything that I prayed for
Oh-whoa, livin' in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight, I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be all right (all right) I'ma be all right (I'ma be all right)
Let me live, till I die - oh I
Oh-whoa, livin' in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight, I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be all right (all right) I'ma be all right (I'ma be all right)
Let me live, till I die - oh I"

Let the show beginnnnnn!

Lights, camera, annnnnd
ACTION! Take 6, Ludacris, it's nice to meet ya
Blow the smoke in the air till I blow out your brain
Turn it up until I blow out your speakers
Gotta keep them Tweeters tweakin, gotta keep them woofers pumpin
Then I blow out one of these verses
Spit 'em in ya, got a million more comin'
However you want it, I can give it but you gotta admit it
Other rappers talk it, try to walk it, Luda live it
Sign it and seal it, multi-mil' it, said it and did it
They give me sixteen bars on another nigga's song
And you know that I'ma FUCKIN' KILL IT
'Cause I'm the FUCKIN' realest, when it comes to this rappin' sheeit
Semi-automatic tongue when I spit another verse cock back, I'm packin beeitch
And I'm back and attackin with album six
Tell them other niggaz we see danger
Probably 'cause I got enough, albums to fill yo' CD changer
Gotta buy my whole collection, gotta beat my whole selection
Hit your neighborhood record sto', and you can get it in the smokin' section
Now that's a coke connection, these fiends are addicted to it
No guts no glory, so that's my story and I'm STICKIN to it
That's my story and I'm stickin to it

Luda!
On your mark, get set, put the music in the deck
And turn it up and let the system go
You done heard a lot of people in the past
But you never heard a nigga like this befo'
Ain't nobody better let the records show
If they outta order let a tec just blow
Over the border, I be in Mexico
Throwin' it up like an anorexic hoe
Anybody thinkin' like they just don't know
Tell 'em that Luda gotta electric flow
Come and see me live and I wreck a show
Sucka niggas better find the exit row
Extra cheese and the extra dough
And I'ma keep goin' till the record's broke
So if you don't mean what you say when you spit it on a track
What the FUCK YOU RAPPING FOR?
Women wanna get me and I can't say no
So I get 'em fast and I sex 'em slow
But every now and then it get hectic
They holdin' on tight to a nigga and I gotta let go
Gotta go sign on the X with O's
Wrist gotta shine and my neck just glow
It's a man's world
And all you women I just want the rest to know

And I'm as real as they come, don't ever doubt me

I'm a G! So all you hoes can eat a dick up and die
While I puff the magic dragon, heat the weed up and fly
Tuck your tail between your legs, y'all ain't made for this shit
Worth a hundred million dollars, y'all ain't paid for this shit
I'm talking Empire Building, we got Prada flows
And you're so pussy you should fit in Lady Gaga's clothes
Nobody really wanna go there with me
Nobody really wanna say my name
Nobody wanna put the pedal to the metal
And meet me up in the ghetto we can throw them thangs
When I come up the spot, in the drop top
With the Glock cocked, that'll make a nigga pop lock
Ludacris, I'mma hot shot, straight up out the block
With a knot that'll get a nigga block knocked (OH!)
Somebody tell 'em that I ain't playin' with 'em!
Put a pussy nigga 6 feet deep in the ground and you'll be layin with 'em
I just been watchin over, from my mighty throne
Y'all Roberto Duran, so just leave it alone
No Mas! No Mas!"

Shit like that, maybe because I get like that,
Kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that,
Climb like that, 'cause the world is mine like that
(Yours like that) mine like that
(Ludacris)
You can get your whole crews, even niggas that owe you
They ain't paid you shit you can drink some cold brew
And throw on them old shoes and jump in the whip
You can come and find us, be right behind us and insert the clip
You hear something that went ""clack"" ""clack"" ""clack""
Somebody went down but it wasn't us
You can settle 'bout two meals get hooked up with a good deal
Start stackin' dough you can ride your mobile
Get 20 inch big wheels and collect some hoes
Tou can even start eatin' good and smokin' good
But you pressin' your luck and you say wha'
Somebody went bankrupt shiit but it wasn't us
(Ludacris)
You can go to the drawing board just start from stratch
All over again clean
Or you can tell a bunch of officers that I'm the one to catch
But my niggas is the police
You can try to blame me or even try to frame me but I'll make bail now
Somebody goin' to jail shit but it wasn't us
You do track after track, and walls get plaque after plaque
CD's on rack after rack no moe selling sac' after sac'
You could've had that good life, good kids and a good wife
It was yours to earn but the records stores gettin' returns
Shiit but it wasn't us
(Ludacris)
You could be
Goin' on worldwide tours and see your face on every magezine
Or you can flip to channel after channel
And see that ass on the TV screen
You can pay for expensive videos
And have whole lot of big bootie hoes
But when the shit start comin' to a close
Shiiit but it wasn't us
You can use your back-up plan, even call him your back-up man
And start think'in quick
You can call on your back-up hoes, even call the back-up pros
And tell 'em to suck a dick
And you tell just to get deez
And you tell just to pay the fees
And to pay their dues, and they catchin those STD's
Shiit but it wasn't us

Glad to see your payroll came through
Oh yeah
So glad to see everyone came out this morning
We readin' from the book of Hush
Today, verse 69
Come on somebody, Come on somebody
Good to see all of you came out this morning
Even though some of you just leavin' 112
Smellin' like booty and Hennessey
Come on Courvoisier double shots
(Ha Ha) It don't matta'
Keep it on the Hush
Don't say nothin'
Ain't gonna be no talkin'
While I'm doin' my thang
I'm lovin' the way your legs go so far back
Your one of them flexible girls
I figured your daddy always said you was one of the best in this world
But never the less in this world, I'm just professional girl
I teach em' a lesson, have em' stressin', and confessin' to girls
How good it was, and how good it could be, if they just tried it
Taken' my double dosage, skip the daily dick diet
To ride it, they so excited, and can't hide it
I'm tryin' to do my thang but you gotta be quiet
Now even when I just come in our house, and cover your mouth
Because your momma's at home
You grippin' the sheets and makin' an effort not to holler and moan
You got to keep it on the hush, 'cause we in no rush
And you tellin' me it's the little thangs that mean so much
And it's an illusion thinkin' that you can match what I can do best
So if your man call, tell him to put some hair on his chest
But he don't even have to know, we keepin' it on the low
You walkin' it like a dog and stay workin' it like a pro, so
I'm'a taste your neck and begin to nibble aroun your ear lobes
Down to your bellybutton, then I'm unsnappin' your bra
Thinkin' your titties are tryin' to tell me somethin'
Hard nippes, colder than icicles
Workin' it with my tongue, you can just tell me if it tickles
Freaky deaky, kinda sneaky, Ludacris and the gang
Disturbing the peace, we runnin' the streets, and steady slangin' dem thangs
But you gotta keep the noise down, in order to keep the boy down
It's joy all around and you know how it sounds, if you just
Your thang (4x)
My thang (2x)
Your thang (6x)
Keep it on the hush (yeah, yeah, yeah...)
Look at sista Johnston in the front row with thongs on,
Your legs open tryin' to tempt me
Keep it on the hush
I'll be over there by 7 o'clock
Keep it on the hush
Shhh... hush"
88,Large Amounts,2004,The Red Light District (2004),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
(Luda speaks in the background)
(Verse One)
Now everybody wants a piece of my pockets
And it don't help when I'm screaming on these records that I'm rich
Calling people from my number now I Block it
'Cause ain't nothing worse then getting haunted by a stalkin ass bitch (oh yeah)
'Cause good game I talk it and yet you're so true some women will have you feeling blue like crips
I lay my feet upon the path and I walk it
I spread my wealth out or someone close will have me layin' in a ditch
I have my friends steal from me
Snatch my credit card and my wallet hit the town and leave outstanding bills for me
They say I got the cash for it and I can't recall one single member of my family that never
Asked for it
They've been kicking down doors and bustin' out flows
They can't get me on the phone so they surprise me at my show
And everybody needs a loan plus they say they won't blow it
All I hear ""common 'cause, you know I'm good for it"" (man)
(Verse Two)
Now don't get me wrong 'cause being rich is such a beautiful thing
But more money, more problems people drive me insane
Not giving no handouts no more so take advantage and flee
My goal's to set my friends up to make some paper like me
Put 'em in position and make their wishes come... true
So they can have multiple accounts gain interest over night
Given a million dollars, what you gone... do?
Map your life out for your kids-kids or would you spend it over night?
Now see me I'll do both I got unlimited funds
My daughters life was set before her stankin butt turned one
And it don't help that I got 4 or 5 retirement funds
So if I choose before I'm 30 I can lay in the sun
My dividends can show and prove the real meaning of fun
That's why I live by the sword but you can die by my gun
The IRS'll never sweat me or even put up a fight
'Cause I'm sure I'll pay more in taxes then you made in your life
Because...
(Verse Three)
Now women these days don't want a man without a nice pay check
So he splurge even though our lives ain't in right place yet
Buying jewellery and some cars just to impress these whores
Meanwhile you childs poor like ""daddy what you left me for?""
Yeah but it all comes back that's why I named my daughter Karma (yup)
Who's teaching me the lesson of life and making me smarter
I sweep her off her feet 'cause I'm her knight in shining armour
And I have your fucking head if anybody tries to harm her
Got to teach her about the game that most of us niggaz will spit
And about these scandalous ass women that get money through gifts
They'll suck a cold hard wood for some cold hard cash
Or ride a brother good to put a foot up on the gas
Of that brand new ride, pick up our friends
While you're slippin' she slides.
Drop top Benz gold diggers inside
Crazy what the world will do for money
Thinking that everything will be all right
'Cause...

Luda
I done killed so many niggas in the booth
I sell rappers on e-bay
Cause every one of my verses been instant like replay
Speakers get blown like candles on ya b-day
Cause Luda's catalog got more records than a DJ
Tha bank yells mayday like everyday's a payday
I put it on tape then I sell it like Ray J
But not out tha store (nope) straight to tha buyer
'Cause I slung 'em out my trunk like tha D.C Sniper
And 6 albums later you'll deposit every word
Till ya memory bank give me tha credit I deserve
Top 5 damn right but really it just hit me
That 3 of yo Top 5's too scared to fuck with me
So how can I advance if you don't give me no opponents?
How can you see tha future if you living for tha moment?
Hip-Hop couldn't die I never offered my condolences
But I offer y'all a day of atonement

Never had a holster
I keep it on my lap
And hip-hop ain't dead it just had a heart attack
But you see I keep it pumpin
Yeah I got that heart back
So just call me little carter
Or little cardiac
Precious like an artifact
Valuble like a quarterback
Hannibal like they call me Jack
Throwback like a starter hat
And now did he thought a that
I mean how did he think a that
I mean how did I think a that
Now like a rental bring it back
I mean how did I think of that
I surprise myself sometimes
Some one could throw me a surprise party for every line
Everytime I do it
I do it dity like swine
For the dirty and fine
Hip Hop I'm alive
I'm a lyricist till the death
SAndI got whatchya need
Weezy F, I'm the last of a dying breed
And we almost extinct
So I'm saying it loud
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'

Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'

They say O'Reily don't like him
Oprah wont invite him
Tha president denounced him
No one will announce him
Controversial lyrics like I'm crying for
I'm very talented but I should be ashamed of myself
But this is my art, this is my music
I'm speaking from tha heart hit record and I'll lose it
Bite my tongue for no one I'll put you on blast
So all the news channels y'all can kiss my ass
And if I dish it I can take it, fix it if you break it
Could hit rock bottom and I'm still gon make it
'Cause I'm a born hustla, natural survivor
Seed of a gangsta I put that on my father
Youtube or Google me, turn it up and play it
Cause many people think it, I jus had tha balls to say it
And risk everything, I stand for the weak
And I live for my fredom of speech cause
I'm a lyricist till the death
So I got whatchya need
Ludacris, I'm the last of a dying breed

Luda!
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody done called it quits
Shit I thought Bobby and Whitney'd stay together forever
If they made it that long; I guess the drugs weren't that strong
And now it's Russell and Kimora, even Jordan and Juanita
And to top it off, Brad left Jen for Angelina?
What the hell is goin' on in this world, this just can't be!
If Will and Jada can do it then why can't we?
Hillary's still with Bill Clinton, how do they do it?
He got his dick sucked and the whole damn WORLD knew it
Now Paul McCartney's losin half of his life
All because he got divorced from his wife
Somebody said it's cheaper to keep her, but not in K-Fed's case
Cause Britney even had to pay for K-Fed's case
Nick and Jessica, Trina and Wayne
And if you broke up wit'cha girl I know ya feelin' the pain, because
[Chorus: sample] + (Ludacris)
Everybody's breaking-breaking up
Let's stay together-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall)
Let's stay together-gether-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall, c'mon!)
Everybody's breaking-breaking up
Let's stay together-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall)
Let's stay together-gether-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall)
(Ludacris)
First it was Shaq and Kobe, then Iverson and Philly
T.O. and McNabb, even Game and 50
I guess sometimes you gotta let the past be the past
But I'd give a hundred thou' to see Jay with Dame Dash
B.G. with Lil Wayne, Juvenile and Turk
Mannie Fresh with Baby, how can we make it work?
Krunchie with Three-6, Diamond with Crime Mob
Lauren Hill with the Fugees, Remy with Terror Squad
Lil' Kim back with Cease, and Snoop with mo' Dre
Dre with mo' Big Boi, CD's with mo' play
What's Tribes with no Quest? Salt with no Pepa
Even the Eagles broke up and got the fuck back together!
Sellin millions of copies, and gettin' that cash
And Raz B said Chris Stokes was gettin' that ass
I don't even understand it, what the hell went wrong?
Maybe folks'll wise up and take heed to this song, because
(Ludacris)
I can't take it, no!
At first Wu-Tang broke up, now O.D.B. is gone
Then I'm hearin Cam'Ron don't talk to Jim Jones?
Who'da saw that shit comin'? Certainly not me
Or the Dogg Pound break up, or Goodie Mo-B
Then Shawnna almost jumped ship from D.T.P.
If Chingy left and came back then damnit, why can't she?
We gotta think it's all for one, and one for all
HIP-HOP! United we stand, divided we fall
So why is
[Chorus] - repeat to fade w/ ad libs"

I'm just going to get right to it
Luda!
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me when it come to getting lyrical
Murdering the rapper and killing beats nigga!
I'm cinematic making everybody panic
I be bustin' like a fully automatic feel the heat nigga!
We can battle in the Phantom in Atlanta the rover in Minnesota or the Arizona streets nigga
They sayin' all these offensive lines I snapback it's the quarterback sneak nigga!
One time for the sneak dissers Ol' puss ass fuckboys say my name!
Anybody coming at me know I never back down killing a rapper is my claim to fame!
You lame
And my flow is what expose in these hoes even on a nigga worst day
They say Luda don't want it no mo'
No nigger I'm as hungry as the first day
What you want how you want it you can get I'm the definition of a real g from the south side
The crime scene be the studio get the yellow tape and the chalk and I'm leaving everybody outline
I'm all about mine
Getting paid getting laid getting clothes getting hoes getting green back
Used be like everybody is a lil kid now Big Boy, outcast like three stacks
Laying all it in the Cadillac with a red bone giving me dome my music on with the seats back
Ludacris this is album number 8 and my pockets gonna be straight
Even if a nigga leak that
Timmy all up on the David Banner track with Janet Jack in the back like ""Damn Luda freak that!""
Break it down like you dropping to the ground but we like the 808 in Atlanta so bring the beat back
Sample had to eat that
Couldn't control all of the leader
But put any other rapper on the track and I guarantee they'll never know how to treat that
I'm a boss I'm a king I'm a legend Imma drill it in your head till you dose off
And I just so happen to be the type of rapper that make your women want to take her clothes off
So let's get to the action
Let's get to the show
I'm been getting to the Forbes list six year straight let's get to the do'
Shout out to the Luda Nation
All my fans just got live
And they waitin' for everybody to put me in the rapper category of ya top five
Let me get it back
Ever since I
Came in the game it ain't never been the same
Can't nobody do it like me
Is it ever gonna be another Luda you know that'll never happen that's highly unlikely
Knowing that I'm better than everybody you put me up against I'm in the hall of fame
So fuck call to call we can go bar for bar I'll put your name up on the wall of shame
And everyday is the same thing
Looking for another way for me to make paper
I think it's time for every single rapper to go to church
Whoever is my opponent you better pray first
They like ""Luda why you rapping so fast?""
I'm like ""Bitch why you listen too slow?""
I'm the truth in the booth and they can't keep up hardly 'cause I always hit 'em with a new flow
And the two door with the coup low with the Hublot off the window with the two low blades
From the top like judo listening to bruno on the way to school though getting kudos from a few hoes and they from the choose though
'Cause I'm numero uno and the crew know it's a couple loop holes when it come to fluke hoes 'cause some of they pussy bite like kujo
But back to the you know who
I can't stop till you tell me I'm the greatest
If you need a reminder then put the whole song on repeat and continue to play this
Better turn your stereo louder
Listen up and let me preach
And let's get arrested for disturbing the peace"

Whatever happened to approaching them?
Looking at 'em eye to eye
Too much tweefin' going on in this world
Thumb thuggin' is at an all-time high
They startin' to take this shit a lil too far Jack
Rappers all in they feelings
Well here goes a little lyrical healing
And hip hop is, uh
Too many rappers gettin' sensitive
Y'all should start a pussy ass nigga initiative
'Cause even when I'm not mic'd up
I'll fuck your life up
Come to your show when ya crowdsurfin' and hold a knife up
I tell your momma you ain't shit
I hope you skydive and all land in an alligator pit
Your album ain't shit, you couldn't sell it at an auction
Your five minutes is up, like Antoine Dodson
Meanwhile that Mary Jane got me wiser
And Mr. Jack Daniels is my spiritual advisor
Now everybody said I'm strapped and I'm too scary
And keep a hand under the pillow like the tooth fairy
Your favorite rapper say I'm sick and they ain't no antidote
They kidnapping my flows they ain't even leave a ransom note
Your shit is faker than the knockoff man
I'll make you niggas quit rappin' start a hot dog stand"

Here I am, yep, yep, I'm the m-man... word
Here I am, yep, I'm the m-m-man... word
DTP's about that bomb shit
When Premier puts the needle on the record then I put it on blaast,
Your flow is garbage, I throw it in the trash,
I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit,
Rewind the verse, make the track do a back flip,
Your speakers poppin' on a handstand,
They sneakk dissin' niggas, throwin' little jabs like Bam-Bam,
And I'm a bad man,
They amatures like at Apollo, I wipe 'em off the stage like Sandman,
Damn man, what the hell you smokin' on,
It's Ludacris I got more cheese than Provalon,
And the chrome is home, so I'm never home alone,
And only keep friends with 2-X chromosomes,
So I command all these rappers: ""Put the mic down!"",
Throw a grenade in your mouth ""Nigga, bite down!"",
'Cause I'm back with Premo on the track,
Takin' it to the essence, showin' niggas how to rap
Here I am, yep, I'm I'm I'm I I'm the man... word
Here I am, yep, yep, I'm the m-man... word
Here I am, yep, I'm the m-m-man... word

Still hungry as the day I began
I heat the booth up so much the engineer caught a muthafuckin' tan,
I'm the truth, when it comes to it,
I hold Hip Hop for hostage, since 2000 I put a gun to it,
And I run through it, like a jamaican boat,
And everyday is a vacation on jamaican smoke,
Charge your whole block,
Talk shit, they hear the four pop,
""One, Two!"" and it don't stop,
And my deliveries invaded your vicinity, Hennesy is my remedy, takin' shots like Kennedy,
And I've been a G, for a long time,
To these streets I'm connected like I'm online,
On time for whatever,
And every time and album drop, I drop big like Voletta,
I'm ahead of the competition, they wishin' I just fade off,
My career for your life, let's trade off
Here I am, yep, I'm I'm I'm I I'm the man... word
Here I am, yep, yep, I'm the m-man... word
Here I am, yep, I'm the m-m-man... word
DTP's about that bomb shit
8 years in the game, ain't a damn thang change,
So I brought it back to one of the tracks, so where the damn thang came,
And he goin' down in history, 'cause he don't sleep,
And he the first southern rapper on a Premo beat,
I ate the kick and the snare,
The samples always taste fine,
And I shoot a hot sixteen from the baseline,
I'm on point like CP3,
And I'll be goin' down in rap as the MVP
Here I am, yep, I'm I'm I'm I I'm the man... word

Sounding like you made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad fo, hah?

Time to start putting grown-ass men on time out
Go to the corner and cry somewhere man
Old insecure ass nigga
Your heart pump Kool-Aid man
What you mad at me for
Is it 'cause I got houses on every coast
Or that I'm on that Forbes list making rich rappers look broke
While they're blowing that smoke
I'm blowing a couple million
Making a killing stunting on impostors
Only rapper in the game with a Grammy and an Oscar
7-figure movie deals, 8 figure bank runs
And I'm still feeding the same hood that I came from
Any car that you got I've altready drove
Any chick that you hit, nigga I've already ho'd
Say it with your chest like these diamonds on my tongue
Name on my headphones, label tatted on my arm
Air traffic control say ""Ludacris is insane""
That niggas daughter's birthday's the tail number on his plane
Fuck with me but nobody's fucking with me
Take in the sight of my cognac, more millions
Real G's chug it with me
If I'm happy there's no reason you should be sad for
So will somebody, can somebody please...

Is you niggas hating 'cause you mad
Or is you mad 'cause you hating?
Choose one, hater
Now if these niggas hating on me I'm a kill them dead
If I wasn't rapping I'd be probably be in the fifth
In the cell, getting mail, with a million dollar bail
But instead of counting blues, I'm a take this YSL
And this Gucci, and this Louis, Prada 'cause I'm hotter
I used to ball in Philly, with that nina and get dollars
I beefs up in my Bimmer, check aboard my collar
And when I check my bank account
I'm checking for them commas
I'm like all these niggas haters, all these bitches fucking
At 24 I went and bought a Ghost like it was nothing
At 25 I bought that Aston Martin, now we stunting
And you nigga still talking all this money shit you bluffing
You bluffing, you bluffing, I really think you bluffing
100, 000 dollars man them bottles we just crush 'em
Now tell me why you hating? You hating 'cause you mad?

Mad 'cause I'm gonna keep it real with a real nigga
I got racks on racks, and a black Maybach
Call it black on black, 'cause I kill niggas
In the club all girls, no niggas don't talk to me
'Cause I ain't really trynna hear niggas
In the coupe it's the truth
And the roof go poof, vamoose
I can make it disappear nigga
See this the type of shit that I be saying
Just because I'm balling, that don't mean a nigga playing
Haters can blow me like a fan
Flyer than a bitch, I don't think I'm a ever land
But in the meantime, baby what's your plan
You can call me daddy but I can't be your man
Fiending like the addicts, when I pull it out they panic
Bitch I do damage, you gonna need an ambulance
Tell me what they mad fo

That's mad at you right now for no reason
Riding around in my jeep
Bumping that 2pac
I'm walking around in my hood
Cocked back two glocks

I came back I'm the baddest
Christian's on my feet
I told you I'm the baddest
All the way in Paris
Don't talk you'll get embarrassed
My watch is fucking nice
Yeah you get embarrassed
500 on them racks,

Yuck!
Hey Luda, you know why these haters mad fo right?
The truth shall set you free
If you sellin' all the records and you fuckin' all the bitches
And you sit a top of the charts and you livin' out your wishes
With your chains all smothered and your watches all glittered
And your ghost and your phantoms all comin' home to visit
Or maybe cause your bitches was never really your bitches
With your baby mama fucking every rapper in the business
Niggas saying you was better when the drugs was in your system
Now your crack swag gone ever since you came from prison
Got you tweeting all stupid, is you skatin', is you dissin'
Found out your Ghost leased and your Phantom just rented
Won't need it in your name like Pac when he went missing
Makaveli lives on so I'm riding on you bitches
Hail Mary be the witness, Lord Willin' I was dealing
Stupid motherfucking five star, tatted on his ceiling
Bullseye, be that motherfucking target for this killing
Ain't y'all the motherfuckers with the millions?
Tell me what they mad fo
Come around the hood
See us sitting there looking good
Tell me what they mad fo
Cause you be on the radio

Ooh, hey yeah
Do you know how to leave, ride... ride
Ya see, it started off in St. Paul from the street of Old Nash
And it feels so good to escape and just kick it and laugh
My clan had to bring the ruckus 'cause we had the cream
All you can eat over at Ryan's or some fish at Gaseen's
And I had to fix a good bag and make decisions and haste
Cause soul food ain't the motherfuckin' thang to waste
So let's get looney up on the set 'cause I got five on the fire
Will slide to East Point and make our way to Black Rirer
Lookin' like Outkast on the spot smokin' blunts and
Hit the liquor store got up, got out and got something
That eightball, so I can do some space age pimpin'
My blood stay young off 45's Colt and chicken
Camels and Rolls filled with d's and Vogues
And playas mackin' them hoes, in dyke clothes
Comin' up slammin' Caddy doors
In Southwest, we'll take it to yo chest
And we got it locked like some niggas on house arrest
'Cause we ridin'
(Chorus: Chimere)
Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, riiide
Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, riiide
It's just one of those days when I can kick it like this and like that
It's a free day, my folks got rowdy way back
I right off of Cascade or Ralph David Abernathy
I shall proceed and continue to keep my roots nappy
Cause afros in all seasons, they keep me warm
Some livin' that thug life so how long will they mourn
I still ride, that's why I bounce my way to bank-bed
I'm so bad that I'll knock you out, that's what my mama said
Sippin' on brandy, sunny days with my best friends
Today you see and then you cruise through the West end
They should've said it was Six Flags Over Georgia
Then underground, my Tuesdays would be packed when I got older
If I told you one, I told ya ass a thousand times
I got em' all in check when it comes to bustin' rhymes
Don't sweat the technique 'cause I just move the crowd
My mob's deep of alcoholics, people label us loud because we ride
See I felt my bones jump as I crossed the road
I heard the squad was wiped up so I flipped my mode
On my way to D-E-C, baby can't you see
That Decatur is totally to B-I-G for thee
Lost Boyz ridin' around in Jeeps, Lex Luth's, and Beamers
Yo cars get scooped just like Regina carpet cleaners
It's Stone Mountain Cats puttin' it down
They played Kurupt so I just gave all my dogs a pound
Now my conflict was crucial off some hay I smoked
I should be gettin' it cause life is too got damn short
And now my mind's playin' tricks and my boys actin' ghetto
Back to the C-P, I put the pedal to the metal
God bless the child that's just got his own
Since I was a juvenile makin' cash money at home
I'm from a boy to a man, I've reached the end of my road
It's Ludacris signin' off till the next episode, let's ride
'Cause it's the A-T-L
Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
We get the cash and the ass then bail
We leave a trace but never leave a trail
Say it again
Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
We get the cash and the ass then bail
We leave a trace but never leave a trail

Takin' trips back and forth from here to the Bahamas

Double Dragon, mixed up with an Abobo
I kill villains in slowmo for talkin' crazy in my Dojo
Got nothin' to lose, like I'm a boxcar Hobo

Can't get no new clothes, I wore the same tennis shoes
But now the game's changed, I'm all about the hustle
Man even hogan knows best, I'm all about the muscle
I'm all about my team, I'm all about my green
I'm 'bout supply and demand, I'm 'bout serve the fiend
And I'm a workin' dream, I keep the circuit clean

Checks all my vitals like a doc's supposed ta
All white coat, all white heels
And nothin' underneath so it's an all night deal
I'm her number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her vitamin D
But wait! I got a lawyer girl that's so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
Said she needs some evidence, and to show her the PROOF
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth!
'Cause I'm hung like a jury (jury)
Judge Luda preside over your body and I'm never in a hurry
You may proceed, let the games begin
And if I call a mistrial we gotta do it again

Never - see movies, don't like them actors
That's just what I go after, that's what I need
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-IIII-I be buggin
'Cause all these fakes thugs is tryna press up
I need a boss like HEY! Who's flossin like HEY!
Tossin' dough like HEY! You know that he'll PAY!

(Verse Two)
Stop it - anything I want I cop it
I just - want somebody to get fly wit
I got - what I need, but can you top it?
Yes - I'm a hot chick, somebody you can ride wit
Got hips - all the boys want me to drop it
So thick - niggaz be buggin, I own it
I may - be young, but I know what I want
If you show me baby, you can get on
So come on
That's just one of the things, I, need
Only one I'm pleas-ing, is, me
Unpredictable, yeah, that's, me
I can't help it, that's so sex-y
(Ludacris)
I'm the number one hustler of the century, s-s-see me in your dreams
I'm the boss of all bosses, k-k-king of all kings
I'm your favorite rapper's idol, I BEEN had the title!
Call me hot sixteen wit more verses than the Bible
Fifteen bank accounts, ten different bi'nesses
Five different lawyers, tell 'em what the bi'ness is
I live down the block, was raised up the street
Want beef? I'll do like summertime and raise up the heat!
I'm the leader of the pack, plus I'm STILL in the slums
Man I was ""Built Ford Tough"", I'm as real as they come!
But fake thugs love to hate, some punks be ice grillin' me
'Cause I g-g-got assets, no liabilities
Now to infinity, grown women be feelin' me
And they ain't got nuttin to lose but they virginity
Still the Lova Lova, so give me a couple rubbers
I'll get 'em in a room, and Luda will make 'em stutter like..."

And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
Long days half sober nights
Unsigned performing at every open mic
God is all I needed to believe in me
Haters I tune them out they were on another frequency
My mama never winded my decision
And all the bright lights never blinded out my vision
Music was my passion and my first crush
I'm just tryna ride the waves baby surfs up
When I'm down music gets me worked up
Plus in all my shows it gets womans to pull they skirts up
What can I say I'm turnt up
I'm on fire these other rappers is burnt up
If you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from me
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
Yeah what an imagination
I'm a dreamer losing my concentration
Head in the clouds to trace my observations
Just connect the dots to all of the constellations
Looking for signs that's astrological
And I don't dream big my dreams are astronomical
So when critics write articles of my chronicles
I wonder if my hunger is felt and they abdominal
Hiding from life daily distraction
Where thoughts become things from the power of attraction
And I'm attracted to money and beautiful woman
Ha and toasting to new beginnings, yeah
If you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from me
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
Look it's not long till the fights over
The turbulence is non stop till the flights over
So when passengers panic just stay silent
And realize it's never too late to become the pilot
I fly higher take control of my destiny
The first step I needed me to invest in me
Its still an every day struggle for wealth
I'd rather struggle to working for me than working for someone else
And I'm steady tryna ease the stress
So I open up all the doors with the key to success
If it hasn't been done then I'mma do it first
'Cause I'm the master of the Ludaverse
If you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from me
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them

It gets meaner and meaner each time baby
Feelin' real good too (holla at 'em man) What up Uncle 'Face!
(Yeah)
I'm a bull in this industry man (tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout right? Look
I'm never going nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me
Respected highly, HIIII MR. O'REILLY
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of my Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded rapping harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)

Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell them holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later until these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin' so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
'Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)

Keep it going it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot!
Causing lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""
Stay on the track, hit the ground running like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ah, boys and girls
Ludacris sit down and take over the whole world!
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)

Ludacris it's your year baby
This goes out to my father, who is in critical condition right now
I appreciate your prayers
Mr. Wayne Bridges
I love you
Rest in peace Wayne Bridges
You're still living through me
Listen!
Look, I lost my father to the bottle
I'd hug him everyday like I might not see him tomorrow
Got a little sorrow for a lifetime
'Cause when he was living I'm thinking how do I get him to listen
When he was seldom in his right mind
My early years I was too young to understand
But I remember the smell of beer and seeing all the empty cans
Waking up, crying in the night, hearing arguments
Hands off my momma, somehow I knew he was the cause of it
Got a little older and he got a little worse
Drinking must be his remedy, he got a little cursed
Well, tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his pops
The beat goes on, but the drinking's gotta stop!
If I had have know I wouldn't see you tomorrow
I would've had you hold to your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey
But now you got me drunk out that pain, gone after sorrow
Wishing every day you were here with me
But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle
Ooh oh oh
Yeah, I lost my father to the bottle
Function and alcoholics what they call it far as I know
Became a teenager and started to understand
But even through drinks he still taught me to be a man
So before the hospital, when the paramedics rest him
He knew that everybody who met him, instantly loved him
I run the con concerts? Would have made him even sicker
'Cause who gon' tell him he can't drink none of his son's liquor
And tell me without my father how am I supposed to manage?!
He had the biggest heart, but also had that liver damage
Tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his paps
The beat goes on, but the drinking' gotta stop!
If I had have know I wouldn't see you tomorrow
I would've had you hold to your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey
But now you got me drunk out that pain, gone after sorrow
Wishing every day you were here with me
But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle
Ooh oh oh
Not a day goes by that I don't miss ya, and don't wish you were here with me
No matter what you did, I forgive you!
I lost my father to the bottle
Tell your parents you love 'em
You might not see them tomorrow!
I swallow my pride, try to put my problems aside
But I feel so hollow inside
Gotta keep my eyes on the prize
'Cause I'm steady wishing you were here
To see the goals that I plan to reach
You left the day after I put you into my Grammy speech
It's almost like you waited just to see me win
Well, pops I can't wait until the day we meet!
If I had have know I wouldn't see you tomorrow
I would've had you hold to your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey
But now you got me drunk out that pain, gone after sorrow
Wishing every day you were here with me
But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle
Ooh oh oh
I can't get over you you you, hey
Love in a bottle, hey hey
Oh, I miss you!
I wanna see you tomorrow
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you tomorrow
I miss you, you you you you
I love you, you you you"

(Ludacris:)
It was Friday night and I was feelin' aight (Yep)
Downtown Atlanta, big city, bright lights
Mixin' Henney wit the Sprite while I'm drinkin' and drivin'
No police lights, no police sirens
I'm headed to the club, lookin' fo' a freak
To spread a lil' love and spread a couple cheeks
Pull up to the spot, 26's like bam
Eyes on me like ""Bitch, do you see him?""
Stroll through the front door, headed to the VIP
Bought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips
Scopin' out the room and what do I see?
A nice round ass and a pair of double D's
So I crept up like ""Shawty, what's happen'n?
You kilin' that dress and I love it wit' a passion""
Then she turned around and her face was aight
She had a gap tooth and mean overbite
But I was like hmm...
(T-Pain:)
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
Is that what you wanna do, shawty?
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
You too
(Ludacris:)
Woke up the next mornin' and all I can remember
Was takin' shots and tippin' the bartender
Surrender to the woman, end up bringin' me home
Cause' she started lookin' better every shot of Patron (Yep)
I jumped up wit a devilish grin
Cause' tonight damn right! I might do it again
So I called up the homies (What up?)
Let's ride, we can hit the sportsbar
Over on the South side
Get a couple of Coronas, couple of limes
Went up to the bar, saw a couple of dimes
So I, slowly walked up an said ""Hi""
My name is Ludacris and I'm a hell of a guy
One said ""I know who you are, I'm your #1 fan
And right now it's too bad I got a man""
And I said ""I understand, but where the hell is he at?
Cause in a minute if he don't show up then man...""
(T-Pain:)
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
Is that what you wanna do, shawty?
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
You too
(Ludacris:)
Uh huh
Ay Pain, holla at 'em right quick man
(T-Pain:)
You gon' get in trouble wit yo' man, girl
(Don't get in trouble, girl)
Talkin' 'bout how you're my biggest fan, girl
(I know it, I know it)
Now I don't wanna do
(Please)
What you gon' make me do
(Don't make me do it, don't make me do it)
But... if I have one more drink...
(Ludacris:)
One more drink I'm a get cha
Home, then I'll split cha
Grab the camera phone
And take a buncha drunk pictures
Cause' Hennessy mixed wit a whole bunch of Buddha
Equals you mixed wit a whole bunch of Luda
And you know how far one drink could go
Start slurrin' my speech, slowin' up the flow
Hikin' up yo' skirt, climbin' up yo' shirt
It's Mr. Late Night Luda and I like to flirt
So guess what babygirl?
(T-Pain:)
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
(Just one mo')
Is that what you wanna do, shawty?
(That's all it's gonna take)
If I take one more drink
(Hey)
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
(Haha, who else T-Pain?)
You too
(Ludacris:)
You hear what I'm sayin'?
People too picky these days, damn it
Too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny
Have a couple of drinks and quit discriminating
This is been a Luda Service Announcement...
Deuces...

I'm from the A, I came to party till I pass out!
So if you with me and you tipsy throw your fist up!
If you got diamonds and they shinin throw your wrist up!

Hey hey
It's Luda Luda get it right I'm Mr. Money Machine
And I'm steady lookin' for two women I can come in between
You can catch me chillin' up in the cut but I'm always ready for ac-tion
I'm stunt, like Jackie Chan and lay low, like Reebie Jack-son
Ma-xin and real-xin, haters, do they really wanna test me mannnn
I got an arsenal waitin, do they really wanna catch me mannnn
No, I, don't, think, so
I've, got killers on the pay-roll if there's a, problem then say-so
I, make dough until there's none left
I run with plenty gangs that's holdin' thangs
And rearrange your frame in one breath
So to keep on breathin I suggest you take this beatin'
'Tis the season for bleedin and we've been lookin' for a reason

Hey hey
Come holla at me, I'm a star, I got the hood on smash
You know me! My whole car smell like a woodshop class
I point 'em out like her, her, that girl with the mouth
Plus you and your friends
Let me show you some whips that don't come out till the year of 2010
So I'm flockin 'em in, till the droptop is rockin' again
Boy I got it locked, if you think not, then you'll get popped in the chin
And I'm clockin these ends, my record sales are blockin 'em in
Gotta thank those blessed to walk the streets to those that's locked in the pen
My entourage is game faces, mean muggin, mean muggin
Now the media is convinced that we thuggin', we thuggin'
Momma told me grow up to be somethin', be somethin'
I went diamond with this album so we buckin, we buckin

I'm so far ahead it's only RIGHT for you to hate on me mayne
When I'm pushin 90 by myself up in the H.O.B. lane
They tryin' to figure how many mo' women that I can take on my plane
Bein one of the few rappers responsible for changin the game
Now desperate artists tryin' to sue but they just makin' some claims
Can't get in the spotlight for NOTHIN' and it just makes 'em insane
That's why some of the niggaz resort right back to bakin that 'caine
And sellin it off to junky monkeys who keep bakin they brain
As they grow older they'll be feelin' a lot of achin and pain
So right at the head they might as well just be aimin that thang
And you ain't helpin the process out by always cakin these dames
But it is hard givin' up the place where they be shakin they thangs"

Getty up Getty up right on to the real
And death to the fake
And tell your boyfriend just to chill
Don t player hate
Kick back relax and just take off yo shoes
While I kinda tell you what's I want to do
Let me touch it (Let me touch it)
Let me feel it (Let me feel it)
Let me grab it (Let me grab it)
That phat rabbit (That phat rabbit)
Fatter than fat
Fat like a dub sack
Showin 'em where that loves at
So open up yo eyes and get a surprise like
In Cracker jacks
Pooh Nan Don Happy
Giving up that nappy dugout
Get the cut up then I cut out

And it's always in the back of my mind
Whatever the place whatever the time
Even in college park after dark

Closer than close
Closer than most then I'm all up in ya
For beginners give me a thigh, breast and leg

And let dinner be served

Kick back relax and just take off yo shoes

Reminisce like Mary
I got to pop that cherry
Kind of like that coochie
You wanna be my hoochie
Better than my adversary
Don t be so scary
I never thought that you could act up
Make a nigga wanna back up
Keep it tight for the night
While I wet this track up
So we can slip and slide
Make you wanna dip and dive
Trippin' while we rip and ride
Till I get you to come inside
Got you where I want your ass
In the case of an emergency brake the glass
Keep yo eyes on the present
And erase the past
And be happy if we got more blunts to pass
Get done up and run up
In the guts of ya butt
Don t shake like it used to
I wake 'em up like a rooster
Take it slow not fast
In a turbo buster
No worry
No hurry
No pain no gain
Better keep yo eyes on strain
Cause ain't a damn thing changed maine
Sit back relax and just take off yo shoes
While I gotta tell you what I wants to do

With a slot in the president's iPod, Obama shouted him
Said I handled my biz and I'm one of his favorite rappers
Well, give luda a special pardon if I'm ever in the slammer
Better yet, put me in office. Make me your vice president
Hillary hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant
Now Jesse talking slick and apologizing for what
If you said it then you meant it how you want it have a gut
And all you other politicians tryin' ta hate on my man
Watch us win majority vote in every state on the map
You can't stop what's about to happen
We're about to make history
The first black president, it's destined and it's meant to be
The threats ain't fazing us, the nooses or the chokes
Get off your ass, black people, it's time to get out and vote
Paint the white house black and I'm sure that's got them terrified
McCain don't belong in any chair unless he's paralyzed
Yeah I said it cause Bush is mentally handicapped
Bottle up all his speeches and just throw them like candy wraps

119,Problems,2015,Ludaversal (2015),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"They say ""Luda, would you rather have the money or the fame?"" and I steady try to tell 'em that it all just depends
'Cause every time I make a little more money I seem to be losin' more of my friends
So I'd give it all up to repeat life over and they'd say ""Dude is a fool""
I can't trust another motherfucker livin' in this world and this really got me losin' my cool
What would you'd do if you were in my situation and the minute everyone you ever loved to say you looked up?
You drink your pain to the bottom of a bottle and the Conjure would have you fucked up
So I'm lookin' for love in all the wrong places, pop pills, drink liquor by the cases
Get high, make a woman get low, in the strip club lookin' for familiar faces
People know me on a first name basis but all they ever really want's my cash
""Let me borrow just a couple hundred dollars and you know that I'm a pay you back"", my ass
This world so superficial, this world done lost my trust
They say ""Ludacris, you changin'"" but I really don't give a fuck!
What the hell am I suppose to think? What the hell am I suppose to do?
I'm hearin' that the Devil's in disguise and I'm hearin' that the nigga look just like you
They know I walk throw the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I don't go astray
And I get down on my knees and pray and I say
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
Wish my problems would go away, away, away
Doc say I need to change my diet, 'cause I really not eatin' right
Mama said I need some peace and quite, 'cause I'm really not sleepin' right
What's the use of havin' all the money and the power in the world if I can't abuse it?
Seems like the, only thing that's, keepin' me together is my music
If it wasn't for that I think I would lose it; if it wasn't for that I would go crazy
When nobody went good on they word and the industry'd make you feel like fuck you pay me
'Cause I gotta feed family, some of the same ones that abandoned me
That still lookin' for a hand out till you found out that there ain't shit ya handed me
Hah, still mad at me? But I'm tryin' to be the man I plan to be
But can't do it if you callin' me for dumb shit, thinkin' I'm innocent, I'ma plea insanity (oh!)
Too many distractions, and it feels like everyday
So I get down on my knees and pray and I say
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
Wish my problems would go away, away, away
I finally made it to the top of the CEO position
But when things don't go their way, these artists got all these suspicions
So the weed keep me at peace and I think I need an intervention
Who the fuck put me in charge of makin' all of these decisions?
My position got me stressin' like it never did before
Not to mention my best friend drowned and Death was knockin' at his door
And it seems like someone in my family is passin' away like everyday
So I just look up to the sky and get on my knees and pray and I SAY!
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
Wish my problems would go away, away, away"

Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)

Let it rush through your veins, 'cause I'ma be the one
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they C-note stacks
Bustin' dominoes, spades, cee-lo, craps
We shootin pool at the Luda-plex; I slap a hundred on the table
Just to see if any fools wanna do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anything that you wanna do
But come up short and OH THE THANGS that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel 'cause I'm makin' 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase - scared money don't make none!
(Ludacris)
Throw some money on the books, 'cause I know how to call 'em
Somebody tell my fam I got a gamblin problem
I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's
Drug away by the COPS, or when I'm blowin' steam
Countin' green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
All my people bring the strength to the block
Yessir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's gon' do it
It's people livin' they LIFE comin' up off change
And hustlers payin' they bills comin' up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate; catch me out in A.C.
Callin yo' bluff with Puff eatin cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers
(Ludacris)
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips
Breakin the whole casino and doin' backflips, man
Cameras eyein us, sidebetters tryin' us
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buyin us
Tryin' to get me off my grind, but it won't work
'Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
I'm still breakin 'em, and dice still shakin 'em
I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em"

Wanna make an album, that's all.

It's an everyday struggle
Trying to get out
Trying to get out
Trying to make it
Check this out nigga
What
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking it ain't no dough
So I don't wanna look no mo what
(Repeat)
I need to get away to another day or place in time
And find where reality can ease my mind
And shine on me like the sons of the earth
For what it's worth my turf is ruff and rugged so I gave birth
To a dream where cream lies between
All the dirt and the gravel so I battle to achieve my green
And still try to move forward at a steady pace
Cause bad luck is interfering with my paper chase
So I erase the crime lies and sad cries
Wit sore eyes and keep mines on the uprise
But it don't work 'cause I'm steady getting jerked
By my neighborhood up to no good where bad niggas lurk
The urk me leaving effects that's too negative
So Ludacris is looking for a better place to live
And I can't stand it it's really got me buggin
It's like I'm in the war and I just keep on tuggin 'cause I'm
I try to find a way outta this maze
It's got me crazed I'm in a daze
So many ways to boost into a different phase
But I can't think I can't do nothing
You think I'm fronting
You hear me grunting
Lord you ain't even saying nuttin
I need some currency before there's an emergency
Forget crimes I won't let my mind get the best of me
It's not gone happen I'm trapped in two worlds
On one side I see diamonds on the other I see pearls
It's a whirlwind disaster with two damn sides
So I'm gone with the wind and come right back with the tide
'Cause I keep my eyes on the skies and my head in the clouds
And when my mouth is shut up it makes my thoughts get loud
It's like a crowd in a stadium
Mils I be craving em
Money making schemes locked up in my cranium
'Cause I need outta this critical situation
My mind's in jail I don't know the time that it's facing I'm
I'm sick of knockin' I'm sick of clocking
I'm sick of droppin' in a hole never reaching my goal
It's got my soul separated into pieces
It just increases
I'm hit wit anger like a cooked tit wit hot greases
So if you understood my attitude
Maybe you feel what I'm feeling
And then it start appealing
To ya intellect and aspect of dreams and aspirations
Death by temptations even got my heart basting
So I'm tracing the line where I can find a better path
And make it last sit back and laugh before the aftermath
The tragic flaw is what makes it raw
So let it fall and I'll get through it even if I have to crawl
My way, I see the sun and there's no delay
And I'ma pray cause the lord will make a brighter day
Or will he keep me in his holding cell
But enough wit the questions the only story to tell
Is that I'm"

Now little Lisa is only 9 years old
She's tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all all alone and they never met her family
Mamas always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listenin'
Mama is on drugs gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with laughs--usually endin' in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mamas knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.

Catch you night time and then brighten your day
Shots at your head, they don't like what you say
Coroners coming to wipe you away
Thangs can get jiggy here right with tha K?
Wherever you standing, that's right where you lay
Y'all niggas run yo mouth just like a bunch of bitches
Pussy niggas talking just like a bunch of snitches
Lord be my witness, I ask for forgiveness
But if these pussy niggas keep running they mouth, I'ma give them the bidness
Heard you pussy ass niggas talking about me when I'm not around

So I told the other nigga, go tell the other nigga, move out of town

Zig zags and golden wraps got my mind gone,
Drugs don't affect my work I still get my grind on.

And if you wanna pass the sobriety and breathalyzer test,
Heres a quick Luda tip, some packets of mustard in your car
Keep mustard god damn it, and whoever said the south can't rhyme,"
133,Secret Song,2008,The Preview (2008),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"(Chorus: Corey Hart)
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can - so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can - so I can
(Two chains.)
(Tity Boi)
I am wearin' my sunglasses, I'm feelin' fantastic
I'm blowin' on that [?] watchin' a plasma, what have you
And shorty layin' in my lap, then she sit up in my lap
Tried to take my glasses off, I'm like uh-uh-uh- none of that
[?] Wit' a hun'ed packs [?] wit' a hun'ed stacks
I'm ridin' in a fancy car with twenty-somethin's on a that
Yeah you gotta honor that, 'cause you know we runnin' it
I'm a fuckin' soldier, that make my kid a' army-brat
Ain't no need o' stallin', when you call we ain't callin' back
Yeah we want that product, when we rob you we'll take all o' that
Yeah, my sunglasses on, it keep my face [?]
See, when her sunglasses on, yeah that's her make-up
With tinted frames on my eyelids look what I did
I drive with no gasoline like a hybrid
I'm high bitch, I'm on it ho
Seven-five-oh on two-eighty-five, peddle on the flo'
Metal in my car, I fell in love with dough
It's all about that money, that's all you need to know
I can't explain it, I don't know what you drinkin'
See all I care about is pussy, weed, and Ben Franklins
(Aphilliates, nigga. Pay attention, biatch!)
(Chorus: Corey Hart)
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can - so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can - so I can
(Tell these motherfuckers how I do it. Luda!)
(Ludacris)
I wear my sunglasses at night-time, never in my right mind
Pushin', peddlin' then movin' that gwop right through that pipeline
Money money's what I see an' money money's what I be in
Freshly dipped from head to toe, flew to Cabo just for the weekend
Bitch, that's just how I do it; Oh bitch, I get right to it
Sippin' on some Golden Grain, but my niggas we call it embalmin' fluid
Put a bomb in your mamma's house, put a bomb in your bitch's bed
Meanwhile over on the southside, Ludacris is gettin' head
I'm on that foolish shit, only got one life to live
I'm shootin' pool wi' Tit, only got five thou' to give
Till I stop tellin' Tit to rack 'em, then we shoot them dice 'n' clack 'em
Later on that night on the southside, we got some bitches and macked 'em
Right down to their bare-essentials, don't mess wit' 'em on their menstruals
Don't test us like that bitch - get a number two fuckin' pencil
You must be out your noggin, better make the right decision
I wear my sunglasses at night 'cause they got x-ray vision
(Chorus: Corey Hart)
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can - so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can - so I can"

That waist got a swivel to it
But that ass a Cali earthquake jiggle to it
She a stallion, no horseshit
You could fit that bitch's booty on a forklift
Beep! Beep! Bitch back it up
I put my balls on the table, tell her rack 'em up
Vanilla bed sheets, chocolate laid one way
Sprinkle my nuts on top - what a sundae, hey
Whipped cream cherry on top
And when I ain't wit' her, pussy on lock
Throw away the key, it's a rap bitch!
Large shake and a Ludacris sandwich
Yo, mama turned out, she so popular
You suckers can't see her with binoculars
She'll suck your pocket dry like Dracula
Her last boyfriend bought her an Acura
Don't try to get all attached to her
She an alley-cat type - that chick'll scratch you up
Like Bel Biv DeVoe said, ""She's dangerous""
Her old man used to snort angel dust
So, don't be quick to judge, shorty bad as fuck
She's the type that drive back with the bricks for bucks
She had a ballplayer dude but she fucked him up
He bankrupt, selling cars like an auctioner
It's Gucci
I've got a sausage for them hot cakes
And I be fuckin' while you niggas out on hot dates
You all polite and open doors for her
While every night I put that blanket on the floor for her
These hoes be sprintin' like it's track 'n' field
Because this supersize dick is their Happy Meal
So for an extra value woody
Put this Big Mac into that Quarter-Pound pussy, yes!
It's Ludacris ""Mr. Slay-A-Bitch""
Unless that p-ssy is smelling like a Filet-O-Fish
Shoo Fly, ho! Kick the bucket
And niggas talking shit I bust 'em in their chicken nugget"

Perpatraitors can suck dick
I tried ta tell them
But dey don' wanna listen
I tried ta shine em
But dey don' wanna glisten
While the hot head keeps on tickin
And the kick drum peep I'm pumpin I'm dumpin
On da coast is fools
'Cause rules was made to b broken
But you can't make broken rules
Hear wut I'm sayin' or heard wut I said
Hear wut they playin'
'Cause through this music ima still be hurr if I'm dead
Call yo producers 'cause I'm hurtin' deese beats

142,Southern Gangsta,2008,Theater of the Mind (2008),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"(Intro: Ving Rhames)
He's a hustler, unbound by law
A self-made, millionaire
With a wreckless disregard, for the haters
Ludacris, on ""Southern Gangsta""...
A true, entrepre-negro
CEO of Disturbing The Peace Records
He expended his empire into multiple profitable businesses
Including his Thai food restaurant, Straits
Internet sites, WeMix.com
And my favorite, MyGhetto.com
The MVP, of this rap shit
(Ludacris)
Luda! I'm a hustler, BALLER, gangsta, CAP PEELER
I stay strapped like your neighborhood trap dealer
I got rifles that blow ya below ya bible belt
And mac-11's that leave you wetter than Michael Phelps! (woo!)
But you'll be swimmin with the fishes
Softer than bitches washin dishes, fool what's the BUSINESS?
I'm already rich, so talk mo' figures (yup)
Spit 30 large for cigars of you hoe niggaz (oww!)
I got gangstas that'll rearrange ya whole face
And put your casket on ice, now that's a cold case (ha!)
Never forget where you come or that block'll bang you
I keep my ear to the STREETS like a cocker spaniel
I cock and blast you, into outer space
Break every bone in ya, you so out of place
Boom without a trace, you a bluff to block
I got some red beams, let's play connect the dots!
(Interlude: Ving Rhames)
He's the biggest boss, comin' outta the M-I-yayo
Straight from the ""Port of Miami""
To keepin' it ""True""
Involved in many heated acts of violence
This goes deeper than rap shit
He's worth eight figures
So young niggaz, boss up
I present to you, Rick Ross, the boss
(Rick Ross)
I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened and read it, it said ""We want hustlers""
Had a Lexus at 18, picture that
Got a Chevy with pictures on it from pitchin crack
Bitch I know Haitians, we speakin' Creole
Bitch I'm a D-boy, still slingin kilos
I got twenty cars, why exaggerate?
It cost me five grand just to fill the gas tanks
Love the marble floors, got the Greek pillows
Frontin at awards, real street niggaz
I used to serve shake, now I serve steaks
Three squares on the road, call it 3rd Bass
Big ass face, chop you in your laugh face
Shoot his ass, aim defense is the last case
Keep Jewish friends, the newest Benz
You in a pool of blood, let me see you swim
(Interlude: Ving Rhames)
Hailing from College Park, Georgia
Authorities figured they must have been some sort of mob
Or illegal organization
According to authorities, they made a quarter mil' a week
Selling {?}, they were some high-rollin' hustlers
Tity Boi, and Dolla Boy
Playaz Circle, A.K.A., the Duffle Bag Boys
[Tity Boi] + (Dolla Boy)
Uh, I'm so sick I wrote this verse in a hospital
It's an election year, I support strippers
(We roll like bicycles, icicle flow)
(White liquor, my nigga stay on line with the blow)
I'm on time with the flow, not a minute nor second late
Ain't no such thing as second place
(And every day I live heavyweight, you niggaz featherweight)
(Fairytale tellin' niggaz really need to take a break)
And the estate got a lake for a backyard
(The pool room product put it all on my sacks card)
For real? (Yeah, for real)
I'm ill, I deal, I did, I will
(I got dogs like Cujo, me and Tity two chains ridin' in a two do')
Bitches catch kudos (you know)
Yeah we move weight like sumos
And kicks it with them bitches like judo
Southside!

[Quik] Gotta keep it a secret (woo!)
[Luda] Ay man let me ask you somethin' man
[Luda] You ever have one of them days where you felt like
[Luda] you mighta got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
[Luda] Y'knahmean like you just got your paycheck
[Luda] Paid off a car note or somethin'
[Luda] Just jumped out the shower feelin' fresh than a muh'fucka
[Luda] Witcha good shoes on, y'knahmtalkinbout?
[Quik] You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?
[Luda] Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party
[Luda] Like call e'rybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it
[Quik] In Compton we call that ""spur of the moment""
[Luda] Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?
(Ludacris)
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
Fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't trippin' on child suppo't
(DJ Quik)
Because she can't support that garbage, she should come pay homage
When we pair 'em, we gon' share 'em, when I'm finished we all switch
I ain't really got the time, yo I'm chillin' with Luda-
-Cris stop and twist the buddha got me feelin' like this is it
If we gon' party, we gon' sip, we got a bar
We all in shape, we gon' go far, you can't stop the car
We on the freeway, if you get out you burnt
You woulda thought you woulda learned me when my hair was all permed
I think y'all bullshittin with it dawg
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
[KJ] And for once in my life everything's gonna be all right
G'd up, my mind is freed up
[KJ] From the day through the night everything's gonna be all right
(DJ Quik)
Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that would jump in your bag for your jewels
But to put some money in it for your drink and your shoes
We get the News like MTV, every ten to the hour
We play Mario Brothers, we eat the 'shroom and get power
Now eat your sour powers, and use your dental floss
What does bein mental cost? If you ain't knowin' you already lost
(Ludacris)
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin' 'round grinnin, runnin' 'round sinnin
Gettin' lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin' up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's around
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive riiiiight
(Ludacris)
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's lookin' this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin' quite kipper
Can't nothin' go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill
(DJ Quik)
If it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
'Cause I do {?} elevation
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show it in the back of my truck, at the picnic

If the paper ain't right then we call in a sweeper
To clean up the problems and straiten the mess
So nigga come with yo pistol and nigga come with yo vest
This ain't the east or the west
A bama weed or the stress
I'm young pimpathal author
And we done passed the test
And we smokin' the best
Everywhere that we go
And when our record come out
Them bitches sell out the sto'
Stayin throat on the dro
And keep the thang on the flo'
Want my money up front
When we come fo' the show
Y'all can play wit ya paper
But I'm dyin' for mine
So while y'all buyin them watches
I'm gon' stay on the grind
(Fuck nigga)
Stick 'em up stick 'em up bitch stick um up
Put yo hands up where I can see 'em, see 'em, see 'em
Stick 'em up stick 'em up bitch stick um up

With my hollow plan
Hollow bullets, I pull it
I'm about to live in vain
And then I drill 'em refill em
Make sure they feel the pain!
It's mighty strange how y'all peephole is my fuckin' gauge
Catch you in concert and then wipe you off the fuckin' stage
I feel a ghetto rage
Let's turn the ghetto page
My bitch will stick you with ghetto metal stilleto thangs
And I got a ghetto aim
With diamond bezzled rings
So why my index is workin
My pinky's blindin thangs
I hit 'em at close range
I spit 'em at most brains
You think you real rich
Nigga we gonna make some chump change
You think it's a fuckin' game
You think it's a blood sport

And I see a red dot aimed at yo head
Then bright lights

Say nigga you think it's a joke
Treal niggas be goin' for broke
Twist this whistle loc and them muthafuckin pistols smoke
It's just a matter of time
Before you labeled a buster
I just the nigga
That couldn't catch up and cut the mustard
Now I got confidence
I don't need no condiments
All I need is common sense
To see through your incompitence
Nigga keep yo compliments
They don't flatter me
You fuckin' with me
And that'll be the day bitch we don't play
You know where the gat'll be (huh)
Right on the side of me (side of me)
Right where it's supposed to be (supposed to be)
Bitch niggas die for me (die for me)
Just for gettin' to close to me (close to me)
So kiss your rosery beads
And sing you silent one cause
I promise if you get it it's gone be a violent one
Coroner catching his breath
Like he got asthma
When they cut on the blue light
And see all the fuckin' plasma
Millennium murda masta nigga
I ain't new to this
So when you see that Bun-B young pimp or that Ludacris

154,Tell It Like It Is,2006,Release Therapy (2006),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"Things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be
Like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry
Talkin' bout what they got, and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars, but you don't own ya own name?
Get ya business right boys, the first class is in session
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession
Start up ya own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya 'bout a grand so start savin' ya change
Open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps
Sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks
Hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need
Whatever gets ya juices flowin' could be speed or weed
Get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered
Sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard!
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me
But I can't hold my tongue
I'ma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun
I'ma tell it like it is
Give it to ya straight, no chase
I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo face
And I'ma tell it like it is
I can't hold my tongue
I'ma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun
I'ma tell it like it is
Give it to ya straight, no chase
I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo face
And I'ma tell it like it is
See, mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems
The money could be the problem, but money can't solve 'em
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy
I'm close 'cause those close wanna live off my fame
And that type of shit alone will drive a nigga insane
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandelous promoters
Crabs will try to sue ya, magazines will misquote ya
Most of these label-heads, they don't care nothin' about ya
If you stop sellin' records, they'll act like they don't know ya
It's hard mixin' business with pleasure, so don't play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other day
Rappers ain't above the law, but our life is so fast
That we got a Special Task Force of police on our ass
All that, and this is really just the start of it
Hip Hop, you really wanna be a part of it?
I can't hold my tongue
I'ma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun
I'ma tell it like it is
Give it to ya straight, no chase
I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo face
And I'ma tell it like it is
I can't hold my tongue
I'ma tell it like it is
Man this biz ain't all fun
I'ma tell it like it is
I'ma give it to ya straight, no chase
I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo face
And I'ma tell it like it is
What's worse than havin' no money is havin' it and losin' it
What's worse than havin' some money is grabbin' and abusin' it
We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool wit him
I wish his ass well, but I don't want nothin' to do with him!
Some don't own they publishin', me I never fool wit 'em
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em
'Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant
Unless I'm still in competition with my president
And believe that I'm supportin' the Hova"

Either of yo' lips, yo' ears, yo' neck, yo' stomach or yo' back
Yo' inner thigh, right on yo' kneecap or yo' belly button
These other guys be out here talkin' but they steady frontin
They don't know what they want, that's why I tell you put yo' trust in me
Share all yo' secrets, yo' desires and yo' fantasies
I ain't gon' tell nobody baby, I'm an only child
I'll keep it to myself cause all I wanna do is see you smile
Knowin' that you got someone to talk to, ain't that what you want?
I'll be yo' lover, yo' provider and yo' confidant
And I won't judge you 'cause I know that ain't nobody perfect
But you got some perfect imperfections and that makes you worth it
I wanna see yo' body in all of the positions that you like it in
We could do it slow or have some drinks and it gets enticin when
You like it rough and I give it rough and start to pull yo' hair
Cause ecstasy's yo' destination and I'ma take you there
Tell me a secret baby

Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows
Girl don't think about it, just soon as the door cloooose
Tell me a secret baby

Tell me all the things that you would do if it was you and me
Tell me a secret baby
Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby

It ain't nobody in the universe that competes with you
Imagine the possibilities and all the little freaky thangs that we could do
Blindfolded handcuffed to the headboard, never let you go until you scream my name
Maybe you think I'm playin' but this is really far from a motherfuckin game
Ain't a damn thang change still nasty as I wanna, be
And I got just what you been lookin' for baby girl you wanna, see
It'll turn you on and it's gonna be on soon as I take it off
Just give me yo' body, it's guaranteed that I'ma break it off
Off off off, off until the sunrise
And I'm not here to disappoint, just give me one try
One kiss, one pinch and you could take or leave it
But before you make up your mind just tell me one secret
Ne-Yo, holla at 'em
(Ne-Yo)
Said we can talk about your fantasy
And ain't nobody gotta know but me
Baby c'mon and make this move if you're gonna
Baby we grown, we can do what we wanna, hey
Said you can tell me what you like to do
Baby girl you never know, I may like it too
Baby c'mon and make this move if you're gonna
Baby we grown, we can do what we wanna, ay

Jump down turn around pick a pail of hay

Pickin' records like cotton in the thick of the day
Till I'm spoiled and I'm rotten in a sinister way

More money but still locked in a similar cage

Hey welcome to the jungle, and I'm the lion

I'm not the president, but I see cops behind me
Well fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, and they can not stop me

161,Two Miles An Hour,2004,The Red Light District (2004),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"Yeah... we gon' send this one out to everybody that put more into they cars than they do they relationship.
Let's ride.
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.
[Ludacris:] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll!
Yes, 7 cars, 8 cribs and ain't a damn thing changed
I'm still pumpin' 10 kickers, still grippin' the grain
Still candy in the paint, still ridin' 'em things
And most my folks would say I'm happy but I still feel pain
Until I jump in my ride, that's my only escape
Me and my automobile's got these neighbors screamin' ""Give me a break!""
It's a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses
Don't be mad 'cause I can't hold my 500 horses
Lamborghinis and Porsches, Ferraris and Vipers
I'ma wipe the seats witcho' drool then rub the hood with a diaper
Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank
I mean to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap your seatbelts on, go put your money up
Go put your life on the line, go put your honey up
Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys
It's time to play or better yet it's time to bring out them toys
We goin'...
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.
[Ludacris:] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll!
(x4)
Assign your name in the streets. Sign your name in the streets.
Yo, one of my ways of releasin' tension while I'm releasin' some steam
Even if I just put a fresh coat of wax on I'm makin' sure the slippers is clean
The 26's is mean, shut down the block, you could picture the fiends
My system supreme, you can feel the knock, just picture the scene
The chickens just scream, whole crew ballin' they sick of my team
We gettin' the cream, I'm through hollerin' I'm livin' my dream
I'm black with a scheme, won't stop until that fat lady sings
And yeah it's actual and factual what my faculty brings
A car show for whatever we slide and wherever we glide
You can keep your rules and regulations man 'cause we don't abide
And we lookin' alive, Mercedes Benz, 6 or the 5
In a Beamer, Lexus or Ac' we don't know how to act when we drive
And I fiend for the ride, I lay back and lean to the side
Onlookers and turnin' heads is all that's seen through his eyes
I'm breezin' on by and no doubt, it's easy to fly
But it's even better when you slow down or ease to the side and go...
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.
[Ludacris:] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll!
I'm ridin' up in GTO's & .44 2's
Grand Prixs, S-S's 'cause we so so cool
Ridin' Regals or the 'llacs, we in Chevelles and Verts
Skylarks, motorcycles, ATV's with the works
Malibus and Camaros, T-Birds and Novas
Escalades, Navigators, Expeditions and Rovers
H-2's & Denalis, pickup trucks with the beams
Crown Vics, Monte Carlos, even Cutlass Supremes are goin'...
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.
2 Miles An Hour, so everybody sees you.

Chorus: Y'all got a problem come see me
Verse 1: I be that Nigga named Luda
Alert, Alert
It's the At alien intruder
Collage Park water boy spit in the ca cooler
I Jam till they Def
They call me Slick Dick the rula
Women indeed
Keep your eyes closed
Bold flows
C'mon out them clothes hoes
Low pros low blows
Watch out for them Po Po's
And I chose to be that number 1 contender
Southern offender
Fucking up your whole agenda
When I walk you try to run
When I run you try to hide
You skate at the snap of my finger
Call me golden glide
It's you and I
Do or die
Who am I
I got a pocket full of family stones
Cats think I'm sly
Why try
You one of those niggas that like to cheat death
And I'm one of them niggas that rip out
Exersions until there are no seats left
You shit and wheat chex
And fart out deep breaths
While we toss darts at the bottom of y'all V-necks
(Who Cris aw that niggas aight that nigga can't fuck wit me though
Let me get on tha mic who tha fuck are you)
Verse 2: I be that nigga Bronze Bridges
Playas wanna ball but go on strike
Cause of my pitches
They think I want they bitches
But I don't want no pigeons
Yet pigeons can scrub my dishes
And y'all don't want no scrubs
Until y'all pullout ya extensions
Y'all in school detention and never come out
Man I'll cut your Achilles tenden and put a sock in yo mouth
'Cause we the shit in the south

Ya see we Jack and we Daniel
Y'all Earl and Ralph

These bitch niggas is lame

You all wet behind the ears but its
A drought in your brain.
And that's just simply and plain main
Three W dot shh

Verse 3: I be that nigga that lova lova
I'm nastier than thinking about your parents
Sex each other
No glove no love
Better tell your dick to run for cover
So when lightning strikes
You'll be safe wit a few rubbers
If you know what I mean
Not everybody's Mr. and Mrs. Clean
Some get burned like Freddie Cruggers
Sweat dreams
Girls backing they ass up
Now they 400 Degrees ha
Hot girl
Tryin' to give it to niggas up on the block girl
Have you screaming stop girl
I rock worlds
Wit my nine-inch Louisville slugger
Still wonder why they call me Lover Lover
Self explainectorian

Satisfaction
(Chorus: Voice)
Yeah, blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
It gives me (satisfaction)
(Verse 1: Ludacris)
Can you handle it
808 bang in the back with the woofer like boom boom boom boom
With my foot on the pedal and my hand on my strap
Got the engine like vroom vroom vroom vroom
What's up, you ain't never heard a nigga rap like-like this before
I got an addictive flow that'll give you (satisfaction)
I'ma make you satisfied, even if it kills me
Even if it takes the slower minds, a little bit of time to feel me
Recollect the 15 million I sold, or the 30 times I went gold
And if you take 2 puffs of this dro, it'll give you (satisfaction)
I've sold the most and no one's close, but I'm not meaning to brag
It's different strokes for different folks, like Angelina and Brad
Some keep the heat in the stash, put 30 keys in their Jag
And if cops ain't peepin your tag then you're gonna feel some (satisfaction)
Pumpin' out albums like Reverend Run is pumpin out children, here's another one
So catch me on more 24's than Kiefer Sutherland
I'm bound to be the greatest, I'm determined to win
Until then I can't get no (satisfaction)
(Verse 2: Smoke)
I'm the one that went to the gunfight with a knife, and won
Left with his pistol and left him dead, the guy he tried to run
Just because my verse 2nd don't mean I am not the one
When I'm done I'm guaranteed to give you (satisfaction)
I might not be the best in the world, but the best the world ever seen
I'm all been in Georgia's daughter Conde ding-a-ling king
And when I'm digging deep in the spleen, I'ma make the cream and she scream
Baby get me hard like a Snickers bar I give her (satisfaction)
Yessir there ain't not other way so motherfuck what you say
Y'all had this spot, we took you off the top like a toupee
Them coke's been kick and pushed in this fiasco like Lupe
Back that ass up like Juve, cause the south we givin' them (satisfaction)
Ever since I signed with Luda and them, my chances of losing are slim
Y'all talk that smack but copycat and do a movie like him
Yessir my mob got that goodie, as if my group had a kid
We gonna continue to give them a double dose of (satisfaction)
(Verse 3: Shawn Jay)
Yeah Fleetwood drop the bomb, when I rhyme it's TNT
That's why my money long as the line at the DMV
When they askin who was that that was snappin I'm that answer dude
Like Snickers bring no nuts no (satisfaction)
I hustle and flow, I done been by my cheese since I was knee high
Weed what you need, hit me I'ma drop off peaches like I'm T.I.
Earvin Johnson gimme that rock and magic cap of Shawn Jay
Dope sold money for (satisfaction)
I been the nigga they can't fuck with, hot but the flow cold
Flip rocks by the boatload O.G. no see see me get tipped off getcha no dough
Zip-loc full of dro tow big glocks on the hip cocked try to play the big shots
Get popped with the four four
Don't be the reason they mopped in the floor for payin' me, that (satisfaction)
Fool for a dollar let me get that pop, man I need this cream
Where my cake give me my candles, I got sweet sixteen
Now the kid with the cocaine flow got DTP on his necklace
Now Luda tell them what you think about your invest (satisfacton)"
165,Undisputed,2008,Theater of the Mind (2008),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"(Floyd Mayweather speaks)
Luda: Back up on dat ass,
Back to put rappers on one knee like they bout to run 100 meter dash,
Bow down to greatness, before I get pissed and run up in the stands like the Indiana Pacers,
Covered all my bases, straight, no chasers,
Diamonds on my chain look like my neck's full of glacers,
Titanic flow, Titanic dough, women on my nuts like ""Where da Titanic go?""
I been scourin' da earth, makin' my fans catch da holy ghost at my shows like ya grandma at church,
And the fat lady singin', it's ova for you rappers,
Can't none of y'all bust your just sacs full of semen,
And I got da women screamin', and they could catch my balls on any given Sunday like my name's Willy Beaman,
Or LL Cool, so if ya boyfriend thinks your loyal to his ass then he's a motherf***in fool,
Got jewels on my pinky, jewels on my wrist
Iconic status and his name is Ludacris,
Bitch please, you messin wit some real O.G's,
Wit million dolla whips dat I ship from overseas,
Got a pocket full of G'z, and the inconvenient truth is that the ozone is back 'cause I been smokin' all da trees,
The globe is warmin' up when we fire up the blunt,
And put it in the air like Evil Knievel stunts,
Wat you want from me? I got pistols for da haters,
Ya fam will be in black like the playin' for da Raiders,
And ya music isn't favored, and DJ's they neva bring it back like when you go and borrow somethin' from ya neighbor,
Like a cup full of sugar, a rope full of salt,
The name of my car insurance is YO F***IN FAULT,
And if you sittin' on chrome, I'll call up my boys and have you stripped of ya medals like Marion Jones, nigga ...
(Floyd Mayweather speaks)
Luda: Back up on da scene, back to put a nail in these rappers' coffins I got the hammer in my jeans,
Call me Mr.Fixit, barrel hotter than a fresh batch of home-made buttermilk biscuits,
A-tisket, a-tasket, a custom-made casket,
Luda leaves them trouters stretched out like gymnastics,
And acrobatics I'm superstar status, the mouth of the South like gangsta grillz you bastard,
The international traveler, and I may not be much to you but I'm the shit out in Africa,
So put ya fist up, even the statue of liberty lit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up,
You can't compete wit me, I got 'em stuck like I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet wit me,
And then I broke free, I'll let 'em loose when Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drug-free,
I'm the baddest mother shut it like Shaft was, leavin' rappers wit headaches like bad drugs,
They shoulda warned ya, you got defeated by the heat but, eh, we'll just say we Alonzo Mourn'd ya,
So Cater coroner, I'll show up to yo funeral wit some gators like I'm fresh outta Florida,
Call me the swamp thing, y'all headed in the wrong direction like you hit the subway and caught the wrong train,
So don't fuck wit it, I'm sendin' lyrical bullets right at ya dome fuck niggaz betta duck wit it,
Or else you stuck wit it,
You'll get stalked so bad you'll leava da scene thinkin' eight Young Buck's did it,
But not in Cashville, you lost yo feelin' like comin' down off X chasin' effects of yo last pill,
You f***in Daffy Dill, You's a Daffy Duck,
And I'm the undefeated champ, y'all niggas suck!"

168,War With God,2006,Release Therapy (2006),Hip Hop|Southern Hip Hop|Eurodance,Ludacris,"The time has come... for bad things to leave
The time has come... for life to begin
The time has come... for the war of the gods
Yes...
It's that time
I'ma take the subtle approach first
'Cause I'm just gettin' started
Let's go
(1st Verse)
Look, I'm the best and there's nothing that you can do about it
Never needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it
Even in the core of the streets, you can't sway the youth about it
But keep runnin' yo mouth, and I swear I'ma knock a tooth up out it
I never claimed to be nothin' but who the fuck I am
Never sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin' man
Understand, nothin' you did makes you better nigga
You claim the streets, but the streets respect that chedda nigga
Luda got twice as much yo life you can charge it to 'em
I fit four of your houses inside my daughters room
And still have room for young Karma to play
Givin' back to the children of tomorrow, for good karma today
So you can say whatcha wanna say, and you can talk that talk
But real niggaz ain't doin' no talkin' 'cause we walk that walk
Album for album you can see I got a multimillion plan
So call yourself whatever you want cept the multimillion man
(2nd Verse)
How many times is you gon rap about busting your gun
How many times is you gon trap without busting your gun
Only shots you ever took were subliminal to the general
Disrespectin those doin' real time with real criminals
And I ain't never did a day in my life
But it should be illegal to walk a day in my life
I paid the price and the cost to be the boss so you can rest your mouth
I'm universal, Luda never limits himself to the south
I give a damn about ya hootin and hollerin, and it ain't botherin ME
I hear you talkin' but you ain't made it to THREE
You know where I live, but you ain't made it to ME
You ain't made nigga
I'm havin' a house party, kid come get played nigga
You got played, my record label never jerked me
So shoot me, stab me, but words will never hurt me
I feed off your energy, my powers with God
So it's even better if you make ya diss record real hard..."

DTP we ain't plying if you try to get our pen
A.K's get ta spraying like...
Bottom line that mean I'm 'bout it, any nigga want it, doubt it
Bust you in the broad day, on the street that's fully crowded
Find our hole and fagots there, just for thinking its rap
And tell that pretty bitch thug we got some pretty big gats
Chaka say I'm shot out, and I tend to agree
So you should what you saying if it's intended for me
So be careful what you starting, let my fingers do the walking
And that Uzi get to talking like...
(Tity Boi)
Hammers, jam 'em, snatch 'em, grab 'em
Can the an and fuck 'em, damn 'em
Press him, man him, scared him, teared him, kneed him up
Bake him, take him, beat him up, I hate I hate, I eat him up
A-B-C-E-F shorty is you a G or what
Now it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world
I'm pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like earl
Serving the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em

And I'm throwing Techs like a NBA ref

Artillery, could it be I got all kinds of these pistols

You gon' need hella doctors, when the Glok go...

Ill leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song
My Shotguns are cold and hard, but my Desert is easy
And my triggers are always talking about some squeeze me, squeeze me

So I stripped them off the wall
Waiting for my cue to corner pocket eight balls

Relax and take notes,
While I'm put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect, then if I put you up on cane,
But you should grab yourself a seat and a Whisky Double,
Because the girls of the world ain't nothin' but trouble,
They like a little danger and might not admit it,
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it,
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowin' with swag
And keeps his women all draped in new Louis Vuitton bags
With Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to 'em,
I like open toe straps, but SG talk to em!
I gotta whole buncha girls I'm tryna bring by the crib tonight,
Betta wear your cape, 'cause they bringin' that kryptonite,

Neckless, bracelets and all other types of jewelery,
So, shop till you drop, or till it makes you psychotic,
Heres a triple Black Card, it ain't trickin if you got it
Others will stay content if you just makin' 'em laugh,
Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble bath,
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand,
And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!
So get loose and slide off your damn garments,
Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm tryin' to find,
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me what's on your mind,
And I got plenty more to learn if you's invested in me,
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be,
And for that!, I'll give you everything up under the sun,
'Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun

Pass that
Let me hit that
C'mon nigga
(Chorus: Ludacris)
What you smokin' on, nigga
What you smokin' on
What you smokin' on, nigga
What you smokin' on
What you smokin' on, bitch
What you smokin' on
What you smokin' on, bitch
What you smokin' on
I get so high
I get so high
And fall off in the sky
(Verse 1: Ludacris)
I've fallen and I can't get up, somebody wake me up
So high that my eyelids low, feelin' like I'm in a coma better come shake me up
What you wanna do Luda? Shit, roll up might as well
AK-47 to the head then we ain't dead, we just high as hell
You might know it as weed, grass marijuana, cannabis, sativa
You may call it cheeba, maybe reefer, Wiz Khalifa
Smokin' on white moonshine, or that anthrax, or that blue dream
Spread a lil cologne on my clothes feeling like Versace blue jeans
While y'all smoking that rough weed, that dirt shit, that ragamuff
I'm smoking on that homegrown and pass out 'cause I done had enough
Of that sour diesel, that northern lights, and that killa Cali
They see me out up Oahu, Honolulu, smoking that Maui Wowie
(Verse 2: Ludacris)
Look, don't fret
You niggas need a better connect, you gotta get your status up
Y'all smoke that stress, we smoke that shit that won the cannabis cup
Now I'm higher than a satellite, eating everything like a parasite
Now we in the streets looking for the baddest dike
To run a midnight train like Gladys Knight
I'm higher than the prices at Petro
Higher than the balloon after you let go
'Cause I'm smokin' on that loud in the middle of a crowd
And the loud is really louder than techno
I've got my weed card on the way to the store to get medicinal marijuana
Luda, study more Buddha than the Dalai Lama
Granddaddy purp, bubble gum, or the OG Kush
White widow, or the g13, and the Irene got your homies shook
But that Jack Herer and the headband got my homies wired
And the blueberry yum yums that fire
(Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa)
Uh
Smokin' on that something grown at home, sunken blowin' ozs
Nigga I'm from PGH but all my weed from Califon'
Can't find the remote control
That's how you know I'm stoned
All you do is call me, I got all the weed, the papers, bongs
Brownies, trippy sticks, and vaporizers, we could smoke a bowl
All these niggas smokin' weed around me it's a smoke-a-thon
Crowded in my whip, its partly cloudy 'cause we smokin' strong
You say you can't smoke them joints, probably 'cause you rolled it wrong
My dollars up, I'm gettin' 'em and I'm foldin it
I'm lighting em, I'm hittin em, I'm not holdin' it
I'm passin them straight to Ludacris and he's smokin' it
Security and a nigga that own a bitch, Askin"

You know what I need,
Somebody who can come and lick-lick the clit, (aiight)
And a nigga who ain't thinking 'bout a Trina LP,
And make you wanna get my shit
He can go from the front-ass gential coop deville
Hotel talley-ho, and Beverly Hill (that's right)
I need a real nigga not the one in da mill,
Come and spank me, and make me shoot to kill
From da kitchen and you can move me to da jacuzzi
And up the booty, come and do your duty
Me and fat dick Ludacris making us a movie
Butt naked in a bed-a-cash,
Make you st-st-stuttah when I bare my ass
Tell your baby bye-bye, she a thing of the past (bye-bye)
I'm a bad bitch and I'm off the glass
Havin' sex in little dress, monaj-e-toi
Gettin' buck-wild no matter where we are
Indy 500 in the back of the car
In the dark-ass club or in the back of the bar
Never want, never ever wanna leave
Work with me like tha league over seas
I wanna man to fulfill my needs
Keep my body trembling and buckle my knees
(Shawnna)
I wanna do it on a canopy
I wanna do it where your girl gon see, and get mad at me
I wanna nigga that grab the weave
And turn my eyes Chinese, tell me 'baby can you handle me'
I wanna do it all in your mouth, then I put that ass out
Make you bounce till you pass out
Or we could cut up in the grass
And give the neighboors a flash
Can you tell me who the bad mutha fucka now?
Said I wanna take-take-take-take a nigga back to the crib
And I wanna do all the things- do all the things that I never did
Like upon tha... top-top-top-top of the projects getting head
Or you can find me in a drop-drop-drop-drop on dubs and candy red
I like a nigga when he face down-mouth wide
Hold on down with the blaze on the ride
Keepin' the pound with them K's on the side, but it's okay
I'm gonna break something tonight, oh see, get on your knees
And I'll show what's my fantasy
Like up on the coot, coot, tell your bitch she ain't gotta be mad at me
(Ludacris)
I wanna lick lick lick lick you from your head to your toes.
And I wanna move from the bed down to da down to da floor.
And I wanna Ah Ah you make it so good, I don't wanna leave.
But I gotta li-li-know what's the fant-a-sy...
(Foxy Brown)
You gotta lick-li-li-lick me from my ass to my clit
And you gotta s-suck the pussy while I sit on your dick
And I wanna talk some shit while the feel it get stiff
And rub-a-dub up on my tits, while I nu-nu-nut on your lips

Ya think a bitch got my rep., three mills,
Still BK to the death, still don't give

And rub-a-dub up on my tits while I n-nut on your lips"

I keep a fresh pair of One's on my feet and double deuces on da chevy.
Three's company the double four's on my belly,
5 hot amps speakers shake like jelly,
So many wires in my trunk look like a bowl of spaghetti.
Assault and batteries, but my trunk stay ever ready,
Assault and battery if you scared you never ready.
And yeah I went green da 26's on da high bridge,
Smoked so much green that I can't open up my eyelids.
Wake up in London, go to sleep on Atlanta time,
Still my paint got more candy then your valentine.
For 5 mil I bought a lakefront crib,
Da Bentley car cover lookin' like a laced front wig
Of course dey hatin' 'cause dey still ridin' da MARTA train,
We named da yacht but put the plane in my daughter's name,
Now dats Karma so call me Daddy War Bucks

Da inside of da 'Lac look like a wood shop class
And these women gimme love like it's tennis time
So many shoes dat my closet look like finish Line
So many acres dat my crib look like Bermuda
So many diamonds da safe look like Kay jewelers
Dat spot bout to drop my team said Luda get it
Now 50 thou says I'm the first nigga with it
Da first round draft pick later for you imbeciles
The car is all black like it got traded to the timber wolves
And I keep a li'l bit of that green up in the lining
But as the weather change my weed adjust to different climates
Green in the summer time, orange in the spring,
Now it's black with dat purp, I call my whip da Sac King
'Cause I got it, all these haters wanna grill me

I'm fly enough to fly away, trouble I don't shy away from it
I annihilate suckers in they driveway
In church on Sunday mornin prayin' bout what happened Friday
But dem da consequences for comin' pimpin' sideways
Nowadays guess it pays to change in cahoots with corporations makin' major change
With magnificent watches and amazing chains
Plush pad in Atlanta and L.A's da same
I ball till I'm bored with selections and assortments
Some auto motives worth a small fortune
Of coure there's the '72 Chevelle hard-top, '69 drop
60 K a piece, you could barely pay your lease,
Dude wanna talk new school, tell em' go ahead
Drop head double off Maybech and corner sales
Swag got the ass, cash stacked to the hairline
Fuck another car, it's time to try and buy an airline
'Cause I got it, all these haters wanna grill me
But fuck that, I'm bout my money if it kills me

Whoo... Kel... Chris...
And clubbin on some smooth shhh...
(1st Verse - Ludacris)
Ludacris can't hide or deny that I wanna get you down to them Vickie Seeecretsss
And your body I won't misguide mistreat or misleeeeead it
Hate it up, love it, they can't cut it, so strut it
Number one shaker, like Vick's vapor I wanna fuckin' ruuuuuub it
Louisville slug it hit 'em with a right left, its goooooone
Tell every last one of ya girls how good it was and its gone be onnnnnn
Soul Train, more brain, from meeeee
No pain, no gain, it's so plain to seee
They be like ""I've been feelin' kind of stressed can you blow my back out?""
And I'm like ""Yeah but don't trip if I happen to yank ya track out""
When I get done its smooth sailin once I pull that 'Lac out
Next destination I move forward like Jerry Stackhouse
And 1, have fun, when you chillin' with Ludi
Slow grind and slow jams while I'm feelin' yo booty
We'll hold hand and hold times when I'm up in that coochie
You so fine I'm so sad that you feelin' so wooooozy
(Chorus - R. Kelly)
Got you feelin' woozy baby (baby)
And that's how's it gonna be when I take you from the club to the crib
On dubs and I get you in the bed with meeee (in the bed with me)
Your so pretty, and so sweaty and so sexy and so ready
Girl I'm surprised you this nasty
But its cool 'cause I always wanted to go down on a girl that reminds me of me
So get upstairs, get yo clothes off and get them sexy legs legs in a 'V' (yup)
Your vision blurry as if you were seeing two of me (two of me)
You so fine I'm so sad that you feelin' so wooooozy
(2nd Verse)
Will YOU, make me feel like I just hit the lotto
Other girls I give 'em a shoulder colder than Chicago
But in ya center I heat it up in the Mourning like Alonzo
And I'd get it, I'd bit it, I'd split it, I'd hit it up in a Tahoe
Bravo, make make make it clap I'd break break break ya back
Then tuck tuck tuck you in so you can take take take a nap
Then back to makin' dividends I'm in the wind
Somewhere hot, I stay on islands longer than Gulligan
Sippin on a pina colada, little mama I'mma make ya holla
How does it sounds when you makin' love on a Million dollars
I can only imagine lets make it real baby
Like D'Angelo ""How does it feel"" baby
I know I talk a lot shit but I can back it up (up up)
Like BBD flip it, rub it down, smack it up (up up)
You so bad when you call me for duty
You so fine I'm so sad that you feelin' so wooooozy
(3rd Verse)
Don't get caught up in the gossip, them chicks is jockin girl
They just jealous, everybody hates when Cris is rockin' ya world
Hey girl, hey friend, how you doing, where you been
Enough of that talkin', lets begin, break it in
Shake and spin, take it in, say amen
Then I'll make you say goodness graciouuuus
Look me in the eye and make them nasty faaaaaaaces
I'm so glad that your body's so juicy
You so fine I'm so sad that you feelin' so wooooozy
(R. Kelly ad libs)
Giiiirl, said your body is what I want (wooooozy wooooozy wooooozy)
I'll be making scream and mooooan (wooooozy wooooozy wooooozy)
Girl let's get on up out this club (wooooozy wooooozy wooooozy)
Ooh get you to my hoooome"

Talk about that Word of Mouf baby!
Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh! Here we go, here we go
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now
(Ludacris)
Check it
You see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for ya health
See I ain't gotta say SHIT! Money speaks for itself
With all models I make I'm +Great+ like five +Lakes+
You got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates!
You rollin' on dubs, I roll right into clubs
Dirtiest home with more rings than ya tub
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a couple of girls that shakin they thangs
Then I, put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be goin' to hell
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail!
I got junkyard dawgs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper
And my baby's assed out, 'cause I rub my cars with her diapers
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
""Word of Mouf"" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass
(4-Ize)
These rap cats is soft like R&B singers
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggaz one by one
Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworkin
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurkin
Creepin', I'm in the shadows, the nightshade
You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?
Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes
The black rose with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I alter beast
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace
(Ad libs to end)"
