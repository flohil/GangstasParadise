0,40 Acres,2013,My Name Is My Name (2013),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"(Hook: The-Dream)
Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours
But you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres
(Verse 1: Pusha T)
Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money is universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaude him
Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
Cause stand up niggas don't lay on no floors
Much rather burns us, ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it out the plastic
Now you celebrate motherfuckers raise your glasses
Push...
(Verse 2: Pusha T)
Unpolished, unapologetic
Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always fuck it
35 years of marriage and my momma left it
You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him
The better question is did you enjoy the dance with him
(Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch
You know this money grew your hair out
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one I care about
Place none above me, God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me, only he can judge me
(Verse 3: Pusha T)
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended
Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended
I was a goner, punished by karma
Called him tar baby now he's transcending genres
The 911 king with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I'm Jordan vs Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine, reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres"
1,Alone in Vegas,2011,Fear of God (2011),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"I let you into my diary to admire me
The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiós I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas some other niggas double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look at what the devil did
She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading so
I write this alone in Vegas
They'll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you're rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It's 911 you're on your 25th hour
Asta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher
The game can't go by just followin' the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede, yeah
Upgrade them, upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans
Reagan era I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it
Fear of God niggas, got me feelin' like Pac
This the realest shit I ever wrote
Who you know sit in New York for 2 days around Grammy winners
Come back home straight to the money getters
About $14,000 dollars worth in 20s
Brown paper bag money, I call that a good weekend
Re-up gang forever
Long live the caine coming soon
Malice my brother I love you
Liva Don till the end nigga"

3,Amen,2011,Fear of God 2: Let Us Pray (2011),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"(Intro: Young Jeezy)
In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray amen
(Kanye West)
You like that don't you? I wrote it myself by the way
And I don't mean to be selfish
But I picture myself getting paid
And you might catch pneumonia
'Cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
Me and Pusha back on it
Now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I'm trying to get paid
(Pusha T)
Try to get saved (too late!)
Time to get paid
Got a gun and a stocking mask
Niggas thought I was trying to get waves
I'mma let all y'all niggas pray for it
My young niggas knocking off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back-end
Only fucking way I'mma pay for it
Front that shit, you put a flame on
My niggas locked in a cage for
They keep telling me to go hard
#1 spot you was made for
I made more
Front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red
Glow In The Dark like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas stepping in my lane for
Not knowing that it's a land mine
Soon as a nigga feels a cool breeze
Throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue? Crip or Blood?
Solitaires, diamond studs like chandeliers I'mma flood
Black Jesus piece like it's dipped in mud
Fashion God's, notice mine
Rollarball spikes I'm Pokemon
Paris shit, Louboutin
Under bright lights where do you belong
Please Lord, yeah, it's gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin', niggas starving, niggas they can't find no Yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin' and some be dying, bow heads and let us pray
Amen
(Kanye West)
Amen, how many people do you know hatin'?
On your downfall sitting their waitin'
When you shine, don't know what they gonna say then
Everything I do now stadiums
Tell me what they really gon' say to him
And I'm headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, nigga, finna go in
Nigga you get it when pigs fly
When Yeezy fake, Devil's pie
Piece of cake, Kit-Kat
I need a break, God's child
Jesus Christ, Club like a broken neck
I need the ice, I need the lights
In Egypt they fightin' for freedom
Cop pull you over no reason, beat him
(Young Jeezy)
I got them units packed in
That black van like the A-Team
Even seen them come 2-tone like a saleen
Saleen, Yeah that's a Mustang
Break 'em down in the night, that's what I call hustling
They say they want that dumb shit, well this is ignorant
Condo on the timepiece, now that's ignorant
Young, you a fool, I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block, I tried to sew up half the streets
I'm on, 75-75, going for the 25
Guess who's pickin' up a trey
Just an ordinary day with extraodinary pay
Extraordinary risk
Can't even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it 'cause I lived it man, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony: ""don't you fuck with me"""
4,Blow Funk Flex,2011,Fear of God (2011),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I'm just tryna find my way up out this fucking kitchen
A Birdseye view got me channeling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo's got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands, all's forgiven
We kicking up dust like the Colosseum floors
Walls full of safe's like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet like she walking through my morgue
Grant's, Jackson's, no room for George
Yeah, the fear of God's in you motherfuckers
This art imitate my life
Your WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fools ghouling imitation ice
My music's for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through her bachelors
While my old bitch went back to get her Masters
Same graduation, I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts every time it's revealed
What goes around comes around, this is life's Ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill
The fact that I'm free let's me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I'll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up, sipping java
Ey yo, strolling up the totem pole, what's my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bed my toddler?
So many hands raised as the band plays
I'm here now, watch how many niggas plans change
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied till all my niggas get it, get it?
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said ""take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said, ""I got way too many blues for any more bad news""
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls
Uh, look, Uh uh
I let you into my diary to admire me
The making of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawn from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug-of-war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harry Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear this Vegas night was fucking awesome
But adios, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Loss some niggas, some other niggas double-crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthafucking gorgeous, whoa
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush did they paint me with [?]
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But they devil-red, tires double tread
I postin parks up, that gives me double head
Tight rope walking, tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind, look at what the devil did
Yeah"
5,Body Work,2011,Fear of God 2: Let Us Pray (2011),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"(Verse 1: Juicy J)
I got some killers so don't push me, Juicy J be on some mob shit
Waiting by your doorstep, hidin' in the bushes (mhmm)
If it comes down to it, ain't no thang but to do it
Got a vest on, got a gun that can really do it
You niggas playin' with real niggas' money
Get fronted, one day you is the plug
Next day you're in the dumpster
Couldn't keep it one hundred
You're thirty-two percent
The police got you on a leash, nigga you a bitch
(Hook: Juicy J)
Give yo' ass that body work nigga we spraying
Ridin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking 'bout the Klan
This ain't no arcade, nigga so quit playing
It's eating time, me and my niggas buffeting
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga we spraying
Ridin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking 'bout the Klan
This ain't no arcade, nigga so quit playing!
It's eating time, me and my niggas buffeting
(Verse 2: Pusha T)
You don't know about this life, nigga
Earning all of these stripes, nigga
Kilograms, Peter Pans, pack holders on bikes, nigga
Throwin' bitches on flights, nigga
They ain't know that they're dykes, nigga
Till the money's out and the bottle's pouring
They're in the midst of they life, nigga
Rose gold on my wrist
This Rolex like Devil's piss
This Daytona illuminate
Y'all think I'm talking that devil shit
This's fifty racks, no bezel shit
Like blood diamonds, it's rebel shit
This's more guns, this's more bodies
We call shots, they nobodies
They fuck niggas, they owe prolly
Who's fuckin' with me? Nobody
When the guns drawn, they're so sorry
Spraying niggas now the Lord got 'em
Bullets out the barrel make your body jerk
Fuck with my money and I'll hit you that body work
(Hook: Juicy J)
(Verse 3: Meek Mill)
Bad bitches on deck, nigga
Money, power, respect, nigga
Cop, cook, collect, nigga
You was never no threat, nigga
Everybody be rap dissin'
I catch niggas, I check niggas
These goons with me don't spit no verse
Just limo service, they stretch niggas
Black 'maro 2 S nigga
Couple birds on my neck, nigga
Everytime them hoes see me
They like, ""Meek Milly you a mess, nigga""
2 gats, no vest, nigga
Strapped up like I'm a cowboy
Stand tall like that Yao boy
Got a bad bitch, she 5""4
This gold roley that's on my wrist
Leprechaun prolly die for
Young boys that's on my strip
They'll kill anything I say ride on
Tell them niggas call us if they're out of work
'Cause we lifting weights but we don't do no body work
(Hook: Juicy J)
(Verse 4: French Montana)
Shout my lawyer all the crazy shit I ever did
Know we love that KK sound
You know we not backing down
100 drum like, ""Hold that doe""
Diamonds flash like Kodak, though
Straight cash, nigga fuck that loan
Seven digits on that phone
Money so long, smoke a whole zone
Getting blood money, tryna put my 'cause on
Bitch I'm on fire, got my jaw wired
Sex, money, murder - Peter Rollack (Soundview, whaddup)
Body work, chopper work like a techno song
Twenty thou' a show, I just hope my nigga Max come home (wavey)
Money fast, diamonds flash like high beams
Make it rain in this bitch - Hurricane Irene
(Hook: Juicy J)"
6,Can I Live,2011,Fear of God (2011),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"Coming live in direct from Abu Dhabi
Recorded in Emirate's palace
I bring to you the Fear of God
Noah on the boards. Steven Victor on the camera
Virgil whatup?
They say it took confidence
I just call it patience
'Cause I had too much pride to take this motherfucking cadence
Now when the feds watch me, private paparazzi
Still chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi
Against all odds see the judge tried to Pac me
Lucky dice roll got my lawyers screaming ""Yatzhee""
Who the fuck can stop me run away freight train
Mike Vick's redemption, big doggin like a great dane
12 cylinders 50 grams of willing ya
These rappers get away with pushing child Illingers
Now it's hard feelings... I just put my ceiling up
Planetarium push, the Imax experience
They say I talk coke for 9 years long
That means my rap sheet is more than 9 years strong
You niggas would have thought that I was 9 years gone
But I am still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw
Nigga get your bag on
Bitch get your bag on
Balenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home
Yeah, see my verse I let you tag along
Swim in the oasis of this drug dealer Babylon
3 bitches 3 different flights
Glad it was 4 sides at that Paul Williams fight
The Wynn, the Bellagio, the Palms 3 nights
As long as they are separated they are my three blind mice
You can't just rap this; the same mindset
That had me hiding in the mattress, now got me round the atlas
Wish every dough boy could get a crack at this
They say when one ends, that begins a new chapter
Can I live?
You tell me, can I live?"
7,Changing of the Guards,2011,Fear of God 2: Let Us Pray (2011),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"Heavy is the head that wears the crown
These niggas heads is too light
Put the Fear of God in these niggas, Pusha
It's like the changing of the guards
We changing out the frauds
I gave these lions heart like my name ended in Oz
Long time coming, Sam Cooking up these bars
Still Eddy Caning, see the fiends sunk in jaws (Yiuuck)
Push a ton, pledge allegiance to the raw
Known dope dealer that escaped without a scar (Yess)
I'm Buddy Lee so lucky me, see I'm home
Wish I could jailbreak my team like an iPhone (Woo)
Squilly told me take this motherfucker by storm
Get the money and they bitches, bring the prize home (Yess)
So as I embark, this where begin start
I write my own happy ending, nigga pen sharp
My life's a Kodak moment, I need a frame for it
The Penthouse's bed needs a crane for it
I'm fuckin' on it, exotic bitch from out the rainforest
So many bitches it's a blur, I take the blame for it (Woo)
God in heaven knows what I feel inside
Responsible for all this inner-city genocide
I'll be damned if I let Yale campus vilify
As I uplift this art form ceiling high
I can't identify, with your one death
We lose thousands over here, you speakin' one breath
Outsiders looking in like using one ref
My zip cam point of view to you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody
How cocaine single handedly carried me
Escaped clever through the fox hole narrowly
They kick dirt up on my name until they bury me
I just shake it off, then I shake a leg
A lot of time to make up is what Jacob said
The fans fell for your act, I tell you break a leg
Then guns shots going off that'll awake the dead
Push!"
8,Cook It Down,2011,Fear of God (2011),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"I went ahead and asked God for forgiveness
So now I'm just asking you to listen
I'm living in a World (in a world) where my truth can be my lynching
Last words ""f-ck you all"" feel the ropes tension
I'll never compromise, in it till the powder dries
Best friends drowned in quick sand and help you cowards rise
I floss in they honor, there legacy's in bottles
Make them walk like there 30 years is right around the corner
We was all f-cking Shawna, you and E was f-cking on her
I was jealous when you both said her mouth was like piranha (woo)
Yeaugh, spend money like we print money
Buck fifty on the car, that's little dick money
The AC is forever broke, that's vent money
Cocaine snowballed from gambling my rent money
Everyday struggle get money, get the crown for
Always thinking big now they praying for my downfall
Say you telling on me
Told them folks 'bout me
All this coke round me
Like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down
You know that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around.
I just bought the house
Put the pent on it
No rent couple can't hundred spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down
You that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around.
Got me loooking at the crown from a birdseye view
'Cause I hit the ground running from the birds I flew
Now I'm standing at the top from the words I drew
Rap shit'll drive you crazy, it done drove Shine's you
Yeaugh mazel tov, now I'm hotter than a Molotov
Tell Lyor I need a million for my monologues
A small price for my cocaine catalogue
Scout the coupe like a tomohawk
Travelodge stories
I pray that you ignore me
If you can't feel the joy of a hustler in his glory
Hiding money in a wall from the first to third story
ATL, Glenridge, condo's true story (woo)
A man of everything that I say I am
A little better than the fans, hope and pray I am
We the jokers out the deck and just play my hand
Smokers getting stuck and going nuts
Like it's peter pan
Say you telling on me
Told them folks 'bout me
All this coke round me
Like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down
You know that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around.
I just bought the house
Put the pent on it
No rent couple can't hundred spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down
You that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around."

Uh-huh
Beautiful evils
Yeah
Check me out
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
My young niggas sic' 'em
I don't get 'em
I just get back their jewelry if I'm fuckin' with 'em
Your man crush Mondays be owin' niggas
My skin is triple black, I'm the omen
You can't kill a God like the Romans, uh
Take my time to craft shit
'Cause I don't like back and forths with Puff about rap shit
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
Rappers is victimized at an all-time high
But not I, you pop niggas thought I let it fly
I'm Yasiel Puig, I'm in another league
I defected, only thing we have in common, niggas bleed
In ya thousand dollar joggers as you rhyme about ya dollars
Is there shame when a platinum rapper's mother lives in squalor?
Mildred's in the Bahamas for the month
She's probably sitting in her pajamas having lunch
Swordfish, my reality is more fish
Banana clips for all you Curious Georges
Old niggas slapping young niggas
Ha Imagine that, where you from nigga?
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is death by the masses
The only asterisk is the change of address
My infinity pool as long as Magic's
Yeah I let Zillow change my pillows
The home is so inviting, the Porsche is the armadillo
The silhouette
The pop, pop, pop; the chop, chop, chop
The throwaway TEC's got Tourettes
It's more than this drug money, I love money
I speak to your soul and that's above money
This the ministry of street energy
The church of criminology, teaching my chemistries
Woo I'm the L. Ron Hubbard of the cupboard
To some certain motherfuckers gotta love it
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims"
10,Everything That Glitters,2011,Fear of God 2: Let Us Pray (2011),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"(Hook: French Montana)
Better know who you is
When you lookin' in the mirror
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low (?) from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Ridin' with my niggas
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low (?), hold me from the haters
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by
(Verse 1: Pusha T)
For every brick broke down it's one stepped on
For every known rat, it's one slept on
For every loyal nigga fronted, one kept owin'
For every bitch I showed the way, it's one that kept hoin'
So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and a tour follows
Let's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow
My niggas embrace guns and ignore Bibles
Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines
The new jury can be you, ghetto law-abiding
Better know who that is looking in the mirror
The truth lies, and your soul can't see it clearer
(Verse 2: Pusha T)
I just can't leave it alone, I just can't leave it alone
They're handing out football numbers after tappin' your phone
Or you watchin' for the drop as they clappin' they chrome
Took a brick and I turned it to stone
5 into 10, the Return of the Clones
Then I took my experience and turned it to poems
As we took single engines and turned 'em to Boeings
Panamera blood red symbolize bloodshed
Loss lot of niggas, some in Club Fed

Too many clicks in the dial tone
I'm my city's Willy Falcon
How you niggas celebrating Alpo?
I'm disgusted
Interior rustic, the mustard-colored wall's adjusted
Trap doors everywhere
Macs come out the floor, dinners at the Forge
Four Seasons all four seasons
It's good to have a getaway for no reason
Concierge never speak
'Cause this week look like last week
They both named Ashley
I might travel to El Barrio
To get it from Daddy-O then adios
Cellphone at the back patio
I didn't have to make a cameo to get it off
I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it's FIFA
Yuugh! Pops up like dandruff
Beverly Hills Jed Clampett
A shotgun wedding to collect my ransom
Cameo Chris Hansen
I'm at your door
You don't wanna know him if you owe him
I done boxed in cars and had to tow 'em
I done laid in lawns when they didn't mow 'em
Even hogtied wives, I had to show 'em
That I mean business
I mean everything I say, no witness
No forgiveness, Souls of Mischief
It's on through infinity, my arms are endless
Your arms, too short to box with God
Might send a bitch a Elie Saab
She fucks and robs
10 grand just to touch the job
Close range, she don't duck and dodge
You can't trust them odds
I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it's FIFA
I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it's FIFA"

I'm go ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about ya, but I'ma get off, 'cause I'm feelin' myself

Came out ... from the days of my dealing

Still up on my nino, smelling like a kilo
But I'm down and fresh soft white like my pillow
Feelin' myself so ... like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free drove
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters

More's in my winnings, we can share opinions, like baby steps
We can share ...walk before you run, but she so independent
And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
We so real, got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed, watching dealer no deals

Smart enough to dedicate their work to their wing man
Keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling hand
Play my cards right, now I'm looking at a dream hand
Yeah, got you looking at my poker face
No joker see it, you can call me smoking ace

Strip it down nigga, Jim Joe
I build it better nigga ten fold
La Ferrari from the Enzo
The stencil inspired by Kenzo
The roof is like Ghostface, can it be so simple
40 keys in a rental
My dogs bring it back, now you name a better kennel
I keep cash, case Feds connect me
Case kids kidnap me, kids can get back me
Not concerned with your rap beef
Poetic justice watching you sock puppets
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
Thou shalt not covet what thou cannot budget
I bury 2 mil in the Caymans they can't touch it
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
Trap phone, gun at your backbone
Graduated from the corner where the crack's thrown
Back talk to your momma now you act grown
Listening to Young Dolph till the pack gone
I relate to 'em
I'm a Pyrex God, shit I'm great to 'em
All of you lil' niggas quote all of the wrong figures
Poke all of the wrong bitches
And follow the wrong niggas
Whichever rapper hot at the moment
Don't realize he a candle till he blow it
I gave y'all the game it's decoded
The only thing left is to grow it
Drop a shoe, start a Play Cloths or two
It's all hustlin', so deja vu
Still a nigga unwrap bricks
I'ma dye on that money like a bank got hit sniff
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
Game too emo, I'm too Nino
Must stay low-key, I play Reno
I'm so Pesci, too Casino
We Sinatra, Sammy, Dinos
Outlandish, so illegal
So Carlito, so Pacino
We sip vino, the grapes of wrath
Money counter go till it breaks in half
Coupes the flagship, it feels like futon
Palm the paddle shift, abuse the redline
The home is ranch style, reflects the poolside
Powder paved the way, the sword got two sides
Duffle a hundred bands, trunk is 2-5
Mules are flying in, the drive from Tucson
The dash is hollowed out, we shortened the fuel line
Connect is in Panama, in bed with the cruise lines
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it"
15,Hold On,2013,My Name Is My Name (2013),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain't hearing none of that street shit
'Cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I'm a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Watercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win
I was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Over night I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall, I got you my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
(I got you, my nigga, hold on)
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on"

It's like an itch you can't scratch
It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still want it
Sleeping with the finest
The thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwin' on the sherwin, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got 'em feeling like he's Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your World spin
Learn from OG?s, Alpha Romeo's and Sterling
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue, in the inside's potato sacks
Yeah, talk money, I'm made of that
Cocaine parties, like the 70's I cater that
You know what fame is?
Sittin' with the women of your dreams and forgettin? what her name is
You know what pain is?
Flushing 2 bricks and have a n-gga try to strain it out the drainage
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo
I still wanna sell kilo's
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the rico
I still wanna sell kilo's
Searching for the fish scale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilo's
That's what happen's when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilo's
(Rick Ross)
Grew up watching momma car repoed
A little n-gga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my own star
Piecing puzzles together solving homocides?
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red Velour, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
Fiddling dope a real n-gga sell yayo
Everyday a n-gga dies than we can't ask why
Show 'em all love, the bitches f-cked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce called ?, trunk full of work
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo
I still wanna sell kilo's
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the rico
I still wanna sell kilo's
Searching for the fish scale like I'm tryna find Nemo

That's what happen's when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilo's
(Ab Liva)
Testarossa top models, G4?s, Gucci pass the crease off
Everything I climb in, I win
Richer male, ?, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logo's in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rose bottles pour for the Champions
You think it was a Grammy win
Celebration spills through the morning like an ambion
Bithces love my ambience
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras
Thousand n-ggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousands keys that I'm about to do pilates on
Where the Kings crowned like the grill a Maserati's on
Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on
Cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, ya DeLoreans pouring in"

Drug Dealer? dime
Rap nigga?
You tryna save the culture?
A dios mio
You gotta pick one daddy
Leave your conscious at the door
We done hid the monsters in the floor
I speak to the trap lords
And niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards
I done been black balled
And never gave a fuck 'cause I'm Jack Frost
Of sellin' that blast off
I'm on a crash course
Where talent meets timing
Christopher Wallace, Think Big, keep climbing
Reasonable doubt, drug era, keep climbing
I'm my brother's keeper, Lord Willin', keep grindin'
As a God amongst men
Rinsed drug money, I done paid for my sins
Books and the lawyers, I done paid for my friends
Still held back, I done paid with my skin
The only thing missing is a cape on me
You niggas wanna tag a late, great on me
Put the fears in my peers, heard my footsteps coming from the rear
Now it's murder was the case homie
I'm watching this three ring circus
Old lions don't roar, so the clowns ain't nervous
Even you fools serve purpose
Let 'em run amuck until the king resurface
Then it's off with your heads
Wear your little jewels, you could floss when you're dead
They take samples of 'em, I make examples of 'em
It's the thrill of the hunt, I keep my mantle covered
Ask 'Ye who's loyalty more realer
Ask P, who's core's a drug dealer
Me and Tim, it's coming, it's gonna kill 'em
The only great I ain't made better was J. Dilla
Now we breaking new ground
Get ready for the placing of the crown
King Push nigga!"
20,Keep Dealing,2015,King Push - Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude (2015),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"They call him a crack dealer, I am like Warhol
A nigga paint a picture of a bullet for all y'all
Now crawl for him
My sophomore jinx is more minks
But only for my mother she'll use 'em as couch covers
You niggas cheapening my All-Star Weekends
If y'all can't swim in the deep end then watch nigga
Woo! 80,000 on this watch niggas
Yuugh! And I ain't never had to watch nigga
Rich or wealthy, pick your poison
I think I paid for one too many abortions
Another Celine, it's like a routine
It's like Ferris wheel of waist trainers and Seven jeans
Her new body's in my new body
Make her in an hourglass that's my new hobby
Rich nigga shit, how I blew my first million
Luckily was somethin' in the ceiling, keep dealin'
Talk numbers, but never talk 'em to me though
When you're the link to what fits in the keyhole
The realest nigga to marathon on the RICO
The last cocaine superhero
I got the cape on, to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Goddamn Batman holy toledo
Nah, you ain't talkin' to me though
The Robb Report of the snort
Kings hold court
Lawyers get bought
Palms get greased when them cases get fought
No felony what the fuck is you tellin' me
Reduced to simple assault
It cost to keep it hush-hush
It was just us
Ended up sellin' my Bat Mobile
The crash don't kill
It's how you survives it
Rebound on niggas, I nine live'd it
Couldn't miss a Super Bowl or a Cancun
Bitches ain't respecting niggas not in full bloom
So the neck is full moon
I'm living a lie, she live for this life
And loving the Alaia pumps
Loving the rush, I'm living ""The Wire"" Uh
Drugs and this rap is really ""Empire""
Rich nigga shit, how I lost my second million
Luckily was somethin' in the ceiling, keep dealin' ya
Talk numbers, but never talk 'em to me though
When you're the link to what fits in the keyhole
The realest nigga to marathon on the RICO
The last cocaine superhero
I got the cape on, to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Goddamn Batman holy toledo
Nah, you ain't talkin' to me though
Ten toes deep in the trap, nigga I'm good here
Feelin' like Tony reading words on the Goodyear
Big said, ""Only the FEDs I should fear""
So no threat, be on your steps with the whole hood there
Yeah, shoot up shit then we blow the scene
Kerosene in a 20 ounce Poland Spring
Nothing to lose attitude like Ron from Arizona
It's homicide when I slide up on ya
Reporting live from the project benches
Hella caine, dope in cellophane, dirty syringes
Heron zombies street-walking on three-week binges
Clientele look like the ""Thriller"" vid in 3D lenses
COD, niggas never had to front me jawns
I'm weighing bricks on the scale they put the lunch meat on
I'm Nino Brown in the projects
Yes, Curtis Jackson in his pyrex
Get rich or die tryin' is my mindset
And spend it all until I'm swallowing dirt
'Cause I ain't never see a Brinks truck follow a hearse
I ain't never see a dead man taking the stand
I ain't never see a nigga swallow a bullet
And live to talk about it
'Bout that bread, I drop a coffin 'bout it
You watched me go through hell, now watch me walk up out it
Nigga shit, that's how I lost three million
Luckily was somethin' in the ceiling, keep dealin' ya"

This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders
Gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided if you hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, and my side bitch I let tag along
Call me daddy from a complex 'cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard
Step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar
But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks
Fuck nigga, with the sly talk
Miss me, with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters big
You point us out just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For eleven years, we seen better years
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress
'Cause I'm King Push, still king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks
Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name dropping 'bout caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry 'Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash
Difference between me and Hova
But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks"

Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you
Uh, I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?
It comes with the territory when you buzzin'
A ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging?
I ain't trying to guide you, hand on bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
Thirty dollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke
So, no cuffing, no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone she's just bluffin'
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothing
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you
Hey mama come fuck with the shotta
With the Givenchy toppa, shoe Balenciaga
If you act right, I can match you up proper
If it's about a dolla thing, big like Poppa
Introduce your exes to my choppa
Don't listen to your best friend, she don't matter
You know she wanna be you in that vehicle
Riding in see-through V1 V2
Chanel or Celine, however I see you
Christians or Chloe, damn them C's too
You know I play fair, I'm Daddy Day Care
I know it ain't cheap for you to lay here
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want

All the ones I sponsored clear my conscience
Can't commit the crime without accomplice
We both to blame, let's push the shame behind us
On the DL, pushin' my brother's CL
Meet you at the spot, you had tint on the TL
It's only right you shake them phony types
And embrace the kid, like my bracelets did
Uh, I'm from the era where the money come fast
Blow it all cause the money don't last
All them broke niggas lookin' puppy-dog sad
She in that new purse, sayin', ""Honey, don't ask""
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you
Boy, let me love you
Boy, let me love you"

""Paid In Full"" was more than reading a script
Paid in full is really just being Rich Porter
Filling all standing orders
Would you question could I swim if you saw me walking on water?
Yeah, while every song got a rapper dance
Yuugh, I'm drug money like Dapper Dan
No retirement plans, no Derek Jeters
We all know I did it; Rodriguez
The illusion of money we don't believe in

Diamond crosses, hang Takashi portraits
Street millionaires rub shoulders
And laugh at bitches fucking promoters
Hoping that they get noticed, still driving a Focus
What you fuck him for if you didn't know what the goal was?
Shine, remote control blinds
That turn on the time lapse, controlled by the iPad

Two years later admitting it, all them niggas is renting shit
They ask why I'm still talking dope, why not?
The biggest rappers in the game broke, voilà
They say it's hate, but it's these well-dressed snakes
That learn to walk on the concrete, I just saw it and spoke to it
Yuugh, you ain't know, you got coached through it
Woo, the rap fans got hoaxed through it
Ha, the whole time I sold coke through it
Nigga, and records I was Bo through it
King Push is synonymous with kingpin
Chess moves on your checkerboard, king him

Is the shit that's most appealing to you niggas
Even I fell victim to it, your pride don't let you do it
The lies will get you through it
Money, pussy, alcohol, what a wonderful cocktail
Fronted my first brick over oxtails and ran with it
Dope is like a two-way street
The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat
Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep
Every sparkle in the club that wasn't ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
No reward, then what's the risk you taking?
New bitch I been fucking might start a rap war
Won't unveil it yet, can't tell it yet
Defense wins games Bill Belichick
These hoes having Google numbers, niggas better check

Now the Major League's where you're fishing
You young and hot, so why not?
The dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot
We can't judge you 'cause we ain't hug you
We sent you off to other hoods and let them niggas fuck you
For real, we made you watch from afar
Even talked down on you, tryna dim your star
Until we seen them foreign cars pull up
And watch them pick you up
And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough
So, make us proud, make it count
Until you learn to love 'em, make 'em spare no amount
Make 'em dig deeper to keep ya, knowing you deserve it
Take advantage of it when you're worth it
Real bitches worth it

Take a swing, snatch a chain
Lose your mind, go insane
I'm in the club, you in the club too
I got money, you got money too
You think it's honey dew
Whispering in my ear like a hunny do
Eyeballing every bottle that we running through
Trying to stand near, nigga damn near
Pushing bitches out the way to Instagram here
It's no pictures, now you in your feelings
I'm a real dope boy, no stranger dealings
Bruised ego, Henny-induced Debos
Nickel bag niggas, all of a sudden Ninos
I cancel all of you G-Moneys for G money
I get it done for quarter ki money, for real

And with these niggers walk around with, that's little flash money
Baby don't buy it
I know he's a ? player, but he's not gonna spend it
He's been put for much too long, so trust me
They thought I lay dead, I was playing pass'em
Spot me everywhere with the 8 like king goslin
Niggers think they sit at the top, they just pasturing
Now they hid their head like an ostrich
Optimist prime and they go wing
Feeling like I transform niggers still hands on
Whip me like a sandstorm, had the ? to sell it in a damn prom
Get you higher angelo, the author of this ant thumbs
Your punch lines are mere jabs, they see through
Like the clip glass on that coup... pass
Money on my mind like my pillow is a vault
You niggers is soft so when that pillow's where you talk
Can't fight it in them dealers, actresses on mattresses
Your real chance to loving you bachelors, I laugh at them
Don't you know that it's money over bitches
Bitches love money, I granting them 3 wishes push
Shout out my nigger don c, aka jivon ? don c,
Didn't even know that you got an aka digit, ahaha
Always in that fly shit, mike t, warrup? bring it
Or should I say in a national ? marcus paw, refresh, yeah

Drown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with similac powder in a baby bottle
Yeah, the formula is warning ya
Crack kills, offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother? Nigga, I'd be damned
Gator at my momma house, welcome to zombie land
A hustler's paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Down forty, but a streak will have you square by night
Didn't bat an eye at it, kept the pokerface
Cause the batter I add, it had the coca base
When you get to Heaven's door, they won't hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smoker's face
There's no feeling like your bitch +Chin-chilling+ right
You in Italian leather and you four-wheeling right
You know you up when you can count a quarter million right
And if you down, you can slang it like a pillow fight
I'm a wizard at it, nigga here's the magic
Make a small town feel I threw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bare witness as I unveil this instant classic

The first coming still here so I'll need a hearse

No pain, no gain nigga
They say I'm heating up, welcome to the flame nigga
No matter the success, still the same nigga
I only change when the new body came nigga
Aerodynamic, roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The 0-12 a year early, I'm a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at thirty and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need-to-know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
There'll be no waiting, I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
I'm here now nigga, pardon my lateness
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
Yeah, it's the new God flow ain't it
The Last Supper for you niggas now repainted
Take position on the chessboard and rearrange it

Got a call from my jail niggas, said I'm doing my damn thing
Woo, they see I'm doing my damn thing
Magazines, videos, they ain't missing a damn thing
Nowadays I sell hope, what you rather I sell dope?
What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad
Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke
I done been in that same boat, I ain't letting this chain go
Representing my niggas down till they free 'em like Django
It's the same old, just the same old
How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go
My mind wanders on a PJ, my mama brought up in the PJs
In the club sippin' P&J on the same arm as my Piaget, woo
If I leave today, throw the keys away

Every hero got theme music, guess I need me some drums
Bought me a five for fifty, I bust 'em down, it was jumps
Trying to be fresh as forces, I swear they white as new ones
Streets taught us, streets raised us, had it less determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murders, federal to state pen
Uncle got power, now I see him in another ten
We was set up just to lose, Lord know we trying to win
In the pursuit of this power, this masterpiece to the hour
You know it's platinum and waterproof, wear this bitch in the shower
Yeah, we want finer things, plus a plug in the scale
Yeah, them plates shining like diamond rings at back can't you tell?
In the hood I'm a king, King Arthur to the people
Except he got his on a chariot, I got mine in a Regal
Sportcars, Italian leather, Princess Cut, with baguettes
Law of physics say them nines weigh more when they wet, no regrets

I started out as a baby face monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm and hammer and a mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago, if he dies he dies
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries he cries
We don't drink away the pain, when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playing on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fucking with my sinus
Nigga this is Simon says, Simon red
Blood on your diamonds till you dying, dead, yugh
You better change what comes out your speaker
Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah
What is it?
You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Troubles on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis either that
Or my auntie was stealing it, hit the pipe and start feeling it
Oh wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when there's tension in the air nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said ""Daddy, one day I'mma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand grams of cocaine then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter""
He said, ""Son, how come you think you be my connect?""
I said,""Pops, your ass is washed up with all due respect""
He said, ""Well nigga, then show me how it all makes sense""
Go figure, mothafucka, every verse is a brick, your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)

You can't respect the new school when you played Hookie
Cooked white turn to tan, so the world is snooky

Flash and trail blazer transcend us, look to us for
The next mission when the tie dries up

Confidential informers disguise like us
Jail doesn't resignate with guys like us
Told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us
Didn't listen so prison is what they did to him

You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from countin' Jelly donuts to taking the most
From my high school sweetheart to f-cking with hoes
Look I'm all grown up and I dun blown up
N-gga ain't much changed, in fact, things are the same
I'm the definition of shooter, gun of choice the ruger
You'll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I'm a magnet to murder, when I'm in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I'm bad news, you n-ggas know the verdict, I'm filthy
Drop Phantom is milky
White on white, 24 inch blades of steel
Red eye smoking that bomb shit
N-ggas surprised, 50 back on fire
50 back running round this bitch strapped
Hitman for hire
(Pusha T)
I sit with the liars, ducktape and tyres
Been lost their soul
They just waiting on the fire
Innocent faces with a shit load of prior's
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGuyvers
Deep sea dive for the fishscale
Tryna find a better price, man that ship sale
Take a record head back if that shit fail
Drop weight like an anchor than you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine double scream when I turn the key over
Pirelli's on the street rolling like a steam roller
Bitche's double team when I have my sleep over's

Test it on ya tongue or watch a fiend do it

Folks rush in, 3 letters try and stop it
F-b-i-r-s-d-e-a (fbi, irs, dea)
One letter short but still muthaf-ck the DA.
We play by the rules as they try and crack the code
Combination locks to the kilo's that I hold
Leopard print Louboutin's, prowlin' the concrete
Roller balls come alive just like Jumanji

I'm glad that you noticed
The realest nigga here
It's kinda chilly being the coldest
Me and Timbo in that two-door, making our ""Otis""
Now witness the chosen
It's just different here
Monte Carlo nights, let her throw the dice
Play in paradise
All I know is white
Get the powder gone
Bitches love to shop, levitate the mall
Mattress full of money, let it break the fall
Woo! She used to fly on a buddy pass
They say when the money go, you hope that your honey last
I been preaching since money, cash-hoes
And I promise, I hardly see you
From where I am it's so hard to see you
Got money I've been different ever since
Maybe it's me and my arrogance
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you? We don't know you
Who are you? We don't know you
I'm the fire and the base
I'm admired by the greats
This to each and every rap nigga
I look you liars in the face
Cold case, Rolls Wraith
Big dipper, constellation in the ceiling, see the stars
See the jewelry, all rock, no guitar
Who you know better with the raw?
Bogota, she like finessing niggas
She gets a Range Rover Sport
And got seats on the court from the best of niggas
I never bit at that apple
I never lost my El Chapo
I can still grab it, and bag it and capsule
Covered in white like I walked in the chapel
I'm that cold
And I promise, I hardly see you
From where I am it's so hard to see you
Got money I've been different ever since
Maybe it's me and my arrogance
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you? We don't know you
Who are you? We don't know you
The last dope dealer
Red leather in a room full of Thrillers
The mamas, they zombies
Chase a nigga for the money, they behind me
Woo, safe look like it got a printer
Ain't no rappers in that Sprinter
Ain't no saints, only sinners
What bitch ain't fucked a winner?
I'm a blue ribbon nigga

But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey
Now when the phone start to click in, your words start to echo
Say you got to hang up but the man won't let go
Oh, my nigga say it ain't so
Now we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearing whispers, ""it ain't adding up""
Giving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standing up
I never thought I'd had have to question ""Were you man enough?""
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Telling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press five
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey
Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls
Tryna act normal but the writing is on the wall
It's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall
But I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall
They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone
And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home
Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome
I'm just tryna offset what he was saying on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like your honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak, saying
""Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey""
Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga
How many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga?
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is getting stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facing, once he told me that
""Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?

Lookin' down on you niggas like white folk

With no pillow, you just sellin' a dream to 'em

I just laugh at 'em, fuck is he doin'?

Take a glimpse of my life as I walk through it
Powder everywhere, like I drug the chalk through it
Catty-corner penthouse as I park-view it
Hit the jackpot; bulls-eye, dart through it
Music; I talk through it, it's an art to it
Let the critics praise, let the charts do it
As I burn through this money, no thought to it
80 cents could save a child, but I ain't opt to it
I just shop through it; cook and chop to it
Move Heavy D; I should walk to it
We got our own thing; drop the top to it
This is block music; Wacka Flock to it
I'm so raw, runnin' from the law
A nigga got rich from what you snort through a straw
Here to raise the bar; chain, no flaws
Say it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw
In that two-door, no rims on the car
The hate is so thick, you can cut it with a saw
See what I saw, the best getting better
Look, but can't touch; I'm a muthafuckin' leper

You niggers little bees to the base guard
I've been cooking, is you mistooking?
Shot town plug got the city junking
Jivon she motorcycle leathers,
Mad max 5 stacks before I look this weather
Small circle bad bitches all think they clever
The mix 1 whole shape and recycle better
Sit them on a curve when I'm done with them
She oblivious a girl wanna come with them
Can't blame off another niggers can't run with them
Husein bolt through these bitches then I'm done with them

Holy father to em, I ain't talking Jesus neither
Balance on the scale, I ain't a Libra either

Don't make a sequel 'cause we share the bitch of two

I build mine off fed time and dope lines
You caught steam off headlines and co-signs
Young niggas cliquing up with my rivals

Oh, suicide, it's a suicide
I'm just talking to the world like it's you and I

I'm top 5, listen, who hot in the past year?
Five heartbeats and I'm feeling like Flash here

Being laid over ours
Sworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?
Looking over their allowances
Building prisons where the mountains is
Laptops is for the county kids
Metal detectors is where ours is
They'll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery
And so it goes, every truth don't get told
All these cops get cleared, and lives are stole
Every goose don't lay gold whoa
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
They call in the National Guard
Public Enemy, I am Chuck D
Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I'm Huey P
Woo! The new elite, it's either you or me
Let the sunshine, 'cause their dark clouds try to ruin me

Or maybe you could touch it
See where it leads
Go head just beat it, like you was billy jean
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need
You in college now, so you too old to tease
I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need

I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe

Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless

Still trick with bitches, out with money or with ass shots

Whole 'nother level, then you add fame
That's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer
That's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar

Sport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas settle
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

Soaked, getting jiggy with it in Bel-Air's richest
With a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit

And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks
Ironed pair of dockers, two Glocks cocked screamin', ""West side!""
With the speakers blastin' a pair of Pacs
Yonkers 10 milli, you're silly
Thinkin' that this 'preme wasn't free, willy
The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful
And fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the

Rick James said cocaine's a helluva drug
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?

Two different worlds, same symmetry
And this black art, see the wizardry when you at the top

Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin' pin the trafficking on me like Mano and Tony

The president of G.O.O.D. Music has been announced
A quarter million a year and that don't bounce
I'm in the score of these movies, I'm losing count
Mu, you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce
My breakdown game bought me '8 Mile' fame
Selling Eminem to him and 'em
White to the Blacks I'm a villain in
The Rolls Royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem
Let's talk about it gentlemen
My barcode is Netflix ""Narcos""
Part on the side of my 'fro like I'm Pablo
No hablo, I sell blow
Lone wolf, no Tonto, head honcho
Yuugh, let's take the scenic route
I could show you the strange fruit
It's looking like Beirut
They open the wash bay, I climb it like K2
These kilos are drought killers, I flooded the Jesús, I made use
Of every Spanish name I done ran across
No matter what the weight, I done ran it off
I'm walking on water, I took the sandals off
Tell A&E to turn the cameras off, Push
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600"
45,What Dreams Are Made Of,2011,Fear of God 2: Let Us Pray (2011),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"(Ric Flair speech)
To all hustlas with the same interest
Bow your heads as the Lord's mentioned
Prayer service held in the kitchen
I wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen
I'm what dreams are made of
Cocaine Ronald gave us
Then Nancy tried to save us
By that time we had Motorola pagers
Now we push button start motors
Yacht owners, you small ballin', that's Pop Warner
Menage a trois in the bath house
Blew money on 'em, bitches never bad mouth
You glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out
You open doors, I open jaws and pass out
Luxury is just my lifestyle
I'm Scott free with a million dollar bright smile
You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I'd rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can't deny it baby
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of
Yeah, Louboutins under sweats
A hundred just landed from responding to a text
Niggas talk money but I'm still unimpressed
When these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling underdressed
Hip Hop bores me, hustlers applaud me
Too much school boy, not enough rude boy
Nothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy
And it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like the Jew boy
Bentley with the rag-top yarmulke
It says kilometers all on my speedometer
Cocaine under my tongue like thermometer
I got the fever, I never took a breather
Need a way out like Nas needed an Ether
Like Mike Vick chased by PETA
More pony hairs, more zebras
More pythons, more lizards"
46,Who I Am,2013,My Name Is My Name (2013),Hip Hop,Pusha T,"Our feet are trottin' broken glass
Don't forget
Woo, they said be all you can be
Woo, they said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie, I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever, I just wanna be who I am
Woo, they said be all you can be, nigga
Woo, they said be all you can be
Always knew I could rule the world, let's define what my world is
Knee deep in this dope money, damn near where my world ends
Same block, same rock, I was thinking 'bout murdering
I ain't getting my hands dirty, let you worry 'bout serving 'em
Yeah, they said be all you can be, woo, they said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie, I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever, I just wanna be who I am
Woo, they said be all you can be, nigga
Woo, they said the truth set you free
Entrepreneur, strip club connoisseur
Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you hallelujah
Pour it on you hallelujah, pour it on you hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you, ah
Red, white, blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's leftovers I still got to eat right
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She popping her jeans tight, all day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Woo, they said be all you can be
Pretty girls is my reputation, one on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation, to fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top escalating, elevating, good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going till I KO, eyes closed, I'm okay
All my bitches know they roll even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him, all night and all day and all night and all day
And all night like that shit's his motherfuckin' soulmate
'Cause no time for hand in hand when you got this paper hand in hand
Bitch I'm feeling like a grown-ass little boy, nigga na na na na na
Bitch I'm feeling like a grown-ass little boy, 'cause I still love to get pampered
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners
Woo, they said the truth set you free
Woo, they said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie, I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever, I just wanna be who I am
Woo, I just wanna be who I am
Woo, I just wanna be who I am
Always knew I could rule the world, let's define what my world is
Knee deep in this dope money, damn near where my world ends"
