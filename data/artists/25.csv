0,260,1996,Ironman (1996),,Ghostface Killah,"Cat I got to take him off of here, that's right
I got to take him off of here
Cause there's only one, and that's me
You understand? for all that fighting, you understand
That sucka think he good, that sucka think he can whoop me
And I know he can't whoop me, i...
Ay boy, the nigga whole style is chump
You understand?
Let me get mines first
Then after I get mines, you can do what you want to do...
(Ghostface)
Yeah, scandalous
Yeah miraculous, the arsonists
Yo, kicked down the door on the spot, 260
2l, I heard they had o's for sale
I heard the same shit, money drive a burgundy whip
Keep it low, faded licenses plates and great plate
Where's the cat from, think he's from new jerusalem
Pretty rick did his thing for him, but he was usin' him
Power sun, jungle, physical, you know the god
He go with tim, the one who called lover of god
While equality sell, I know the master law now
It's time to get the God jewel and blow like mines
But on the iow I heard he got born original sin
Back in a drive-through kentucky fried shot up his ac
We got to get him dunn, aliens is snatchin our bread
U.f.o.'s movin in with bigger plans than fed, yo
Knock on daddy-o's door get the scope
He's not home, he took ishmael to park slope
There go the the dreads yo, swindle two bags of that stuff
That get you crashed out had you laid out like bums
Peace keana, what's up with your girlfriend wanda
She drive a green honda, with legs like jane fonda
I just left her, she took rashean to pathmark then
Jetted to canal to get her man some cloth
She said be back in ninety minutes, ghostface God forbid
She say, peace to w, who's watchin the kids?
(Raekwon)
Two hours later, scheamin like deniro in casino
Son better have more coke than al pacino
Keana ain't tellin' no lies, last year she did a sting and a half
And tymeek bought her a aircraft
But anyway, yo, daddy-o home, we need the shotties nidow
When we get back, throw you a bit out
Later that night, stay mesmerized yo
Go get the green 5, meet you on the corner of marriot
You ready, you got the e&j and the machete?
We goin' upstairs, I hope one nigga is empty
We walked in, both of us, looked like terrorists
Masks on, second floor, dunn yo, I handle this
Kick in the crib, the whole shit looked graphical
Natural, fuckin' a white bitch, actual
Fiends chanting, ""do your thing chef, handle it""
I shot him in the neck, it ricocheted and hit carolyn
Ran to the back analyzin, much disguisin
Surprise we comin' and their eyes were tranquilized
And buggin, throwin' her twin cousins at his nugget, fuck it
Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby
Where the drugs, where the ounces you be bouncin'
Fake cats announcin on the block, you loungin
Where the blow at, I ain't got shit, stop frontin
(Yo chef, throw the joint in his mouth, money'll start stuntin
Bitch, show that bit, before I push your wig back
Chef stop wavin that, show him where the paper at)
Come here valerie, you know the God he need a salary
Put down the pipe here's two tickets to a coke gallery
It's in the kitchen in the ceiling
(Baby girl kept squealing
Only found a white block of cheese from new zealand
Oh shit! yo, yo where that shit at yo?
Yo chef, where that shit? what? what? aiyyo...)"
1,2getha Baby,2010,Apollo Kids (2010),,Ghostface Killah,"(Intro/Chorus)
""Together baby... together baby""
""Baby just you and me (just you and me) whoa""
Yo, yo
Aiyyo it's Tone, crispy like a pair of headphones
Used to play the 280 party rec rooms
Now I play the big spots all in the city
Spread champagne, scopin out bitties
Pick one, thick one son with small titties
It really doesn't matter as long as she's pretty
Come here mami, dancin right beside me
Tommy Hilfiger cut, skin like Halle
She looked like she get it from her momma (momma)
That's right Michelle, I'm Obama (bama)
Or maybe she get it from Madonna (donna)
(Material Girl) I still don ya (don ya)
Je-wels is for the girl if she do well
Knew she was dangerous, she rode me up too well
Her jelly roll shakin like she into the well
She wanna put my name on her new nails
(Chorus - repeat 2X)
Yo, yo
Aiyyo I roll on bitches, like a skateboard
Got a few friends that give they cake to whores
Me that's a no-no, Starks take control of a chick
Then I go deep like Tony Romo
Kick 'em right out and the day starts over
Where I don't stop drinkin' and I can't stand sober
In the morning when I wake up I get up just to ill
TD Bank is what I do with the mills
Bracelets, Cuban neck is on chill
Polar bear ice, I stay dressed to kill
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
Hittin the haze, now I'm on stilts
I'm too high, stuggle like Precious (Precious)
Love doctor niggaz get the message
When it comes to baggin a chick, don't be impressive
I get girls, y'all fellas is desperate
(Chorus - repeat 2X)
Yeah
Yeah, yo
Yo son tap that girl, excuse me miss
You gangster~! Far from a bougie chick
Love the way you talk, your jeans fit nice
Still a lil' hood in you, you just my type
Go 'head swallow that new roll, no disrespect
You front on me tonight I'ma bag me a new hoe
Spank that ass like a real papichulo
Picture me Neutron I sit you right on your culo
(Chorus - repeat 2X)
(Ghostface over Chorus)
That's right sexy lady
Come and have a seat baby
Come get a taste of this Patron and Nuvo
This that Jimmy Neutron baby
Your lipstick lookin' all good put your lips on this baby
Come sip on this, aight?
Check it out, let's go"

Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't Ghost
It's no joke iron coat rife him with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat

On the crime scene
Body on the block
Eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still had a lit cigarette between his fingertips
Danger when you step into the chamber with the master
Disaster, gotta blast ya, 'cause I hafta

The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed off, 'cause you worship the gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss

Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers

Like Keyon, got his wig pushed back, Five-thirty
Yo they gotta hit placed on my head, what should the God do?
Max out in Spain and do business with the Jews
Never that, them never look angry out of synch
The imperial, industrial king got weight
Don't give a fuck like the poor part, we watch 'Heart To Heart'
They used to push me in shuffle cards
Now I'm writing books like Ebeneezer
The porno teaser saying words like Sheba
Educated rapper fouling the teaser
My team got rocks like Six Flags, plus the Wu lab
Cameras in nine bedrooms we own tags
Don't touch this crackling hot shit
I snap ya shoulder blade in half, laugh, and pop shit
Reader's Digest, passed my book to L. Ron Hubbard
Got bagged that the world government tried to dub it
But devils love it movie trap raps cover the tracks
Like Ajax sharper than cuts laced on hardly scratched
Supreme clientèle, my cartel
Willie Star passed, shit his piece, where's the Nobel?

Throw a fiend in the sleeper hold got beef with the cold
Met my comrade go half on this lamp down in Baghdad
Flipping like a mex tab get money like an Arab
The type niggas snapped six legs on the crab
Now, hush, who wanna do what, my click better bust

Underprivileged,
Grew up in a Stapleton house village,
Where blood flood the water in the streets like oil spillage
When the water was flowing (Wu-Tang-Delphonics number one)
I spot a fifty-five borough
A nigga was still flowing voice was echoing
I rise high like an Opera's, Procter wouldn't Gamble
The sample, it shocked her
My ninjas run wilder than Shaka Zulu, some play peace like Donny the Guru
Others live to be wise and old like Desmond Dutcher
Undisputed champion, bell holders, shape and mould us
Soul Controller of the moon, I, solar and polar
I blow half smoke through my nasal bust my ways with thirty words

Hardy Boys shit... uh huh
Smoke a Winston to this shit nigga
Word up bout to fuckin' throw ya head up, Yeah
Yo, yo he got his stones from Greece
In mouth he had like thirty plus karats
Big ratchets, smoke cigars like a Bogart classic
Told niggaz if he dies he want a glass casket
Parents died when he was five years old
Made his way inside the US with Columbian Gold
A fake name and a passport
Benetton luggage, one sister, pretty thing, light skin
Niggaz will body over her like fuck it
With a scar by her left eye
Her brother Alex was extremely close, he sold coats and minks
Had trays put in toilets and sinks
Loved to roller skate, ninety nine did time up in Rahway
Came home blown, the thorough kings and soldiers
Never gave a fuck about that MC beef in Queens
Alex, he was a rich nigga
He had close to ten bodies under his belt
His man did the last one and got murdered himself
Took him a while to get his head together
Alex one day out in LA, made a call in New York
Told his man Oc, God it's goin' down, fly the whole team in for support
Remember that Ray shit that Jamie Foxx played? That was my shit
I never got paid, they got rich off a stolen script
In ninety eight I seen Charles on the Cali strip
Showed him the copyrights, his life in the real flick
In Braille, he read it in no time
Hit me with his math, said I'll give you some more lines
Real talk, stand up dude
Said how you like Jamie Foxx to replay you? He said yeah that's cool
But under one circumstance, you think he can bow my walk, flip my talk and my hands?
I said sure why not, he can imitate anything trust me this young boy hot
Shook his hand then I bounced in the limo
Grabbed my cell, bit my cigar and then rolled down the window
Contacted Stony Brook and Roberts
Told them we got it in ten ?, yo Ray Ray signed it
Now we can move on and shoot this live shit
With mad options, Paramount and DreamWorks we shop it
Or Mandalay and New Line cop it
I go and get ten mil' and blow it on the independent market
But anyway down in PF Chains, I had a meeting with this rich investor
Said they'll throw twenty million on the kid's film only if he chose the cast
He was drunk, he was talkin' real fast
So I test his mouth, laid back then I put him on blast
Where exactly we gon' get this cash?
I gotta ill Gotti Gigante connect
Wise guys that kill Bulotti, catching bodies, earnin' respect
The waiter came in a dropped off the shrimp fried rice he ordered
I said thanks as he poured my water
Then out came the veggie rolls, sesame chicken and mint tea
Rice wine had me wanting to pee
Said excuse me I'll be right back, pardon me
Grabbed his glass and he nodded to me
Skated off to take a piss, the shit felt like a nut
Got back the dude vanished, briefcase, script, and all
Ask the waiter where he go, the motherfucker spoke Spanish"
7,All That I Got Is You,1996,Ironman (1996),,Ghostface Killah,"What they gives you blood?
Three months man.
Watchu doin' in here anyway? You oughta be home with your mama.
How old are you boy?
Thirteen.
Thirteen? Damn, the bastards must be running outta niggaz to arrest.
Yeah, ooh yeah, this goes out
To all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real
Yo, dwelling in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm going through this difficult stage I it find hard to believe
Why my Old Earth had so many seeds
But she's her own woman and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits 'cause we was poor
Grab the pliers from the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rocking each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, Daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nothing but my Mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and Grandma held the family down
I guess Mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon, he peed in the bed
Seven o'clock, plucking roaches out the cereal box
Some shared the same spoon, watching Saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating, ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrassing I couldn't stand and knock on they door
My friends might be laughing, I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbour
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, Moms would lick her fingertips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school with her spit
Case worker had her running back to face to face
I caught a case, housing tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyse the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
I sit and think about
All the times we did without, yeah
I always said I wouldn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All things that I did from this to them
Oh, from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always
Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun, moon and stars
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man, woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality
And reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol' days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See, 'cause if you forget where you come from, hehe
You're never gonna make it where you're goin', aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a hole universe all over again
And again and again and again and again
Hehehe, yeah hehehehe ahahehehe"

10,An Unexpected Call (The Set Up),2013,Twelve Reasons To Die (2013),,Ghostface Killah,"It was an evil day the sun glistened over the city
Shined bright though the window and the eyes of my kitty
I was reluctant, a ball in the pit of my gut
Like the phone call I got was to just set me up
She wouldn't do that (nah) my love had love for the kid
So I slid on my wallows and bounced out the crib
Hit the block about 6 somth, shit got switched up
She pulled long inside and said ""jump in the truck""
So I did, we supposed to be gone for ziti
She made the wrong turn, I'm like ""where you goin' to sweetie?""
Felt the heat on the back of my neck
Did a mirror check, I didn't know what to expect
I got knocked out and woke up in the melting pot
I heard the delucas laughin' and then shit got hot
They say ""die tony starks, you gonna melt like a record
Never to be remembered, never to be respected
Yo I got word that my man got all
Rolling with logan, I told them damn that broad
No surprise why a shooter do this
Word in the street, she had a side deal working for the delucas
Word is out, apb, this bird is fowl
Put a price on it, the hood searchin' the house
The delucas won't stop without murkin us out
We should catch 'em while they celebrate and burst in the crowd
Tony dap shit is working me vex
They sayin' think chill, 'cause we'll let you circle the next
Don't need to boil in vinyl, can't let it slide fool
I guess it's just my time to die too
First of all logan gotta make a talk
Who's yo boss? who's yo boss and who make the call?
Tell me or not, you're sleeping with the fishes
But first tell yo boss that he will get hit"

Yo, check these up top murderous
Snowy in the bezzle as the cloud merges
F.B.I. try and want word with this
Kid who punked out bust a shot uip in the becon
Catch me in the corner not speakin'
Crushed out heavenly, U.G. rock the sweet daddy long fox minks
Chicken and brocolli, Wally's look stinky
With his man straight from Raleigh Durham, he recognized Kojak
I slapped him five, Masta Killa cracked his tiny form
E'rybody break bread, huddle around
Guzzle that, I'm about to throw a hand in your bag
Since the face been revealed, game got real
Radio been gassin niggaz, my imposters scream they ill
I'm the inventor, '86 rhymin at the center
Debut '93 LP told you to Enter
Punk faggot niggaz stealin my light
Crawl up in the bed with grandma,
Beneath the La-Z-Boy where ya hid ya knife
Ghost is back, stretch Cadillacs, fruit cocktails
Hit the shells at Paul's Pastry Rack
Walk with me like Darthy tried to judge these
Plush degrees, said the cow, wrap the fees
Gettin' waxed all through the drive-through
Take the stand, throw my hand all on the Bible
And tell lies too, I'm the ultimate
Splash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring, dolomite
Student in role holdin' it

Aiyyo, this rappin's like Ziti, facin me real TV
Crash at high-speeds, strawberry, kiwi
As we approach, yo herb, the Gods bail
These Staten Island ferryboat cats bail
Fresh cellies, 50 thief up in the city
We banned for life, Apollo kids live to spit the real
(Ghostface)
A pair of bright phat yellow Air Max
Hit the racks, stack 'em up Son, $20 off no tax
Street merchant tucked in the cloud, stay splurgin
Rock a eagle head, 6-inch height was the bird
Monday night Dallas verse Jets, dudes slid in with one hand
Two culture-ciphers, one bag of wet
Heavy rain fucked my kicks up
Wasn't lookin', splashed in the puddle
Bitch laughin', first thought was beat the bitch up
Mossied off gracefully, New York's most wanted tee-ball hawk
Seen the yellow brick road, lust of pastries
Same Ghostface, holy in the mind
Last scene: Manhatten Chase
We drew the six-eight digit in the briefcase
Rawness, title is Hell-bound
Quick to reload around faces, surround look astound
(Raekwon)
We split a fair one, poker nose money
Gin rummy with glare, spot the lame, bit his ear
Yo, you taste a tea-spoon, 300 goons, stash baloons
Locked in lab rooms, hit with glock, stashed in Grant's Tomb
Clocked him like a patient, his stock's full, hustle invasion
Knowin' now, we cocked a block off, the chain tri-color
Freezin in valor, ice-sicle galore
Gas station light gleamin on the wall
Cop WiseGuy jams, James Bond vans
Niggaz flipped Timbs, rock boats under water, watch clams

14,Assassination Day,1996,Ironman (1996),,Ghostface Killah,"(Raekwon: What? Hey yo!)
Intro: [from the motion picture ""The Usual Suspects""]
There's no coke!
What?
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke!
What the fuck do you mean, there's no coke?
I've been up and down this ship. I've been in every fuckin' room!
There's gotta be coke!
There is nothing! NOTHING!
Huh, uh, uh, help please!
Huh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, help me! *gunshot*
Intro Two: Master Killer
It's assassi, it's assination day, I stalk...
It's assassination, I sta...
It's assassination day...
It's assassination day, I
Verse One: Inspector Deck
Ryzarector, Madman, uh, uh, yo, uh
I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I lived, a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk
Three G's accost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisonin the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh
Trapped in deep-water gaspin
I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action
Verse Two: RZA
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears
Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensabe
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mike is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches
Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable
Interchangable, caution flameable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retrieve through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare
Verse Three: Raekwon
(Assassination day)
First of all, before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon
Don, spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurgin, mergin in the suburbs, using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aimin like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shootin it like they blew top snow
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti
Verse Four: Master Killer
War is extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback...
It's assassination day, I
It's assassination day
It's assassination day
It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy
It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy"

And if it's a girl, ooh, just like her momma she gon' be so fly
What a joy we made from the love we made, yeah, yeah
Yo, aiyo, I ran up on the corner, poppa warned her like, ""what?""
She pulled her shirt down, smiled, trying to hide her butt
I said, ""Nah, baby girlfriend, you ain't gotta do that""
Hope you ain't the anorexic type trying to lose that""
Us boys like 'em thick, short weaves, curls, braids
I take 'em buck 50, 60 with them thick legs
We can sail it out, five nights, six days
Boat cruise, wardrobe flights, everything's paid
If I'm aggressive just pardon my gangsta
I just wanna get to know you, get to show you
The way I move, that's part of my gangsta
Like art, yo, I can sit you down and paint cha
Plus my stove game's up, no red meat, but having you
In my cipher right now, makes me feel complete
Like a baby going night, night, sucking on his baby bottle
You in a class by yourself, all them chicks follow
If it's a boy his swag and ditty bop'll be just like mine
And if it's a girl, ooh, just like her momma she gon' be so fly
What a joy we made from the love we made, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yo, she cook and clean, matter fact she saved my life
When I'm outdoor, she check and see if I'm alright
I'm okay, babe, how you?"", I'm alright
Just that the baby's kicking, I want some Popeye chicken
And my back kinda hurt from the way I was sitting
Hurry home so you can rub my big belly and kiss it
And I need some, don't be fresh, girl
You know I can't help it, baby, it stay wet, girl
Yeah, that's my joy, love, strawberry shortcake
Leave me weak in the knees where I can't even walk straight
That's the reason why I got two court dates
Grown nigga like me let his thing blaze for that
I was raised in the Stat', that's my word
I pluck something if you fuck with my bat
And my name ring round the way, girl, she the sweetest thing
I love you Starks, writing hearts in between our names
If it's a boy his swag and ditty bop'll be just like mine
And if it's a girl, ooh, just like her momma she gon' be so fly
What a joy we made from the love we made, yeah, yeah
I will be the sweetest thing you've ever known
Like a kiss on a collarbone
I wanna be ya best friend, your homey and your king
And bring to fruition all of your dreams
And so you're having my baby
So stay forever my lady like Jodeci
Now, push, push harder, harder
I'd rather you be wifey than to be a baby father
If it's a boy his swag and ditty bop'll be just like mine
And if it's a girl, ooh, just like her momma she gon' be so fly
What a joy we made from the love we made, yeah, yeah
If it's a boy his swag and ditty bop'll be just like mine

Damn, damn, ma, we ain't even have to go through it like that
It wasn't even, even that big, man
You know, nah, it's ight though
But anyway, yo, let me get that coat
Let me get those jeans, and let me get that rock on your finger
Oh, it's stuck? Then I'll take the whole finger than, man
Let me get those bags from Paris, and the puppies is staying, yo!

(Ok girl) Yo, what I did was wack
But you don't get your man back like that, no
(Ghostface Killah)
Aiyo, I should just bark on you, burn your car on you
'Cause I'm too much man, to leave a mark on you
You'se a bird you know that, giving that man
Ten points, like he about to blow that
He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids
In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it, to him
Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'sucker, you know me'
Stop fronting for them people out, side like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'mma holla at dog
And rip his head off, words of a song
(Ghostface Killah)
Aiyo, I thought we was iller than that, all them kisses
And love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a brother went to war, vests banged up
Staining in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homey in the passenger seating
Honey, look, I'm a monster don, I do monster things
That's why I put your ass under my arm
Messing with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female
On no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you'se a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you
(Ne-Yo)
Shorty what is you thinking bout
Didn't I put you down
Flyest whips, rollin' round like yeah
That's the bosses chick, on the side
I might of had, one or two
Them silly broads wasn't nothing on you
Rolling with him, try'nna get revenge
That's what you just don't do
(Chorus to fade)

A lot of niggas done got bodied
A lot of niggas done got robbed and shit
You know what I mean? We love a lot of things in the hood
But time goes on... and if we don't change a lot of shit
Shit always gonna be this way, and that's a muthafucka fact!
True gangsta shit, y'all, yo, yo, yo

Live from Staten Island, where the gangstas kill
Only place on the map, that got the 30 dollar bill
And we front like we got millions
Our specialty is how we willie, niggas
That's how Buck brought the building
And the police is pussy, they protect and serve
They connect, with baseheads then they frisk our birds
Smack DVDs, blowin' herb, I'm in the room
Bonin' these two white bitches, Ice baggin' up work
That's how we get down, fuck Vegas
The black Carlo Gambino, rockin' the wallo's
Blow his diamonds in Z-No's, spicey, verses is jalapeno
Best to leave, when I'm in the big Escalade, I'm sittin' on Dino
Tone Stark, a poet's art, kiss the girls
And bake them pies, clean up, some are old darts
This that real live don' shit, you heard!
(Chorus: Ghostface Killah)
Yo, they lick forty rounds, today
Okay, plus the shit is mad hot around the way
Niggas don't give a fuck on any time or day
Or if he dyin' today, or could he find a way
Blow niggas over 'turt, bitches, dimes and trays
Blow a nigga a jewel and watch him slide away
It's like that, in the hood, he in the grimy say
But what we try'nna say is gonna ""be this way""
It don't have to... it don't have to... ""My God!""
(Ghostface Killah)
With big carrots and static, with that leaves the bad habits
Drugs layin' in buildings with great big automatics
Anonimos' in the hood, it's a fact, we could do magic
Splatter faggots in lobbies, the heat burn off his eyelashes
Don't try to pass this, back up or you'll receive something
Real tragic, them hollows'll race through your jacket
Semi gangstas with weak tactics
Forensic scientists called in to display graphics
For square inch to his back winds
They brain is spleen, it's left all over a fiend's mattress
Bastard, we cock and squeeze after we leave our ratchets
We keep the hood cryin' for massive havoc
No Trix we take from silly rabbits, yo feed them lead carrots
The little man'sll connect and they touch that fabric
The only thing that can stop 'em is that tephlon phat shit
Maybe artillery's heavy like a bunch of fat chicks
Brrrr... baow! Ain't no comin' back bitch!

My defense'll fly the coop off your mean office
My skills is a fortune, robbin' leech out a suite auction
Teach then fall off the greatest, fuck what they say
'Cause we against the abortions, and we
Lay low-oh-oh, silent those clownin' foes

Get retarded, and once you -- I'mma fix these artists
Take 'em one by one, tie 'em up, line 'em up
Treat 'em like a cigar, fire them niggaz up
Heavy up in the club, six/three tree'd up

Hoppin' over chairs like O.J., my rushin' yards
Depend how the meter spray
Happy wife-beater day, don't touch my, cheeba hay
Get off my D-I, then go C the K's (case)
'Scuse me Mr. D.J., please play ""Fish""
Or that ""CherChez"", live meeting, ten four, may day-may day
Callin' all cars, callin' all cars
We have an APB on Starks and Trife the God
We left the jewelry store, feelin' like we left the morgue
We was frozen, and I brought an iced out Trojan
That's for pussies who's golden, who got Toney wide open
I put my ring up to my man's waves and seen an ocean
Move like a wolf, kid, in sheep's clothing
Snatch the money bag off the milk truck and kept boating
I be potent like ibuprofen, I be coastin'
With two shotties on me, in your grimiest lobby smokin'

Because I hadn't heard that voice in such a LONG time
I turned around...

That's right y'all, y'all shoulda seen what I did
So so pretty, so pretty - y'all hear how she sounds right?
She sounds crazy right? Yes
This what happened at the bus stop

She turned around and this grown lady said hi
I was quite stunned from the way she replied
Peace, nice to meet ya, sweetie call me Tony Starks
Ghost if you like ta, mind if invite ya
Over for some red wine, nice Barry White huh
She pulled out a cigarette, hon here's a lighter
Her voice was a slow jam, full length white mink
Hella fine with a beauty mark on her right cheek
When she spoke her smoke floated when it left her throat
Spelled honey when she blew it out it turned to water word
I was infatuated
She put the perfume to her neck and sprayed it
Plus the bottle was nickel plated
It make a young girl steez yo feel outdated
And know the married chicks shopping with they man's hated
One stone on her finger was green, Maybeline
Cover Girl lipstick, plump color fingertips
Revlon face blush, oh-five-six shit
The ashes was hangin' off her stog' so she flicked it
Damn, had to bundle up, I call goosebumps
Plus the windchill factor had dropped, here the bus come
I never rush one, here take my number miss
I live alone, her face fell when I dropped the chrome
Damn, can I have YOUR number? {*bus pulls away*}"

Sock it to me G.O., the block we spot V.O.

I might shoot ya, make your ass an example
You can't fuck with Tony Starks, get knocked, get trampled
Get hunted like a rat in a field, I hate that
Hate fake ass niggas that love to set traps
Murder the don, I'm back with a bird on my arm
Back to pillage, I rock a live grenade as a charm
I want bodies, [?], spread into the waters
I want mothers and sons, I wanna murder their daughters
Revenge, all I see is blood in my eyes
Like the rise of your worst nightmare come alive
Ghostface Killah, let's see who's gonna survive
He spares no one, he's not forgotten
'Cause he was somewhere
Yo, look away, don't stare into the eyes of a killer
Metal lungies, junkies, nigga, I pack the nine millers and thrillers
Bulletproof robes and [?] caps
Revenge more, nigga, you know Ghost gone stay strapped
Hunt them down in alphabetical order
Each person that crossed me, watch the man slaughter
The butcher, the baker, the torturer, the taker
I'mma send you right back to your maker
A few extra holes, miss your soul sold to the devil
It's the rebirth of a slave brought back as a rebel
I'm immortal, gonna kill generations of your fam
You tried to loathe my legacy away, but I stand stronger

I'll play to the sucker DJ, lookin' like Enrique
Told him to throw in that Supreme Cliee-ente
He said just gave a nod with a thumbs up wink
I just put down my dollar bill, took off my mink
Bartenders know me big spenders, gave us those monster drinks
Sent us lobsters and cigars that stink
Playing them oldie but goodie classics, them honies had fat asses
Noses runnin' from the raw, they hid behind they glasses
Toney with the Montana, I came to play
With my long fingernail, yo honey you should pass that yay
Let me see what color you got boo, I got that beige
I see y'all from the perihperals? ladies far right from the stage
I'm thirty-three, I look twenty-six with big furs on
What y'all inherent the Santa Maria? Y'all money that long?
Your father must have fell back when y'all started fucking
You asked me what I think about dude? I say fuck him
And this one bitch called me Fat Albert
The way my pockets had the mumps you know that Ghost is 'bout it
Then I asked these young ladies do they buff helmets
They said fuck you, took a sniff and then they didn't tell me
Just because you left home, this is Tone... Yo you see I flip stones

If y'all ladies was all mine I'd teach you well
Free tales, sweet smells, slee? well hear bells

And when you wake ? you woman the whole world can tell
Word life, put you to school when the clubs'll stop
College girl, pay for your books at 200 a pop
And all I ask in life's for you to be careful
Stay focused, take care of your health
Have kids and marry a prince
Good luck and happiness
And no longer shut yourself in, taste the pain, the sorrow
The sun'll shine and still come out tomorrow
And maybe be a secretary, business woman, 5th Ave., or run a library
You got the right conversation, education, and looks
With the right intelligence to stay away from them crooks
Baby get on your feet, be an acocuntant, doctor, lawyer or nurses's aid

Peace, the summers mine, I blow the biggest

Tackle clubs, never rock Lugz, I'm way above
These mic's is like golden gloves verses spark plug
It's like the pennant, Seminars the Play-off
Start the J off like Cochran got OJ off
The Specialist who eye balled the mistress necklace
Perpetuous, this curly head kid's treacherous
Leggo the Eggo, so we can dip dip dive the gleego
Throwing can-can, eat that plus this Instrumental
Awwww Shit say Stark-aligist, Starks-aligist
Fried fish halibut pull out the bull horn
And celebrate like Kunta was born
We elbowed our way inside loud and got on
I played the building, burn a branch and get filled in
Like Pilgrims G-ing Pepperidge Farms from out a million
Who wanna rhyme? who wanna challenge the swordsman?
That rock that fisherman hat like Gordon's

Man handle brain killing erect my hidden
Streets may be potent put your 96 bid in
Vampire Curse disperse on each verse
Swim in black water, act slaughter through my earth
You're hit by my element Great Wall of China
Mountain Peak hold the globe like vagina
Measure on my mic stand, molecule and strand
Finger rolling rhythm ride the horse one hand
'GoldenEye', 'Spy vs. Spy', guilty of suspicion
Chess boxer, mic in dead body position
40 oz. Ciga-art, three verse invented
Divine universal black man representing
Similar the pure, rhyme blowing out the pore
Battery in the back, keep it charged for the raw

I met her out in Chi-Town while I was out in Greek town ordering Gyros
The Bad bitch keep the tool in her bible
Quick to murder her rivals and her pops was a gangsta Disciple
He Killed about a thousand Vice Lords guns and knife wars
The feds came for him so he slid to the 9th ward
Down in the N.O.
And right before he left he wrote his daughter a memo left stacks in a Benz-o
It got hot niggas selling giving out the info
He paranoid every 20 seconds out the window
Blow it into limbo he spazzed on Lorenzo
He smashed him in the head with his own son's Nintendo
About a week later the boys came and rushed him
Kicked down his door while he was sleep they cuffed him"

Caught up in my spell, smell exotic, blunt from different trees
Black gloves, bullet's will fly when the 9's squeezed

With dust and weed on him, knock the neighborhood bully out
Take his gun and pee on him

Judges get kidnapped, casualties get decapitated
Starks rise above all to be emancipated
Black Godfather, families at war
Drive bys and Molotovs settle the score
Butcher shops are filled with chopped up casualties
I made sure to keep guns, you know my faculties
The streets run red when the bosses disrespect us
Neglected, I guarantee no man's protected
To each is own, grab a gun off the shelf
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self

How you prepare for war? Grab your guns and your hardware
Never close your eyes in the barber chair
The heart of a lion, that's what got him here
Bulletproof the car, yo we outta here
Fuck the DeLucas, we've got shooters with submachines
Bone-crushing niggas like a football team
Under a new regime, The old we throw it out
Spin back the hammer, let the lord sort 'em out
Keep your gun cocked, at the whorehouse
Sip the brown liquor, while we move a quarter ounce
Pick the territories, move north or south
The high power shine, Yours is watered down
I'm underground, with the vest is on
Open up your head, now your flesh is torn
Never turn my back up at restaurants
Put holes in your chest, come test the don
45 in my holster, let me stretch my arms
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self
So the DeLucas want Tone? Nah, not today
Cock and spray, side with 'em and you've got to pay
Don't even kill 'em, just make 'em feel a lot of pain
Stake out his wife and his seed at the soccer game
Greet 'em with open arms, beat 'em with no regard
Feed 'em two two-threes, freeze 'em, leave 'em with no resolve
Make a lead on me, repping for the territory
No stepping on me, brethren that's a negatory
You want a war? These men pop dangerous
Taking all in a 10 block radius
Murder rate double, triple, cripple the strip
Like it got hit with a couple of missiles

The TV the crack epidemic. The real drug dealers, fake cops is true apologetic
How would you like to be in the court of law? How would you like for me to put a bullet in your head as large as a baseball?"
45,Camay,1996,Ironman (1996),,Ghostface Killah,"Intro: Ghostface (sample is Teddy Pendergrass)
What's happening [love was never born to say, goodbye] what's happenin'
[Love was never born to say, goodbye] Yo, yeah!
(Smoking?) Yeah.
[Just another helpless] We gotta come smoking
[Fool in love is what I am] This is it
(We smoke baby) [just another helpless] another chamber baby
[Fool in love is what I am] slide y'all in
*Cappadon* You know how we do!
Verse One: Raekwon the Chef
Yo, what's the deal Goldielochs?
Ain't butting I'm just hibernating love that watch
Pour me some Scotch and cold Courvesoir out
No doubt, have a chair Boo let's get to prolly in
Who you wit? Me and Molly and some trick from Yugoslavia
What fabric is that? It's only woolen Rayon
Lipstick crayon fly, Vere on ice spray on
I'm getting tipsy, I hope she read cocks like a gypsy
And transport bricks steal in many fifties
Fuck negotiating is you wit me is you waiting
Sweet as carrot cake, faking plus you don't eat turkey bacon
I don't get down like that, I don't get down neither
Cuban Linx skeezer, why you acting like a rap teaser
I'm like the jury exchanged plus arranged
Nigga you small change I only fuck with Figaro chains
Analysing Miss Clairol, Fendi down mascara on
Assistant manager in Paragon
Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass
Say goodbye...
Love was never born to say, goodbye
Love was never born...
Verse Two: Cappadonna
Socializing, vibing with my eyes on dot
She this book cover lady that be blowing up the spot
While my heart was racing, like the hands on the clock
I step live I think she see me putting out the pot
Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous
How's life today your hands are softer than Camay
Too your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you riding on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice
She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, intelligent
Whispered in my ear that she's celibate
Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there
As I grab the hand set her politely in the chair
As we stopped to stare at one another
Black sister, the brother
I'm thinking all the time how she could be my lover
Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass
Just another helpless
Fool in love is what I am
Love was never born to say, goodbye
Love was never born to say, goodbye
Just another helpless
Fool in love is what I...
Verse Three: Ghostface Killah
What's happening brown sugar? Say you look so good today
Ankle bracelet rapt around your leg
Here have a seat, complementary drinks is on me
Bartender Chevalier châteaux at table three
Luxurious rings, eyes sparkling
What's your name sugar? Juanita Cash Hawkins
Your complexion gives a reflection of
Sometime a black woman just need to be loved
Quiet and shy, baby girl my gift got you high
Made you wanna hit me with the keys to that file
Just joking baby, I have a sharp sense of humour
Wish I would of bumped into your frame a lot sooner
What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three
Half Hawaiian with a slight touch of Chinese
Seen you working at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue
Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you
Yo, I'm all into older woman, who's happy living
Love kids and, keep all up and this in the crib and
Not afraid to doubt need a God on your side
We holding hands till death do us apart and then we slide
Earring in the left side of your nose love my combo
Should have left wiz a thousand times maybe tonight though
But you sexy motherfucker damn what's the recipe?
You make a nigga wanna GOD DAMN
Can you cook darling, at the stove you're revolving
Bake macaroni, turkey wings, a nigga starving
Here take my number let me pull the chair from under
I had fun plus your backyard speak with thunder

Pretty little Sally sat up by the tree trunk
White miniskirt with a Betty Boom bum
She had a ass like Deborah Cox, face like Lauryn
Waist like a Coke bottles scoring
Pretty young thing loved the swings
And times she got my ding-a-ling hard
When she said push hard, she kept vaseline
Open as she swung back, couldn't help her dress blue back
Now held accountable right for my actions
Right before the Wallabee Champ was rockin' wallows
Drawin crads, sent her rap message through a bottle
Lines from Dolomite, few tips from Goines
Birthday, gave her two 50 cent coins
Puppy love, gorgeous face, amazed by lip gloss
Cherry cent, when the princess spoked yo it bounched off
Mole like Marilyn Monroe, threw a rose in her mouth
Wherever God go will be Mrs. Coke
Girl's so pretty, kids with little niddys
Hope the years go slow, slow
Surrounded by intelligence, life through education
Healthy minds will grow, grow
Catch me on a bus-stop, dustin, cursin out
The cops are still coming, vibe with me
Everybody's talking about Wu-Tang fronting
But you still telling lies to me
Beautiful in lightshows, having no intentions on love
But having strung eyes of oppose, here we go
It's not the way she bubbed the gum, shooked her ass
I'm not the one, double dus, waiting for the bus
The faggot Nore son, now year later
Lady 7th floor, building 7-80
Fancy fox, booties for her socks, nothing else can change me
Young Nefertiti, knowledge seed with no jewelry on
Tahitian fresh berry tree, she's a capricorn
I really liked the girl, had dreams about her
Thinking to myself some nights she got (""powered"")
But hating, was Shinene and Grace and Key-lolo
Trick bitches jumped my boo at the school a few years ago
Hit me, you hit me, Grace got the last hit
Eh yo, the bitches started swinging and shit
So I jumped in
Those were the days, made faces in school plays
Paper trays, city wide test, made half a days
Shooting puppy water, might hump the pillow, dick a inch taller
Stapleton bum nigga, I pop a cherry for her
Fresh air fun, here's dunn, alphabets, berets
Jellies, bubble yum, soda tongue, too young to cum
Then engage him with them candy rings
Eh yo, I hit that shit, got jealous when she kissed Rob
I broked her chicko's sticks
(Outro: Ghostface Killah)
Guys and girls, y'all remember those days, and shit
Girls walk around in school, one ponytail with the beret
Next looking like baby powder, youknowhatImean?
Those were the days right there
Boston baked beans, girls come to school with mad candy
YouknowhatImean? You'd just come in school for half days, and all that
Just to see that little girl right there, ? to this
Go home and think about it, youknowhatImean?
May hump the bed sometimes on her, youknowhatImean?
Word, those days man, those, those were the good old days right there G

Might get a little, go to the G.O. Store or something, youknowhatImean?

Right from my Lady's sock with two bodies on it

Lost so much blood, these bitch niggaz in they periods
They say I be living the role, like 'Pac in Juice
And only fuck with fly bitches that get fly and boost
And they ears be chandelliers, lit up like a lamp, Who cares?!
They cooch is fierce, the only thing loose is hairs
That's right y'all, if a rap nigga say my name I'm a fight y'all
Fuck a state, light charge

Sic the beasts on you, turning mothers to morners

Tango with dirty Cash, Cocaine jacks

Package the raw, Theodore, We got the game on smash
'Cause we cut from the same cloth
Big guns ready to bang off
Slide off the cables and take the rings off!
We hold the weight of four Synagogues
Jelly'd uptown in them beat down rented cars
Going mad wetting 'em
Milk cash, heavy tecks, hood rats, sexin 'em
Paris crew, little dudes, please!, I was reppin 'em
Niggaz couldn't come through (word)
That's when the block was like wallpaper, loved sticking niggaz like crazy glue
Blackouts happened, God forbid don't be around!
The Bag Lady will murk you and let off in the next town!
She struck two times, get caught, good luck blood, it ain't no heines
Blow a hockey puck hole in the back of your spine
She put two cut up mirrors in the place of your eyes
So when the cops look they see theyselves, they all gonna die
It's the tale of the crips and bloods, pimps and thugs
Get your face bashed in on the concrete rug
On that note I'm a say peace!
Theodore! Word to Darryl Mack's teeth!
Yo, Ayo I'll break every bone in your wrist
Smack you in the back of your head on the block while you holding your dick
My semi, they call it the crouching tiger
A hundred bowls of Total is trash, because my lead eat through fibers
Peel your potato like Arriada
On the day of your death people had candles but couldn't find no lighter
Fuck your marrow! fuck your hood!
You ain't a street legend like me!
Blake Carrington holding the Dynasty
I muffle motherfuckers up like meineke
And write a thousand bar verse that all rhymes with ""eat""
Jewel thief, Shizzam bangles, in the vault deep
And cruisin desserts mad heavy into salt treats

Picking niggaz off by the Red Sea
And did it all for Ghost, sniffin on caffeine!"

Ayo Kane found Logan lamping at Deluca's
Sitting with a little black boy, she called him Lucas, he knew it
Found himself the daughter of a kingpin
The ex of Tony Starks, it's a win-win
His seed, the grief filled up in his eyes
He kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge
Pillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz
No friends, no foes, only evil to expose
Let's make a video
Tell Lu I got his grandson and daughter
And I ain't lookin' for no ransom
I want revenge, I want blood, I want his head on a rug!
I want him to watch me strangle his daughter
Butcher his babies, attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies!
M-80s stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm
This is just the fuckin' tip of the storm!
Tell him to come! Tell him we need to speak man to mush!
As soon as he step in the building...
Ambush!
(Lyrics Born:)
At day break, the Delucas made their way through the main gate
Quietest cougars chasing wild gang prey
They cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps
They raided the Kane gang [?]
The look on Kane's face when he realized what was taken place
He was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee
He sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight
Afraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang!
But wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, ""Lucas!""
And began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane
Blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings!
Finally it was over
The Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters
They shifted through the dead remains
The bedrooms, and the entry way
Where the hell is lester kane?!
(Chino XL:)
Now what is this that stands before me?
Underneath this wack off coughing
It's Logan and her half beat offspring
I got the nod from Kane that I'll be enforcing [?]
(Lyrics Born:)
Kane's gang had no imply the Delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days
They knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route
The hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house
Where to find Logan and her afraid child
In a dark corner where they were being held
They were blindfolded with taped mouths
No light or water, arms and legs bound
(Chino XL:)
But there's a double cross of course, I'm hearing guns letting off from somewhere else
I'm ready to get involved with the revolving [?] warehouse all by myself
I dive underground finding rounds
(?)

Yves Saint Laurent frames, sipping Ciroc berry
Burning the big dutch, sweet feet up
Long ashes, hanging off the blunt then I pluck
Fell back power napping, stones they cover my bones
Bricks laying on my pinkie like tombstones
Unbutton my shirt, unloosen my tie
Got the fireplace up real high, Cuban maid sliding me cookies
Tall glass of lemonade, chandeliers hanging over my head
Sitting like a cloud of haze
Larry King on mute, they about to bury Wesley for taxes
Then shot across the two
Then I grabbed the remote, hit the volume on the big lion
The screens in his mouth, a ninety inch giant
Went to commercial, the phone rang
""Yo, what up Sheek?"", ""Ain't nothing, Tone, just on my dean""
""Out here in Queens, I bag me a queen""
""Fed her all this shit she wanted to hear, she probably want the ring""

'Cause I'm ass naked watching the clock
He hating, but his wife steady watching my cock
Different time zones, steering wheel on the right
Driving down the wrong street, thinking what the fuck I'm gon' eat tonight
White women laying in my bed, I can make a documentary
On what race can give the best head
Rae hit me on the text, told me that he like that new shit
Last night that he heard on Flex
All right cool, hit me up when you get down to Brazil
If the weather's right, fuck it, I come down to chill

I got weight on the spot, that's 'instagrams'

In the mood, getting nude in the swimming pool
I'm doing my thing, how I'm repping
They salute king, and they don't even know I'm Wu-Tang
Name heavy, phone call to my ace Diego
For anything, what up, man? Connect me
I snatch bank like four, five, six
Deuce high, watch a dude ride, I'm on my shit
Up in Mansion, salute, world famous Inspectah
Click large, homey, put some more tables together
Wild for the night, I ain't even think about my flight
I got some bitches and they tripping off that powder white
Aiyo, yo, yo, kiss each other, yo"
66,Do Over,2009,Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City (2009),,Ghostface Killah,"This is a story of a player from the Island
That lost his way, such a price to pay
To kiss those girls and make them cry
Kiss those girls and make them cry
To love, to lose, to plead for a do over
A do over, give me a do over, I want a do over
It's that Radio Raheem and Ghostface Killah
If you know I was out of line, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?
Aiyo, I used to get a threesome, every other weekend
Cheated on my girl 'til we nearly stopped speaking
She broke down and cried and it hurts so bad
Her friends went and told her I was a brand new dad
Of course, she knows now, I ain't used no bag
My excuses, I couldn't cum like that
She warned me of days like this, if this should happen
She'll be out and we'll be the ones sharing the napkin
Silly dilly me, didn't follow the instructions
Don't bring nothing home, I don't wanna hear nothing
But brought to the world
Innocent, two month old little girl
But what am I to do? Yo, I lost my boo
It's like being kicked out the group and lost my crew
Throwing the baby up to someone I hardly knew
Nah, that shit don't add up, what am I to do, yo, I lost my jewel
If you know I was out of line, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, I wrote this right here on the bus to Riker's
Right next to the thieves, the cons, the lifers
For mad years, you held you down, I'ma overwhelmed in pain
And the worst time to leave you, now
I'm sorry, please forgive me, the streets caught me
I appreciate your concern and support for me
Most important your honesty and trust, your heart's incredible
This the truth spilling out of my guts
If I would of took the chance to see
What was place right in front of my face for sure nine out of ten times
My actions wouldn't allow me to be so naive
And blind to carry out these mistakes
I'm cheating, running around, blasting my gun
For me my rep on the streets like touching a son
You're like a fingerprint, I never find a match like you
Thanks for your patience you find a man I hope it's true
If you know I was out of line, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over? Radio Raheem, yeah
She was screaming out the window, I was walking up the block
Throwing out my Timbos and all my clothes
She said, if my apologies
She said, the lost won't fit those
And I said, baby, now let me explain
I know I had fucked up, it was a one time thing
So take all the time you need in this life
And if you let me do it over I promise to do it right
If you know I was out of line, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?
Hello baby, I'm sorry for everything that just been going on lately
You know, I've kinda been stressed out
I've been thinking about the things I did to you lately and
Not listening when you was telling me to chill
Now I wind up in here, it's like, you remember, listen boo, listen
The way you rub my face, the way you talk to me
The way you look at me, I know ain't no girl in the world
Gon' ever give me that like the way you gave it to me
So right now I'm pleading and this is my word on everything
I'm on my knees, babe, just take me back, give me one chance
I'm asking for a do over"

We gon' handle our business and shit
These muthafuckas know not to come around here like that
This is real shit, real talk
Four different niggaz with four different aspects, nigga
This is family shit
Who the fuck said family ain't family no more, nigga?
This is tight shit, tighter than white in ya wallet
(Verse 1 - Ghostface Killah)
Yo, I'm talking heavy bags of coke, bracelets on every men
Innocent dope pushers, overnight kingpins
Indeed, we smack niggaz up for the cheese
Throw bleach in ya face. Got beef? Let it be chuck
The streets don't know my peeps
Jumpin' out of UPS trucks, blowing niggaz off they feet
With four-four gloves, rims spinnin,' tippin' on fo-fo's
My mouth be worth millions, something like Paul Wall's
Ladies look out; they ain't thugs, they homo's
The film look hyper, when I clap 'em in slo mo'
Y'all still paying the mob? We whip niggaz out like waffle batter
Theodore ancient with dart, flossin' them diamonds
Discussing our hits over a glass of scotch
Baywatch bitches that ski, take turns when they hand us the twat
Think not, we still run the trains, till the condom pop
On the low, we still fucking them cops

I'm like damn, what a wonderful kid
I could do what I want, doing dirt, not serving a bid
You know a real fam handle they biz, everybody get searched
From the grandpops down to the kids
And my time, I'm officially here
Tell ya man go and start up ya car, start shiftin' the gears
Sun God got the pits for his hairs 'cause niggaz is scared
Hopin' I don't let it blow in they ribs
I said hot, niggaz get robbed nonstop
Once the gun cock, niggaz strip down to they socks
And my fam at the tippity top, I won't stop
Believe it or not, you and ya man is close targets
Juks everything, dice games, mini markets
Fam gon' spark it
I'mma take whatever's in the pockets, mostly the cash and the wallet
Slide off the jewels 'cause you shinin,' begets and the diamonds
Never deny niggaz with iron (Yo)

Ay yo, chillin' with the Caesar crew
We can smoke, all in the halls
It's how many niggaz with guns, got 'em on
All tip top, cling to the fullest, mad bullets
This is a hobby, the lobby where they clap yo hoods
Get the paper, word to everything, we a acre up
Barbequein' like a mutt, we ain't taking nothing
A high tech extremist, Gatorade, paid ya boy some money
To lay up on the low, swinging beamers
I need to be an actor, but instead, I'd rather be in Hempstead
All of my bread came from crack barbers and shoppers
So much beef in these whoppers
Guns that'll knock out floors and hit choppers
What? What? The family remains, 'cause it's grain
It's automatic, I live it and I claim it's real
Come around here, you bow here
Yo, lay that half tape, then you will get wrapped real quick
(Trife Da God)
Ay yo, we hug the block on President's Day
Swinging all year round, gettin' that money the American way
Might run up in yo wedding, grab the reverend and spray
And let the shots for whatever they may
This is family, nigga, minus the mob size
The resurrection of Tony Starks ""Trife Dies', starring in Part 5
Niggaz'd rather die when they pride's in question
Tryin' to play hero, gettin' stuck for they prized possessions
Look you staring in the eyes of oppression, that's why I ride with protection
Extended clips, super sizing my weapons
Five eleven, keep the heat tucked
That'll burn a hole through ya stomach like acid reflux
Get buried in ya cheap tux'
We make it hard for you niggaz to keep up
Been through a hundred towns, and running, beating the streets up
From up north in New York, down in Miami
Pumping at the table, breaking bread like a family

I changed shit on the block and got rid of the fools
Things'll be different, no need to feel pressured
No more drug houses, little kids could be treasured
The streets ain't filled with crackheads and D's
I go walk around my hood, nigga know my steez
Philly, about to rebuild the nation
Through the knowledge of self, through education
Freeze, motherfucker. Hands, hands, let me see your hands. Get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car. Get out, eat some fucking dirt. Get on the fucking ground

I seen the police pull up, and rides hopped out
Put your hand behind your back, you're guilty without a doubt
What you mean, son? We built on this
Illegal chokeholds, slap cuffs on my wrist
I don't know what you talking about, boy, I'm the authority
I'm just here to question up minority
A thug drug pusher, violent man of deception
And you just happen to fit the description
Nigga, you just another pawn in my chess game. I taught you everything you know, I run this motherfucking city. Think you gon' fuck everything up? You got the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in the court of law. (Faggot ass police nigga, man) Nigga, you're going away for a long time
(Verse 3: Ghostface Killah)
Okay, I got it, niggas just set me up
Do their dirty work and thrown behind bars
You want wars? You got it - Tony ain't the one
I told you before, I make murdering fun
Gotta swindle the kid, have me masking your enemies
It's all good in my chest, I got ten of these hearts
And I vow for revenge
Tony don't stand for crumbs and fake friends
(Verse 4: AZ)
It's funny, only if niggas really knew
Got the keys to the city, I could kill a whole crew
Put the squeeze on the willy, get silly, go fool
Chop a nigga up, blame his body on his dude
What it do? It's bigger than the boys in blue
Beyond definition what this falls into
M's in my optic, no ends to the profits
Judges, prosecutors, politicians in my pocket
Hostage, high life, living on the edge
Toxic in hindsight, see me when I'm dead
Pledge, sworn in to serve and protect
What a web, catch a neck, then I'm onto to the next
Shit be booing, played out scripts, need a new one
I dare a nigga doubt what I'm doing
Moving, cash rules everything around me

Lil' niggas bussin' off they punk heat
I'll make a massacre, try to rob one of my donkeys
But I ain't wettin' that
I don't wanna send nobody back, violently take a nap
Promise you got something, Lord, that I honor you
Blow your lil' head off while you're tying your shoe
But back in the kitchen Pyrex's
Occupied by the twins, bank robbers with large records
Hard vests, 86 got guards on, Benetton rugbies
And frames that fake guns when they rob [Incomprehensible]
To them that's natural action play the [Incomprehensible]

Rock you to sleep like I got these little bitches, come over
Hoping you fall for the bait thinking you safe
Had that ass sweating like T.D. Jakes
I want the ones, nigga, you non believers, you can ask your momma
Now that's drama
Dollar icy from papi with the scraper glock with the laser
Trying my best not to pop yet but the trop is major
Shot my lil' 'cause I do my aunt the favor watch this
I never been this itchy hope the cops just
Get a doughnut urge and just splurge you bot he nerve to play third
In a softball tournament round my way say that's your word you bird
I'll put your beak on a curb but anyway
Looks like a good game the pigs ain't leaving so I'm a lay
Nice play, just too bad it's your last
Couple bundles of D and 200 cash to sack you in the grass
So watch the teams line up, shake hands, guess the games over
Faggot nigga, hopped in a Liberty, fake Range Rover
I'm on his tail like Sonic little shorty palming on a 40
Broad day, I'm trying to dodge a cover story
Look like he stopping for gas I'm a pluck him, yay
This had to be his most unlucky, lucky day
2 brothers come out of 7 Eleven in army wear and stand there
Acting like my tires need air
He closed the gas cap, too many things going his way
So I just stashed that you probably think I'm bugging but, hey
I know them games in Lindsay Park is every Sunday
He ain't going nowhere
I went home switched gear went out and grabbed me a beer
10 drinks later I'm at Burger King window for a Whopper
Look left and see partner, I hit the stash bloka
Who the fuck you think you is Ron O'Neil
Tat tat what the fuck when that 9 milli peel
Is it real realer than Pittsburgh steel
Yo Ghost pass the toast these niggas is daffodils
Got buck naked bitches counting half a mil gloves on
Fully dressed bitches watching them with they snubs on
While I'm in the kitchen pretending to be Raekwon
Watching Rachel Ray all day, I get my cake on
Fiends love me like a Drake song
Rep that Louboutin bottom in my back pocket all day long
Black Wall Mafias, Wu-Tang Sopranos
Niggas steady pushing keys but we don't see pianos
Niggas steady pushing Phantoms, we don't see the opera
Niggas steady rocking dreads, you ain't even Rasta
Take your New Era off and reveal
The fact the nigga you are or your cap getting peeled
Then we out to Brazil I know niggas in Negril
That'd chop your fucking head off and throw it on a grill
Take the gold out your mouth and throw it in they grill
Send a finger to your moms and let her know that this real

Top 10, how the fuck you gonna forget Compton
Every rapper on your list'll get their shit stomped in
I started soowoo, I'm the reason for that 5 shit
Came in the game on that fucking ready to die shit
Sold 9 mil ended up with some fly shit
Naked pictures, R&B bitches, all in my sidekick
How I be killin' the pussy should be a hate crime
Got a Blackberry was getting to much face time
Back to fucking project bitches now I hate dimes
All they want is money, my nigga, I can't waste mine

Little kids that's killas and love doing bids

A big spliff in my ashtray, July sunny day
And I'm feeling idle, slide through Medina, son
I done pushed everything, I love the way the benz swing
So I turn my music low, caught a thought, wrote it down
I seen 'em come back from out of town and get laid down
It's music loud, windows down, summer heat vibing
It's live when I'm gliding, I'm smoking while I'm driving
Riding, mini skirts flirting while I'm passing
They waving, I'm leaning hard, cruising, grooving to the beat
As I move through these mean streets, I beep at the seeds
Stop, bless 'em with a little gwop, ha
I keep it rolling, picture me, twirling
The big truck, yukon, my sheep skin showing all the leathers
It's a cold world, winter war weather
This is wu-block music for the black hooded champions
Step in the car and go
Round down by your lady and I
Be waiting at the door
We bout to go (""drivin' round"")
What is the key to life, with no ignition
Another jump start, then I'm on my mission
I keep id, insurance and registration
Wu music, good hemp and stimulation
Pull out the station, yield to pedestrians
Blacks, whites, asians, indians and mexicans
At the light, the bass head, fragile as the pringle
He ask me can I spare change, I throw him singles
He mimics my song that's on repeat
Addictions so strong, got him in knee deep
Buttons on his lapel, picture of obama
Four years later we stuck in this same drama
These street corners, just over crowded saunas
Biggest losers drop weight, sweating from the trauma
Education to a thug is well debated
Each crime is kinfolk, all bloods related
Step in the car and go
Round down by your lady and I
Be waiting at the door
We bout to go (""drivin' round"")

Officer of the law, why you touching me for?
Checking the crack of my ass, and looking under my balls
Strip searching, touching my person, dropping my drawers
And to top it all off, I ain't got nothing at all
I'm a hard working tax payer, for that nature
Do forty hours a week, slaving for that paper
I'm try'nna make an honest living, it's not much

In a cell, with thirty inmates blowing Newports
And I'm awaiting to be arraigned, these niggaz doing the same
Nodded off in a corner, the bailiff calling my name
In front of judge, looking filthy
Asking my lawyer how I plead, I plead not guilty
He set bail, momma love on the edge of her seat, biting her nails
Stressed out, the look on her face was mighty pale
Her son's going to jail, a black innocent male
No justice, but these kids say justice prevails
Stuck between a rock and a hard place, the God's face
Truly explains the pain and the heartaches
It's too much to partake, but I'm still fighting
Still got my hand up, even though it seem frighting
It's a fucked up system, niggaz, please listen
The old tradition plants in this country, it needs fixing

You wouldn't believe (what) what just happened to Steve
He got bagged up town with a brick in his sleeve
Plus an asshole full of dimes, so when he see the judge
You know he gon' get an asshole full of time
Linebacker numbers, no distracting this hunger
And they was watching 'em for damn near, half of the summer
It's a shame how that boy that bagged, right on the Ave
One four-fifth, d's was hopping out yellow cabs
Guns drawned, told 'em get on the floor, gave 'em a run for the money
And in the process he dished the raw
Had the whole precint on him, cops sleeping on him
Them faggot ass rednecks started beating on him
Usually roll with a pitch in his fifth, or heat is on him
Was a risk, but the nigga insist, he keep it on him
It's a fucked up world we live in, for all my niggaz been maxed in, in prison
Going back to the system
(Chorus x2: Trife Da God)
The moral of the story is there ain't one
This is just a tale, take a look at this picture, I'm try'nna paint one
Go into my mind, and see what you'll find
Events that all took place once upon a time
(Trife Da God)
They say I'm grimey, but I'm cool as shit
I show you how to use a bitch, to move a brick
Half a kilo stashed in the uteris
Don't gotta say a word, she observe when I move my lips
She don't sit when she piss, she 'stand up' like Ludacris
My bitch, she'll shoot a snitch, quick fast in a hurry
And then she'll hop her ass on the Ferry
Push the pedal to the metal, pumping gas in the Chevy
Hit my whole team off, serving ass in the telly
And she ride for a nigga, like Kobe's wife
This is Trife, no comparison to Obie Trice
And when she bark, man, that's only right
'Cause she be starting a flick, starving for dick, on her lonely nights
But Tone told me to play it close, before she leave a player broke
He seen her in Medina with Katrina stealing baby coats
Her pops got money, this shit is worth eighty notes
She nineteen and fiend for 'Ice Cream' like Rae and Ghost
Good girl, or bad girl, nigga, they all the same
See it's not how you fuck 'em, it's how you teach 'em the game
You can shape and mold 'em, but you sure can't control 'em
They have you dealing with six, going through the emotions

To the nearest telephone and call the fire chief up

So run along with your little buckets of water
There's not a nigga that can doubt my game or doust my flame
I'm know to cause a panic when you shout my name
Fire, you damn right, nigga, I bang pipes
It's not a fucking room in this building I can't light
I'm the definition when you mix heat with friction
When I walk through I set off all sprinkler systems
I'm that kid with the firey flow, the firey glow

Peep the barcode, leave the booth, wrapped it in charcoal
Sippin' on firewater, plus I keep a cigar rolled
The human torch, special effects, cannons is shootin' off
Leave body bags full of ashes, we ain't no move to cost
Spit flammable bars, I got a whooping cough
Scarlet red, six forty five, with the dual exhaust
My barrel blow like dodgers, pop one in your rider
And cause a meltdown at One Police Plaza
I'm the opposite of aqua, hotter than a plate of pasta
I'm the reason LaMar Odom was traded off the roster
The hot stepper, crushing ya niggaz like hot pepper
The forty cal' squeeze a nigga, my heaters apply pressure
In the kitchen with the gun steaming, six hundred degrees
Feeling like you in the desert with the sun beaming
You can't block me with the sun screening

Pull down your little red drawers and start to kiss you all over
You hope it last forever, I know baby, I hope it last forever
So I took off my paisley pajamas I got from St. Thomas
Yo, I love you so much, so let me pay you homage
And if you do, yo I promise never break a promise
So can I give you the honors my little Pocahontas?
Play by play, Miss Camay
You like a Zales Diamond in the window, right on display
You just a shining, precised in every curve you cut
And for your daddy, yo, you never have to tuck in your gut
Because I love it like that, stretch mark fat
Plus let me show my crunches to burn it off
Just lay right on your back and let me do my love dance
I pop it to the left, I pop it to the right, I get it all night, come on
Them other chicks must hail to the queen as I
Put them dudes straight up and check 'cause the queen is mine
Last forever, last forever
We can be broke, holes in our coat even still we shine
We got each other through the bad and the best of time
Last forever, last forever
Yo, yo, I'm lost in love, with nowhere to go
She says I'm a pain in the ass, boy, get to the store
She can say that 'cause we best friends, we play together
She carry my left rib, therefore we pray together
Bury me on top of her in our graves together
'Cause when she feel pain, I know how to make it better
Talks, some long walks, communication in parks
Understand what she's going through, our listen was smarts
Especially when she's on her friend I be hoping it leave
I have to bite my tongue just to keep from arguing
Six days of that is like who let the monster in
After it's finished then I can get on top again
Shorty girl's my oxygen, never catch her gossiping
Look it y'all, this my flower, she gon' keep on blossoming
Long as she is mine and I am her, we gon' ride the wind
This lady here is all for me, I never have to lock her in
Them other chicks must hail to the queen as I
Put them dudes straight up and check 'cause the queen is mine
Last forever, last forever
We can be broke, holes in our coat even still we shine

It's game time, gear the lacing of your kicks
When I bang mine, ain't no escaping out this bitch
And your chain's mine, kidnap the bracelet off your wrist
Heard it through the grapevine, that you was hating on the click
(Trife Da God)
I'm not Chris Tuck', but I'll tuck them ratchets
When I was young, I used to beat off, and fuck the mattress
And I promise you, step out of line, see what that llama do
Demolish you, rip through your chest, hit your abdominal
My hammer hold twelve like a dozen of eggs
And your man'll get bodied over something he said
I'm not a blood, but I rock nothing but red
He got his button on, I heard son fuck with the feds
Why niggaz wanna fuck with my bread, like I ain't starving
When I reign, I leave niggaz in Payne, but I ain't Martin
If I ain't gone, I'm gonna move the weight by the carton
On the plate carving, find me out of sight like a martian
And I'm bobbing and weaving, dodging the precint
Hit I-95, blowing cigars on the Decon
Even when I'm fucked up, you know the God'll be eating
It's all good, my hood is like the Garden of Eden

We make hits, classical shit, spit acid
Turn bodies into ashes, T.M.F., we the masters
Father to your style, so you can't be called a bastard
Held fast in close casket, on the verge of collapsion
Demolition derby, car crashing, heart smashed in
Brutaly, I beast on beats, Broadstreet, Staten
Usually I creep black heat, in dusty clothes
Then drift from rusty 'fro's
Communicate; Sprint to Sprint, somebody knows
Phonetap, info'll get leaked like cognac
Seepin' through plastic cups, no caps on the bottle
Sold crack 'cause I got to, feed my seed is my motto
Believe I'm leave the hood, I hit the lotto
But wherever I go, you know the hood gon' follow
With them hollows and a tech, spray Windex
Glassed on niggaz get chin check
Theodore Unit, nigga, we out for them ten checks
(Trife Da God)
I'm in the kitchen with them pots and pans
And when them guns start to fire
Ain't no telling where them shots gon' land
Niggaz smile up in your face, but they not your man
So it's obvious they not gon' stand
I'm on the block, every day, moving yay', try'nna knock off grams
If a nigga steal from me, I'm gonna chop off hands, so don't
Get it confused, niggaz, give up them tools
'Cause when we walk through the spot, y'all get up and move
I'm a nigga that stay bending the rules
Take a real good luck at a crook, and remember this dude
Now keep that talk to a minimum, 'cause niggaz be quick to peel off
When that shit jump off like Lil' Kim and 'em
Pumped off adrenaline, got his man drillin' him
Feelin' him, gasin' him with all types of words
I'm like the rain forest, I got all types of birds

Don't be surprised nigga, you let those cops in

Berettas tucked in our leathers, strapped with terrorist bombs
Shorties, running around with more Gunz than Corey
Getting high off weed smoke, blowing your funds on forties
You'll be amazed how these rappers try to run with stories
This ain't a novel, muthafucka, this is guts and glory
Pain and struggle, the game will crush you, it's a everyday hustle
You want to eat, you better strain your muscles
Hopeless martyrs, afraid when approached by mobsters
With them grams, call me Sam the way I'm ""coachin'"" ""carters""
With starters, listen homey we can never be partners
Don't get it twisted, handle business with my hands and revolvers
The grown man, that'll touch up your wig, like beauty parlors
Pop niggaz, like, how we pop bottles, you do the honors, nigga

Spot you twenty points, and you still can't win
You can't compare Grey Go' to gin, you too thin
Y'all niggaz is hubcaps fuckin' with big rims
If the shoe fit, then your foot in my timb
Masked up, hoodies and gems, I couldn't defend
Your title small, a deuce-deuce next to a rifle
The hackle'll snipe you, disconnect and dis-mic you
Disrespect your rivals, have you dancing like Michael
Moonwalker, uh-huh, platoon bark, goons in the dark
Only lights from the spark, boom-boom in the parks
Vocals in fumes from my darts, lead the roofs on the part
Fuck up your happy home, daddy's back with a chrome
Snatchin' ya throne, you mimicking, you actually cloned
Finish him, I'm crackin' ya bones, diminishing

Who playin' outfield without a chest shield?
Wanna move? Choose ya weapon of steel
Nigga we 'bout reppin for real
Only take a second to peel
Should've known there was a Tec in the deal, nigga"

""Ack, just by destroying Starks Enterprises,
We could cripple their national defence.
So, you Professor Finkle, the world's greatest
Expert on electricity must devise the destruction
Of Starks' mighty guardian, Ironman.""
(Ghostface Killah)
Yo, summer time holdin' the 9, split the Vega in half
Jeeps rumble and my dogs puff grass
Bank stoppin', high-derox hydrolic
Kid with the most knowledge will obtain to touch top dollars
Hold me down, hand me my cake, dusty, bake, activate
Fuck your corny debates
I'm like cake or maybe like $10,000 rabbits
The kid walked through, switch up his accent ""Now I'm from Paris""
Cash the bill, frozen element, Seagal
Signs from the most high causes me to break them all
How the fuck was y'all niggas thinkin'? You think I fell off the ledge?
The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead?
Never, Impossible, pull out black burners like tonsils
To gallants, hit 'em if we go to
Bustin' at y'all niggas daily
Wall-to-wall, Hawkins
Suckin your teeth 'cause God chain-talkin'
Like Ghostface this, Ghostface that
Ghost sold crack, now his revelations spoken through rap
Valored down like the sheik of Iran
Gasoline CREAM wrapped in hospital bands
Model vans, Michael Davis, it's me against housin
Extraordinary pro-black, sold God creations to control thousands
Catch me at the flicks, Apollo rap Fredick Douglas
You know what? Eh yo, fuck this
Eh yo, how can I move the crowd?
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instructions, put it together
It's simple ain't it? Well, quite clever
*Singing*
Marvin, Marvin, you were a friend of mine
You stood for somethin', ugh
Tupac, Biggie, oh how we miss you so
We want y'all both to know
We really love you so
Eh yo, I'm Gucci down
Wally boot, Jamaican hat, long 4-pound
Ask niggas how I get down
Don't speak much, deluxe plush
Imaginations holdin' all like Willie Hutch
You might've bumped into me on the Riker's bus
Weed in my teeths, jem in my beauty sleep, sleeve
Dead serious, knowledge by 2% triple geese
Come on, we juggle mic's
We come on all the amps, advance the final
Show these niggas how the way we dance
Hot night, Jamaica
Came through in a boger green '68 Pacer
Had mad paper, high as a fuck
Truck, 2 rappers got stuck that night
I ain't sayin' no names, they know who, thank you for the change
Outdoor event, New Year's Eve, Cali weed
30 seconds till we tear and decease
Quick, call all my seeds dipped in the crowd
The hoe spotted me, knew not to call my name out
He walked off softly, we exactly
Formed like Christ and the disciples
Black fatigues, lethal-faced dunnie, he held the rifle
We had the whole shit shook, you favorite rapper's droppin' they drinks
On the low, tuckin they links, we made 80 off the books
(Superb)
It's like '86, Magic Johnson, no disrespect
My metaphors'll keep out The Projects
Rap connects'll keep me correct
Eh yo, I wrote this on Donnie roof
After his funeral, on one knee
Thinkin' his killer's followin me
So to my nigga Donnie, up there
Can you please tell God that we fucked up here?
We got beer, weed, guns, AIDS
All these obsticles, it's hard to make it nowadays
Watch the Devil in it, some say it's our fault
If that's the answer, you know smokin' can cause cancer
Let me drop a bracelet, leave a chain behind
My tape stay at the beginnin 'cause that's how they rewind
Y'all know how we dine, we don't eat swine, and we don't drink wine
If you don't bring me some motherfuckin cognac, I kill you
I can't feel you
Ain't in my senses, and you ain't in my dollars
I fuck with rockwilders, no leashes, no collars
Brolic scholars, that's Ghost Deini!"

Listen, man, it's going on 2007, g

Fuck that, let's get this paper!
(Ghostface Killah)
Yo, yo I was sitting at the table thinking
How the hell do I murder these M.C.'s, sting 'em like bees
My attitude's that of Hannibal, not compatible
Why I would damage you, fuck, if I drink, then ran with you
Y'all chose to war, so called rich niggaz wanna verse the poor
I'll rob you first, then go to your earth, it's not gon' hurt
If you try calling the cops, it's not gon' work
All you gotta do is lay in the dirt, we dug a hole
And my guns weight more, yo, then Gerald Levert
With more blubber than a Ruben Studdard, I grease the pan
With rhymes, and y'all can't believe it's not butter
I told y'all to chill, stretch all out like franks on the grill
With a classic deal, I'm like a farmer when I'm playing the field
Just painting my seeds, in 20-06, it's time to build
""Ghost is back..."" - [sample 4X]
(Ghostface Killah)
Yo, I cooked up the beef, seasoned up the meat
Fried 'em, tried 'em, took it out the grease
Ghost came to steal the show, since you loving your broad
I'ma lay back and reveal your hoe
She a brain therapist, chick you can't kiss
Opened up her legs, like ""ooh, I smell fish""
Yeast infection, queen, she love dick
Shivlered up tits, she'll bang the whole Knicks
Now how can I salute you, kid, I'm planning to do you
Crucial, blow rugers at who you with
We bump heads while we out in the street, it's all good
My trigger fingers'll matter, kick the back of your feet
And your red monkey jeans, is looking like a scene from Baghdad
That's bad, flags red, dirt beds
Y'all niggaz is eating, crystal meth' heads
We pissed out, wrist out, with the best threads
Knockin' niggaz off, knockin' niggaz out
Fucking up rappers is what I'm about
I'm holding Staten Island down, y'all cats must be dead
Keep fronting and lose your head
""Ghost is back..."" - [sample 4X]
(Ghostface Killah)
You can decide on who's liver
Toney Knight Rider, wisdoms love my saliva
Slobbin' 'em down, hoggin' the mound
Pitchin' 'em eightballs, robbing the town
Don't let your gangsta, get you murked up
Faggot ass homeys done got you worked up
Rappers can't come around, y'all wide rap is dead
Freeze, nigga, come off the bread
Whole horizon, hit 'em with toast, a rap arising
Ringing the boys bell like Verizon
Eyes, looking surprised, that the four-five
Yo Ghost, don't even do it, I got some more pie
(Outro: Ghostface Killah)
Word up, aiyo I'd like to give a mean shout out to Staten Island
Holding the boy down, y'all know what it do

Yo Supa! Y'all know what it is, man, yaknowhatimsaying?

Toy stores are out of control, and kids singing

Rudolph the Reindeer, red nose that glow
It's all about the candy canes and Christmas list
North Pole and that chubby jolly old Saint Nick
The little elves getting busy, in Santa workshop
And how gingerbread men keep they buttons on top
Wooden soldiers and chestnuts, roasting like marshmallows
Goodfellas, chocolate pudding pops and Jell-O's
It's the gift, the cookies and milk on the mantle
The mistletoe, that scent from that peppermint candles
That warm French vanilla, mean coat with zippers
Bearskin robe dragon with Versace slippers
Around the fireplace we breathe, shirts are short sleeve
We stayin' up all night on Christmas Eve
It's the season for sharing, season of the gift
Season for snow, it's December 25th
That time of the year, we dress like Saint Nick
Stirring whip cream into that hot cup of Quick
It's the season for sharing, season of the gift
Season for snow, it's December 25th
That time of the year, we surprise all the kids
Buy gifts for your loved ones and diamonds for ya wiz
I see snowmen, snowflakes, cinnamon cakes
Sisters and brothers, sliding down garbage can covers
Snowball fights, eggnog splashed with Hennessey
Bet Christmas is Christmas from New York to Tennessee
The Kris Kringles, the Jingling Babies
All them late nights wrapping gifts, driving you crazy
And Jack Frost is outside, freezing it up
Got the hood and the goose just to loosen you up
And all the homes is all lit with some many lights
See the trees through the windows, glittered up at night
Gingerbread house, bumping that Jingle Bell Rock
And all them little bad kids get coal in they socks
Ghost knows when you be sleeping
And Ghost knows when you are awake
And I know if you been bad or good
So be good for old Ghostface

Broke my heart on what you had in the stroller
On the low, that could have been me, huggie down
Fly and handsome, talk about little Starsky
With little Barkley's, little car seat
Two years later here comes little Sharneese
I'm saying, are you involved, what's up with you?
And where homeboy at? Oh word, y'all through?
Eff him, you know how I do, when I come through
Shut the whole block down like I got something to prove
But um, besides the lane, you look the same
Still blowing beauty marks, sitting under your bang
Ankle bracelets that Donna Kay shit
I saw one rope for your throat, yo, it cost about 8 chips

Finish 'em off like your menstrual after you spotting

I go by watching you, watching you

Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood

Goose over ice cubes, pass the O.J.
Two light skinned wizzes, want Ghost, on both ways
Come here, sit on my lap, it's not a gat, sugar
Have a seat, don't be afraid to move back
Feel that? You'se a nasty girl
Big butt, slim gut, I'll crash your world
It's not polite to bend over in Starkey face
Sheer lace, fat ass, got want me to taste that
Lodi dodi, with a coke shaped body
And my jewels hang low like my balls in the potty
And I dare y'all to try to rob me
Theodore U, we got the army
A-Town to Mariner's Harby
Wild West, Now Born, go hard, G.
Killa Hill, Stapletown, Port Rich' kids
Pack heat, like I was pulling out biscuits
(Trife Da God)
When we on the block bubbling rocks, watching for cops
Holding glocks in and out of the spots, (it's all good)
When we overseas, getting that cheese, whipping the hottest V's
Blowin' exotic trees, playa, (it's all good)
When I'm in the whip, sunk in the six, drunk off the liqs
Pull up, stunting, fronting for chicks, (it's all good)
When we on stage getting them Grammy's, snatching them panties
Jetskiing off the shores of Miami, (it's all good)
(Interlude: Ghostface Killah)
Yeah... told y'all before, another Theodore Production
This is how we go in the 06 to 07, come on, come on"

I know she gone, but I'm still holding on
Still smell the scent of her clothes, only God knows the pain
I cried till there's no tears left
Love my babies, we can't explain why she left
I'm all alone, feeling like my heart is blown
I do anything, just to see her come back home
But she chose not to hold on, and broke the bond
Left me with two babies like I'm Mr. Mom
But I'm handle what God gave me, 'cause I'm a good man, and
Try to break me down, I'm strong and stay standing
Never imagine she gettin' down like that
Nine years in this together and you turning your back? Come on
(Chorus: Eamon (sample))
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah
(All we can do is hold on) That's what I'm do, yeah
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah
(All we can do is) I'mma try to (Hold on) hey

I can't believe you walked out of my life
Not saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it
I know the grass look greener, but you should have stayed beat
Let a good man go, so you can run free?
Could of held on, to these rough times, and made better ones
You left me when my music was down with no fun
Broke, I struggled so you made it through college
'Cause I had street smarts, but you had knowledge
Longevity, suppose to be together forever
Now you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever
So I'mma open the cage and set my butterfly free
Just hoping it ain't too late when you come on back to me
(Chorus w/ Eamon ad-libs)
(Eamon)
But I'mma try to, hold on, and be strong
'Cause this time, you're so wrong
But I wait, and, I long
For you touch, but you're gone
All these tears, and all this pain
I'll never, never, feel the same
I keep control, I lift my soul
I sing my song, I hold on

This one's for the boys and the girls on the streets
Make sure you listen careful to the words I speak
Before you get the drawers, and the bitch wanna eat
Make sure you let 'em know to sign the pussy receipt, and
(Chorus: Ghostface Killah)
Greedy bitches, greedy, greedy, bitches (come on)
Greedy bitches, greedy, greedy, bitches (and you)
Greedy bitches, greedy, greedy, bitches (say what)
Greedy bitches, yo, the hoes ate the Oreo's
(Ghostface Killah)
Word to my momma, yo, I hate y'all greedy bitches
Y'all greasy, after the club, want the piece of chicken
Hotel rooms, you better not touch the phone
Uh-uh, leave that roof service book alone
Don't ask me, for food, I ain't ask you
Cut through the bullshit, you can just pass the pool
And ya fat friend you brought, she can crash too
But if ya stomach growling hard, I'mma laugh, boo
No Domino's, Papa John's and Waffle House
Frontin' on the pussy, you can throw the dick in your mouth
Straight cock, we in the halls, yo there's other twat
In Trife room, where them other hoe bitches flock
Wigs got it popping, Du-Lilz went bird shopping
He got bird seeds, he's probably getting head whopping
Fucking with you, yo I hope you ain't cock blocking
I want some pussy now, if not, you can get to hopping
Bounce, muthafuckas talking about you ain't giving up no pussy
(Shawn Wigs)
Yo, this is for them greedy bitches, who wanna eat off my buck
Who get 99 bananas, 'cause you fresh out of luck
I wanna fuck, and you try'nna get a sirloin steak
Little money, backstage passes, and some Oreo cake
You better split if the legs don't spread like wings
This is Theodore, we more than just suicide kings
Super groupie, that G on your chest stand for greedy
Caught a contact high, 'cause we always bake ziti
Blow the gerder's, we just wanna puff and sleep
Not in my bed, I'm try'nna put nut in your cheek
Little squirrel, my twat team stay on alert
I pump iron to them pink panties under your skirt
Why try to scheme, my double stuff cream got 'em all
On a scavenger hunt, greedy bitch of the month
They want a table, when it's time to give pussy, they front
You can't play your boy Wigs, like I'm some kind of chump
That's right, get 'em out here, yo, Tone
(Redman)
Yo, I get butter, nigga, like Land O' Lake
When bitches see me, they be quick to pump they brakes
But wait, before we fuck, let's make it clear
If you ask me for a dime... get the fuck out of here
Aiyo, you broke nigga, no bitch, you got it wrong
I'm still spending, from Red and Meth sitcom
What you doing? Stripping, grabbing on groin
I bet your momma proud of what you become
I'm on the block getting it, hip hop, getting it
Blunts got piff in it, new five, whipping it
Shorty like ""Redman, buy me a cigarette""
Try'nna get me robbed at the store where her niggas at
Greedy bitch, hoods up, hoes down
Get money like Barry, looking for MoTown
And if I'm in your hood, bitch, high as a fuck
Clock the flavor, audio one, your time is up, bitch..."

Sip on this little bit of odor, made brown
Zone out, turn the lights off
Ant boogie, what up? Uh-huh
(Trife Da God)
In the crib, with my wiz, getting my grown man on
Listening to classic soul, with the slow jams on
Smokey Robinson, Tears of a Clown, shedding tears
Popping beers, almost twenty five years in the town
I seen niggaz die off, like dandelions in the fall
Niggaz heard of Chip Banks and left him lying in the hall
Your boy Sandy Brock was ill, like Kobe Bryant with the ball
It's no exceptions, even the biggest giants gotta fall
'Cause we living in denial, but these lessons are vital
When marinating in the slums, you gotta practice survival
Now everybody wants to be next American idol
But these are more than just songs pressed up your vinyl
Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine
But we all can't green, knahImean?
Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine
But we all can't green...
(Chorus: Solomon Childs)
I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder
But I ain't been to many operas
Or had money for private doctors
As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown
I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder
The message is I'm too strong to hold down
I know the ledge, and I ain't planning to drown
As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown

Momma ain't raised no fool, they say we gotta save the children
But first, we gotta save our spoons
I was taught not to waste my food
Even if I didn't like it, every scrap on my plate got chewed
Either you ate, or you didn't eat, the memories are bitter sweet
Used to get teased by my friends, 'cause I had bigger feet
I think about them jokes and laugh, crack a smile
'Cause as a child, I never knew that being broke was bad
Growing up I was close to my dad, but that still didn't stop a nigga
From putting that coke in them bags
That was the past, now, I'm riding with the oak in the dash
Got jealous niggaz hating, big time, hoping I crash
I can't blame 'em, and on the same note, I can't change 'em
Let a nigga disrespect my shit, I'm gonna flame 'em
That's word to my son little Jay, my little homey
Ask niggaz how your boy get down, ain't nothing phony
(Trife Da God)
Yeah, they say two heads are better than one, and in the process
I learned that slow progress, is better than none
That's why I'm still here pursuing my goals, baking that bread
In the bakery, if I ain't out, doing no shows
I hit the block, once in a blue, and front with the crew
And show niggaz a good time, by getting drunk in the stud'
Some niggaz find happiness, with a blunt and a brew
They talented niggaz, but they just need something to do
It's kinda hard try'nna look beyond buildings and bricks
We can't condone broken homes, when our children is sick
Try'nna survive off the cereal and milk from the WIC
And all the good ones we got, be getting killed in the mix
He could have been the next Jordan, who knows, the next Emmitt
Young Tiger Woods, or the new Arthur Ashe of tennis
That's why I'm looking past the gimmicks, getting cash with Dennis
Criminal grind, we gonna smash the business
Yeah, when you see that big thing pull up
Don't be mad at us, man, be glad, we done made it from the projects
We done came up, Stapleton Houses, man

97,Guest House,2009,Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City (2009),,Ghostface Killah,"In the crib on this rainy day, I'm chilling
Glass pianos and Portuguese drapes, hang from the ceiling
Persian rugs, Moroccan sofas
I walk to the house in Paisley robes and Ferragamo loafers
And Iron Chef just season the salmon
It's coming down pouring, he watching BBC, eating a salad
I'm on the couch hitting the chalice
Checking my textes and out of nowhere, my dick is hard as a callus
I stood up, pulled back my sleeve, checked my watch
Where the, fuck is my wife, it's 12 o'clock on the dot
Very impatient, I'm getting nervous can't stop pacing
My heart's racing, her Nextel don't get no service
Damn, all this over a gallon of milk
Something happened to her, somebody wig'll get peeled
Okay, let me calm down, maybe she at Keeba house
Her birthday's today, we both bought her jeans and a blouse
Since 7 o'clock, she been gone for hours
Jetted up the steps to the master suite, checked the shower
Nope, all that is there is towels and soap
Stomach is nauseous, caught a big lump in my throat
Found a phone book with mad names, looked down
Bow, there go Keeba tying my shoes, I put the bitch on speaker
And bluntly addressed her, ""Where's my girl?""
Yeah, she ain't out here
Last time I seen her, Ghost, she beat it on an old nigga
Yo, Keeba stop playing, yo, nah, we took a shot of Henn'
Lately she work out by 10, I told her, bitch, buy a Benz
Or even shot a car, I'm getting me some Advil
Show these motherfuckers, how Keeba love to drive stick
I snatched up my raincoat, the grass was soaked
Under the bed in the guest house, where I keep my toast
I yelled to the Chef, yo, ""Watch for Kayla
Check the pool and the bowling alley
If anything, just hit my cellular""
Hopped in the go cart, the yard is dark, I'm bugging
Few feet from the guest house is where I parked
Hope she's okay is what I say in my heart
But something don't feel right, so is what I'm saying to God
As I got closer something ain't kosher
I heard a bunch of squeaky sounds from the house
I don't think I'm suppose to is this the end of the Starks regime?
Let me find out somebody on my ground, yo is pounding my queen
Yo, I'ma kill ya, hold on 'cause
Baby, let me explain, you overreacting, that's not what it was
Shut the fuck up, you got caught moaning with your legs up
Eyes all red, what did y'all just blaze up?
Then froze for a sec, so I dipped quick, lift the mattress
Aimed the biscuit at both of them bastards
What y'all excuse now, yo 'cause, she said she live with her pop
Her dude mad strict that's why we up in the spot
And yo this little trick of yours bought me a ten G watch
He reached down for his drawers, that's when I let off a shot
Back the fuck up, snatched his covers
Had 'em looking like the black Adam and Eve, some sinful lovers
Chill, Tone, put the gun down, how you know my name, son?
Hold on, let me explain, yo y'all two is done
Just let me put my drawers, get dressed, before I get rocked
'Cause real talk, is looking like you tryna let off that glock
Yeah, you right, you look familiar, you put my cable in, right?
The FiOS nigga and you fucking my wife
Yeah, I put that cable in, nigga, we both got caught
And she a triflyn ass chick, don't act like it's all my fault
Baby, no, mind your business
Now Kayla, don't stop him, let the sucker do what he do
He touch me and he finished
What nigga, hold that, eat it
Oh shit, what the fuck, you forgot your drawers
And your little tools, nigga
You FiOS mustache wearing muthafucka
Fuck you, nigga, I got you nigga
I'mma see you nigga, fucker, fuck

They picked the car up, they on some Flintstone shit
Oh shit... and them niggaz stuck together
On some Siamese shit... yo

Yo, classic murders, slick gun material
Burnt up bodies that rock with no burial
Hammers that hardly work, go to work
Like a slave on a hot day, with no water
Blow you for props, in the cop's face, might get knocked up
Jakes that play hero, they can get popped up
Face fallin' off they cheekbone, gotta take meat
From they ass, to sow it back, I'm a beast, holmes
It's ground beef, in the streets, so we street's clone
Like fresh fruit, from a tree, so the heat's blown
Your momma missing, your boys are crying
Cut ya balls out your nutsack, the chinks are buying
Shit bags is like gift bags, you get it for free
If you master fronting, classic cutting
You keep stunting, them gem star'll rip something
Look homey, it's the bloody sweepstakes
Glove club you down in the club, how you like that, sweet cakes?
(Trife Da God)
Yo, it was a minute after twelve, when the tragedy struck
Niggaz emptied on son, and left 'em leaning right in Valerie's truck
The red Cherokee blood was pouring out his head heavily
The only motive for murder was wetter, either jealousy
The found him slumped over the wheel, horn blowing
Bullet holes showing, property stolen, motor still going
Driving side door, waves scoping, the window is broken
Glass back and shredded his grill, his collar was soaking
He probably knew the killas, 'cause they jinxed him with ease
Cops hold the perimeter, thirsty, looking for leads
Knocking on doors, questioning tenants, the lieutenant
Was the first to arrive on the scene, he knew he was finished
DeWayne Roberts knew him in college, mid-twenties
Stopped being brolic, V.A. driver's license in his wallet
The last call on his mobile phone was back to home
Sorry, Miss Amonia's son was found dead with two in his dome
(Cappadonna)
This be the bird's eye view of things, look how we doing things
We stick niggaz up and we take they rings
Mission Impossible, Theodore Unit, we unstoppable
Spit razors out of our mouth and start chopping you
Bank robbers, blood jakes out with the obstacle
Ropes hanging down from the roof, my parachute
Soaking water, heat smoking, we scrape and we Pillage, man
Wherever we broke in, Theodore, pulverize
Boat rides and tours, smashed 'em in the crib with they coconut straws
Dudes step off the scene, black face and four-four
The CREAM that we stack up, cake and whores
(Killa Sin)
Cash in abundance, the cats that I run with
Got gats at a motel, and splashed by the hundreds
I don't ask if I want it, my attitude is running
I don't ask if I want it, my attitude is running, yup
Mega ice neck, with some fish, with some fish dishes
Rakim gems, my mind shine is what my weight misses
Anything else is uncivilized, send the kind of niggaz
A tremendous spy, you can see the venom by
My nine leave a ten to buy, I don't need my men to ride
I'm in the moshing squad, beside the car that's highly energized
Been advised, before, that fucking with I, is genocide
Many men have died, from playing games from what they feel inside
Brawl with it in me, put it on my enemy
Be warned, defending me, like killing off a Kennedy
I silly song M.C.'s get sent on base
Type of nigga spit the Remy or laugh in ya face
This dig in my waste, is mastery, step out of place
Shatter that ass, like glass, and break fast like a neglige
Play with the biscuit, dick, don't even risk it

In the blue safe, right upstairs
I make sure that little nigga stay warm, tuck him under my pillow
Case the robbers come, I gotta perform
Kiss him night-night, mwuah, read him bedtime stories
Times I just stared at him, the Glock .40
His belly stay full, and he on a strict diet
I feed him lead, he good, he at ease when fired
Go to sleep Mr. Gat, I had him doing doubles for two days
And this the only way I get back

I told him chill, he said it's better when you getting jumped
No matter how you face it, now matter where you place me
Since the day that I was born, I ain't have safety
He went from Y.O. to Staten, that's real talk
He hung with Puff, he was with Shyne in Club New York

I raised them up from 380's, I raised them up from 380's
That Wu-Block shit, nigga, yeah
I still pour liquor after I pop bottles
Got a friend named Deuce Nickel, the cops got him
Back then when the coke price was rock bottom
I robbed a lot of spots with him, and I'm not lying
Then I got knocked with him and the cops kept him
I reminisce and get high over a lot of weapons
Got a friend named Nine, caught up in the murder one
I ain't seen him since, 'cause my man had to murder son
Homey named Thirty-Eight, he pop with him
And it ain't too often that he's not with him
Call 'em your guns, I call 'em my friends

Live off of mighty gold, tongue and yack

Two porsche's, big ass ranch with twelve horses
Scarface breeze when I speak, the all bosses
Plus the jewelry so truck, the cuffs get you nauseous
Two years, been through like six divorces
Now the talking put my business in the street, but
I'm like cement, I rock when I step
Kill music with no hands and leave with no weed stuff
Like my bitches better when they wore Reebok's
See hot, let's have a toast, I verbally bomb deacons
Have the whole church praying for Ghost
When we speak we give sermons, and switch our names over permits
The big shit, you might get burned with
God-body fly automobiles with grills
Two thousand, fifteen, nigga, we can take off the wheel
A Georget Jetson, so y'all sit still
Chill, peace to Queens, so the God Allah reel's reel
It's the takeover, breaks over, make something

I had to shut you down, I had to shut you down
(Ghostface Killah)
Welcome to Saturday Night Live, write rhymes
Glide on beats, and we high from the police
The dogs bark funny, in fact, when I'm clean
They can smell mark money, truck and mad bummy
Off the peter, grab shoots, Cerebel Paisley
Gats, pull out the mack on cancer, the ooh-wop
I bag down AIDS, word to the U.S.
There's no need to panic, yo, we been through a phase
Like, namebelts, got the fronts in Alfa Romeo's
Tent the patrol niggas, that we had on a payrole
I play on niggas like stop and go
And tell the other liquors that Don pop more
And Venus told Mercury she a hot ho
Me, I'm just thinkin' bout what's next for Ghost
The Enterprise worth billions, delay America
To Africa, home away, the six text-tillion
Turn, Siskel and Ebert givin' two thumbs
New York Times call it my best work, bump to it
You can Rolling Stone every bone, and kill 'em at the Grammy's
Have 'em sit down, polly with the top five families
Blocka-blocka, boom, now they all dead
Now I'm the only one gettin' that bread, that's right
And the only one rockin' those threads
See these cowards let the fuckin' lead go to they head
(Hook: Ghostface Killah)
I needed to scream on all y'all bitches, birds
But the more you bite my style, the more I learn
Your rhymes ain't workin' now, look who's hurtin' now
I had to shut you down, I had to shut you down
(Outro: Ghostface Killah)
God, yeah, party people
You are now listenin' to the sounds of Ghost Radio
777 F.M. and all that, no doubt
It's real right about now, yeah
The dance floor is packed and all that
Everything lookin' glory, I see asses
I see glasses in the air, yo, put your hands in the air
Come one, let me hear you see Theodore, ""Theodore""
Theodore, ""Theodore"", yeah, yeah
That was chunky and all that
No doubt, but yo, where Staten Island at?
Where y'all at? Make some noise, yo, yo, come on
Yeah, check-check-check-check me out
Check-check-checkin' me out, come on
Take-take-take-takin' me out, whose take-take-takin' me out
Come on baby, take me out, uh-huh, yeah, no doubt, no doubt"

Yo, I've seen Raj
He been a friend for years
Now your boy in blue, how he switched up gears
He said how I been?
I got a ear full of bad news
Your block is corrupt and it's time to choose
We got some niggas running drugs that can't be touched
Unless you wanna' handle the dirt, it'll mean so much
I said I got this, message received
I'mma clean up the block like you wouldn't believe
Call me Mr. Clean, aka Starkiano
Nine years later slid across the Verrazano
Clean sweep, apply pressure to the scum
This is my town, Stapleton is where I'm from
Third shot slapped in the head with a juice box
Grenade with no pin in his mouth, this is my block
And Bamboo fucking with this is absurd
I'mma handle my bee's wax, that's my word
(Hook: Rell)
Came up out the darkness, searching for light
I know home is where my heart is
And now nothing seems right
I tried to make peace and cut my losses
And carry on somehow
But I've come much too far, man
Too late to turn back now, here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again

Now I'm exposed, my nigga, you haulin'
Streets is different
(Verse 2: AZ)
Yeah, yeah, welcome home Starks'
Remember us? At the jams in the parks
All gold guzzlers, Wallabee Clarks
Young cold hustlers, obviously sharp
Voom with the purpose to bloom, so in tuned
Dialogue like the Disciples in the circle of goons
My ace boon, then you got sent to the tombs
And shit went left, had to pinch my flesh
And figure some other scheme to get cream, reign supreme
You know everything ain't what it seems
So I switched up size, had switch up lives
And now I can fuck life and rip her thighs
A badge and a gun that's legal, it's more lethal
Than any local dealer that's evil leave you peoples
The sequel
Me and you both could split a loaf
Just need you a little closer
You could squeeze that toast
And knock off targets, starting with the hardest
By next year my nigga, we be the largest
Felonies done with no charges"

Wild in war, before rap, I was gettin' it on
Choke a fat nigga out in like forty seconds, my gun get hard
With a .45 steel erection
Eagle on, Kangol hat slanted, coconut, bounce to Morocco
Guerilla medallions, like Flava Flav clock, yo
Niggas want me dead, but they scared to step to me
Rip they guts out, like a hysterectomy
When beef collide, look on the flip, buy a penitentiary kite
Or get you bumped off from the inside
Jaws is hanging, frauds is lifting
They drawers on the floor complaining
Bird ass nigga, resemble, Keenen Ivory Wayans
Stay in your place, dirt bomb rappers get shadowboxed
For training, y'all still eating bacon...

Then left my fingers for dead, told 'em
""I ain't have nothing to do with the writing""
I hold you down when you be squeezing that lead
Shopping sprees, with my man's on the corner watch D's
Rolling in threes, in them purple capri's'
A gritty bop, my rocks is bigger, wallo's with the gold tassels
Your old slave, with Starkey Love on the shackle
And I stay fly underwater, my toes is iced out
Poofed the nails off, ya faggots can figure the price out

Get my slippers, before I go gun ho!

Who them fly niggaz when we walk through the party
Pimp talk with the Mac strapped to our body
Bartender's nervous, afraid to serve us, bad service
Un-smacked him on purpose and see this drunk come and berp us
Paper chasers, Starky stayed up in the makings
Theodore conquer the four devils wit the patience
Cellphones is blowin', the crews not available
Ask 'Donna, word in the town, we the realest dudes
We don't need no diamonds rings
All we need is a drum, like, fuck it, he can rhyme, I'll sing
And in my Yankee hat, you can drop five beans

It's a homi' on any and everybody that he love
Hold up, there go his man Mick
In the car with his kids, I'ma split his mothafuckin' wig
Follow him to the crib and park up the block
Go in the trunk, grab my mothafuckin' 40 Glock
On my way thinkin' this nigga gotta get it
I'ma empty out the clip so that Tony gets the message
Kick in the door, started lettin' off
Mick fell through the table, got wrapped up in the tablecloth
Skated off in the darkness of night
Left my callin' card on the body and said ""fuck your life""
Shit is brutal, I gotta get made then bounce
36 seasons, I'm stuck back on the couch
Like a potato, I don't play though
I'm stone cold son, these lames is built like Play-Doh

I seen Mick's body on the floor covered in sheets
And a note that says I'm a dead man walkin'
An empty soul just headed for the coffin
This is crazy, they took my brother, they must be clueless
I'ma get that mothafucka, I'm ruthless
Relentless, [?] than a dusted out Navy Seal
I'ma skin him alive, that's for real
I ain't goin' nowhere, they let the beast out the cage
The face of a killer, straight up, on a rampage
War path, blood bath, a killing spree
I'ma show these mothafuckas how it's meant to be
Ayo go against the grain, I smell a massacre
I'll stick a bomb in your limo, blow up your passengers
Kill every one of 'em, leave no witnesses

Represent Stapleton, raised in the West
780 Anderson, now I'm the best
Stoppin' all bets, slammin' niggaz like Barkley

Always kept aluminum, bags in the car seat
Them not show doin' them, that's where the NARCs be
Came to play no games and stay in your lane
And the ratchet's on your brain and fuck entertainment y'all
The big spender rock a robe in November
I never broke but I throw my trees up in the blender

You want a good time, you all right, you all right?
C'mon, how you like me baby?
You have a good time tonight?

Dane cracked the window when the fuckin' room's hot
If my CD was skippin get a different boombox
New socks full of Polo, champ rugged low Mocc's
So hot, right before I popped the fuckin' show stopped
You can't box, I seen better hands on an old clock
The old ox never marked you, I'ma blow pop
Prophesized Don it's me, aqua blue mink
And my bitch arms'll be, 20 G's scrill
Niggaz like ""Pardon me,"" I'ma be honesty
Your man with the Dom P more like Sean Connery
Heard he fight crime like the old man Barnaby

And I keep drugs in the Tony Starks pharmacy
Desperate Housewives slobbin me 'cause they honor me

A Bird, a Magic, or something, yeah, you know a nigga got dough
A nigga can leave the league, but if I leave.
The fans still gonna love me, man?
I get love out here, I done sold coke on these streets, man
Hash, weed, heroin, as long as niggaz is feeling it
A nigga like me can hustle it, that's my gift in life, eh
You know? Funny man, you a hustling muthafucker, man

Hustle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, holla back!

We hustle hard in the city of Gods, with dedicated dealers
Take this shit for a serious job
Thugs with hideous scars, bag the prettiest broads
And teach 'em how to move coke, in they panties and bra's
My pops stayed on the hustle, 'cause the family was large
No fancy cars, no shrimp scampi or caviar
Just a cold plate of agony, mixed with a harsh reality
Fuck a donation, we started our own charities
We had to hustle, we ain't caking like Russell
So if you live how we live, you can relate to the struggle
Me and my niggaz running wild like some apes in the jungle
Paper chasing, serving fiends, at the gate when they come through
This one's for all my Newport slingers, dope heads that'll chew off fingers
Just to shoot that thing up, get on ya grind
'Cause while your getting yours, I'm getting mines
If you need some tips on how to hustle, drop me a line

Hustle hard, that's the only way a nigga know how
Been grinding most of my life, and I ain't gon' stop now
Growing up, I remember them days, slinging that beige
Pumping trays on the first of the month, niggaz was paid
I learned the tricks of the trade, with the flip or the save
When you bag up, wear rubber gloves and clean off the blade
I used to watch my older brother carve stones at the table
And my moms home, it was new to my 'view', like Star Jones
In and out of buildings, lamping in halls with eight balls
Way before they had the cameras installed
That was 9-7, when Biggie Smalls gave us the script
The Ten Crack Commandments on how to manage your bricks
Shopping bags, popping tags, with the brand new in shit
No more hand-me-down rags, my appearance was dipped
I'm on my grind like coffee beans, I'm gon' sale
Worldwide I got fiends on line like AOL

King of the jungle, ain't shit about me humble
Rock a black panther hoodie, nigga, made from panther skin

War time Starky, on some black avengers
Shadowboxing with killers that move like ninjas

Bulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us
Can't stop my reign or terrorize the power
Tony Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower
(Verse 2: Masta Killa)
I'm prepared to go to war for the battle of supremacy
There's nothing now to remedy this decision
The only thing left is the loyalty of the family
Cause once we establish the power they gone turn sour
And use everything in their power to shut us down
We've come to far to turn around Tone
Got a new connect, Don Stone
Flew his private jet from Rome to talk business
He heard about your crime saga poems looking to invest millions
It's up to you Tone, this move can make us both rich
The crew is armed, cocked, and ready to rock steady
It's non-stop hustling, flow of their own casino, RZA Tarantino
It's Wu Gambino for life, you know how we go
And to the last breath blow, mi amigo

Yo, there ain't too many people I would die for
That I would lay down for, you heard...
It's like my family, my closest friends that's here in my circle
YouknowImean? My moms and 'em, my babies, man
That's word to mother, son, that's what it is...
(I'll die for you, I'll die for you) Uh-huh...
That's right, man (I'll die for you) Just some real shit...
(Ghostface Killah)
Aiyo, I'll die for the prophets and I'll die for the Lord
On the battlefield, wounded badly, holding a sword
With no questions asked, I already know, it's all for the cause
Just laying me facing the East, when I'm under the floor
I might've sinned in the process, from being, in the projects
Eyes swept from all the anger, that could've fucked with my conscience
And more or less, I'm a man of my word
My body is holding a couple scars on it, though I was never a bird
(Hook: Ghostface Killah (sample))
For Martin Luther and my brother Malcolm (I'll die for you)
And my ancestors picking cotton (I'll die for you)
My close homies that get it popping (I'll die for you)
You what time it is, nigga what?
(Ghostface Killah)
Aiyo, I'd die for my moms, and I'd die for my kids
If you, really my Queen, then I'd die for my whiz
Even my man's, if we that tight
Jump in front of a biscuit, snuff money with all of my mics
Or we can brawl it out and take his life
By taking his gun, no problem
Just make sure we eating when we on the run
Like slaves that's chained together, who killed master?
The dogs is coming, the pigs is gon' blast ya
I'd die for you, I'd die for my brother
Die for the babies who can't eat with bare feet who need they mother
I put niggaz lights out like Con Ed, my verbal is barn
My bread'll blow you, show you who's real with the arms

Dog, you want revenge on that devil Satan? (I'll die for you)
We could do it now instead of waiting (I'll die for you)
We don't have to wait for revelations (I'll die for you)
We'll sort this out in other conversations
(Ghostface Killah)
Yo, I'd never jump out the window, lose my life for a lame ass nigga
That scene is bogus, it's not in the picture
You just can't feed me anything like ""Yo, Tone it's beef""
Expect me to go all out, jump in and bust my heat
First off, drunk, you not my peeps
Yeah, I know you, we from the same town and shit, but we ain't that deep
We never stuck nothing, oxed something, ran together, popped something
I thought ya team was Wolves, cocksucker, stop fronting
You barking like you got the town in a smash
I'd never lay down for you, faggot nigga, you ass

Wop them niggaz that be yelling that (I'll die for you)

You switch up, last week you burned a old lady's retina
I thought them thick Coke bottle jammies might protect her
But it didn't Pah, the lady's blind and it's all your fault
It went down to jury court and you walked
On stage you fuck with nigga's faces, glaciers
Hittin off with Cristal bottles, bing wind up in the basement
Very expensive championship
Chip Rocks known for his wedding day, bitches give you props
Look you tied a knot, understand you hot; you got my man popped

Paved the way for Flex, Mister Cee, 'nuff of them cats
See, this rap shit came at a time that was accurate
Twenty-something years later, I mastered it
Seen light poles get used for power
I was a little nigga
Couldn't stay out late - I was sour
So I sat by the window, heard the DJ cut
Impeach the Pres, Apache, and just begun
Otis Redding - slam! The music stopped
Guess the system blew out one of his amps
It'd take a little while, then it come back on
Somebody stepped on the wire and shit, that's all
Now everybody's back in the groove, echo chamber
""Check one two, one two"" - that's my favorite
Strobe lights is live, Pink Champale
Little pink joints being lit up on the side
Couple niggas had two fives
Other than that, cleared a circle in the park and shoot 5
Girls wore they Lees and jellies
Jordache and Lees, TF Lords fit the fellys
Sams and Kangol buckets, BVD's
Go to Sergio's like, fuck it
Seen the stamp on that Crazy Eddie
Niggas coming back from the Funhouse dusted
Throwing bubbles on the wall
(Hook: Ghostface)
We must remind you
Where this rap come from
Yes my brother, my sister
It's our duty, we must remind you
Hip hop was set out in the park
We used to do it out in the dark
(Verse 2: Black Thought)
Yo, it all started at the After Midnight Philly, but walk with me
Mad niggas coming down from New York City
Prolly hit the skating rink USA
Banging Schoolly, ""Gangster Boogie"" and ""PSK""
I remember shells, Gazelles, top tens, and lottos
Mega design, reefer smoke, Coqui nine bottles
Entire wore velours, call the boys with the Lucci wore
84's from Atlantic City Coogi store
Linoleum break dancing, Rust-Oleum cans
I put the writing on the wall signed, ""Truly yours""
Philly smashed '87 Music Seminar
Out on the battlefield like Pat Benatar
Hit the borough with Krown Rulers out of Camden
People Patty Duke-ing in the party, all cramped in
Around the time Flav started cold lamping
""Rebel Without a Pause"" was the street anthem
Old Memorex cassette, tape collections
Bright spotlights on all the fights at the Spectrum
When the Fresh Fest come, leather bombers and sheepskins
Brothers would bust they guns to get one
MC Breeze, Disco C, Jazzy Jeff
Cash Money and Miz and Lady B
Everybody banging ""Sucker MC's"" in '83
I was South Philly like St. Charles and Crazy D
Them wild North Side Puerto Ricans would snuff you
Twenty deep in a Ford Escort, pumping the Tuff Crew
I used to follow my cousin, he was a buck too
""Y'all don't like how I'm living, well, fuck you!""
I been a G since a little kid
Sticking my head up into somebody's dollar party, getting into shit
And late nights, shoulda been in bed
Instead, I was running 'round with them downtown lemonheads
A little man, hanging where them grown women is
Under thirteen, seeing real strong images
And that's the reason for my real rap penmanship
That's where I started it, and that's where I'm a finish it"
114,In The Parks,2007,Hidden Darts (Special Edition) (2007),,Ghostface Killah,"""Let's dance!""
(Ghostface Killah)
Walked up Dr. Jay's, five niggas with K's
Son, they feelin' ya waves, it's like mayonaisse
Old people love you, corns on they feet
Fifteen, twenty deep, you walked in, cross streets
Walk 'em through red lights, Shaolin through Crown Heights
Even had 'em on bikes, they was starting fights
New Year's had 'em all drunk, lazy eye Milton
Found a pump, tired of busting 'em
Scotty snatched Janet's wig off, that night, shit got hectic
Barbara Jean fuckin' old man Shet
Good God, shit's real as a fuck, throw a buck
On Chuckle-Up, Thunderbird in cuffs
Skeeter with no teeth, night train lips
Beefin' with police, Grady hit knees
Dude blew a bag with him, he got butt naked in the 'villes
Plus he fucked a whitey in the hill
Throw a buck on, Chuckle-Up, Thunderbird in cuffs"

(What you doin' on our turf, punk?
Got a message for Smokey.
Give it.
You Smokey, man?
Give it!
If you ain't Smokey, it ain't yo' motherfuckin' message
Motherfucker, I said gimme the message!
It's from Willie, in the slam.
Nigga, you been busted?
Yeah, the man picked me up.
Well, I ain't got no fuckin' time to play witchu! Now gimme the message.
Willie's in Warwick, doin' 1-3. Told me to tell y'all motherfuckers to
Keep cool. He be out one way or another. Quick. Maybe I could stick
Around for awhile.
Naw, that's out, man. You know? What can we, The Lords, do with a punk like
You?
Kiss my ass, motherfucker! (Burn 'em) Just me and you, motherfucker, just
Me and you. I put trademarks around your fuckin' eye!)
(Portrayin', won't be payin'. Uh huh, Uh huh)
(Yeah, no doubt, no doubt, this Wally champ cat. Yeah, it's on this one)
Raekwon:
Yo, Gambino niggas who swipe theirs
Deluxe rap cavaliers
Midgets who steal beers, give 'em theirs
Chorus: Raekwon
Sit back jollyin'
My team be gamin' like three card Rolly an'
Drug Somalians pollyin'
Verse One: Raekwon
Many raps they crochetin'
Ay yo Iron, these niggas portrayin'
But haven't been payin'
For real, slide on these niggas like flesh fear
Caesar fade style, usually tough grenade
Throw a blade, fuck gettin' laid
Guzzle this shit like Gatorade
Big-dick Wallies have never half-suede
Connectin' with the hot style is done
Light up a chalis
I run with nuttin' but the wildest, foulest
Come on now, long-dick style
Niggas on the hit out, ay yo Iron bite my shit out
Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally
Been doin' this century kid, just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin' off by P.M.
Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
Fellatium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians
The greatest lesson is don't owe, you might get stole on
When I go bury me wit Valow on
(They come to me, and understand, just let me get mines first. Then after I
Get mines, y'all can do what y'all wanna do. Fuck 'em up bad)
Verse Two: Ghostface
'Sho 'nuff, hit the bank and thrust
Cool Nauticas Jamie Summer got trained on the tour bus
We upgrade, swallow raw eggs, read the label
Hittin' white-label, left the Winnebago unstable
Smooth sailin', walked in, my earth started kneelin'
Started stealin', I'm too ill, see we're bellin' at the parlay
Kicked up, mack, max motion
Michael Bolton magazine call, I'm too potent
Louisville mix pain kill rap, Fuck benadryl
The violin in 'Knowledge God' sounded ill
Tremendously obnoxious, no blotches
My telephone watch'll leave bartenders topless
Dead on the prosecutor, smacked a juror
Me and my girl'll run like Luke and Laura
We sit back on Malayan islands
Sippin' mix drinks out of boat coconut bowls, we whylin'

Sit back jollyin', Uh huh, Uh huh
Uh huh, Uh huh, Sit back jollyin'
Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh
Sit back
Verse Three: Cappadonna
Deep meditation sound orientated, war the blizzard
Rap para-medical the wizard
Cappadonna, never caterin' to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You oughta five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowin' with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of whylin', Park Hill profilin'
I cut your face up rough fifty sure while you're smilin'
For violatin' my position,
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
'Cause I'm P-L-O T-K-O every day
Dancehall General, Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna son'a old school just go infernal
Veteran for rappin' with the new set of rule of hard rappin'
Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clappin'
When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evenin', I have a by myself meetin'
Thinkin' who's gonna be the next to catch a beatin'
From my mental slangin', bitchin' rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize, all competition catch ill hair
Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards
(The way I, the way I wanna get 'em. I want 'em gotten. I want 'em layin'
Out. I want 'em gotten. 'Cause niggas need to be gotten. He need to be
Taken off of here. That's right.)"

It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
It's five o'clock in the morning and I'm just getting in
I knock on the door and a voice sweet and low says
(Who is it) She opens up the door and lets me in (let me in)
Never once did she say where have you been?
She said, (are you hungry), are you hungry honey, (did you eat)
Yeah, let me hang up your coat
The woman says, pass me your hat
And all the while she's smiling
Never raises her voice
It's five o'clock in the morning and I don't give it a second thought
It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
Don't think you can keep breaking your woman's heart
It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
And you should sit back and enjoy it
(It's a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)
She gonna fool you one day
The sweetest woman in the world, can be the meanest woman in the world
(If you like her that way)
You keep hurting her, she keep being quiet
She might be holding something inside, she gonna hurt you one day
Now I'm laying in the hospital, bandaged from feet to head
In a state of shock, just that much from being dead
I didn't think my woman can do something like this to me
I didn't think the girl had the nerve
Here I am, I guess actions speak louder than words
It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
Don't keep thinking you can keep treating your woman bad
It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
She won't ever get mad
(It's a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)
She's gonna fool you one day
(It's a Thin), It's a line thin, (Line Between Love and Hate), between love and hate
It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
She's gonna fool you one day
(It's a Thin Line), Yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)

Pumping coke out the spot smacking fiends in the kitchen
All around dick sucks whenever
Blowing chronic out of Phillies, getting flusty in the Cube' Link era
Niggas telling me my spot is hot
They like, ""I think anyday now, playboy, shit gon' pop‿
Back then I was the fat Ghost, it came March 1st
My ace {Bakool?} got merked I burned for all our work
After the funeral I played low
Counting my last ten Gs, three weeks later yo I'm back in the {P's?}
Gathering up information, checking faces
Keeping the 45 auto loaded like it was bases
When it get dark better believe my mark
I heard a voice through a bullhorn the white man he said, ""yo Starks
You're surrounded, put down your gun look at the ruger
It's nothing but cops nigga, you better not run
Over... And I'm not laughing
(The masquerade... the masquerade)
My, my my, good days is over
11.40am in the Best Western
I'm with my bat blue her ass back and chest in
Slob my knob yeah no question
This my main bat, she thorough like that so we don't use protection
But the night before my wiz must of checked my phone
How'd she got the code? Psh, I don't know
Next thing she laying in the tel' lobby
She spotted me tipping the doorman, holding hands with my bitch beside me
My heart dropped, everything stopped, scared to death
Told my broad to keep it moving 'cause I just got knocked
Don't turn around, as soon as she did she bust a shot
Plus she tough security dropped when she touched the glock
I had the dumb face on, long face on
Didn't say shit, not even cough or spit, my bitch was gone
There goes the car, house, {?} jury, court date, judges
My shorty tried to screw me"

Aiyyo
Here's a little story ghetto situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-ass big brains and straight out the hood
(Ghostface)
Yo,
Aiyyo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn
Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn
She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong
Right before she went to rest she had me singin' this song
She must be a special lady
And a very exciting girlllllllllll
I don't know
She had the high-glow's switchin
See her in the club you hear others chicks bitchin
But Dawn quit to bust a bitch ass and shit
See she did 12 months over a ratchet
Not no crab shit
Got bagged with the mag
Taxi cab shit
Clit was hangin' out her panties with no where to stash it
It was classic
Nowadays she's laid back
Helpin me perfect my rap
Only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat
Wife everything
Diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
Lickin' glass bowls in her cat clothes
Cause crazy stacks
Finicky thing
Her kittin drink pollar spring
Take naps
Near her jewerly box
She play with all the rings
And when she step out the tub it's like an ill flick
Carmel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit
Cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode
Paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me
Versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)
She a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN
(Cappadonna)
Aiyyo, she gotta be gone
Waitin on my sweet strawbeery pecan rican LaShawn
Holdin' my taffy down when I'm gone
Three fourths of her body always covered with clothes
That's why I'm eatin her candy
And suckin her toes
Sweet sexy LaShawn
She got body like what's goin' on
On some marvin gay shit like let's get it onnnnn
Suuuugarrrr
Letssss getttt it onnnnn
Ayo she a diamond in the rough
Black rose in the hood
I love my queen and she treat me good
Fuck cookin for me
She stash me out when the feds come lookin' for me
I'm not cheatin' on her or beatin' on her
I spend the weekend on her
We on the block when the bills start creepin' on her
She right there when it gets sticky
She strict politic to the vicky's
And a fly aviator the color of sky
God on her side
Indian chick with cat eyes
Mad respect with the fat thighs
Plus her guns for the revolution
Would straight leave her if she prostituting
Yo my girls the bomb
Intelligent mind
Sky blue louis vetton
Leg muscles, deep dimples
Body is soft she smell fresh like a new born
Pretty feet peitete ass nice shoes on
The sunshine for my quiet storm
Keepin' the food warm while I'm gone
It won't be long till I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn
Hit me up baby, P.S. Cappadon'
(Trife)
Aiyyo, aiyyo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn
Had a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen
You know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe
Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue
Pretty young thing, with a body like vida
Ass off the meter, eva medenez look, strut like a diva
Leave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba
She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up
Ms. Bonitta Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column
Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin' condoms!
'Cause she my bitch, the only cat that I lick
Throwin' that ass like Ciara on the top of that whip
Latin decent, velour suit with the cameltoe print
Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips
Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh
Even at my loneliest times you that Jen will ride...
(Chorus - Trife)
Whether Jen, Don, or Shawn it's the same situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood

God's woman... what's going on?
I know things seem messed up sometime
You stressed out and you can't handle the situation
Sometime it feels like you lacking the guidance
And you don't know what to do... but stay strong
And keep in mind that he always loves you...
It's what it is... that's right sugar love
Come on...
(Chorus: Willie Cottrell)
Josephine, the times are getting tough
Seems to me... you just wont get enough
The rain, wont wash away, your sins...
You'll be here, to do them all over again...
(Ghostface Killah)
Yo, I know this chick from the hood named Courtney Cox
And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
She's awfully hot, asshole burning like tobasco
She used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go
Started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe
Thought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right
Infactuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
Putting dope in the cook, searching for her vein
Tracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain
The monkey on her back is now a gorilla
Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's gon' kill her
The clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman
Destroying her pretty image and her health
Got me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?
I seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching
(Trife Da God)
She wakes up, with an urge to get high
Everyday, the same routine, needing the mood of fix to get by
So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle
Tie a sock her arm and start shooting up the diesel
Had a flesh back, screwing some dude up in his hashback
The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack
A regular John, she met her through Tom
She passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
Dying a slow death, oh, she losing her dear mind
From the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind
Uh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS
Lost her appetite, hardly slept in days
Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around
With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases
Two months pregnant, carrying around her fetus
But they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners
(Interlude: Ghostface Killah)
Josephine, what's wrong, baby?
Come on...
(Ghostface Killah)
Yo, what your momma gonna think of you girl?
Her little baby's all doped up, strung out on the world
Try'na make some quick cash for a hit of that stash
Listen, baby, you growing up much too fast
Uh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto
For those getting high, using drugs on every level
Living your life, day and night, getting stoned
You better leave those drugs alone, feel me?
(Willie Cottrell)
Up all night, under the party lights
Same old popping and party hopping
All of your so called friends, are leading you down the wrong road
Leading you back to crack, it's a known fact
It is time, that you need me, I'll be there, to help ya
I'll be your leaning pole when you're falling down
I'll be there, when you falling down (sooner or later)"

Ass in some spades
(Tell 'em girl) And if they ain't got it at that store
Get it at the 99 cent store, nigga

I keep runnin' to the bathroom, shittin' {where the tissue at?}

Countin' up g-stacks, eatin' Ken' Fried Chicken
Who wanna play spades? Word to rap, I'm givin' y'all a whippin'
Guzzled a couple, now, I'm seein' double
Rubbin' my girl leg, lookin' at Barbara, her sister got a nice bubble
I used to fuck her while she was seated by Bags from Brooklyn
He drove a Jag', she cut me off when she turned Muslim

We gon' high to this (and diners, and restaurants, I don't know)
Yeah... yo...

Aiyo, I couldn't get enough from the way she smell
Was it Baby Phat, J.Lo, or straight Chanel
Her face belongs in a Luther video, Never Too Much
The way she smile, her face look pretty, though
Hands is soft, feet, no calysses
Her father owned six pallets in palaces
Laying out in New York, crush villas in Vegas
Greatest designer wear, son, she sport the latest
So I, pause the smooth talk, made her a drink
Blew her a kiss, as I sat down, she smiled and winked
Stood up, grabbed my hand, what up, slid ya boy to the bedroom
Popped the suitcase, I'm in the lead room
This check was loaded, equipped, with fifths
Porcelain handles with horse back kicks, whispered
""You know what, Ghost, I do hits"" But niggas get fooled
By the sexyness, I'm a real gritty bitch
(Chorus: Method Man)
Killa Lipstick, my femme fatale, with the biscuits
A hit chick, now I'm number one on her hitlist
She killing the game, 'cause she the business
Type of chick that love you to death, then leave no witness
Killa, I call you Killa 'cause you slay me
Killa, you murda, mami? Ooh, you such a fucking lady
Killa, drive me half crazy, let's go half on this baby
Killa Lipstick, k-k-killa
(Ghostface Killah)
Yeah, this white chick Everlay, she smell Downy
Had her best friend named Jade, from Rockland County
Double cokeheads who love cartoons, type chicks who eat pussy
Listen to Prince and play with they wombs
Flight attendant out of Delta Airline, get money girls
Travelled the world, only one did jail time
Jade, her father's a judge, same nigga in the O.J. case
When he tried on the glove, but uh, in this scenario, four A.M.
The bars closed, now we at it again
Drunk nigga, come out I'm popping mad shit, he's past it
Nancy Drew, drew out her purse, the blue steel ratchet
Didn't even say shit, she blasted, barrel smoking
Shot the Henny out his hand for laughing
These are my bitches, Nancy and Jade
Natural born killas be letting they guns blaze... god damn!
(Masta Killa)
Look she tired of the same old basic, let's face it
This is how she wants to be laced, I'm raping it
Anywhere, I'm taking it, she loving how the gangsta flex
This is thug sex, Iking it, nasty talk
As she liking it, spanking it, she biting the sheets
She's a freak, my view from the embassy suites
Is off the beach shore, Dirty would've love you, mami
'You like it raw?' A tear drop, fucking you slow
I see your knees knock, your love is so sweet
If I switch beats, and hit you with angles, you might breathe
You know the Godbody make healthy wise seeds
You, plus a glass of weed, is all he need
You could travel so far, look, maybe book a flight to Mars
To escaping at, one forty two?
They take Jet Blue for two, into Long Beach
Rain lifted whipping the port, from when I touch
Look something nice up in the stash, hit a Dutch"

Break out of town when the Jakes take down the Pharaoh

Blowing coolies into hoopties, slamming cuties and ice
Big heavy pots over hot stoves
Mayonnaise jars of water with rocks in them got my whole projects out of order

Get caught with this, niggaz'll grow to fail
Stop playing, pot slaying, baking soda and scales

Thirteen getting it, pyrex whipping it
Like UPS, pack it up, shipping it
Whether base or sniffing it, I got your fix
The story's foretold like apocalypse
It was me Michael T.T., handing out freebies
Taking over blocks, telling niggas to be fee
Where big brother 'Vine'll leave the body in the street
Something kinda like how I be bodying the beat
We was 300 deep like the Persian soldiers
Word spread fast, we was serving boulders
Ten crack commandments, holy Moses
If you don't fit must equip icer toners
Never grip they holders, fingers to the snitchers

But we be God damned if taking all our business

And I got faith in my man, Lest
Take down the King's throne
Conquer the warzone

Lester Kane, I call him LK for short
See LK pushing for that King of New York
Few million dollar cribs
Liberace jewel box, go ox
Ostrich leather shoes, the Egyptian socks
Tailor made shoes built like a brick house
Six foot nine, son
The guard had to duck in his house
Keep a trail of bitches, I'm talking three on each side
The head of this to the kid
Walk with black pride
He a monsoon mastermind
Flyer than the Isleys
Put a pop in your pudding
But not the Cosby's type
I'm talking big guns and Cadillac coupes
The New York monsignor's just scared of his suits
And his troops is like loyal lions, ready to feast
At the first drop of blood that falls down from the beast
Roam these streets with iced out case for the syndicate
Fucking with Lester on these blocks, boy, you in for it

All hail to the King Kane
Sling remarkable razor lines
Organized crime brung shotty's under the trenchcoat
Black Bugatti with gold spokes, folks get heart attacks
Sitting on top of the glow. money in garbage bags
Washing up the restaurants, nightclubs, etc
Pinky ring worth a small island, I raise the bezel up
Women on they're night strolls turning tricks and they trained to go
Nothin' stoppin' my function, got coppers on the payroll
Lawyers and judges quick to toss cases when I say so
King of New York with pesos
Leaving 'em foaming, mouths stitched
Eyes wide shut but speaking on my firm
When will they learn, loose lips will get your flesh burned
Puffing on a Cohiba Cuban
Them rubies got some bullets with they're name on it
And I'm itching to send it through
City is mine with war on my mind
And take the thrown by design
Yes, it's mine, I claim the spot 'cause I'm

Temper like a old dad who lost his kids
Lester'd be the first to spaz out and slap you with
Headlocked the bitch, spit in the mouth while she screaming
Tie her to the cross in the church and write ""Demon"" in blood
On her titties, no remorse for life
He wild for the night, son, gun and knife
Living trife reckless, hang a man by his necklace
Then mail it to his family with blood still on it
Few black roses, maybe a finger or two
He out to be the King of New York
And he gon' do exactly what he put his mind to
He a crimeboy, he's diligent
Silverback gorilla and he's killing it
Ruthless, this man reminds me of myself
Tony Stark, the King obsessed with wealth and power
Built for the takeover
Rearrange your whole damn face
You need a makeover
Pushing for the King of New York, I see it
Gangsters try so hard but can't be it
Only one could rise above all the rust

Empty ya pockets'fore the cops come
When I bus take off past the light that ass better Run
An' don't look back (no), hide if you have to
Dollar vans, just Run into boats if he have to
Even got a .38, don't give me no hastle

I'm about to smash that pussy like baby Aspirins
I'm fuckin' her, like I had feelings for the bitch
I caught feelings for the bitch, fuck in Pretty Tone's whip
If I wasn't whipped, why I keep givin' up my dick
Like it's voodoo on the kid, I keep suckin' on her clit
From the bed to the bathroom, Toney dickin' her down
Sweatin' bullets like we in the ring, goin' some rounds
Miss Lucy, eatin' sushi, playin' with her cucci
On some Lil' Kim shit, tattoo right up on her booty
That said ""Bet you five beans, you can't even move me""
Know how to work the pussy muscles when your dick is in that cootie
That's right, yeah her nookie's the bomb
She had niggaz wrapped around her middle finger, like the female Fonz
But anyway know what, I'mma call her again
Dododododododo, if she diss me, I'mma fuck up her Benz
""Hello?""
""Hey woman, this is the second time I've called you!""

Yo boo, let's cut the crap, you know we like each other
I been wanting you bad, yo, that's word to my mother
I know you got a man and I'm involved
But we can play this right, if we shuffle the cards
I've been wanting you for mad years, when the elevators broke
I run and help you with your bags upstairs
I was scoping you out, today you was late to leave by 8
With no time to be at work at 9
She'll be back by 6, son pissed you off I know
When I spoke, yo, you didn't say shit
But still you was looking mad cute to me
With your lips poked out being rude to me
You're still sexy, luscious and all them words
Only girl in the building with a full length fur
Had no choice to raise and press up explain how I feel
It's only your love I want the best of

Folding your clothes by the dryer, my drawers is wet
So you passed me a Bounce one fell when I bend down
And got up you start tonguing me down
Butterflies ran across my stomach
Didn't wanna put the fire out 'cause goddamn, I love it
Moved the basket out the way, cleared the table
Laid you down, my mouth slid past your navel
Your feet had knocked over the Clorox bleach
Held my head closer to you when my tongue got deep
I'm saying we both of those, this how I feel
If you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal
But ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes
Somewhere inside I know you feel the same
It's alright tho you look like you know how to get it

139,Life's A Rebirth,2015,Twelve Reasons To Die II (2015),,Ghostface Killah,"(RZA:)
With Lester Cane's revenge complete
There's only one thing left to do
Logan begs him to stop, but Lester does not listen
He puts the gun to his head, and pulls the trigger
Killing himself with honor
Seconds before Lester's final breath escapes his body
Ghostface becomes consumed by a diabolical revelation
Inhabit the flesh of his young son, and he could live as a reincarnated Tony Starks
(Ghostface Killah:)
Ayo fuck it, I'm taking the soul of my son
Live through the eyes of my young
We gon' rule, conquer, pillage and destroy
Bulletproof shit, blast through alloys
But first things first bitch you fuck with the worst
Logan, I'm about to quench ya thirst
Put two to your head, leak brainial fluid
(No please! Starks, don't do it!)
Bang bang, no more time for compassion
My reactions to your action: Satisfaction
No more DeLucas, the rise of a new day
Hey, hey, Mr. GFK
The rhymes of the black suits no longer play
I'm avenged, a proud man walking the Earth
Satisfied with my kills and my life's a rebirth
So live long, and long live the illest
Twelve Reasons to Die, Ghostface Killah
(RZA:)
As thunder strikes, and the clouds smother the full moon
The soul of Tony Starks' son is cats into an abyss of fog
And the spirit of Ghostface Killah is [?] into his body
Becoming a human inferno of vengeful rage
Logan screams in terror, as she realizes her fate
The possessed boy begins stabbing her, again, again, and again
Now standing alone, blade in his hand, he grins at triumph
*Sighs* the sweet taste of revenge
Lester Kane and Tony Starks were nothing more of [?] spirits
Separated by time and space, but bonded together by violence and death
A touch of fate brought these two souls together
But for one of them, the ultimate price was paid
This is not the last we'll ever hear of Tony Starks
Actuality, this is a new beginning
Tony Starks was once a man, and became a demon
But now lives again, in the flesh and blood
Of the Ghostface Killah"
140,Lonely,2009,Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City (2009),,Ghostface Killah,"Don't be surprised when you see me 'round town
Walking around with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
On this cold pavement I feel like laying
In the middle of the street and just saying
I can't take it, I won't make it
Too much weight on my shoulders and my kids are getting older
For so long I've been so strong
I've been crying all week since you've been gone
And as the tears roll out my eyes
Another happy young couples walks by
Don't be surprised when you see me 'round town
Walking around with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
Someone been sleeping in my bed, eating my food
Using my soap, laying up in my pool
Walking around in his boxers like every thing's cool
Gassing my chick for the whip dropping her off at school
Under my covers and changing my channels
Playing my CD's in my robes, another man's burning my candles
My cologne's half way gone, a fake don my wiz fell for
Now she strolls the park under his arm
This is my fault, I've never thought I'd see this coming
From the outside bugging with crazy knots in my stomach
Say what goes around, comes around, now I know it now
Now I'm the fool looking in while it's going down
If somebody would of told me I might be lonely
Now it's on me, baby call me please
Don't be surprised when you see me 'round town
Walking around with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
Now he's getting all my kisses, stroking my loving
That 'posed to be me but I was too stupid and stubborn
Like a piece of rope I let it go, my mother said it so
You better straighten up don't act like you didn't know
Her birthday came, heard she was hugged up wearing his chain
Play in the sky box at some bullshit Knick game
My son said, daddy, he like his eggs well done
And he kinda cool, mommy happy, I can't front
He take us on trips and clothes shopping, most of the time
We watch flicks on your surround sound, he watch boxing
You better go beg or something before she go love him
He's taking your spot 'cause you was dissing mommy you bugging
They don't argue, he sent her flowers for no reason
She's cheesing, I'm wishing you could come back and see this
Don't be surprised when you see me 'round town
Walking around with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely"
141,Love,2004,The Pretty Toney Album (2004),,Ghostface Killah,"(Ad-libs by Musiq & K. Fox)
(Ghostface Killah)
First I loved God, then loved my mother
Love my babies, sisters and brothers
Love my father 'cause that's my mom's partner
Love my grandmother and my grouchy assed grandfather
Love my aunties on both sides of the family
Uncles, cousins, nieces and nepthews
Mess with my peoples you get stepped to
Love the mother of my children, them girls is special
Love feels good though we stuck in the hood
Love my last album, though the joint went wood
My man's and my enemies, I Love them too
Love God he let me see passed 32
Plus what he gave Wu
I chance to change music just listen, you and I know the truth
Love is essential, to some it's detrimental
Most of you would've use the next person as a rental
(Chorus: Musiq (K. Fox))
Love, lift us up, (higher) take us higher (high)
Like every ghetto flower (oh Love yeah)
'Cause Love, only Love has the heat and the power
And we can never give it up
Love, Love, Love
(Ghostface Killah)
Love life, the ground we walk on
My sickness, it made me strong
My loved ones in Heaven
The ones we lost, to heroin
Malcolm, Martin, and what they still for, the men had it poppin'
Love the sun when rain drops in, cosy night with mom punk in
Love the hell and my struggle
You gotta go through Hell to come out right, Love conquers pain and the puzzle
Funny on how Love could end so subtle
Was it just sex and not really Love for the couple?
Love people, Love the fact when there's a baby bein' born
Like ""push girl, come on""
I'm not just sayin' that 'cause BET's on
We is one, one Love, each one, teach one
(Chorus to fade)"
142,Love Don't Live Here No More,2014,36 Seasons (2014),,Ghostface Killah,"(Verse 1: Ghostface Killah)
Feelin' fresh, walkin' down the block
'Bout to see my boo, it's about 6 o'clock
Love is love, it'd been a long time comin'
9 long years, I know she missed my lovin'
Huggin', kissin' in the scent of the kid
She gonna fall out when she see me at the crib
Ding dong, can I speak to Bamboo?
It's me Penelope, stop actin' a fool
She said, ""damn, I thought you was dead
Not a phone call? Not a card in the mail?""
For real a phone call? Stop
You know I had to up and leave
I told you I'll be back, girl, but you ain't believe
She told me 9 was too long, and she got a new man
One who gon' stay and hold it down for the fam
So scram, there's no more love for the kid
So I turned my head down and walked away from the crib
(Hook: Kandace Springs (Ghostface Killah))
Loved so many times
I've been alone so long
Had to pull myself together
Find my heart a brand new home
Got a good thing goin' on
Can't let you mess with my flow
Too little, too late
Love don't live here no more
(Love is love, Tony's back up on the aisle)
(Gone for 9 years like 9 months to a child)
Cried so many times
(Where's my boo at? I need to see Bamboo)
(I got a lot of things on my mind, to explain to you)
Love don't live here no more
Love don't live here no more
(Interlude: Ghostface Killah)
It's like that?
Okay then where you put all my stuff at then?
You know, I thought, you know I swear he's, he been doin' this for too long
I done came home, you got another man, you know what
(Verse 2: Ghostface Killah)
Oh word, so you over it? That's absurd
I never did a damn thing to deserved it
This is a man's world, I go away come home lookin' for you
Now you fuckin' up the plans, girl
You another man's girl, that ain't kosher
Once you see the kid's face you're supposed to
Drop what you're doin', show your loyalty and love
Step out on the porch with a kiss and a hug
Yo you buggin'
(Outro: Ghostface Killah)
Just can't understand, you know. I treated you, I gave you everything you wanted. You know what I'm sayin'? And it's like you got another dude laying in the bed?
Wearin' my robes, wearin' you out
I know I was gone but damn, I just can't get it, baby
But I loved you though man, and I still do though"
143,Love Session,2001,Bulletproof Wallets (2001),,Ghostface Killah,"(Ghostface)
Just like a fresh pair of Royals on the first day of school
It was love, even from the jump I spoiled you
Before the fame camera cars and the glitter
Though my occupation is tasty for God's sake it came with the bitches
But that's on another note (uh-huh) let me explain here
Right now sugar on how I feel for you
Like when we UHH yo I get these crazy chills from you
And when we done, yo I know the perfect meal for you
The mashed joints, big onions on sauteed fish
Little Royal, candle and one big kiss
You my pumpkin and my 'nilla custard; you cussed me out
When you found condoms layin in my pocket I was busted
I gets right witchu (uh) form a life with you (yeah)
The type after sex get a warm rag and then wipe you
Hyped up love light it up, might bite you at the altar
I'm bitin off you, I'm wearin white too
(Ruff Endz)
Ain't it funny how tables turn, chase you all around
Change your life baby, 'cause I love you baby
(Chorus: Ruff Endz (+ ad libs))
Stuck with me through the thick and thin
Through the pain and strife... the love of my life
Said that it will ne-ver last
But I'm here by your side... the love of my life
(Ghostface)
And I'm here... that's my word
Only fight you when we makin' love, that's what I call it
Burnin the chronic we laughin' while I'm shittin on the toilet
Camcord it, happy times record it; the time you asked me
For them blue Nike's - I was like, ""Boo I can't afford it""
I was fucked up, plus I was stuck, Starks the King
Hit the block and still scraped up, eighty beans
How you like them apples? My technique is Taye Diggs
Your attitude is right that's why I made you my Wiz
The only girl that can make my shit jump, with the slightest touch
You at the stove while I'm grabbin my stuff
God forbid somethin' happen to us
Let's remain and friends and discuss our troubles and might try again
Word to my Iron pen, it's not good to hold the cryin in
I feel the same way your heart's trapped in the lion's den
Iron Man, I am him
It's the beauty in our souls through Allah where the love lies within
(Ruff Endz: repeat 2X)
Can't believe you found love in me, through everything
Held me down like my boys in the streets, here's the ring
Whatchu wanna do? Whatchu wanna do?
(Ruff Endz)
Every part of me, every thing I've done
Is still there, still there, still care, oh
Always been there baby
I don't wanna, and I don't wanna cry no more baby
And I love, and I love and I love you girl

To tell you all the things I feel when you're with me?
The day we met I knew I'd fall so easily
You must believe you're givin' everything I need
Never to much...
(Ghostface Killah)
Snatched the Princess
Tricks keep searchin for the glass slipper
The first time the brides maid zipped the zipper
Then walked down the aisle, look at little pretty Roxanne's smile
That's right, she big head child
Spot the glass on the hand, white valor laying across the floor
Draggin' damn, she got a good man
Family in the back, one half on both sides of the church
Look at Keisha in the tight ass skirt
Mom Duke in the front row, Grandma Pearl sittin' right next our row
Beside Uncle Joe, then right before her eyes
The preacher ask, ""Would it to death do you part if one dies?""
She replies, ""Yes"", the winnin' words that described best
Grandma pinned sittin' 30 on the right breast
Now she searchin for the slob-down, the block's slick vitamin joint
Mad water in her eyes at this point
The man holdin' the Bible announces, ""You're married for life
Sign my cheque, peace to the bridal""
Recall this one girl's marriage, one girl's carriage
One with the lucky fingers, grab it, she attracted to magnet
She might have cracked the safe, seen the cabbage
Now it's one love in the tablet
(Chorus: Ellie)
How do I begin
To show you I love you anywhere, it ain't no sin?
This love will outlast time, I can't remember when
I thought I lost you but now that you're in my arms
Just say you'll stay
(C-Wiggs)
Cobra popped, a bottle of black Burgundy, coversated
I stared at your green eyes stagnated, your butter milk skin
You smelled good but you taste even better
Eye ball walk/talk was first on the agenda
I 'member the first time we engaged in the act, in the ac'
You jumped on my lap and pushed the seat back
Passionate thoughts, I knew you would be the wiz
Now you hold my kids, my divine little wiggs
The grand souflan 'cause of your presence
So I'ma take it back to the essence just like Valentine presents
Long tongues and wet kisses, sex positions
Buy habista, siesta key, Florida visits
You exquisite young heart, I held you by afar, unchained
Our physical's 33 within the Range
Things have changed over the course of time
But you are mine, and I'm yours
I'm lookin' forward to you after tours
(Chorus: Ellie)
How do I begin
To show you I love you anywhere, it ain't no sin?
This love will outlast time, I can't remember when
I thought I lost you but now that you're in my arms
Just say you'll stay
Lalalalala, whoa, whoa, whoa
Lalalalala, whoa, whoa, whoa

(Verse 1: Kool G Rap)
Yeah fam listen, I'm ambitious
I'll leave a man missing
Plain and simple, tickin' under his transmission
Did my first hit 12 years old, pants sliddin'
A little place in Coney Island called the clam kitchen
I walk right up on the table where I can't miss em
And his bodyguard coming out of the can pissin'
The two waiters serving plates stood in a trance, shivering
I carried out the damn mission, that's loyalty
No regrets anything less will destroy the peace
A boss is a boss learn to respect royalty
Run off with money get put down in the soil free
Now sit down and enjoy the feast, boys kapeesh
Been running here for 9 years
And believe me none of them kind years
I done lost about 9 peers
Crime career never find fear
Soulless eyes my guys got a blind stare
(Verse 2: Nems)
My intuition told me play my position and stay loyal
You ain't got to get your hands dirty, I'll do it for you
I grew up on the crime side, the New York time side
And gave up on everything when my moms died
Perfected my craft on rooftops and staircases
Pulled robberies with no mask showing my bare face
Keep it G, low key, and never ball out
Got with a sick ass clique and went all out
Gat for gat back to back we can brawl out
Hundred deep run up in Macy's and aired 'em all out
Just give the ordering my niggas will come
Give me your gun, point 'em out and consider it done
The streets fathered me, so I'm considered its son
Keep it real stay sucker free and the figures will come
Live by the gun and put my life on the line
Anybody can get left bullets right through your mind"

Hoodied up blood in my eye, a lead to fly
Like fuck it (2 gunshots), look how these niggas duck shit
One kid hollerin what lookin' up, he the big wig
Fake ass cat, low life, sodomize mind
Beatin' niggas, big bricks of bread sellin mad dimes
His feet hurt, networkin he get no work
Yo smack him where his hand hurt, fuck what he worth
Yo he sucked his thumb smooth for the kid laced with the big guns
Stain to my Baltimore niggas that he on the run
Plus he ill in the drums, heartburn for life, calcium man
Watch him grab the Tums, he's a front
Pigeon totalist sister with the fat ass
Show hash behind up the block plus he smashed her
Big Bub did him somethin' deadly, act premedidtated
Buck 60 strike was the medley
Nice like Van Halen, seen him at the tunnel with his skin peelin
Did two days thought he was jailin
You get close, look at his hands
That's the same kid that cut his wrists, talkin' 'bout the cuffs did it
He ran away, frontin majorly, eyes like Sammy Davis jr.
Rounded off with a fade g, he sport the Bob Hope classics
Ran down Asics, Kmart, the short sleeve shit be the basics
He eat hams shitted on himself twice, big hatted Jews
Rushed the nigga out in Crown Heights
Yo let me tell you how the game go
We gettin' rid of all the prostitutes
Tony wants the streets back fo sho
Too many hustlers, too many thieves
We're fuckin' up who's willin' to fight and teach the c's
Too much TV, guns and robberies
Lust and greed and hate the 4 devils jealousy

Yo I champunch Mase in his face over some bullshit
The other night they kidnapped his brother pokin it with knives
It's rainin, 85 degrees kinda muggy
One of the nights they thrown in his face it's real ugly
Yo we up in Jonesy's posin, all these niggas know me
>From fuckin' wit, under theses niggas heavy parolees
Yo we played the speaker
And from a distance we could see these chains
The P slayed, flat on his chest, was two plains
Ashy hands yo, no need for rings at all
He just cracked the V8 backed up, leaned against the wall
Lookin' flower, he just came home, he on like a fuck
Did a dime for holdin' up the gods up in the armored truck
Ten years later son 280 on the weight tip
He throwin' up six plates plus he studied Matrix
He's a wally horse shout it out sweatin through his valor
Cock-eyed nigga back up his neck he had shores
Sammy eagerly rode up on him, taxi off the turkey with the joint
On him
Flower look his man stood up before him
The bitches hit the table, Jah king stripped off his cables
Shots went off, Sam'll get a chance to make his debut
Flower grabbed Tiff his man with the sideburns, hat fell off
We nerd his wigworms, he hid behind Rich
See Allah hit the light switch, young girls were trampled
In the measured pool, pistol with Mase, and broke the handle
Desperate crawlin to the door on all fours
Shim kicked the jukebox the theme song rode in was ""It's Yours""
Oh my goodness, Ba grabbed the Mo bottle thrashin
He layin like a gay models shoutin out Sebastian
He smiled with his teeth missin' begging for mercy
No more god, the 68 thousand down a pair of three
Out came the cannon, whistled out zaggin
Cham snatched his flag four big rocks enter the dragon
It's over, another story told

O-5 black suburban straight from General Motors
Walk through give the niggaz the shoulder
Just fucked this bitch on the sofa
Twisted the chocha, me'll flip on the culture
Had the bird niggaz shittin' in peels, clippin' your tail
Let the four-five kiss ya, as I'm liftin' your bail
Put a hundred wolves on you, have them pick up the trail
While I'm in the honeycomb, weighing bricks on the scale
Sippin' old M.A., me and my protege's, cause even on the coldest day
Your boy stil shine, giving off solar rays
(Ghostface Killah)
What you know about stepping out heavy, Just' jewels, no crew hurry
My inside pants leg, I'm packing like two machetes
One ratchet, two gloves and a mask
Jumping out of green rover, niggaz ballin' me down
That's when I reached over, figured they ain't go no matters
Young boys round here, they don't know my status
And niggaz looking for a full time jack move
But they don't know, that these blades here, crack dudes
Give it to 'em quick, something like fast food
Take a nigga gun, like 'you gonna blast who?'
Cinderella girl frontin' in them glass shoes
Homo thug bitch ass nigga, I'll smash you
You mad, cause you rockin' the shit bag
Smellin' like piss, when it popped your click ran
You fucking with powerful niggaz, devour your business
It ain't gravy, you pussy niggaz, you the Avon lady, fuck you
(Sun God)
Niggaz better stay in they place
'Cause when I stash the plastic mask on, leave a hole in your face
Who this young dude holding the weight
Got every drug from dope to bud, even small package your face
Niggaz bam, look God in the face, can't look in my eyes
I tell you why, cause this thing on my waist
Bread and butter, got it all for sale, and I'm duckin' the cops
On every block, I ain't going to jail
I ain't the type that'll rot in the cell
Never talk or fist fight, with drama, I'll be popping these shells
Hit your chest and your flesh get, hotter than hell
Them hollow tips make it hard to inhale, you not worthy
Vest and a white tees, and throwback jerseys
Julius Irvings, black suburban
Twisted off one-five-one, my whips swerving
Try'nna see that chips, full clips, no splurging

Verse One: Ghostface
Yo, black man watch out, she salt-water trout
Al Deuce dug her back out, inside the dugout
Heard the pussy was good, big niggaz fell victim
Mentally stripped 'em one God turned Christian
She know magic, soaking wet pussy on the mattress
Skin like Cleopatra's, the leading actress
She been fucking since we went to fourteen, look at Miss Thing
With a ponytail kept a jar of Vaseline
She's a big girl now, with a body that growl
Likewise murder trial, smile attract crowds
Most niggaz, would light the lord over this broad
Big niggaz in they drawers pose one knee on the floor
Little kids daydream of humping 'Wildflower'
Hanna Barbera faint I'm riding no Rivera
Verse Two: RZA
Fat-ass whips big asses, colourful lips
Wide hips, baller kits, chrome dipped wearing
Blue kicks, plus jeans booming beats
Loud horn beeps, crowded streets, the fusion yo
The heat is on, never too black or too strong
In one hour Wu-Tang Clan is about to perform
Police barricade, sidewalk crowded like parades
The arena now present, de event of the decade
Long braids and fades, baldheads, spangle waves
Extensions, nails Friday, just got paid
Headliner or marquee is the prime time rhyme crime family
That shines Godly light
Upon this Hip Hop artform, yo Dunn
We can't be measured by no chart, the God brung
Never bust premature for sure
You want it raw, let me plant my dynamite bitch
Deep inside your core, the explosion stops the menstruation
Causes stomach inflation
Patiently waiting nine months for deportation
Of the Earth from the Moon, black woman stay in tune
Yo God, let me pour y'all the science about the womb
It's a black hole for those who lose control
Fertile soil before you are wise
And spoiled many men and took many lives
And all you brothers changed sides
Only worth a decimal compared to those who died inside"

Back in the dollar bill he sniffed like six lines
He put his Gat down, why he do that?
Creeping through the crib is Maxine pot holdin' down with the grits
Pam sucking his dick, Maxine Al Greened him screaming slipped in piss
He ran into Ceas' room, grits down cryin' aight with his balls out
He stepped on Clarences' Biggie Smalls album
Mooney get that niggaz, Pam yelling rip that niggaz
Mooney went and got that dye out the kitchen
James jumped on Moon, poked him with a screw driver
Broke the TV Niggaz watching Knight Rider
This is Pam Jerkins mother house the same shit go on in her brother house
(Ghostface)
You know Mooney is only a buck o'five wet
He only had two hundred dollars worth of shit
And the kids tore his ass up, the Ceas had a huddle up
I felt sorry for'm, the funny shit when bowlegged Keke hopped on 'im
Jumped on him pigeon toed Moony poured dye on him
You should've seen his motherfuckin' face fryin', half dyin'
They stuck a fork through his nuts
The little girl was happy she beat the brotha up
Quick pick the window up Mooney over heard
Right before they threw him out the Nigga said Word!?!
On the count of three he landed on the first floor balcony
Blood brains splashed... he was dead? and the cops never came

Hungriest shit, seventeen dummies a clip

Uh, thirty thousand feet up in the air, up in the lear
Dressed in a black tux, forty cal. tucked, strapped to the chair
Half asleep, hopping out of my seat, caught in the daze
Turned around and seen a white man's face, covered in shades
I must of passed out, can't remember shit before I blacked out
Three more niggas approaching, holding they mack's out
One spoke, gave me the keys, to a boat
Reached in his trenchcoat, and pulled out a yellow envelope
Which contained twenty thousand in cash, a photograph
Of a Colombian nigga with a long mustache
Miguel Sanchez, keep a gun hidden in his pants leg
With armed bodyguards, surveillance around his land spread
He runs a billion dollar organization, under investigation
Plus he's wanted by immigration
Now I'm stuck, crazy look on my face, shocked in amazement
How the fuck I get involved with these federal agents
They knew my background, knew about what happened down in Sac Town
They knew about the wrap down south, they laid they backs down
Said I had two decisions, take out Miguel and his cartel
Or spend the rest of my life in prison
A classified mission on some James Bond shit
007 style, love to get some straight convicts
Now I'm pondering, my thoughts wandering, got my girl on the phone
Told her to kiss little Jay 'cause I'll be gone again
Honey, I can't sleep, she sucking her teeth
If everything go good, baby, I'll be home in a week
Pinching myself just to see if I'm dreaming, call up my team and
Meet me by the docks in Miami, I'll fly out this weekend
(Sun God)
I got you nigga, four-four pop two niggas
That drug lord that we want, got a spot for niggas
And if we kill 'em, it's back to the block, my nigga
He carried rugers, thirty four shots I figure
He only holla at the kid, when there's money involved
They pack shotguns, hollow tips, dummies and all
When me and Trife doing right together, got no choice
But give us ten, like we selling white together
Left side, four-five, right, black beretta
Taking trips over seas, flipping packs for better
Every flight a hundred stacks and better, so grind hard
Get ya money up, get on your grillies, don't mind odds
Fuck a cop car, throw on some chumpers, and drop charge
Hit the block hard, it's kinda hard being G-O-D
If he owe Trife, he owe me
Load up the mack grounds, M-I-A, call that the jack town
Tell niggas I'm on my way, coming back down
Miguel, Mr. Sanchez, it's a wrap, now
Theodore extorting your shit, handing out packs, now
I used to listen to 50 and jam ""Back Down""

Fifty a wop, purple top, nigga, I'm back, clown

Thinkin' I'ma fold under pressure, y'all wanna see me break
Had these niggaz skating on ice, doing a figure eight
Twelve getting strong in the game, y'all can't touch me
I must be, made out of steel, y'all can't crush me
Watch how I paint this picture, into a mixture
With symbolic words, when they merge they form a scripture
Tone be that nigga, I belong in the ficture
Very necessary that my robes is furry
Picture me, in the King's chair blowin' on bark
Before queens holding toothbrushes, scrubbin' my Clarks
Feedin' me grapes, give me style shakes, Frosted Flakes
Flood the plate, twenty four karats that intake
I'm all over the globe, like water in moat
Cocaine cookouts over portable stoves

Watch how we milk 'em this year
Y'all niggaz straight soft, like silk in this here

But this time around, we got a new sound for deaf ears

So it's a new direction that my rhymes is aimed in

The way that we walk, the way that we talk
It's our language

I'm something like Matt Damon, and backin' in my Bourne Supremacy

Deadly ready or not, y'all people better steady the block
Or keep the heat coming, steady or not
Don't want no trouble with Joe
We'll throw blows that empty out the whole bungaloo
If y'all soldiers can handle my click
Then walk forward and find the one that make you ceist to exist
You never heard me spit as lethal as this
Flippin' ya brother man, on the other hand will empty a clip
If I build, my life hangs in a myst, the balance we call this
Dark and light, I know wrong from right
But am I wrong if I live my animal appetite
Have a feast in the middle of night, riddle me right
And more righteous, must of all your might, you can't bite this
Cause the man in your mirror is my lightness, and know that act is right"

No doubt!
Verse One: Raekwon the Chef, AKA Lou Diamonds
Rich man, poor man, read the headlines
Nigga getting murdered for spot and bigger dimes
Jobs and drug wars, living by gun law
Jail cats come home and want to take yours
As the young one, growing up broke me and my people
As the self, huh, I guess we all in the same boat
Think it, plus drinking that 90-proof
Playing on the roof saying we need a next man to shoot...

Verse Two: Ghostface Killer, AKA Tony Starks
Yo, I know a rich kid, who got hit for three bricks
Showing off his 850 plus, what a nice whip
Young blood guzzling forties hussled in a rain
Old Earth, shooting dope in her veins
He never had it all, the kid loved basketball
Had a favourite song, ""I Miss You"" written by Aaron Hall
Now back to the original neighbourhood criminals
Clocking dollars, by the hour like his digital
Styrofoam silencers, he rolled around with the
Wildest niggaz peeling caps known as the Islanders
From Staten, where crazy clips be clapping
Slept in his principal spreads, threads made of satin
Labelled as the cow he had crazy beef
Seen him at the flicks, he pulled out on Duke, Hez and Latief
But he fucked up, he should of kept it real and went for kill
'Cause if he don't, these niggaz with black barrels will
But, shit will never calm down, one day downtown
He dropped an ounce off money had slept like a nightgown
He rolled up in the Albee Square, relax like he lived in there
Two kids was beaming him, them niggaz from the movie theatre
One had all Guess on, looking like he had a vest on
The other felly pell tucked with a firearm
Moving slow, baseball hats, crazy down low
Word life God, this bull kag nigga gotta go
Oh shit! Bookhead, just bought a 5, G headed King Tudpea
About the size of Little Maurice
We got to get up baby, no cousin, count to ten
I'm running in my first instance is to return em, the time is now
Warfare and pull delf
Remember me, the nigga from the UA and you pulled out
Don't move don't even flinch
Fix 'em up, drop the head, don't want to get blood in the tut
He burped, I shot him, bitch screamed out I'm robbing him
Had to hit him ten more times make sure I got him
Told the owner lay on the floor, shake the comedy
Randy came out whacked out with a half a shotty
I laughed, grab the King Tut head and the cash
Then he shot my man in the ass and broke mega glass
Damn, had to go out with a blast
I shot my way up out of the Albee fast
(Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child)
Oh shit, what the fuck?
This shit is horrible."

Yeah, testing one-two, one-two
Testing, one-two, yeah, one-two
(Ghostface Killah)
I've lived the life of Sonny Carson
Favorite slacks was the baby blue knitted sharkskins
Custom made like the ace of spade
Switching robes when I leave the forum
In the sleeve is a classic date
Russian cut, mustard handle, 'bout the same size
Of little tight Shawn with his Nikes on, still blamp you
Vamp you, throwing homo's out they sandals
Leave your brain all chunky like I'm advertising soup from Campbell's
Bowl legged old man give me props, all I do is buy 'em a bottle
Hit 'em off, like ""peace, pops!"", Fishscale got the streets hot
All you gotta do is go on the road, with Dipset, Rae & D-Block
And that's how we take New York back (yeah)
Flex and the Pitbulls, Heavy Hitters, Kay Slay, Absolut
Camillo, Lantern, load the wax up, cock and shoot
Cypha Sounds, DJ Clue, Envy, next, Staten be the scoop
(Chorus: Ghostface Killah)
We them brick, flippin' niggas with Cash Rule, relax duke
Doctor bills, funerals, that's what cash do
Come around here, fronting, we'll splash you
Staten Island murder goons, cousin, we'll scratch you
(Ghostface Killah)
Yo, heard some of y'all singing like Lou Rawls
Try to fuck me, you gon' suffer from blue balls
Tone's a karate champ, shottie champ
You period niggas be spotting with bad cramps
Intestines looking like chitlings
All we need is hot sauce, my pork eaters, go and get rid of 'em
Kites and death threats, y'all keep sending 'em
For every dart you throw, my last one's killing 'em
Like cancer patients, in the process, losing they hair
You'll be fighting for life, scratching and gagging
Panicking, gasping for air, suffocating from no-wind syndrome
Like somebody cut the neck of a deer
It's algebra in the third, Alfa Alfa with the gun to the rascal
Jessica Alba is one of my birds
Plus AlcaSeltzer's blowing up bursts
Out to melt you brain cells like Alien herb
(Ghostface Killah)
Get lost in my hood, it's like you lost in El Mira
You might get poked up, smoked up, throat cut
Rocking them little fly chains, get yoked up
Y'all Boar's Head niggas, y'all just cold cuts
Victims of night time street horror, going home with casualties
The twelve gauge blew a path in your knee
That's what happens in war, when the high heaters don't eat
We creep, our stomach growls loud, so we don't sleep, tote heat
Won't speak, (we them), we them grill niggas, we smoke beef"
161,Murder Spree,2013,Twelve Reasons To Die (2013),,Ghostface Killah,"Yeah, yo, there's a dozen ways to die, six million ways to do it
Let's go through it, my mind flow like fluid
Torture, chop your legs up, thrown off the boat
Guillotine, nigga, one chop to the throat
Suffocation, saran wrapping your face
Buried alive, throw a few nails in the case
Manslaughter, eight degrees of separation
Leave your body chopped up in a piece, that's mutilation
Six million ways to die, cyanide in your drink
Catch a cuban necktie for your mink
Dahmer style, cut up and stuffed in the fridge
And maybe washed up and show around thunder the bridge
Hit him with the whip, drag him half a block
Machete or the sock full of padlocks
Chainsaw, switch your medication
Stomp a nigga out till he one with the pavement
Torture, he's gruely peaking at the meeting
Suspicions of him being a rat? even worse than cheating
I'm cold reaking of ice picks, scratch and sticks and closed fists
Brassknuckle steel toe kicks
Crack ribs, punch your lungs, hard weaving
He's gasping and wheezing for air, his breath he can't catch
He clinches the shirt on his chest
In a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed
First things first, I chop your head to your fingertips
Butcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments
Make sure it's legitimate, conceal all my fingerprints
Chop, chop your body up quick then get rid of it
A hole in the desert, body bag, just polluted it
Your miss was a snitch too? shotgun killed the bitch
Leave her in the wilderness, suffocated and scarred up
Your brother want more too, blow his fucking car up
Another homocide city, murder mystery efficiently
Delete your fucking history broke bone, missing teeth
Throw bones, it's slippery, brings on the triple beam
All topped and chopped up, my luck is a mr. clean
Clorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene
Photograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team
Won't leave a trace of evidence for the case
It's sinister to finish it, hit with the man with no face
Red wine and pink pill
Unknowingly that this would be his last meal
Cut the voice, made the field, six inch stiletto heel
Kept his refills filled
Till he's like the gas, kept him still for the real deal
Hitman from brooklyn, tommy gun specialist
Sipped cavasier at the bar then waited till she lit a cigar
Then sprayed
Them shatter wine glass he laid, he never saw it coming
Yo, murder one, bullets went fast through the flesh
I cocked the sawed off shotty, put a hole in your chest
Blow your lungs out, I've seen you been smoking for years
You got no heart, I'll hunt you down like cape fear
Push your brains out the back of your head, blow off your hands
Leave your body in a dumpster, head in the trashcan
Cell catching scene look clean as a whistle
Ghost carved through your skin tissue till the bone grizzle"

You probably showed him your sexy faces, how you ride on top
Grabbin the sheets, in a deep zone if he hit the spot

That night I cried with the kids, I was out

Feed your mother and your family, my wildest fantasies
Take place, overlooking real high mountains
They wrote our name in the sky, see baby, we 'bout it!
This is all us, Adam and Eve if you want
This time, we respect God's work from the jung'
That's all you ever said, Ghost fed, many heads
Broke dead, I'm going bald, girl, I can't grow dreads

CiCi Vet on the beach steps give me slow neck
She's lyin', she be on X
She's tired, she a house wreck (that's right)

I never left you, you left me
You thought if you break out from the kids, you'll be stress free
Talkin' 'bout it, baby, you my first lady
You let me suck up on them nipples

And the worst, don't it hurt, my love, stay alert

I need a girl that's stacking and popping
When I come in late she's not clocking
Not in the crib throwing 'round pots and
Nice girl, that's clean, that was raised to cook
Be on the couch chilling, shorts on, reading a book
Biting on a pen, thin glasses on
French type frames by Yves Saint Laurent
Say hey pretty mama, do you fit the bill?
Do you got what it take for you to fit in my wheel?
Would you bust that steel if niggas came to kill me
Protect that safe, baby, dag that's filthy
Whoa, somebody let her know up in here
He like Papa Smurf, I'm like Papa Bear
I'm just looking for a queen so I can rock her ear
Tell her P. Tone in here I got her locked this year
I'm not your average girl, I be your Bonnie right beside you
No need to worry, boo, I got you, yeah
I'm not your average girl, see me without you is unlikely
Them other bitches they not like me
You can have keys to the boat, money follow me
I got the cheese and the yolk, plus the juice
That's fresh squeeze with the pulp, mama got a big butt
Tiffany chain, the stones freeze in the throat
Love to hold my hand, stepping off planes from D.R.
Luggage with a big black tan
Whatcha gonna do? You or him, me or you?
Fucking with him you look mad pitiful
Boo, I'm not the type that be slobbing down hoochies
Looking at these hoes, eyes low like Droopy
Tugging on my jacket 'til the lights come on
We run trains on them bitches never ice they arm
That's a no, no, chicken heads looking for a come up
In the club oh my God, now they wanna run up
Nagging 'til the sun up, shut up, I'm not a double-up, boo
Go get your feet done, your toes 'cause they knuckles up
I'm not your average girl, I be your Bonnie right beside you
No need to worry, boo, I got you, yeah
I'm not your average girl, see me without you is unlikely
Them other bitches they not like me
Baby, baby, don't waste your towel
Looking any further 'cause the girl is ours
Holds it down for you, any place, any time
You already know, I'm the one, yeah, I'm that
Fly girl, rider, just say the word
Anything pop off, it's us against the world
Such a hood girl with that dirty loving
That'll make your toes curl
Yo, relax and chill analyze the story
Love your boy Tone got mass appeal
All them other little players ain't as half as real
They just wanna get up in you like Mass and Gill
But me I need a wisdom play it like wifey
Well mannered understand the kid and not bite me
All my real ladies put your hands up
Holla at your boy if you ain't a groupie right now stand up

No need to worry, boo, I got you, yeah

Hit his stash, dip back, to the Lab, make him flip
Uptown, BOO-DOOP, now we back on your ass
Incognito, fatal aikido blow, pop a needle
Dick a knock-knee hoe, bust out her fetal
Nine inch long strong, Bobby pop the bitch thongs
Spit on her, then I banged on my chest like Kong King
Merciless Meng, point the killa bee sting
Ring DINGS, right through your head BING
Snap the wing off of bats, my battleaxe tongue hacks tracks
Once the ball drop, I'ma snatch ten jacks
Pass the crack to a niggarette, puff a looseleaf cigarette
While your man search the internet for +Bob Digitech in Stereo+
Crazy as Shapiro
Multiply myself ten times standin next to zero
And snap my fingers like the Fonz
And bag me a golden bronze skinned girl with the honey blonde
Dip hair, make a nigga flip in his chair

Stomach fat as a pancake for her man's sake
Used to fuck her when she menestraute

Aiyo, it's my turn, Wiggs, top of the food chain
I've been starving, waiting for this money train
Now I gorilla, monkey jump and spaz on beats
Slang doctrine, throw some new words in the streets
Roll sheets to the icky, chocolate Wonka
I'm like the ice cream man, I make the block go bonkers
(Ghostface Killah)
Please, we puff little Christmas trees
I keep a, chick on her knees, some custom dungarees
Two-tone hungry's and a whole lotta cheese
Coconut waffles, pa, I blow like the breeze

And the block can't knock me, cause my style's too cocky

It's Theodore, Starks Enter', make it hot in the winter

Duck out the way (better move nigga)
Before you clap or get sprayed (brrrrr-aow)

Ok, I see you wanna take it down to the grit
Like I've been through the struggle, pa, and can't handle the shit
I'm a gorilla, I beast everything in the eye
Rock an eightball jacket in the middle of July
(Shawn Wiggs)
Verbal slaughter, grey goose and vitamin waters
Slumped in the gym, throwing the dumbells all out of order
Knockin' scuffs on my Reeboks... (say what)
I got that old drunken style, that spit time in detox
A to Z blocks I see Oz for the weed spot
Anthony Acid for the party on the roof top
Custom made jewels, I got my own spot
Like my chain all chunky, and my ladies so lovely
V.I.P. with a bottle of Goose
It's Wiganomics, no beginner, make it hot in the winter
And my gun gonna speak the truth, I told ya to

Aiyo, the block can't knock me, 'cause they love when I'm cocky
Rock a mink with some Phat Farm jeans

A big dooky ass charm, hot broad on an arm
Yo Wiggs show 'em how to serve them fiends

I hit the block like a ton of bricks

But only give me five harder knicks
Dirty pillow, we bulletproof cars are armadillo
Got the whole tri-state weeping like willow
Get that money, I need a Hugh Hefner account

171,Outta Town Shit,2006,More Fish (2006),,Ghostface Killah,"I'm six foot two and a half
With shoes on make it three even
Been shot but I'm still breathing
Sent niggaz back to Pittsburgh
With they necks wrapped up no lie
See that's what happens when slugs fly
Doves cry when a thug dies
It might rain if you're a love guy
Glocks we tote 'em in belong pawn shops where we resold 'em
And going in we let the fiends hold 'em
Fake aliases, no driver's license or socials
But we cold cheek shit, so many hammers left the clerk speechless
Outdoors my niggaz is dirty
Rollin' smoke in the back seat sippin' orange juice
Bumping Blackstreet, suede wallets, Wallabees
Pea soup Clarks, music blastin', laughin' with the whip in park
Bodies for lunch, they eat those
Old school guns is like old albums, clean 'em and they keep goin'
Hey man it's rough outside
Crack heads is buyin' all night
Handguns is necessary
Fuck around you might lose your life
Anywhere in and outta town B
The same every hood it's so real
That you gotta be on your grizzly
If not then you might get pideeled
Like one day right over a powerful dice game in Minnesota
We hit the mall up for kicks
Slid, in other words bounce, tip the chauffeur
To get that cheddar cheese back we lost from earlier
Get back the dices shaking, stretching my arm like Troy Aikman
What's in the bank? Nigga what? Twelve grand bowl 'em
No little shit on the floor roll 'em
That's what I do (sounds of dice shaking)
Six 'em girls, hit his kicks
I'm a still show that motherfucker he fish
Pound cake, beat that bitch
Holy smoke! I admire your roll
Two fours and a five, they all applause and he smiled
But confident me, yeah I threw my twelve on the ground
Grab the dice, blew on 'em
Passed off the other thirty five thou, I'm doin' 'em
Nigga move shoot 'em, what's that? You roll a five?
Twenty or better y'all, I'm taking all side bets! Everybody spread out!
Watch the magic number that my pretty hand let out
My first roll was one two four, picked 'em up
Somebody screamed out, ""Tony Starks headed for the dust off!""
I'm like hell no I'm headed for the gun store
Punch you in your motherfuckin' face like Spongebob
Watched his face when he aced, the place got quiet
Bowled like twenty forty times, my arm got tired
Couldn't hit a point, not even a deuce
Took a swig of my man's goose
Anything just to give me a damn boost
Then out came a wonderful six
Holy shit! Stack that shit
Yo Trife Dies snatch that fuckin' cream quick
That was one one six, one sixteen point C
And I don't care about no motherfuckin' Royce Green
He pulled out, he pointed at me, I pointed at him
My main man pointed at them
They pulled their guns out and pointed at him
And crazy shells they was coming in
Hey man it's rough outside
Crack heads is buyin' all night
Handguns is necessary
Fuck around you might lose your life
Anywhere in and outta town B
The same every hood it's so real
That you gotta be on your grizzly
If not then you might get pideeled
This just in, breaking news
Today in Downtown Minnesota, a tragic shootout occurred at 5:23 pm
An alleged witness says things went haywire over a dice game
Two black males were shot in their buttocks
Leaving one critically wounded
Two others were pronounced dead on the crime scene
At a nearby hospital, three New York men are recovering
In stable condition but are being held under police supervision at this time

Spitting liquor in they mouth, cold Moet
Captain Morgan, taking flicks, posing, holding my tech
With cowboy hats and coach bags, they party like rockstars
Bo Gary watches, just chill, they down in the shark bars

You could find me fucked up like the mice in cheese

Karate, black belt and I bring booze
To big bar brawls, ball games blasting, fuck till my balls blue

We like the black Yankees, old vets who sit in the rest
Thankful, counting up currency and move when it rain, pour
From every bitch that we bless, we hit up, automatic love

We put it down, Columbian style, with three killas
Based on money, dummies'll die
It ain't funny, trying to front on mine, we get in ya mommy
Keep cool, nigga, read him the rules, before he bleeding in pools
And fuck my shit up, and I'ma just lose
Paid a lot of paper to live here
American Gangster status, Big Brother, lemme get in ya ear
You know what time it is, crime it is

We gon' stay fly, hit lye, rock diamond shits (no question)
Based on a general's fist of fury
Neck, arm, money, all of that's crispy jewelry

Let me show you how I g ride, nina on both sides
Nobody riding shotgun but the four-five
Nigga, if you won't try, I'll give ya something to regret
Throw that mothafucking semi to ya neck
Throw the other black Jimmy to ya chest
If you budge, you get stretched, nothing more, nothing less
Pay respect, I'm a element of Homicide Housing
In other words, bitch, I'm the resident from Homicide Housing
Known for drug dealing, stack thousands
Four hundred grand in the couches, two hundred grand on the houses
At any time I could move up out this
And go and cop some shit up in the moutains

Aiyo, aiyo, you know ya boy stay fresher than produce
Timberland snow boots, collecting more CREAM than a toll booth

Call me Arab Diesel 'cause I'm a track bomber
Roger that, my niggaz ain't got it cracked
All we do is dollar stack, get twisted like bottlecaps
While you on the block getting indicted
We island hopping, globe trotting through the friendly skies flying United
There's a party over here and everybody's invited
The headliners is Theodore and everybody's excited

Fuck that, 'bout time we took it back to the block
The task force coming, I got crack in my sock
White Rock on the dinner plate, get cash, shit is hot
Smash whips on the Interstate, we dash on the cops
It's them dudes, drug slingers, 1-6-Ooh
Crime figure, rhyme spitter, his gun spit too
Call 'em Sex Pistols, ravishing, nigga, I'm Rick Rude
And ain't many mothafuckas could fit up in Rick's shoes
Man, listen, ice glisten, they love the life we living

173,Paragraphs Of Love,2009,Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City (2009),,Ghostface Killah,"Her face glow like I was exposed to sunlight
She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is dumb right
The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils
I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on in the possible
She blushes as I kept splashing her compliments
Polite thank yous is all around she crush the mints
Developments, smooth keys from the piano
Changed the mood like we changed the channel
This is art Picasso I got him beat in the flesh
I'm staring at beauty Nefertiti heaven bone in the chest
Yes, everywhere she step went off like a flare gun
Stilettos on parquet floors
Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three
Bad little mama she built like Alicia Keys
No facade, her strut is hard, based on books by
Intelligent jail crooks writing to let the time fly
She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down
Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand I picked it up
I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes as I gave her her jewels back
Miss thing started rubbing her gut
Excuse me are you pregnant? Not to be rude
But if it means anything I can get you some food
Cheese crackers, in the back there's sauteed shrimp
Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp
See my due date is January my first and it's kinda scary
It's only June, in Christmas I'll be getting married
And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name?
Tone Starks, peace, I'm Gabby
Well, I gotta go my husband is waiting
But before I go can I give you one last statement
You the most beautifullest queen I ever seen
And I would love to have a thing like you on my team, you take care
Any other day I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations and I've got mine
But baby it's okay, it's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight, it's okay
You can tell he must be on a mission
Because my heart has made it's decision
As soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision
I fell in love, sweet love
And no infatuated 3D glasses to see
That you're the one I need
And the situation don't matter to me
'Cause this is love, it gotta be love, love at first sight
Any other day I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations and I've got mine
But baby it's okay, it's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight, it's okay
Any other day I would of just let you, pass me by

Son I spent it up top, blowin' a cop, cop, cop, cop, cop...
I had 2 Cent, plus my car fare home
It wasn't even Broadway until I got those stones
I was sixteen, shit, I barely knew what a gram was
Studied Scarface, so I knew what the plan was
To get that CREAM, and serve them fiends
Around the same time my nigga Buck converged with Beans
Two way team, posted up on the benches
Wit a magnet for a stash, that I kept hid under the black fences
Jakes shootin' through the middle, like Kerry Kittles
I was baggin' up small hittin' fiends, with very little
Though they switched nickels on niggas, and pointed out bitches
In the precinct got the snitchin', so they hit 'em off with something decent
Avoid the sweeping, them boys is beastin'
On point, but I'm kinda paranoid when they creepin'

Faggot ass niggas, when I ride get the fuck out the way
When I see jewels, all I know is take
I'm like a seed at a birthday party, all I want is cake

Movin' birds and weight, through suburban states
God damn it, I told y'all niggas
This is a Theodore stickup
Wake ya bitch up, watch the fifth pick up!
(Outro: Ghostface Killah)
Yeah, you heard what the bitch said
When we wasn't makin' too much muthafuckin' CREAM and shit
We was beatin' the shit out of niggas
Takin' their little Summer Youth shit
Buyin' beer and weed and shit
Shakin' niggas upside down on some cartoon shit
Change fall all out of their pockets and shit
Yellin' and tellin' the cops, fuck y'all niggas!

So he's my competition, that makes my decision
Easy, he gotta be the lord of the drugs
And that's Bamboo's man, that's where he stands
He played both sides of the fence on some real-real shit
Counterfeit thug, tryna play legit
Seen the bars slide open as I bought off a bail
I seen Bamboo waitin' as I exit the jail
She said, ""Please Ton', you gots to go
You can't stay around this part of town."" Already know
I'm blowin' bail, headin' up north, free in the country
She gave me a hug and a big stack of money

Press his peoples, left a message, nothin' peaceful
Shit police do, we could never be a equal
Execution, I get it in, retribution
Best solution, get up close when you're shootin'

Clap your heels two times, grab the magic wand
Nameless, these stonewashed cats leave him brainless

Take a blast fool boobie trap up crews it's natural

You onion head niggaz spread out and parley
Yo Rae these itch days get crashed with ash trays
I pull stings like, guitar strings down in Spain
I'm so hyped Jakes label God ""crack cocaine""
Why Equality Self God, yeah yeah you know it kid
Ricki fucked up, and G-Pac, blow his wig
He's rocking Wu Wear, the latest in fleece uniform
He's a newborn, look at money swearing like he's on
But anyway back to furry Kangols Jamaican Wallabees
My back is on the wall, bombing devils with trick-knowledgy
My heart is cold like Russia, got jerked at The Source awards
Next year two hundred niggaz coming with swords!"
178,Pokerface,2006,More Fish (2006),,Ghostface Killah,"This is why the World Series of Poker
Is decided over a no limit poker tournament
Players, pro's even, can't handle the pressure of the game
They consider no limit the only pure game left
(Chorus: Ghostface Killah)
We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean poker face
And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em
If you plan on, staying on top
You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot
You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck
Go all in, if you're feeling your cards, deep in your gut
(Shawn Wigs)
It was a late Saturday night, big chips, we had a lotta
Theodore performed at the Plush Brigatta
It was an hour in, big chip leader of the game
Caught pocket jacks and flopped two more of the same
Looking at quads, waiting for someone to bluff
So I checked till someone said ""I had enough""
I'm raising a thousand, son I pay to see the river
Caught an ace and his face, was a straight up giver
He had three now, must of caught two in the hole
A full boat, I'm about to sink ship, tell him to fold
He laughs, raises his fifty g's, please I need chip count
The pit boss, swear I flip over, you gon' flip out
I'm all in, here to win, I rep Staten Island
He called it, I showed four jacks, he started wilding
This son of bitch...
All night, he set me up, he check, check, he trapped me!
(Shawn Wigs)
It was a cash game, 100/200 dollar table
Me and Johnny Mack sitting, God willing and able
July 23rd and 4th, the lions is out
It's the month of the Leo, we gon' win with no doubt
Bunch of high rollers, laughing like he know we're low in the amateurs
I buy him for the macks, twenty G's, I'mma damage ya
Couple of chuckles, broken glasses, all tinted
I'mma put y'all all on tilt, give me a minute
So I check raise 'em, bluff 'em, ain't showing my cards
Two four off two, y'all ain't no superstars
I should have been at the table, World Series of Poker
I'm up 80 G's already, y'all a bunch of jokers
Now they all on tilt, raising, I call 'em all in
With pocket three's, for 80 G's, I'm ready to fall in
Flop two aces, caught my three on fourth street
A four hundred thousand dollar pot boy, life's sweet
He beat me... straight up
Pay him, pay Shawn Wigs his money"

Jacob Javits Center, Wu and Snoop there
D-Block pull up, olive green drops
The interior suede, 'cause that's boss crock
Air fresheners hang, the joint is sold out
To capacity, this young bitch keep asking me
""Can I suck your dick?"", ""Not now, shorty""
""Maybe after the show, just hold fast for me""
Ferocious bangles, birds on both arms
I'm jew-eled out like a box of Lucky Charms
On stage, two treadmills, a pull-up bar
Involved with the lights to give it that red feel
Feeling like Bruce Wayne, making up for never making the prom
Ma, you chilling? The belt glow in the dark
Where my aunt stays, batteries gone
That's when I pull a forty out for Ason
Wu-Block, I'm from a gun play habitat
Let me run into Nicki, I'm smashing that
What you know about the ratchet in your mother mouth
Killah banging the neck, with two rubbers out
Sheek and Ghost Deini, aiyo, Cap, pour that bitch a martini
Loosen her up, fuck it, pour Goose in her cup
Tell her chill, 'cause the Gods is here
Big money in this place, I'm balling when I'm leaving out of Chase
Red diamonds on a Freddy Kruger face
I don't get pat down, you know what's on the waist
I don't mean jazz when I say I count base
Fly Louis sneakers, Purple Tape coming out the speakers
Bumped into my high school teachers
They said I wouldn't be nothing, sitting on the bleachers
Now I'm sitting in the Phantom, trynna figure out the features
I'm a big fish now, I watch for the leeches
Wu-Block, I'm from a gun play habitat
Let me run into Nicki, I'm smashing that
What you know about the ratchet in your mother mouth
Killah banging the neck, with two rubbers out
Aiyo, I jump on stage with my dick in my hand
I'm a Park Hill nigga, straight from Shaolin
New York is the borough where I pump my rocks at
Bitch ass niggas where I dump my glocks at
I don't have to get dip, I'm known and flossy
I'm known everywhere like Remedy Rossy
Never say shit, I'm hard and cocky
Too hot for these tracks, wash this summer
Go hard for the hood from Arlington to Sumner
Yeah, nigga, what, I'm just one of us
For all my jail niggas, that feel wondrous
Fuck a fat bitch, with a thunder butt
Mad groupie love, too caliente
Mahogany, polly with Sin Jay

Episodes of drama, never ending sagas

You know Pudgie, who rock the old rugby, kinda chubby
Timbs always muddy, and his wiz is kinda ugly
Him and his man Dudley got killed in an accident
Late last night, when they was driving down Castleton
The whip was badly crashed, come on, you do the math
They probably smoked a bag, no seatbelts, they flew through the dash
The forecast was foggy, light drizzle, sky; cloudy
Lost control at the wheel, a front pole wrapped they Audi
It was televised, at the scene live, on Channel Seven
Newsflash story, this just in, around eleven
Yellow tape scenery, barricaded the block
Patrol cars and EMS, all invaded the spot
It was tragic, they swerved out of control to a wood traffic
Hopped the curb, tired flatted, glass shattered
Witnesses said they heard a big bang and loud screetches
And Tamika said police found drugs in Pudgie speaker
Plus son had an open case, for dope and base
Jake rushed his moms lab, he got bagged in Ocean Lake

Oh lord, two shots just went off on Broad
I ran out the building, seen my man on the floor
Children running frantic, with fear, all I saw
Was a four door Explorer, made a uey, then pulled off
Miss Gloria screaming, nobody seen him by the store
Beanie and Jamal, freaking on the lawn
Told me, if they get you, call Ruck with the rental
My mental went rushing, who the fuck was buzzing
Was it them niggaz that we stuck for them hundreds
Or did that bitch that we ran a train on, tell her husband
Moving fast, hoping that my man don't past
Heart pumping, eyes closing, yo, he might not last
EMS please hurry, nervous and worried
He's only 19, he's too young to be buried
Got a life ahead of him, Georgia Tech just accepted him
Point guard, but at this point, God
It was heaven and Allah opening gates for the star
It was hard, I couldn't believe, he stopped breathing
Stopped from achieving his dream, now he leaving
Thugs grieve, aiyo, he never slinged a thing
And died over drug beef, it's a ghetto soap opera
Living on these bugged streets, streets, streets

(Chorus: Trife Da God)

Now Barbara need to stop
Always at the kitchen table, lighting up the rocks
While her daughter sit and watch
'Cause her bathroom out of order, gotta knock on Uncle Kevin's door
But it's really scary, 'cause he live way on the seventh floor
And she was out on 2, the older brother still in school
But she had to stay home 'cause of the flu
Only six, but she more advanced than other little kids
Always wondering, what's going on, outside the crib
So she stepped into the hall, pressed the elevator button
Bumped into this kid, making a sale, it wasn't nothing
So cool, little and frail, but she knew what he was pumping
At the store, he would walk to mommy, and hand her something
And she always gave her money, few minutes after they got back home
She acting funny, attitude getting ugly
So she took the ride up, five floors, knocked on the door quick
Didn't even speak, she just headed for the toilet
After she was done, he told her go to the store, the milk spoiled
Plus we needed some bread and some tin foil
Little girl heart was loyal, so she ran downstairs
Knocked on the door, to get Barbara, but she could not hear
Now she at the corner with nobody to cross her, red light changing
And up come a speeding Explorer...

Staring like they want me to beat
This New York rap, I'm on the other side of the map
Nah nigga place rap with a bitch on my lap
Back to back on the FDR, big cigar
Explain You can tell there's a star in one of these cars
She's with Ghostface, yeah a bird on her wrist
Mask on face, ***********************
Everybody try but they can't do it like this
This Don Donna it starts I bet I won't miss
Hey yo
Pull them cars out
We gettin' money over here
Them bottles on the table
The weed in the air
Your woman starin' at us
Them haters ice grillin
Wu-Block, you know we in the buildi
Every little spot they know me
Loyal females who can't just give me the twat
They show me like I'm a big stock broker on Wall Street
I said, ""Nah, I'm that big drug dealer from 4E!""
A lot of guacamole, know a lot of parolees
Slung in front of a lot of these delis eatin canoles
I stayed on the front line like private events in airports
And live by the code I'mma bust mine
Word, tunes, start shorty while I got a tongue in my ear
Don't get a stain on my Porsche
Light-skined said she a virgo
Said she love my roll game and my bird yo
A baby ghost appeared from the blunt smoke
It lingered through her hair and settled in her clothes
Her bag fell, I saw a 38 snub nose
I stole that and still fucked her when the club closed
Bust honey on your face, hundred stacks on the car
If I spend a rack today, get that rack back tomorr
I'm a cash ruler, rulers zig-zag along
Get my money off the hook like I'm Abdul-Jabar
Get my money off the book like Steve Paul
Then fall, act hard, but they livin'
They think like a man, but act like they women
I never trust a broad with that in God trust only trust in God
Look at me, I'm what these little haters wanna be
I'm your man, 50 grand and I keep it a hundred G
I'm that block on fire, it's like a hundred and three
Rappers come a dime a dozen but they don't come in tha peace
I only need a few raps when you comin' with cheese
And the people you come up with, they be comin' to me

Both of them turned green, from countin' the ones
Memorized by the glory, word life
Cut off niggaz who killed Bill but couldn't do nuttin for me
Shout 'em out every once in the blue and kid too
I never rocked with, laws they keep away we cool
I devised my own stimulus, plan I'm niggarish
I'm tired of eatin those crumbs and black licorice
The frame of mind so {?} like cleansin the mic
Let the imam pray over my head and wash
Thoughts, sterilized, purified, Godly
Watch us gift men and fetch the green like barley
If that shit happen I'll feed his whole army
Talkin' 'bout the angels and peeps in Somali
Try to stay humble, and swallow my pride
In God I trust, now talk about the ones on your five
Crisp dollar billin, catch me in a little hut in Beneen
Village style, feedin the children
Big pots of jasmine tea with Mandela
Africans chantin me on like Coachella

The Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds
High currents, {?} places we formin wings
Kings offering, thrones was there
Man with the 7 crowns on his dome was near
Feet walked over rose petals, song from the ghetto
Face froze in gold like the pharaoh
A dawn in glory, robe of light, a powerful cherub
As he passed the path, white doves cost the eyes of thugs
Eternal heartbeat, in the dark fire in his blood
700 books were opened
It breaks to right, they threw the crooks in the ocean
Scared, brass hair like it grew from goatskin
The chosen has spoken, tablets were broken
The smoke hand grabs an omen
Gravity grabbin me gradually draggin me through hell's cavity
This is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals be
God felt bad for me but cast me into Caspain Sea
Satan draggin his key, Wu-Family's the faculty

""Am I a good man? Am I a fool?
""Am I?""

He used to sling in the stairwell
Fast to put the rap on thinking cap, ignite your hair gel
No such thing as a fair sale
He'll put the bullet out same day, delivery airmail
And on this level a thug'll sell you garbage
No refund, the only exchange from the cartridge
Where the youths is kept comin' back with they life earnings
Ready to make a deal, soul and pipe burning
The outcome tragic, household dramatic
Living rooms to {?}, basements to attics
Support from the B, hit the courts from a fiend
Who betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team
So they sent him gifts, body parts per diem
In a box that held prints but too dark to see 'em"

Two brothers and two sisters, I'm the youngest out of five

A resurrection morning
The light goes
The sacrifice
The glory of the Ghost controls the soul
(Ghostface Killah:)
Time to surrender your physical being
So I can hear, touch, and smell, and start seeing
Life as a precious gift given from God
So I can enjoy my siesta, healing these scars
Take this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly
Come on Lester Kane, you better show me
You're a man of your work, a criminal conduct
You gotta sacrifice your life or else your time's up
He took the knife, the look on his face got calmer
I watched him take his life like a suicide bomber
(Raekwon:)
It's time to go, I made a promise and I'm a man of my word
I'm a G and my bond will never swerve
I dreamed about this time and this place and I swear I've seen it
Now I'm face-to-face with a death angel
Thinking about the lies that I took with no strife
Standing here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life
But it's for a good reason
My spirit needs to be replenished so I walk on my soul and be delinquent
(Ghostface:)
Lifeless, his body left slumped in a chair
It was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there
I wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth
Smell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers
Be a simple man, but along a ruthless killer
Crime born syndicate, another sinner
Murderer, take lives like mine's was once taken
Or leave my seed in this cold world, my heart's aching
(Raekwon:)
Man up soldier, no need to back it up now
I'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes
Jewels all thick and clusty
Me and the father ain't rusty
What's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore
Did you lie to your brother Kane or died I die in vain?
You don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins
You a general, love the life you running in the city
Pretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want
Think about it, me and you as one force
There's no limit the way they can take it, time is ticking, jump up in my corpse
And be true living king that you are, you need to live again
So you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars
Drink the finest wines and dawn on exotic moods
Tell the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels
Son you hesitating - I didn't hesitate for you
When it was my time to go, I'm cocked it the showed proof

Stigmata scenery ill visions of being villains
The taste of blood is left on my tongue
Walk through the valley of death
I see the reaper waiting with two snakes kissing
I can't believe they took my wife and my kids, it's straight Lester
Word to God, once I get 'em, I got 'em, the moments priceless
Decapitating heads like a journalist snatched with Isis
I want revenge now!
Spotted one of Delucas men, at a restaurant
Eating spaghetti, drinking on Dom Pérignon
With two other goons laughing, probably joking 'bout the murder
I calmly approach them with the burner
When they realized the real live G was about to serve 'em
60 pieces blew through his jaw, closing his curtains
Now it's total chaos, the people running for they lives
The other cocksuckers tried reaching for their hammers
But they was slow on their draw so I blammed 'em
Taking they tops off like a convertible dry burgundy phantom
They say the taste of revenge is sweet, well let me see
Prepare the table for a feast, take a seat, now let's eat

In the beginning, it's time for a new chapter
Twelve more reasons to die, after the laughter
It's relevant, the legacy lives on lavash
Ghostface Killah, return of the savage [2x]
(Ghostface Killah)
Beast mode, I'm resurrected, I hear the record spinning
Early 70s, New York Kingpins
And I see street life, the only life I know
I see Liberty, I see the motherfucking Verrazano
I see gangstas getting money, bitches acting funny
Stacks upon stacks, and not one nigga bummy
Something ain't right, these ain't the greedy streets of Italy
Where Logan and my seed? C'mon son, you kidding me?
Who's calling me? Who's looking for the killer with no face?
Who summoned me into this place? I need answers!
Behave chancellors, I'm a vigilante killer
No time for games and there ain't no nigga realer
Let's talk business, you don't wanna leak your own blood
State your name, before you get stretched like a rug!
(Outro: RZA)
As the Ghostface Killah and the infamous gangster Lester Kane came face to face for the first time, they reflect on the violent events that forced their paths to cross. A black crime family led by Lester Kane has made a violent push for supremacy against the surviving member of the Deluca clan, now residing in New York City. In attempt to thwart his adversary advances, Luther Luca, the head of the Deluca clan, guns down members of the Kane syndicate, as well as Lester's wife and son. The war escalates. In one fatal night, Lester and his men rob one of the Deluca clan social clubs, discovering 12 vinyl records hidden within a safe"

Yeah... yo... (it's the realest niggas on this shit, go in)
(Ghostface Killah)
Left the buildin on start up, heavy
Niggaz couldn't take the chain, it's too heavy
Word to mother, I was swingin' that Shaolin Style machete
Now when I come through it's ""What up Ghost?"", my folks throwin' confetti
My gear is the world premiere, ox yeah, now I'm dickin down Heather Locklear
Rubber glock in the glove box, Benz drop yeah
Hit the mall in Long Island, they got hens out there
I'm not a sex symbol, gangsta or activist
I just bubble like acid in a glass of Cris'
My pen's is Illmatic, plush robes drag across the floor
Gun hand is sore from choppin the raw
And when the jet land smoked up just look right under ya
The aircraft carry back half of Colombia
Yeah, separate the rubble
Stay beatin' niggaz brains out with the God broke belt buckle
Jewels, pay respect to my larynx
My bird blew niggaz away like a clarinet
My hoes, they so happy I ain't married yet
And I still walk down the aisle with a plastic Tec
Haha...

Yo son I smack bitches, make 'em say ""Yes, Wiggatry""
Smoke out ya room like I'm cookin up hickory
Dickory dock, my glock tucked by the scrotum
It's Theodore, our chips' all in, you can't hold 'em
'Cause the Pips be stinky like Pepi LePew
And my style's so sick, son, they call it the flu
Influenza, top contender
Had ya girl head-noddin leavin' marks on my Swollen Member
I remember them days when the Stat was my home
Now we hop state to state, flyin in and out of zones
Had to put down the heat, picked up the microphone
Started payin' off the jewelers and flossin in stones
Chunky and I ain't talkin' chicken noodle soup
Got a V for Vendetta this year and need to recoup
That two point five million'll slice a Sicillian
Next year we want the whole fuckin' pie we makin' a killin'

Then I backslap you, yeah, ya niggas get flipped
Son, I've never been a punk faggot ass idiot
Get snatched in all letters, Puerto Rican bitch fetish
Call me the streets, or the mixtape terrorist
I get respected, like a Pride Fighter champion
Out in Japan, I was ready to smash one
It's real, son, I hold down my squadron
Ghostface and Life scared Madison Square Garden
Is the next destination hip hop preservation?
Theodore Unit on an ill ass invasion
Kid Crooklyn style, Premo production
The greatest men walking, fuck all them their assumptions
Yo, call me the king, the presence of greatness
Often imitated, but you can't duplicate this

Muthafuckin' New York's Backbone, take it home

Aiyo, I roll like a bat out of hell, something swell
With the money green Balley's and the chunky gazelle's
I'm an explorer like Dora, nigga, check out my aura
On the block, I assist quarters, but I'm really a scorer
Place your order, place your bets, I'll erase your set
Puncture your lung and inflate your chest
I keep killas on mountain tops, plotting on housing cops
While I'm in the spot, bagging up rocks, I'm counting knots
I got the eye of an eagle, ride for my people
These bars of life dope, and I supply you that diesel
I'm a needle in the haystack, laid back in Maybach
Slay phat, 'cause he spray gats, try to escape that
Gray slacks for, all my Compton killas
Casket fillers, armed gorillas, who bomb for skrilla
Staten Island's most wanted, the backbone of the city
The rapper killings, niggas get slapped silly, you feel me?"

Ayo, revenge is sweet, that's why I take my time with it
Like good pussy I just stay when I'm up in it
Evil plan, my mind functions well off spite
I don't do that tit for tat, I blow your shit up like dynamite
Take my life, I'll take every one you love
Have your kids thrown out of a plane, 'look out 'cause
My plots are like movie scripts, they well planned
Snatch you off the land and drop you off in the sahara sand
So don't scam me, don't try to double cross me
My Tennessee goons'll nail that ass to the cross, B
Revenge mode, I live life by the sword
And if you live by it, die by it, I'll still kill your horse
Set me up, coming back, like a thief in the night
I'll have a suicide bomber pop up on your flight
You couldn't take my life, my mask done resurrected
And I'm Ghostface Killah, way more than you expected
Those who fear his return
Must face the catastrophe
(Verse 2: Masta Killa)
Yes, but what they didn't expect, a hundred ghouls
From the projects armed and masked with flamethrowers
And gas'll blast anything, hung him by his tongue ring
Till he gave the info on how we find his kinfolk
Made him sign the ransom, then gave the note to his grandson
Bust the shot and made him run fast
Back to his family, news of his discovery
Would set off a chain of events that would
Then lead to members of DeLucas to bleed with no exception
They sip the raw mussles so kill everything
No exception to the media
There would not be a retire or cease fire till every Luca has expired
In entirety, wishes of the god
Tone Starks to eternity, respectfully

Cutthroats, murdersprees, and killings were synonymous with his gangsta life before his passing. So it'da only seem fitting that it would become the embodiment of his new life
(Killa Sin)
I keep having flashbacks of blasting at you bastards, cutting outside the benches
Got convicted of the gun charge and laughed at my sentence
Four years, five flat post-release supervision
For niggas spitting in the wind, but that's what I get for missing
So soon as I hit the bridge again, niggas is finished
Ninja mode on a mission out to end your existence
Think I'm sitting up in prison
With a tin of L, in a cell, sick ass hell, listen
Everyday is like christmas, I miss my seed and my missus
But I see 'em on visits, I ain't stressing over pussy
Beat my dick to her pictures
When they free me I'mma see you, leave you food for the fishes
Hope the Luca crew is in for the fixing
Now get the henchman, line 'em up
Tommy gun 'em down, the muzzle extension
Tear they flesh off if one of 'em flinching
Those who fear his return, must face the catastrophe
The Catastrophe

191,Rise Of The Black Suits,2013,Twelve Reasons To Die (2013),,Ghostface Killah,"Young aggressor, born into the life of crime
I would walk down the streets strapped with two nines
Bitch smacking, jacking niggas, G dub stacking figures
Police drive by, I was click clacking triggers
Jay De Lucas put me with the fam to grow
I was a boss amongst white boys rocking the 'fro
I had hoes, bankrolls and minks by the dozen
My rise to power was quick, they just wasn't
Tryna make me a made man, they fucked up the game plan
I blacked out on them and started my own clan
Black Gambino, black suits, black Syndicate
My crime fam was tight, every move was intricate
The coke was brought in from bad Colombian mules
Gorgeous women that I draped down in jewels
Streets fight started, mafia wars in Italy
Crime fam against fam and no one could do diddly
Do the dirty work, bring in the coke by the boatloads
Go against the grain, nigga, I feed nose holes
Follow no family rules, rules are for fools
Chase the paper 'cause it's the cash that rules
Fuck the law of fam, it's the law of land
You don't like how I move then try to force my hand
I'm moving keys, them DeLucas couldn't touch my pianos
Putting pressure on them Gambinis and Verrazanos
They love my money, they hate to see a nigga getting it
Selling drugs is taboo, but I ain't fucking sweating it
The dirt gotta get done so I took my position
One day I'm just Black Tone with a lot of ambition
Next I got status, dinners with all courses
Flights in and out of the country, they getting nauseous
Money, power, respect; rise of the black suits
Talk shit behind my back, but to my face salute
Hugs and handshakes, they can't stop my reign
Got the coconut, pilots bringing shit on their plane
It's a shame, they ain't have the balls to make moves
They pussies, couldn't walk a mile in my shoes"

The DeLucas pressed Tony's remains
Into 12 vinyl records
One for each member of the family
But little did they know
He would return...
(Verse 1: Ghostface Killah)
Medusa stare, my guns bust in silence
I'm a black vigilante killer, pro violence
It's the rebirth, born again, rise through the vinyl spin
They took out Starks but the light shines within
It's the almighty rise of the murderous Ghostface
Bodies dropped in Owls, left a cold case
Colombian neckties from a black Gambino
Bodies get dumped in the black El Camino
It's Reno, gangster wars, money, power, respect
Revenge is felt like the heat from a Tec
Tommy guns are irrelevant, I'm bulletproof now
I could fly through the air and duck your chick-a-pow
Black superhero, crime boss arch nemesis
Good vs. Evil since the first book of Genesis
Battle to the end that's the way of the thriller
And Starks is reborn as the Ghostface Killah... no one could get iller
Murders, bodies chopped into Ziplocs
Kill or be killed on these cobblestone street blocks
Crime boss, I call warn the DeLucas
Watch my eyes turn red, I got a squad full of shooters
Murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
When the gas start to hum I put the spark to your grill
(Verse 2: Ghostface Killah)
Late night, stuck in the limo
Hogtie the capo all up, beheaded the driver
Left the bitch in the back with no tongue as the survivor
Raw dog, spit in her mouth
Disappear in a swarm of killer bees
Cripple 'em from they knees, take they legs out (Nigga you know the steez!)
I'm a nighthawk, eagle eye, power of mind control
Faster than the speed of light, you catch a big hole
Ruthless, six bodies hung in the meat room
The butcher shop, I call it the body shop
Start from the bottom, killing all the way to the top
Carve my name in your skin, pull a stocking mask over your face
For recognition, no time for remission
Attack till there's no one left in the position
The return of the worst case scenario
Uh, Ghostface attacks on land and now aerial"

Back on the grind, Molotov bottles and pipe bombs
There's war on the streets like Vietnam
Bodies is flung, enemies hung, capos is killed
Kidnap your family and wives with no guilt
No lines drawn, It's all out war for domination
Robbing safes in safe houses, no leaving traces
Destruction, Black mafiosos and militants
It's all for the king of New York and they killing it
(Adrian Younge:)
Crime wave, rioting, streets flooded with blood
Bullet holes through tuxedos, wet suit skirts up
Big Kahuna with the cajones, come through with your homies
Shoot the Ruger where your dome is, while you in your chones
Then regroup up with my homies, less they can't run a crew
Split the loot up with the chromies, in a room with a view
Watch the corners, they on us, laying low with the clues
Guzzle cash, that's the walls of how to wait, got a few
I don't get out much, I'm in the cut with my crew
A clan of vicious guerrillas, banana clips aimed at you
Itchy fingers, malicious killers, valicious my troop
Come to pillage your village, level your root to the stoop
Trigonometry, honestly, nigga, I'm a G
Follow these streets scholarly, all would I do for this loot
Figure courage be piling the change upon us
To slaughter it, yeah, it's heartless, I've gotta get deadbeat loose
The Luger's rain, man, ain't nothing but purp bitch
That's the cane clan, they ain't nothing to fuck with
My tools say blam, change man to chump bits
Fools gonna lay in the Hudson or some ditch
Rolling slow with a gangster lean
Pimped out in the Coupe de ville '72
Lock and load on patrol, lotta hoes on the stroll
Give me street 411 like whoop-de-whoop
Where's the cane man? How many nights I live by this dupe?
Names change like slang, still be aiming to shoot
Call it pop-pop poacher and note the .45 will rise up
(Ghostface Killah:)
Message worth it's weight in gold, he a beast
When God made his son, he broke the mold
Crushing De Lucas, they tryna dismember cane, silly game
Watch his downfall, put an end to it
Street laws, gangsters pulling murders and drive-bys
New York city, flood the streets with cyanide, poison
The boys in blue don't want none of it
Watching cane ride the power, and I'm loving it"

My pockets is mean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy

Errr! Peel off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned downhill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Get cassed, I'm not comin' home with no fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge

Stood by my side when my world was caved in
She cooked for me, fix me up, plus made me happy
Every time she told me she loved me, I said ""no backsies""
I was fucked up in the game, migranes
No honey in pockets, all I had was a chain
Fourty-five stainless, it got so deep
I threw the heat to my dome
She said ""If you shoot, you ain't the real Pretty Tone""
Baby, come home, you not alone, be strong whether right or wrong
Our bond is even more stronger when the light is gone
Say, ""Yo, Starks relax, you know I got the hot water runnin'
Baby, oiled down, pots in the oven""
And my lovin'? It's gone when they style old fashion
And, a, don't worry bout that jam, you gonna smash 'em

Got me, open, even more on her with her bangin' body
My favorite sweetheart, cum, but don't ever stop
Your love, give me every drop, you kiss get's me very hot
Never felt feelings before, and felt so sure
Every time you put it on me, I fiend for more
Think that's the reason why, can't leave, can't lie
Look you dead in the eye
Word to fuck up, like Ralph, baby, your the greatest
I'mma sell my guns, and with the cash I'mma bring you to Vegas
(Interlude: Freddie Scott samples)
Uh... you got it
I was down in the sea of love
Going down to a clear cloud
You came and saved me dear (saved me) {Ghostface!}
It's too bad you didn't do it, I ain't never been used to it
The way we stopped them, dear (stopped them dear)
(Ghostface Killah)
To all the ladies who love they man
Though they fuck up, and you still let them back in
Make some noise if you cook and you clean for 'em
Out of love, doing juks for them
To all my niggas who love a girl with good brains on 'em
Baggin' to get your name tattoed on 'em
Kiss 'em in the morning, hold 'em, definitely show 'em
We got our crab down, packed when it's time to mold 'em
(Outro: Freddie Scott samples)
Oh... oh... oh... oh oh...
Uh... (you out there) you got it [louder]
I was down... thank you"

I need y'all niggaz to buckle up one time
Fasten your seatbelts, I'm a take y'all on some real shit
This Theodore shit, y'all niggaz know what time it is and shit
Y'nah mean? It's real motherfuckin' shit, you know
Yo, making moves back and forth uptown
60 dollars plus toll is the cab fee
Wintertime bubble goose, goose, clouds of smoke
Music blastin' and the Arab V blunted
Whip smelling like fish from 125th
Throwin' ketchup on my fries, hitting baseball spliffs
Back seat with my leg all stiff
Push the fuckin' seat up, tartar sauce on my S Dot kicks
Rocks is lit while I'm poppin' the clips
I'm ready for war, got to call the Cuban guys
Got the Montana pulled in front of the store
Made my usual gun check, safety off, come on Frank
The moment is here, take your fuckin' hood off and tell the driver to stay put
Fuck them niggaz on the block they shook, most of them won't look
They frontin', they no crooks and fuck up they own juks
Look out for Jackson 5-0 'cause they on foot
Straight ahead is the doorway, see that lady that lady with the shopping cart
She keep a shottie cocked in the hallway
Damn she look pretty old Ghost, she work for Kevin, she 'bout seventy seven
She paid her dues when she smoked his brother in law at his bosses' wedding
Flew to Venezuela quickly when the big fed stepped in
3 o'clock, watch the kids, third floor, last door
You look paranoid that's why I can't juks with you
Why? Why you behind me leery?
Shakey Dog stutterin', when you got the bigger cooker on you
You is a crazy motherfucker, small Hoodie dude
Hilarious move, you on some Curly, Moe, Larry shit
Straight parry shit, Krispy Kreme, cocaine, dead bodies, jail time you gon' carry it
Matter of fact, all the cash, I'm a carry it
Stash it in jelly and break it down at the Marriott
This is the spot, yo son your burner cocked?
These fuckin' maricons on the couch watchin' Sanford and Son
Passin' they rum, fried plantains and rice
Big round onions on a T-bone steak, my stomach growling yo I want some
Hold on, somebody's comin', get behind me, knocked at the door
Act like you stickin' me up, put the joint to my face
Push me in quickly when the bitch open up
Remember you don't me, blast him if he reach for his gun
Yo who goes there? Tony, Tony one second homie
No matter rain, sleet or snow you know you suppose to phone me
Off came the latch, Frank pushed me into the door
The door flew open, dude had his mouth open
Frozen, stood still with his heat bulgin'
Told him Freeze! lay the fuck down and enjoy the moment
Frank snatched his gat, slapped him, axed him
Where's the cash, coke and the crack? Get the smoke and you fast
His wife stood up speakin' in Spanish, big tittie bitch holdin' the cannon
Ran in the kitchen, threw a shot, then kicking the four fifth
Broke a bone in her wrist and she dropped the heat
Give up the coke! But the bitch wouldn't listen
I'm on the floor like holy shit! Watchin my man Frank get busy
He zoned out, finished off my man's wiz
He let the pitbull out, big head Bruno with the little shark's teeth chargin'
Foamin' out the mouth, I'm scared
Frank screamin', blowin' shots in the air
Missin' his target, off the Frigidare, it grazed my ear
Killed that bullshit pit, ran to the bathroom butt first
Frank put two holes in the doorman's Sassoon
The coke's in the vacuum, got to the bathroom, faced his bad moves
The big one had the centipede stab wound
Frank shot the skinny dude, laid him out
The bigger dude popped Frankie boy, played him out

I had my eyes squinched up tryin' to get through the fog
Pullin' up mad slow blunted, passin' police cars
I saw one two three bodies
Blood mixed with the rain ran through the gutter
That's the work of a tommy
But then I heard it was the work of a mami
Spanish chick bad, about five six, long hair, red Jag
Kinda bowlegged, Chanel sweatpants, she thick
She love her some pussy, don't really give a fuck about dick
That's when I got the call, yo Tone come to the shop
Some fire jumped, chill I'm about to pull in the lot
Lowered the tunes, pulled the Benz keys out the ignition
Brushed the ashes off my blazer then finished my Guinness
So then I walked in, seen the God shufflin' cards
Spades game, it's goin' down, he lost a couple of yards
Peace Lord, how your physical?
(Raekwon)
He upstate miserable
Stressed, doin' a thousand sets
But yo check the visuals
I'm at this hotel in Queens
Me and Charene getting' slow necked
That's live, I couldn't finish the bean
Gotta a phone call, seen the whole bitch face fall
Dope fiend look like the bitch swallowed an eight ball
They talkin' about killin' ya man's and them
That kid from Staten, his jewels is tough, his robes is satin
Yo that's my heart Tone; yeah yeah he killed the captain
What nationality nigga? The kid was Latin
It happened uptown, broad day, right in Manhattan
I was shoppin' with my home girl, Leona with acne?
But you know what, Flaco meets Lolita
Flew in, she from Medayeen, he deaded her uncle over them seventeen bricks
Niggas ain't slick, niggas is dicks
Y'all got beef for life now cause that bitch is a trick
(Ghostface Killah)
Ay yo fuck that, close the gate
(Raekwon)
And lower the shade
Then a shot popped off
(Ghostface Killah)
Hit lil' bro in his fade
And then I see him dropped his clippers
(Raekwon)
He dipped with the quickness
It was Lolita black down yo
(Ghostface Killah)
With four other bitches
He had a nasty hammer, fat ass
(Raekwon)
Her tits was bananas
Yo the clip was ninety shot
(Ghostface Killah)
She lit up the cameras
So then I bugged out, ran up the steps
(Raekwon)
Yo I got hit in the leg
(Ghostface Killah)
He shot back, hit one bitch in her breast
Under the pinball game aimin'
(Raekwon)
It's foggy and rainin'
(Ghostface Killah)
My jewels is clangin'

Yo Tone tuck your chain in
She shootin' like she wanted a payment
Throwin' bullets like Joe Nameth, yellin'

Yo it's all entertainment
Where y'all girls at? Where y'all pussies at?
Thought y'all bang on Gaten Island?
I killed three things on Staten Island

Take that!

That's all you got baby?
Hold that! Motherfuckaaaaa!
Yeah! You on Staten Island now nigga!

Put your weapons down or we will shoot

""Tony Starks!"" ""Ironman!""
You done slept on Tony
""Yo, before that, I was getting it on""
You done slept on Tony
""Tony Starks!"" ""Ironman""
You done slept on Tony
""I was getting it, getting it, getting it on""
Yo, when they kidnapped your boy, and forced me to do evil
I created an iron suit, to protect my people
Escaped, bound to be Ironman the great
The billionaire Tony Starks'll renew your fate
Built Stark Towers, throw the biggest events
Got liquid, armor, I can paint all dents
Keep a few bad chicks, I ain't your average hero
Movie premieres, catch me with the zam enginero
Six six eleven gold, playboy industrialist
Face of a ghost, mind of a technologist
Specialist, modern day speech slang therapist
Scecialize in weapons, I can blow off terrorists
So, so don't sleep big homey
Real recognize and I can see you phoneys
My weak heart can't take it, got a life long sentance
Boy genius grown up, and I fight with a vengeance
Yo, I got steel toe wallies when I glide on stage
And my heart gently weeps in an iron ribcage
Punctured by metals, replaced by elements
My enemies hunt it like a tusk on the elephant
Extraordinary, hiding my duel identities
Anthony Stark, call me Ton', the top pedigree
Multi-billionaire, military contractor
Crushing my opponents, with the strength of a compactor
Ex-factor, I turn liquids to metals
Water to wine, I turn dirt into rose petals
Greatest man walking, blow a bottle of Goose
Goldy plat iron armor, to Versace suits
I'm so elegant, scientifically intelligent
My lawyers won the case, I won't take the settlement
Money's irrelevant, I need heat to energize
We taking over the planet, Stark Enterprise
Once again, Tony Stark, infinite finesse
Stopped the planet, and destroyed an indestructable track"

Life's quick, don't flip, move slow, ya rushing it
Oh... oh... oh...

Looking lavish, I lace all my bunnies with karets
Spending millions and make music, I pay for the clearance
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised and my bankroll's bursting
Connects with Aston Martin, I'll be that first in
That prototype truck, with the space navigation
Cost of living go up, I'm just go on vacation
Fresh oxygen tanks, got world renowned surgeons
Plush robes made from suede and knitted by virgins
First breath of the day can be my last
So I flash, give my niggaz some cash, I just pull out the stash
Buy a million dollar piece like I buy a pack of seeds
You buy OZ's of haze, I buy a forest full of trees
(Ghostface Killah)
Order that bottle of Louis the fifth and some Dom P
I got a bunch of chicks that love to get raunchy
See, Tone double-dipped and I nut like Flanders
Ask Tamia and Chevon, I got 'em both going bananas
Buying frosted bracelets, Louis Voutton duffles
French vanilla ice cream and hot apple pie truffles
Fly me, to Costa Rica, I got a crib on the beach
With underwater lights and surround sound speakers
Pet cheetahs, tiger sharks and dolphin feeders
Fly French maids, serving Grey Goose by the liters
Got Felecia and Taquesha, Crystal and Katie
Little Precious, picking my poppy seeds out in Haiti

You might be right though, you know

Feel the pretty warm dick, rub it on your clit
Oh, right before I bust I spray it on your tits
Switch you over, throw you to the side with one leg up
See the head slide in your hole, he stay up

From behind I'm a master mind, hundred fast ones
And slow it up because I know how to fuck
Keep your pussy right there don't move, ooh
Holla at your boy, baby, do what it do
I love fucking you, your pussy's the bomb
Think about fucking this shit all day when I'm gone
Get up, suck that dick, spit on it, slob on that shit
More bubbles at the knob of that shit
It's my word you's a whore, taste good, right?
Turn around, get on all four
You pulling my hair, shut the fuck up
Why you fucking me like that? Shut the fuck up
This ain't no R 'n' B dick, this hood
My slow jam dick is on Thursday's, if my sugar high

I said don't touch me, man,
Chill, let me get a cigarette, you don't smoke, nigga
Oh yeah, I forgot, I love when you fuck me like that
I'ma go put up some work at the studio, though
But when I get back have a little nurse outfit on
With the hat to the side so I can bend you over
In that little desk we got in the room
In your thigh highs, word up and I'ma stop at the adult store
And get one of them little screaming O's

We guzzle Dom's, smoke the scratchy throats
Live on the edge, bracelets, shades and classy coats

So hard, stupid big stones from Miss Stella ear
She just turn 35, we in the spot on Martin Luther King Drive
Whole team getting high, on phones
We learned different codes of pig Latin
So the jakes don't follow our trail with sick patterns
And the crib is jig, Jennifer convertible love seat
That's worth forty G's from Madrid
In Spain, sipping cherry Cosmo's and things
Stella, finish the glass, showing niggas her rings
I said bitch, I ain't impressed with that
Why the fuck is every briefcase short by at least ten stacks
We had a mil' in each bag, there's eighty grand missing
You pop up with a new Jag', with a bad system
I done sent your ass to Hawaii and Waikiki
When your man needed bail, you'll come see me
Rob me? That's how we do? You pretty slick muthafucka
You must think I'm a sucker
Matter fact, you gon' suck this dick, how bout that for a change
Let me see what's really on your brain
She said 'Starkey, you violating me, stop it'
I saved up for this shit, you playing me like a hostage
Out of all people, I wheeled you around, when you got shot
Be the closest one too you, and may I rot
In hell, yo Starks, chill, I don't think she that stupid
Since '90, '95, she came through, kid
Two million in six weeks, cover six space
Just to think of those towns alone, we brought a big steak
But it still don't change the job
Aiyo, Tone, who this silly bitch trynna rob
Niggas been getting money, since pushing a Saab
In the spot writing rhymes, never heard of a blog
Is it that coincidental? That the same rental
Be out in Virginia and DC, before she come see me
I'm ready, put this hammer in her face in 3D
I know that's your home girl, but fuck it, on GP
And I don't like her brother, either, he probably put her up to it
Give me the word and I go empty his fluid
Shady? I been bagging up since 1980
Me and Ghost been tight, since Fred met Grady, lady
So what you telling me? My account is off?
Oh you must really muthafucking think we that damn soft
Hold on, yo, Sheek, what you gon' do? Cut her whole hand off?
Put a pillow over her face, and let the four bang off?
Or we can get the gat taping so the hoe can't talk
Before we get the whole story cut this whole thing short
I don't think that's wise at all, whatever honey do with her money, dog
That's not my problem, why is it yours?
Wu-Block, you riding for mine, I'm riding for yours
That's the motto if you talking bout homicide, my lordyep
It's survival, homey, you ain't never lied, my lord
But the Pretty Toney baby ain't never lied before
That's a hundred lucci, word to Bully, I smoke too many loosies
I know her history, if something fishy, must be the coochie
It ain't no mystery, your finger itchy, if she a groupie
Once you go up, once you go down, let's keep it Gucci
You take her head, I take all the jewellery from all these moolies
Get all your goonies, and we can meet up for Call of Duty
Ain't nothing funny like Paul Mooney, this fatal beauty
Got some explaining to do, hold up, I thought you knew me
Better than that, we know the cheddar was tapped
You getting bread in the trap, why get in bed with them rats
My son is missing some racks, and Louch is fitting to snap
She need to come up with answers, instead of fixing her Mac
Makeup, just give the facts, straight up, and just the facts
If you did it, we gon' bury you with it, and that's that"

Send a bitch home with him, let her tell us where to get him
Got the hollows in that ruger, I'm looking at your chain
'Cause the diamonds look clearer then that water in aruba
You ain't even gotta jack 'em, you barely need a gun
You can walk up and smack 'em, they so soft
Then you got the rats, that fat should be up north
Donnie on his bullshit, mask and a full clip
Hopping out that whip, I'mma (stick 'em!) hahaha (stick 'em!)
Lay 'em down on the floor, my man at the door
My other homey downstairs, hand on the four
I ain't even gotta kill 'em, I'm just coming for that raw, I'mma
Brrr, stick 'em! hahaha, stick 'em!
Yo, my daughter said stick 'em (stick 'em) momma said stick 'em (stick 'em)

My grandmother go to church to pray on my victims
She said brr, stick 'em, hahaha, stick 'em
Y'all know me, I'm a slim nigga, from a large family
The burner get passed around the crew like a grammy
My little man with autism, he looked at me
And looked at duke and said (stick 'em!) why y'all lookin' at me? (stick 'em!)
I help you remove the body but where we gon' ship 'em
Fuck it, I just drawed on him, he duck, cupped his jewels
And said 'shoot me, I'm not giving it up'
Aww shit, it's gon' be a long day
Hope maintenance got enough mops for this hallway
The chrome still smelling like ajax
Rip the jew-els off his neck, like 'chill, pa, relax'
Understanding came through, c-allah ripped him
The doc had to staple his face, a straight victim
This how we do it on staten, we hardly get caught
With our hoodies off, let alone a ratchet
Brrr, stick 'em! hahaha, stick 'em!
Yo, my daughter said stick 'em (stick 'em) momma said stick 'em (stick 'em)
My son said 'daddy, if he move, I'mma lick him' {wu-block!}
My grandmother go to church to pray on my victims
She said brr, stick 'em, hahaha, stick 'em
Get my hands on the hawk I'mma (stick 'em!) aids needle I'mma (stick 'em!)
Got the red nose off the leash and I can't wait to sick 'em
Usually make 'em take it off, slow when I'm strip 'em
Probably better to kill 'em, 'cause he can't take the whipping
Consider it charity, vvs clarity
The ara, is the arm robber academy
Just put it in a bag, I don't care, whatever, holmes
The big shit, all the way down to the heroine bones
Credit cards, debit cards, everybody, get it, god
Wedding bands, birthstones, camouflage, earth tones
Yeah, my cloth is cut different
It don't cost nothing to just listen, but if not, I'mma
Brrr, stick 'em! hahaha, stick 'em!

Yo Lady Brown, I'll set it up, who give a fuck?
We vested up from head to gut, them niggas won't get the best of us

Armed to the titles, should've seen me
And let us out of these sheets, believe 'em, leave 'em
Coughin' and bleedin', even barfin' and wheezin'
Son they called for a year at Oz and we gon' make it even
+Burning Season+, Lord, keep all prawn on the head, Lord
The more beef they bring Killa, the mark steak to grease off
One shot nearly took a cheek off, should've seen him leapin'
And dancin', had all intention to smack him and jack him like Jackie lease, son

Watch how the '89 analog switched to digital
It's a miracle, we gettin' rich, offa visuals
Millionaires open doors, split them residuals
And still don't know how to act, spend 5 beams on jeans
Steady blowin' cream by the stack
I get my change, now go cop, get'cha a drink
And have a hoe butt-naked washed up by the sink
Blowin' stink, and I don't see grass on the field

We bleed different, we chase money, y'all can chase dreams
Came a long way, don't fuck that bread up in between
Tell 'em God sent you, load up that wop and let it ring ock
It's more than raindrops, when your nigga name get scratched off
Like his name dropped, that's when that thang pop
Y'all niggaz thought once too much, that's why your brain stopped

Our appearance is we still in the grind, and direct
But on my side of town shit's gorilla, phone booths is broke
Behind the building niggaz on post
What up Doc? What up Lord? I'm chilling
These motherfuckers got my name and my face
Placed up in every building
You see what that do to the children, that ain't right
I've been raised in these projects, damn near, all my life
And these faggots wanna do this to me, I'ma lay low
And blow that cop, son, you watch, no lie, word to my momma, dunn
They don't want the drama, thunn, 'member me in '86?
Knocked out four cops, got knocked on the outer bridge
Bagged me with two clips, a fifth of Bacardi Dark
I spared them, cause all of them left with they body parts
I'm not crazy; I'm lulu, I will Larry Davis these spades
You spill a little blood on the NARC's Fubu
The Culture Pound'll go through dude, and ricochet off his shoulder
Miss the teeth and hit his Lo Mein noodles
Fuck it...
All my life, it's been one big struggle
Born and raised... in the slums of trouble, I'm all...
I'ma tell ya motherfuckers something, my struggle is real
Threw ketchup on my rice, cause there was no meat with the meal
My dog was better off alone, he ate when I ate, if not days later
Two weeks old cold shit, straight out the refrigerator
Ran away a few times, then boom, went to Dee and fried them
Prior to that, burning rulers, we was getting high in the Hill
So many cracks we done crushed up in dollar bills
It's a shame, didn't smoke once plain; don't pass me that
I had escaped that, then dust took over
Hit bags of red devil, bundels leaking, had put the hood in a coma
Hustling backwards and off balance, turkey and cheese hero's
And nutriments, kept a nigga belly full
Fresh cut and fresh kicks, thinking it was cool, now I'm telling you
A grown man still in the struggle, vouch for my brothers too
And sisters, all across the globe, fuck the past
Fix the future, I'm sent here to spread the message, come on

We go marching till the whole entire world take notice
Wu-Block, take notice, Wu-Block, take notice
I'm dreaming, at the bar with Barack's wife
Nancy Reagan making shots for us, TMZ sent they source
Hillary said I frighten her
Alarm go off, choking off the teeth whitener
I'm Don-Don, Daily News, fitted be true blue
I don't gang bang, but my niggas be Su-Wu
It's only a few niggas in the game that I'm true to
She mad I won't fuck her, go wash that poo-poo
Yo, Starks, tell Vel to book more suits
Aiyo, Vel, tell L to call more treats
Snow bunnies, house wives of Orange County
We gun smoking bonanzas, with no bounty
See me? My chain lower than your GPA
See them shooters in that building? They hear to stay
Said you getting that for cheaper, well, what you pay?
Sometimes I feel like Naughty, Hip Hop Hooray
I feel murder in the air, yeah, where my soldiers
Where the hood at? Bring 'em out, need y'all to hold us

Generals on deck, what's up, son?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah... come on!)
Salut this (Library shit)
(Rock the belt, uh-huh, you know what time it is)
They understand and support us
(I ain't goin' out) Theodore (Uh-huh!)
(Ghostface Killah)
Eh-yo!
Stark edition, rock Christian's
The crystalized rock got the big jewelry dealers on a mission
Slick taste of lace, I done smacked New York City
The four-fifty went poppin' when he tried to dip me
Balled out in bingo halls, reported skiied out in jury duty
Judge Judy, big groupie bitch blew me, Beigen rush Cuffies
Blast the last uzi, ship me to Africa, right? I share rubies
Due to the night up on my behalf
I threw the shotti in the glass so I could have a double blast
Duffle pass, couples, teamed with the knuckle clash, fast
Rain, hail, snow, sleet, still bust that ass
Uppercut, bad, you in the grass slumped out and ya faggot-ass man hauled ass
Slammed body in the G-Y-M, G-Y-N'
Love Doctor in the hood, fucked bitches on their friends
So, yo...
(Hook: Ghostface Killah {*sung*})
Party people, you're the reason we're here
'Cause we love the game and our music is projects
So, so, yo, hello! Makin' sure y'all still there
On stage here tonight be the almighty Theodore Click
(Trife)
Yeah! Yeah... yo!
I'm a little dude but I hold guns the size of Europe
Y'all niggas is sweet like pancakes with extra syrup
Whatever y'all put up, I double that
Stapleton is where I hustle at, 2-12 is where I bubble at
Yeah, I'm talkin' money-wise, you funny guys
I'm quick to yolk you up like eggs that's cooked sunny-side
Catch me at the honey hive, runnin' the strip
Gun on the hip, posted for hours, slingin' dope and power
Culture power, throwin' nitros, lettin' the pipes blow
Got remote control cars and they're not made by Tyco
This the Theodore, drunk off Smirnoff
Bit ya ear off, therefore, the drama is what I'm here for
From the block to the stage
I represent for those, locked in the cage
Till I'm dropped in the graves, every line I spit, is like a, shot from the gauge
Move accordingly, even when I'm actin' disorderly
(Hook - minus last 2 lines)
(Twiz)
Who you wit?
See? See? Yo!
I'm a Don, dead form, look upon Ezekials
To the generals in my click, there'll be no sequels
Them hot ones'll crease, the vultures'll feast you
The loved ones will shiest you, gorillas will beast you
Just served fiends walkin' up the block yawnin'
Late night game, damn, forgot I got a warrant
Got in, laid down, then start snorin'
P-O kickin' ya door in, 4 in the mornin'
You blockin' my lane-lane like John Stockton
With the uttermost disrespect just like, Bernard Hopkins
Simply, it's PC within the verse
See we could be peoples later, in business, Money Comes First (First)"
220,The Battlefield,2014,36 Seasons (2014),,Ghostface Killah,"(Verse 1: Ghostface Killah)
Ayo, I'm back after nine years, that's 36 seasons
Shit is changed up for all types of reasons
Staten Island ain't the same, shit is lame
No familiar faces son, I'm dodging the game
I want a clean slate, but these cops stay screwin'
Snatching me up off the block, what am I doin'?
Oh, it's officer Dingle and his sidekick Berry
Driving me around the hood so I could worry
See how fucked up it is there's crackheads on every corner
Kids in the schoolyard smoking marijuana
I ain't feeling it, this ain't the way I left these blocks
And my name's faded out like some old damn socks
I want respect, these streets was my playground once
I was the Mack across 110th on these stunts
Not once would a nigga test me or gets zesty
I would walk down the street and sneeze, they all blessed me
(Hook: Tre Williams)
Been on the battlefield for a long, long time
I can see life closing in on this old body of mine
(Verse 2: Kool G Rap)
Yeah, homie, I'm the kingpin called Future
Make a killin' in these buildings in the millions
Got 'em feeling like Brewster
Shit hot as Fallujah
Kids grown now, they cock rugers
Welcome back to the sewers
Where new whips maneuver
No kids playing, no safe and sound havens
There's tre pound cases on the playground pavement
No more dudes with 22's in their sneaker soles
Kids tote shit that leave your body with a heap of holes
I'm that neighborhood blizzard flooding these streets with snow
Heavy iron on the ready, my shit'll crease your clothes
Keep a flock of sweetest hoes, yeah, I sleeps with those
Little slum young Keisha Coles with cheaper clothes
Undercovers all around the gutter, they creepin' low
I stays ahead, kid, I toss bread like pizza dough
I keep the tef around my torso with the piece below
That bulldog short nose, G be at peace with those, you know
(Verse 3: AZ)
Mama Bear was a church woman, pop's skated off
I was impaired, an introverted youngin', a lot changed my course
From nowhere to my first onion then them cops came across Flashed the badge, took my stash, told my little ass get lost
Threw me off when my grind was prime time then
You could step on and stretch mine's to a nine times ten
I was gone, remembering though that fine line's thin
So I studied that chessboard and we were all blind men
Dealers ran the streets, but the D's ran them
I was a killer underneath, but needed expansion
Something to constitute being high in a coupe
The cries from my youth so I applied for the suit
Salute to the enforcer, call me officer now
Supporter of paraphernalia, I toss it around
The link to the cartel, costs is down
It's that Denzel in training day shit, caution my grounds"

Did you see the moonlight shine?

Did you feel the cold wings fly?
Did you see the dawn of blood?
'Cause as my light seems near
But the light shines nowhere
She was amazing Carmela, caramel complexion
Think God brought 'em into my life as a suggestion
We click, I like mink, she like iced out rings
The finer things in life, together we share drinks
Vodka and cranberry, my little cherry
If I got luck she will fill up my commissary
It was matching, I felt the bomb between us
She was the jelly to my peanuts, Mars to Venus
The earth to my sun, moon and stars we added up
Mathematically, it's like I had a bad habit
Bitch you knew my lifestyle, check of a crime boss
She would hide my guns in the house then lie to the task force
Finish my sentence, do my exact frame of mind
Knew everything I had was hers and she was mine
We were crazy in love, couldn't get enough of each other
The center of attraction, we were made for one another
Nah, don't even fall for that corkazoid
She got the drink blazed, try and turn into a android
She not yo peanut butter, more like a fuckin' nut case
You're a grouper, that De Lucas mob brought you to place
They blowing trains on a beating rate, come in her face
They got the drop on you sun, you a fuckin' disgrace
You think God sent her? I'd ask the devil instead
They got plans for you Ton, they want you dead dead dead
So get rid of that cherry popper, she mad poison through pa, carajo
They bout to bring the poison
Yeah Thunder, De Lucas mob want yo head on the platter
It don't matter, some of yo dreams is gonna shatter
They tryin' to get at you, she got you caught in the rapture
Nigga wake up, darling you done made for one another
She a snake, mogy gone, get yo sprayed rubber
It's a set-up, seen it before, Doofy got wet up
Nah you paranoid, letting yo mind get the best of you
She would never set me up or lace my drink
Watch how you talkin', you know what? You heatin' the mink
You dead wrong, confusion help with one of yo hoes
She's erratic, that chick, believe me
A nigga knows I'm the el capitan, put this whole squad together
Keep talkin' bro, I put one in yo leather
Ball cap, Logan to do the hit, now that's better
Ah man
Come on Ton
You sleepy eyes man
I told you before, son, yo
You gotta stay focused out here, look
Look out the window man
Lucas mobs, son you know who they are
Them same motherfuckers, yo I seen her with the niggas before
She's a set-up chick"

You wanted to be a fighter (Yeah!)

Get out of my ring, you disgust me

Godzilla bankroll
Stones from Stilion
Yo I ain't got it all, that means I barely home
Trailblazer stay ballin
Revenge is my arts is crafty darts
While y'all stuck on Laffy Taffy
Wonderin' how y'all niggaz get past me
I been doin' this before Nas dropped the Nasty
My wallos I did 'em up
Them bricks I send 'em up
My raps y'all bit 'em up
For that now stick 'em up
Ten Four good buddy Tone got is money up
Worth millions still back your bitch lookin' bummy what
Y'all staring at the angel of death
Liar liar pants on fire You burning up like David Koresh
This is architect music
Verbal street opera pop a 'tec man fully got the projects booming indeed
I ran through the tunnel
Terrorize speed
That's when I was still in the jungle slangin that D

Get out my face! No you ain't got no mo?'.

I'm James Bond in the Octagon with two razors

Took a fat nigga out in like 40secs
My gun get hard wit a 45 still erects and eagle on
Kangol hat slanted coconut bounce to Morocco
Guerilla medallions like Flavor Flav clock yo
Niggaz want me dead but they scared to step to me
Rip they guts out like a hysterectomy
When beef collide look on the flip by the penitentiary kite
Or get you bumped off from the inside
Jaws is hanging
Frauds is left in they draws on the floor complaining
Bird ass nigga resemble Keenan Ivory Wayans
Stay in your place dirt born rappers get Shadow boxed for training?
Y'all still eatin bacon

Think nobody can; don't give this nigga no statue give him death
I told y'all I wasn't going away
You had your shot no give me mine
Now why don't you tell these folks why you been ducking me, politics man
You think you going to keep me down

Because I'm not a puppet like that fool up there
Ask his woman she get more pipe from the plumber than in bed
I'm the Champ!
(Ghostface Killah)
I like the deuce of diamonds cutting spades on a glass table
Half a mil on my left ankle
Terry cloth Guess shorts robes is comfortable
Bring me a nice bitch that means I'll fuck with you
My swagger is Mick Jagger stones is rolling
Prestige is cut to a tee sparkin' weed what up
The Cocoa leaf is slightly damp
Sprouting in the backyard next to Gran duke tomato plants
And jets get charted marquee shit with the cars on it
Them haters they earl run to the toilet and vomit
Back East summer MC king since Cuban
Pretty Tone Iron Man and Bulletproof and Supreme
Proof and you double deuce in the jeans

I need help to plan an attack twist back these youngin's
Tired of the run-in's, these niggas ain't live
Nine years in the desert, son, they couldn't survive
We're gonna ambush. Blow out the windows, set flames
Turn the pilots on, set up bombs by the maze
Blow brains, tie niggas up to the radiators

They ain't gladiators we gon' crush 'em
Push 'em to the edge, bomb rush 'em
You know how we do. OG style I dress like the pizza man
And when they answer the door you come out the van blazin'
Flame-throwing niggas like shish kebabs

Toasty, roasty, they be like Ghost be crazy as shit
They fucking with the wrong one
Son of a gun, I make murdering fun
You took my baby, my block, and corrupted my hood
I'm a do it for my hometown, New York understood
I see laboratories, chemicals and shit
They cooking right here on the block. I'm throwing a fit
Destructo, destroying houses like wreckin' balls
Crushing your foundation you sit somewhere, inspect the fall

Chill. Back the fuck up; it's gonna blow
He gotta face full of powder and that blue-like snow
The explosion threw him twenty feet in the air
He hit the floor and his face just stuck in blank stare
Hey yo, Tone. Hey yo, Tone. Wake the fuck up
The chemical burns on his face, I wanna throw up
I hugged him, felt his heart beatin', his chest breathin'
Fuck the police, son, I ain't leavin'
Scooped him, threw him in the van and split
Took him back to the crib and shit, we gon' fix it

I'll pee on a handball court wall where they paint 'em (now hold that)
I'll fuckin' yellow-stain 'em
Them niggas out of pocket with it (word)
Buck shots, left his big man chopped to a midget (blaow-blaow)
Rippin' crazy shit, poppin' from a Civic
Warm biscuit tryin' to put this nigga Starks in a barrel
Them slugs hit the wall, I assassinated his shadow (damn)
At the train yard, my tires rollin' over gravel (yeah)
I hope I hear him step on the third rail and crackle
Now I'm hoppin' out the whip, gotta finish this
My bigger (??) about to show him what the business is
Parked trains, darker rain, ain't no witnesses (where he at?)
I swore I heard his footsteps right behind me (word, yo)
So, I turned around quick to do this nigga slimy
Nothin' but a black stray cat ran over line three (what's that?)
A homeless man rollin' cans in a shoppin' cart (oh, shit)
And then, from top of the train, came a pop, a spark
Tried to pop back but I was locked in a arch
The nigga hit his mark right on top of my heart (aw, damn)
My whole chest went numb and the pain got sharp (down)
Fell face down on the ground, saw the Timberland mark
He bopped, swingin' the gun like a pendulum arm

Yo let me adjust my lens
Through these binoculars
I paid 5 g's sliding off like Kid Vitamin
Viking
Patriot of Broad Street
Bet you think I'm laying like a hyphen

Tony Starks make the narc's dogs bark
With the Benz parked
Up against the boulevard
Starks had the bone sparked
One cop tapped the window glass
Like a cymbal crash,
""What the fuck son! You trying to break glass?""
He flashed his badge,
""License and registrations""
At that moment
His fat partner started chasin'
Chicken heads they was racing wit' they hearts pacin'
For snatching gold
Trying' to dip into the god's basement
Our location
Lead steel shed spread
Cracked shorty head
Left sweetie there for dead
Ghetto poodles
Fingers sticky from cheese doodles
Starving' for a 50 cent bag of Oodles and Noodles
Neighborhood sick wit' it
Clinton 'bout to cut WIC
Maybe one y'all rich rap niggas need to politic
Reach for the sky
They throw bleach in your eye
Don't teach you why
You be keeping 'em high
Dipped like an Oreo cookie
In cold milk, bold silk
Gold-filled cap, Wu wear hat,
Low tilt
True Islamic
We speak verbal rhyme phonics
Why y'all trying to change this hip hop to technotronics?

Girl!
(RZA)
Because of you I'm hurting
Within my within my heart
I know it's not right to be flirting
But a relationship has to start
You're the one that I'm clocking
It's time for you to start jocking
Don't want you to see me cry
This is why this is why this is why
(RZA)
I met this girl named Rhonda from way down yonder
(Ghostface)
Hey yo god don't fuck with her!

I met this girl named Liz she was all in the biz

Hey yo lord don't fuck with her!

Hey yo nigga you better fuck with her!"
228,The Hilton,2001,Bulletproof Wallets (2001),,Ghostface Killah,"(Raekwon)
This Nigga just bought eleven machine guns
And he brought them in my crib
(Ghostface Killah)
Glittered out, stout face, teck, Rae up in the Hilton
Heard Nia Long is in the building
Penthouse fashion, ordered out room service
It looked bugged cause the waiter looked nervous
Lift off the lid, seen two shiny thirty-eights aimed at the kid
What I do, duck!
Rae up in the shower singing
Son don't know that it's real
Coming looking like he about peel something
In a tight jam, red down, matching like santa
If I could just reach my hammer
He bust two shots, I played mice
Ran to the spot were the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice
That's when Rae ran out of the back
Towel on, soap on his arms, spit duke around, fell on my lap
(Raekwon)
Yo, what the fuck happened?
(Ghostface Killah)
It was a set up to get wet up
(Raekwon)
Starks your bleeding
(Ghostface Killah)
Nah, his blood fucked my white leather up
Ten G's down the drain
Yo hurry up, we got to get him up
Get the sheets son, let's fix him up
Lock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch
(Raekwon)
Just give me two minutes to iron my shirt, find my ices
(Ghostface Killah)
The hit came quick
Hit the jack, star six
Ghost
(Raekwon and Ghostface Killah)
Put down the phone stupid
Wipe off your prints
(Ghostface Killah)
Rae ran hysterically
Slipped on soap
Landed on his back, with his gat, now that's dope
We got three minutes, nobody seen shit
Somebody might have heard shit
Singing on some Martin, were my momma bird shit
Fuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock
Everything all right? Partying son, balloons popped
Threw this dude under the bed
A half dressed Raekwon, swallowing diamonds
Had money in juice up on his wedding day
The phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me,
What you want sweaty, lima beans and kidney
Trashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer
Throw a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper
Soap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut
Praying how me make it out the telly and touch
(Chorus - Ghostface Killah)
Fuck it, a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
Caught up in the grimy shit
Finding two days later a murder and we got to make this flight shit
It was a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
A Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer

Ayo, the pressures on, sonny got murk
Its time to move fast
Ayo, Deini it's on, check out the news flash
Flew out the next day, back to the Tony estates
Blew on the first class flight to L.A.
It ain't take long, I pulled a few strings on the horn
So were it came from?
That nigga we stuck and took the caine from
We should have killed him when we had him
Yo I was holding a Magnum
Yeah we bagged him, but we let him slide in the wagon
His bad little brown ho, from out Chicago
She move his cargo, good at handling Roscoes
We had our eyes closed God, we should have seen it coming
He should have seen me coming, running out the shower gunning
Now that I figured it, she put the waiter on
It all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song
Dawned on me later on
By then the day was gone
How dare this nigga even think that he could take us on
Smoke the Cee Allah
Sent the kite through the Pens
Him and big Dan
Known to split wigs, with razor sharp gems
Giants from Attica riots
Halls is quiet
CO's with babies on their arms look tight
And this nigga from down state got shipped up north
Stocky young fella, running his lips on how he set it off
Then heard that shit, plus got that kite
Money got murdered in his bunk that night"

Aiyo what's in it? Three M's in the bank
Shoot it, oh you gotta stop?
Six bitches, to the top
A four and better, beat the five
I looked him in his eyes, grabbed the dice
Son I'll five 'em better twice for ya fuckin' life
Money feed good, all downs is a bet
Meanin', any money on the ground is a bet
Open up the pool, get a dicin' room
Aight bitches, use Pampers, girls need a nice room
That's a six, I told you that bitch ain't claustrophic
If you ass-bettin', you just bet yo' ass
Nah, I got the money, I even got one wit' me
And 'Von bring it too, he on his way to come get me
He just hit me, he'll be here in fifteen
With them two things, grey Benz and maroon seats
I got a quarter-mil in each of my first sleeves
The rest is in my longjonhs, boots and jeans
Come in the buildin', before I pay I wanna see a three
Come in the buildin', nigga

Pop your collar (do whatever you do best)
Just pop your collar (up the ladder to the hill of success)

Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, he had three down and bet three M's
So you know what happened to him
He got three rounds, we all ex-dealers
Ex-killers, we gon' ride to the death for the skrilla
I hold my own and rep my niggas
Always oil my guns and inspect my triggas
Sometimes I call my lawyer just to check my figures
He told me not to worry, all cheques is clearin'
So fuck my rhymes, I got the best appearance
And I survive through project experiences
You wanna roll dice or roll and ride?
No matter, you gon' get holes inside
See you fuckin' with Theodore Dieni
You fuckin' with a metaphor King Pin
You fuckin' with him? Wu-Tang
Wu, you fuckin' with them?
Dun, do you wanna gun to make you slim?
So I'ma pop my collar, get my dollars
Pop all parlors and fuckin' with money scholars?
Matter of fact I'm gonna fuck with rockweilers
(Chorus: Superb)
Pop your collar (do whatever you do best)
Get your dollar (New York, up the ladder to the hill of success)
Pop your collar (you know what we gonna do)
Just pop your collar (New York, say no more, New York, say no more..)
(Trife)
Let off the Jackey Don, rollin' the dice with a happy arm
Everything good, money on wood
Bank stoppers, I send them home broke
Have them all in they stash, bettin' they own coat
I takes it all, fifty and better, you make the call
Watch you break your all, big sixes 'cause I'm a nigga who don't like to fall
High roller, see how my dice kiss
Push you pay me, and if I roll trips you pay me twice bitch
I rocks, believe it or not
Come broke to a dice game, step off and leave with a knot
Head cracks is all you see when I'm hot
What's in the pop? A 00 g's to the bank to the man, who got it stopped
My hand is like a gun, feel the heat when it's cocked
4-5-6 your heart drop, way deep in your socks
You wanna walk, broke your ass down the street with a bop
The drinks is on you tonight, from my peeps in the spot
(Chorus: Superb)
Pop your collar (do whatever you do best, yo)
Get your dollar (up the ladder to the hill of success)
Pop your collar (you know what we gonna do)
Just pop your collar (pop us, do us)"
230,The Prayer,2007,The Big Doe Rehab (2007),,Ghostface Killah,"Sometimes I feel like he don't hear me
Sometimes I wonder, do he love me
Life is so hard for me
This ain't the way it's supposed to be
I pray every night asking for forgiveness
Sometimes ask myself is it worth it
Life is so pain, painful
Yet I'm so thank, thankful
Life wont be easy and I know that
My past is over, wish I can go back
Maybe I change-anges
Rearrange-anges
Sometimes times in life we all feel like we are feel like we falling
Those who suffer in life will be rewarded
Lord I hear you but it's so hard being strong
I keep reminiscing all my loved ones that are gone
He says hun you should know you're born to die
I say I do it's just so hard saying bye
That's why, feel like, you don't hear me
Sometimes I wonder, do you love me
Life is so hard for me
This ain't the way it's supposed to be"
231,The Soul Controller,1996,Ironman (1996),,Ghostface Killah,"Whoaahhhoah, oahhhoh
It's been a long, long
A long time coming
A change gon' come
Yo, yo these streets got me backed down how can I escape?
How can I survive without bubblin weight?
It's prepared for the stand off, once you hand off
That white rock, and then give birth to a knot
Your biggest dream was to rock your 850 and beam
You and the Gods buy a crib in the white part of Queens
But at the same time, niggaz on the block is ill
Some'll rock you to sleep, hap, for selling cross pills
Being watched all day like enemy's prey
Faces, you never seen before is in your hallway
Brothers you knew for years is mad pussy and scared
Back in the days U.F.O.'s couldn't walk up in here
It's time to motor, travel like a foul order
Clear my head, stay sober, the soul controller
Oah, it's been a long, long
A long time coming
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will
Said I'm too, tired of livin'
But I'm, but I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there
In that great big ol' sky
Sink deep into the fog, big buffalo large
Taj Mahal just got banged, shanked for eighty dollars
It's hard to keep up, with these key-ons, that smoke dust
In the U.S. Mint they want to rock the place and call the rush
All these shameless niggaz armed with cherry-red Bally's
On the twenty-fifth, everybody rich is gettin' married
Killed for power beans, your brother own schools in Medina
Vaseline lips is cracked 'cause they all had dreams
They overdue, these Gods own a mosque in Peru
Tropical trees and weaves where they grew bamboo
Olympic minds quick flash like a leak on
A hundred shares short to own Nissan, watch 'em get they feast on
Royal blue lies inside the eyes of heaven
Curse the head, who speak foul and jinx number seven (seven)
Clear my head and stay sober, the soul controller...
(Stay sober, the soul controller)
Oah, been a long time comin'
Oh yeah
A change gon' come
Whoa, yes it will
Yo, yo we sit and play the wall like nine super heroes
Late for the man choose and hit socks and stereos
The kid's nice, warnin you twice, run your garmets
Jet to Providence, switch up and back down your Parliament
Ironman is laced with a plate inside the dome piece
Go off in airports, biographies, prophecies
Watch me set it, real key-ons hold down the desert
And walk with a famous name like Supreme Magnetic
Carbon copy, I love my car, it's near choppy
Melachi off the funky pain with the wax poppy on instrumentals
Niggaz get lost like S.S. Minnows
Turned out like rentals, keep gold around the denim
A change gon come
Yes it will
It's been a long, long
A long time coming
A change gon come
Woo, yes it will
Said I'm so
Tired of living
But I'm, but I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there
In that great, big ol sky
Oh my, oh my, oh my
It's been a long, long time
A long time coming
Change gonna come
Woo, yes it will
Outro Part Two: (from the motion picture ""Carlito's Way"")
Sorry boys,
All the stitches in the world can't sew me together again
Lay down, lay down
Gonna stretch me out in Fernandez funeral home on hun and ninth street
Always knew I'd make a stop there
But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
Last of the Mohicans
Well, maybe not the last
Can't come with me on this trip, Loaf
Gettin' the shakes now
Last call for drinks
Bar's closin down
Sun's out
Where we goin' for breakfast?
Don't wanna go far
Rough night
Tired, baby
Tired...

Good Morning, Good morning
Time to get up
Look at the sun so pretty today
It's so bright, it's so smashing
Lasting, helps out the grass and
Smile when it's morning time
Last night I wrote 3 rhymes, I woke up to see the sun shine
If, God is my witness
In scriptures and pictures
The Sun kiss scrumptious son, it's Nutricious
It makes me wanna climb
Take a bite out of shine
This little light of mine
Yo, the son could never be pussy, He always come out
He'll sit right there, even if you pull your gun out
He can never run out, when the lights go out
If your pants turn out, a herb head spun around
I see Yellow and Green, It's a beautiful thing
The sky's blue, 'cause the sun hit the water like ""BING""
A reflection (uh-huh) and that's all it is (word)
You can't stare at him long, 'cause your face'll do like this

? Before, so it's a fact I support
Feeling the warm sun rays, upon your back as you walk
The heat-driven, A theory I plung to deep living is
Souls have to go through the sun to reach Heaven
And, sensing retreat, our souls badden the scene
Madame believe, since dinosaurs, and Adam and Eve
That Sun's hovered, to the extermination of us
It's a peephole, which leads to the firmament above us

I don't shoot to kill, I play to win
Stay catching up with the cutthroats
Some men shoot a nigga, throw 'em off the tugboat, no floats
The body sinks to the bottom
Or left off the side of the road to smell rotten
The murder sprees, random killings
Ghostface killah's back attacking villains, hanging from the ceilings
Godfather motives, gangsta mentality
Black superhero with the immortality
Forever, I be creeping in a black mist
Ill night vision with the militant tactics
I glide through the air like a swarm of bees
Shake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas
Raw meat, leave bodies slumped in the street
Revenge is the spice of life, it's so sweet
Ay yo, pipe bombs blowing they souls to Jesus
Don't need nothing but the puzzle glue for the pieces
Meat cleaver cut finger tips like rib tips
Home invasions, cars gonna flip, the mucous lose
Pair of cement shoes, tossed in the ocean
Popped until they brain ooze, I won't lose
Blood all on my apron, hog tie 'em up while they try escaping
Peeped the visual, tied 'em up individual,
Took their clothes off, season 'em like sausage
Let the pits out to eat 'em, that's the remedy
Attack, kill, bite off their extremities
Blood bath splash my name on my wall
Call it piece delivery, leave a tip on the stall
With an arm, leg, a head
I'm coming for you all
It's the sure shot
Heart of a lion
King of the jungle
I'm a humble killer bee
You as soft as a bumble
I don't crumble, I strike back hard with a vengeance
Attack through these killer words I spit in a sentence
I'm a menace, the black card cape, caped crusader
The face of a ghost, I disappear in the vapors
You could murder my flesh and bone, soul's invincible
Revenge my death, payback's the main principal
Protect ya neck when you move, I be lurking in the shadows
Starks, the gangsta nigga, I never lose battles
Pimp bitches, with a superhero logo on my chest
Big gucci link, GFK on the crest
Icy arm for the eagle with the eight carat ruby eyes
Piss on your motherfucking lawn while I'm stupid high
All black down, royalty purple and some ice chips
Two glock 9s pointed at you in a hype flick
Now I'm alone in the room, and I just stare at the wall
Revenge my death but I'm going through with yours
My lost niggas, I miss them
This new power and wisdom
Got me thinking I've made a whole lot of bad decisions
Got locals still to deal with
Should I kill her?
Throw her fuckin' ass in a cage with a gorilla
Or let her live and treat her like scum of the earth
I've got goons to feed and babies to birth
I'm the god now, plus I'm a super rich nigga
Do more help than harm, either way you figure
Should I protect and serve
Or cock and aim destruction?
Let the enterprise take over the force of production
Corruption, my mind state is unpredictable
I'm bulletproof now, back from the dead, I'm invincible"

Don't forget who you is, nigga, you my little shit

And my Breitling--the band: you can say it's iced lightning
You don't like him, do you? You wanna fight him
In fact, I should've put you back, relaxed on the stones

(Ghostface Killah)
Catch me in a crisp blue six, deep dish
Doors is crisp, velour stop at the wrist
Watch is involved, talk to me Trick Daddy
I liked the way you tilt ya hat up in that Caddy son,
Can't believe you the most slept on
Took a break since the Cuban, niggas lookin' like you just repped wrong
You done slimmed down a bit, got caught with the hammer
Steal banners, medical examiners, clocked live hammers
For real, you a live nigga, rock ya five in ya slippers
Like them other five guys in ya picture
Come on, watch, I'm the star of the show, so blow then
Mothafucka, you ain't blew in three years
You son of a bitch, that's why I rock the big shit
Don't forget who you is, nigga, you my little shit
I will crush you to pieces, stop ya heart from tickin'
And you mad 'cause you a older clock, couple rocks missin'
And my Breitling--the band: you can say it's iced lightning
You don't like him, do you? You wanna fight him
In fact, I should've put you back, relaxed on the stones
And copped the two-thousand leather in snow cones
A bowl of milk almost killed you, ak, you almost drowned in Pops
I bought another box, I'ma keep it real with you
And I'ma murder you if ya bitch-ass get on my nerves again
(Raekwon (as ""the watch""))
Yo, Ghost, you'se a funny nigga
Turn on the radio, all you hear is X and Jigga

Yo, it's obvious, Clan's day

Hold on, let me park my shit,
Let me find out this nigga barkin' and shit I'm a Don of this shit,
And you know that shit I wrote with Golden Arms is a hit
My Wallos show off, go off like an alarm in the six
Draped in yellow and I'm still poppin'
My movie life in the hood is like an ill doctrine
Beat trial with illegal aide, fuck Cochrane
And if it's on I might blow you if I'm boxed in... {*echoes*}

Eh-yo!
Stark edition, rock Christian's
The crystalized rock got the big jury dealers on a mission
Slick taste of lace, I done smacked New York City
The four-fifty went poppin' when he tried to dip me
Balled out in bingo halls, reported skiied out in jury duty
Judge Judy, big groupie bitch blew me, Beigen rush Cuffies
Blast the last uzi, ship me to Africa, right? I share rubies
Due to the night up on my behalf
I threw the shotti in the glass so I could have a double bash
Duffle pass, couples, teamed with the knuckle clash, fast
Rain, hail, snow, sleet, still bust that ass
Uppercut, bad, you in the grass slumped out and ya faggot-ass man hauled ass
Slammed body in the G-Y-M, G-Y-N'
Love Doctor in the hood, fucked bitches, all their friends
So, yo...
(Chorus: Ghostface Killah (sung))
Party people, you're the reason we're here
'Cause we love the game and our music is projects
So, so, yo, hello! Makin' sure y'all still there
On stage here tonight be the almighty Theodore Click

Yeah! Yeah... yo!
I'm a little dude but I hold guns the size of Europe
Y'all niggas is sweet like pancakes with extra syrup
Whatever y'all put up, I double that
Stapleton is where I hustle at, 2-12 is where I bubble at
Yeah, I'm talkin' money-wise, you funny guys
I'm quick to yolk you up like eggs that's cooked sunny-side
Catch me at the honey hive, runnin' the strip
Gun on the hip, posted for hours, slingin' dope and power
Culture power, throwin' nitros, lettin' the pipes blow
Got remote control cars and they're not made by Tyco
This the Theodore, drunk off Smirnoff
Bit ya ear off, therefore, the drama is what I'm here for
From the block to the stage
I represent for those, locked in the cage
Till I'm dropped in the graves, every line I spit, is like a, shot from the gauge
Move accordingly, even when I'm actin' disorderly
(Chorus - minus last 2 lines)
(Twiz)
Who you wit?
See? See? Yo!
I'm a Don, dead form, look upon Ezekials
To the generals in my click, there'll be no sequels
Them hot ones'll crease, the vultures'll feast you
The loved ones will shiest you, gorillas will beast you
Just served fiends walkin' up the block yawnin'
Late night game, damn, forgot I got a warrant
Got in, laid down, then start snorin'
P-O kickin' ya door in, 4 in the mornin'
You blockin' my lane-lane like John Stockton
With the uttermost disrespect just like, Bernard Hopkins
Simply, it's PC within the verse

We run the city

Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like ""True Lies,"" kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' with put bombs in your mom's gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin' real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed
(Chorus: Raekwon)
Niggaz got to die, if I go they got to go
Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, 'cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid
... If I go they got to go
Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, 'cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid

We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Layin on the bed, lookin' like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, lookin' at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who woulda ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin' sign language is twitchin noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo
All I heard was Frank Lexi get the raw
(Ghostface Killah)
Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust
If he holdin' the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot
Up early in the mornin, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'
(Fuck) the brawlin, cause Tony for the stallin
And all I see is $ signs, here's the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggaz)
Workin out, all I curl is my index finger
Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin' that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggaz) respect winners
I got them big spenders comin' through, hourly
Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully
Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me
You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga
Uh-huh

And we ball from plentys of parties 'cause we start shit
Parole holes, six months in the box

She made it home for shop

Anything ya take 'cause the paper keep callin ya
Gangsters keep ballin fosho, we want more

Yeah, and I'm all about that bullshit

Just imagine what I do for a quarter
Ain't no tellin' what I do for a dollar
Pop a nigga right in front of his mama
Son a nigga right in front of his daughter
And I'm nothin' like a father

To see Baltimore suck this cock

Yo, yo, yo, aiyo you brought me on Jerry just to take you back
After that bullshit you put me through a couple months back
That wasn't right, call the cops on me, and told them I had it like
""Yeah, pop the trunk, he got dope and guns""
Check for warrants, that son of a bitch on the run, I know
Three of his niggas got life, he use to roll with
And told 'em I bodied an upcoming basketball star
Once I heard that, I fell out the cop car, real hard
You bugged out, and thugged out, wanted me to take you back
That could never happen, I'm sorry
No disrespect, but you a psycho, honey
Got that S.S.I. money, and you start actin' funny
Shrimp's every night, ordering steaks
Them jumbo joints, them shits cost a buck 50 for eight
And when you told me your Merlo, need more grapes
I said ""Honey, you never had wine before!""
And if you did, that's not how you act at all
And no... that's not how we rock in Theodore
(Chorus: Ghostface Killah (Jacki-O))
Please, babe, I love you
(Take me back, I'll never do it again)
Always want you
(You know that you my lover and my best friend)
Yes, darling, it's true
(Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on)
Please, babe, I want you...
(Jacki-O)
Back to them days, when the yay' was bein' frontin' to you
Hundred thousand dollar shopping sprees wasn't nothin' to you
When three was a crowd... but I dealt with it
And your sex wasn't wild... but I dealt with it
I always felt shitted, you should of take me back
The girl that introduced you to boy, and helped you open your stacks
I got you in South connects, for the hard grind
That's why I took mine off the top, for the hard time
You know you need me in the streets, to help you run things
And if you catch a case, you got it wrong, I'mma pawn rings
I'm your lady boo, that's what I'm suppose to do
I know when you was coppin' my Coupe, that you was coppin' two
I know when you got me the red one, that she got the blue
But the way I chew on you, you should of got me two
Now you got me in the kitchen, with your fryin' on
Tell me that you gon' move with me, I know you lyin', dog
Who loves you baby? Nobody like Jacki-O
Cook, clean, break up your weed, and I give you nasty throat
What you actin' for? Get back in the door
Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on
(Ghostface Killah)
Yo, you know I always love you, I never meant to hurt you
Even the stress'll work you, I miss your old perfume
Promise never curse you, I want you in my circle
Honey right by my side where I keep my herbals
We both agree on no more fighting, we'll just have a verbal
The man'll treat you like a queen, I will bird you
Mother and father birthed you, if I have to hit you
Then damn, I might as well leave, 'cause I don't deserve you
Watch from you face, when you sleep, let the heat disturb you
Fiendin' from the magic wand, when she 'nique and serve you
Take me please, take me with ease
Take me back, God damn, and scrape marks on my knees
'Member the first time you made my key
You was drunk, you went behind a tree and pee'd
I miss shit like that, and all of the times
We played cops, I'll arrest you in bed
Police brutality, I'll leave the side of your ass red
God damn it, is sex for real girl? Girl, we in special ed
Uh-huh... fuck that, take me back, pretty please, with you on top

Hands is shaking doctors is taking to operating
Now you might not live so they start debating
You in bad shape
And your neck of New York your slithering ways labeled you a bad snake
Smash bait eight stab holes in your shoulder blade
You wildin on the stretcher and shit, they tryin' to hold your legs

My eyes looking like I learn how to sky dive
The world is yours there's rules you abide by
Ride with the fly guy on I 9 5

I told Big L through me he could resurrect
I'm that nigga like Puff and L.O.X.
I took one L and life is still double X

The E's in Eminem's I need a Relapse
And bitches grab my mic give me feedback

You know you doing it when your tire lip rubbing
I keep a freak and I call her chicken meat
Cause this Superbad nigga, she McLovin

Fiends get killed in my hallways we parle
My feet been killing me all day
Your boy down for life like them killers in Rahway
It's all work and no play
Cause this block is nothing like Broadway
Revenge is sweeter that sorbet
You all become believers when this heaters in your face
Just a part of my function
Y'all don't want no part of the gun spray
I would hate to pull it in one stray
That's where the innocence bystand
We're trapped inside these tenements like damn
Why mama try'na feed us this spiced ham
Connects try'na cheat us with light grams
Co-defendants try to lighten they sentence snitching to white man

The way I shoot the gift, I swallow coke bottles
And you would swear it was Lil' Kim lips
Eh, I really like you baby
Do you know how to wife this lady?
Give me what I want, don't talk, don't touch
Unless you got a bank account that make my face blush
Now shush... in my bush
And I can give you what you want, make a whoosh
Just throw it, I'll show you how to push

Yo
Aiyyo I'm lost underwater
I see a pink dog with a crystal handle, so I keep swimmin
Amazed that I'm not drownin
Butterflies took control when I arrived, I opened the door
No I knocked first, I'm not on my turf
I seen a ray of lights that resemble live fireworks
Some mermaids with Halle Berry haircuts flashin they tail
Like follow me now, don't be afraid
I'ma show you where all the djinns and spirits pray
If you scared to face this life you shouldn't stay
So I kept on swimmin, grabbed on to her fin to help me out
As we got close I seen the boat all shot up with his anchor out
Then she asked me politely what I'm thinkin' about
I said nuttin - she said nuttin leaves nuttin
If you fill me up bet this'll bring that out
I seen rubies, diamonds, smothered under octopus
Jellyfish sharks soar, aquaproof pocketbook
Pearls on the mermaid girls
Gucci belts that they rock for no reason from a different world
Up ahead lies Noah's Ark, but that's waves away
And way to the right, that's one of our bangin' spas
She quoted I took notice, Spongebob in the Bentley Coupe
Bangin' the Isleys, he slow backed up
Then he passed me swoop, seen his chick eyein me hard
He got vexed and smacked his boo
Took off, continued my travels
Seen a rock from the Titanic
Lookin' fat and nah it wasn't damaged
Then I seen somethin' real big, sky blue and gold
With whitewalls, behind a large city
That was lost before Christ walked the walk
Upon the waters that's so bright
Everytime we got close the mermaid held on tight
All I heard was ""Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar""
""Bismillah ar-Rahman, ar-Raheem, Allah screamed""
That we heard from afar, everyone selat
And the world's banginest minds got crowded in
With life that I can't explain
They said sir yes I'm glad you came, greeted me with Qu'rans and Torahs
Prayed after that we said amen"

Get the mic on
I don't know what happened, son
I just lost my mind, son
It's like I wasn't strong, G, I couldn't hold it when I seen it
A nigga flesh on me, I can't really-- I couldn't hold it, G
I don't know, I'mma, listen, no I went like this, nigga
I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze
People talking to me and calling my name
But I don't hear a word they say...
(Ghostface Killah)
It was him, the cornerstore and a buttered roll
The shit dropped when I gave him two stomach holes
One to the face, he fell sideways
I was up close, so part of his nose was stuck to my padres
Standin' over him shakin', kid, screamin'
He slapped my girl, that's the reason why I was f'in to lean 'im
Everything got real slow, I ain't hear shit, my word
At least 40 seconds, I stay dead stiff
I pound him with the gun out, Big Din came, opened my hand
Removed the gun and the 16 spun out
He floored past 90 on the BQE
I threw up all on his door, splashed his Gucci seats
I couldn't speak, I'm in a state of shock
About now there should be yellow tape on the block, a raid at my spot
Hey, yo, I feel a li'l bugged out, insane, I lost my mind
People tellin' me, Ghost, you actin' mad strange
(Interlude {*Chorus plays along with interlude*})
See what I'm sayin'? I don't know, I just don't feel right
Havin' flashbacks, bugged out, man, knahmean?
Nah, I don't wanna go to the clinic, I don't want the hospital, son
You know, I just feel like I'm lost, reality, man, y'knahmean?
My face feels numb, son
(Ghostface Killah)
Flashbacks to me blowin' his brains out
All I remember's my shirt, I couldn't get them goddamned stains out
Oxy cleans wheat 'round the chest area
Righthand side, I'm pluckin' off li'l pieces of meat
And my goons want me to bounce to Tennessee
But I said no, I got these two snow-bunnies in Venice Beach
On the low, son, I sleep with the hawk, in East New York
'Round my man Killa' way where all the murderers walk
Manhunt, police searches, swat ran in my crib
Battering rams, early mornin', yo, waking my kids
Now my aunt gotta stay wit' my wiz
She paranoid, havin' anxiety attacks 'cause of these pigs
Plus my connect, they goin' crazy, they try'na slay me
I told 'em, Friday I'll have they money, faggots try'na play me
I'll never eat up out a garbage can
I'll Larry Davis a cop, and if I make it alive, it was the Father's plan
(Outro 1 {*outro 2 plays along with outro 1*})
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowwhere, I'm aight, I'm aight
But I know one thing, if anybody touch me, I'm blowin' they head smooth off
Cops, connects, I don't give a fuck, they gon' feel that Eagle, they gon' feel that Desert
They gon' feel that Bulldog, y'knahmean? I don't give a fuck
Don't put me in no mental clinics, it ain't nothin', y'knahmean?
If I make it out alive, I make it out alive, if not, fuck it
Yo, I can't take this shit no more, it's too hype
Niggas thinkin' I'm buggin' out, I ain't buggin'
Y'all niggaz'd be buggin' out too if you had somebody's flesh on you
Motherfuckers, fuck y'all niggaz, I ain't goin' crazy
Sleepin' on couches and shit... I'm goin' back outside, fuck y'all niggaz, man
I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze
People talking to me and calling my name
But I don't hear a word they say
I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze
People talking to me and calling my name
But I don't hear a word they say
I know my Mother's worried about me
'Cause they might have to put me away at any time
'Cause when my baby packed up her clothes and left me
She oh! I believe she took my mind..."

War in the east, war in the west
War up north, war down south
(Trife Da God)
Uh, welcome to Jam-rock
Where niggaz get popped, buried in sandlots
New York niggaz, triple they money hitting the grand spot
West Coast bang for they colors and they demand blocks
Stuffed in niggaz barbeque grillings, sizzling hamhocks
Can't forget my mid west niggaz out in the Chi
St. Louis and Tennessee, where them killas is sure to ride
Shout out to my Ohio players, clocking that paper
To all them fly pimps in Detroit, rocking them gators
Riding around, with the top down, heat in the lap
Stay balling, with the plush leather seats in the back
Down in Houston, sidding sideways, chucking the deuce
Popping them bottles, getting blasted over cups of that juice
Dizzy stukes, niggaz blowin' off Bobby, like Whitney Houst'
Grey goose with a touch of grapefruit, indeed, it get me loose
We need to call a truce, for all my fallen troops
Stop the warring, let's do more recording
Sit back and count this loot
(Chorus: Trife Da God (sample))
(War in the east) To all them dealers in the tri-state
(War in the west) For all them niggaz out west, raising the crime rate
(War up north) To all them killas up north, locked in the bing
(War down south) For everybody down south doing they thing, come on
(War in the east) To all my greasy east niggaz getting that clock right
(War in the west) To all my jackets catching them fools at the stop lights
(War up north) To all the heavy bidders repping in jail
(War down south) To them votes, shouting the dirty south, electing that meal
(Trife Da God)
You can find me in the 'west', like Kanye, blowing on bombai
With the killas on Crenshaw, serving up entrees
Or lounging with the homies from Northstar, popping out of sportscars
Niggaz wilding out in the sports bar
No matter where I go, I'm still repping New York, pa
You know we get it cracking when we up in the courtyard
Sipping on forties of Ale, pouring liquor out
For all the O.G.'s and shorties in jail
And when I'm out in the Carolinas, blessing that marijuana
Down in New Orleans, my niggaz wrestling anacondas
Clapping them tools in Baton Rouge, provoking drama
Getting it crunk in Atlanta, searching for baby mommas
Philly and D.C., V.A. to B-More in a G4
I-95, making them detours
South Beach, Memorial weekend hitting the sea shore
And every other city we go, I'm promoting T-Dore"

(I just want to celebrate) We hype for just bein here

Stones on every arm, the crib is ten million
The corks from Dom Perignon can't reach my ceiling
Four maids with four grenades
When the sun's in my face, all I do is lower the walls for shade
The pool's a pain in the ass, fifty grand on Windex kid
They keep it clean the whole bottom is glass
So you can see the sharks and piranhas, a pair of pajamas
That's my neighbor, the faggot disresepecting my mama
No cars in the garage, it's underground shit
They way the floor open up you think I'm hiding spaceships
French chefs, the best grapes on they breath
Louie aprons on the Yank cats, the puffy cooks the rest
Besides I got birds that never leave the nest
They fuck with me, I'll watch 'em confess, then I'll go rest
Get back up deposit them checks
Muthafuckas fuckin' up a good time by snappin your necks, come on
(Chorus 2: Ghostface Killah (Rare Earth sample))

Shorties wettin me, check out her body, uh
Throw up your hands like it's your birthda, mommy
Let's celebrate, now I got her girlfriends behind me
Now I'm in the middle, watch is all chiseled
I can holla at the birds like Dr. Dolittle
(What's that in your pocket Ghost?) a Dill pickle
(Not that) oh that's the forty-five stainless nickel
I'm pullin a green, gotta G for the biggest ass
On the floor who look right in them jeans
If you fat, I might take one for the team
But I gotta get drunk first knowhatimean, come on
(Chorus 3: Ghostface Killah (Rare Earth sample))
(I just want to celebrate) Like we won the Power Ball money
(I just want to celebrate) Tony Starks won an Oscar y'all

Na-na-na-na-nah, you can't catch me
I'm out like Thomas in, in a five-fifty
Police be fiendin to frisk me
I'm so legit I walk away with the car keys pissy
Back at the labo, shorty wop need a Dutch
He fuckin' wit a Goose dick, tonight I'ma beat it up
Your thing to wet, you sure you ain't seeded up
(That's how I get Ghost, especially when you eat it up)
My goodness gracious, ass is flirtatious
Move it around like a snake miss or sexy waitress
Ghost don't have no patience
I like you, I usually change chicks like radio stations
I'm, definitely not lookin' for love
But if you give it to me right now I might say I was
You can chill if you want I got crazy bud
But before we do what it do, go jump in the tub, come on

New York, we been had it, we gets it in
Outta town we fuckin' up but gets it in

Bitch motherfucker tried to get a rep' off me
Leave him there, never know, get him off me
I remember days when we just fucked bitches
Bought a lot of clothes and just played the ave.
Now we rap niggas with a lot of wardrobes
And if we want a nigga dead we pay the cash
I ain't tryin' to waste my career on y'all
Even scuffle with y'all, waste gear on y'all
But if I gotta go out, you know I'ma show out
You gon' fuck around and get your whole back blown out

The mess hall crawler, about to zone out
Dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out
We just dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out

See... see... see me
I roll with Ghost and cats that carry they toast and
Make the post and from pagin, sin astasian
When it's time to bust off them things, it ain't a game man
We rocked out own diamond rings, see them 'Bling, Bling'
Got big boy toys, Porsche, Sixes
Dime bitches, told y'all before we import those
Jury stay froze, court cases get closed
Niggas hate Nino 'cause how fast I roast them
Like George Jefferson and em, steppin on em

Minkal monk stars, I come in cat, invades Mars
Hallyed at a sanctuary, first dent placed upon entry
Fainted when the book mentioned me
Keep ballin, new systems, high sciences
Drop that, Ghost listenin, the track sizzlin
Angelica, Judey Plum for bitches, Goines king of the century
Best sellers, but niggas stay together
Posted up trucks, leanin on the Benz
Cinemax smile shot in thrity-five lens
You program, broke bottles of Dom
Seven inch bangles, back breakers
I'm a dope feed, look at my art, Popeye strength
Rap with a British accent, Gucci clothes
Dennis Coles in the latest fashions
Blow backs in, flip raps like forty-eight bundles
Dinner plates, deadly front gates, celeb Brian Gumble
(Hell Razah)
Interlapse this in like Deniro, words in your center earhole
Blocks of ice like Sub-Zero, we been right since day zero
Shatter your soul like glass windows
Turn verses to nymphos, pop these hollows at fake cats in a Tahoe
Wild out, throw your liquor bottles at hood rats to the richest models
We conversate like Christ and the twelve apostles
Livin' life without you, can't count you as great men
Murderers in the state pen', bein caged in
The wage is a sin, before they read up they pop our tape in
You ain't gotta tuck you chain in 'cause here we want the head of Satan
Durags and our pants hangin'

Yeah, assorted flavor Clarks
No doubt
The beer champ
Yeah, curly head kid
Yo, yo, yo
From Gators to blazers, low fades and razors
Big dick saloon, I contact the womb; the black asian
Which location keeps circulating
I want the twin power after day shit on his mason
A God steam represent the gummy with the green
Who walk fiend stand up on your block and burn a bean
Sir Ballentine, lookin' at this bitch walk behind
The thing that's fucked up appeal us that's wine
They turn around take my last pull off the L
These niggas on the block keep looking at me well
But they want the jewel it ain't hard to tell
I'm recognize his face, he actin' like Denzel
But fuck him, I went to check low for chop
On a ball gone the size like faith up top
Now it's a whole new ball game, strategic mind frame
My dialogue's rebellious raid and razor fame
Glass out a red light, see Killah get on a ninja bike
Show my love to the God he peeled out and made a right
(Sound of speeding motorcycle)
When you walking down the street with your - Box in your hand
And you bringing the music of the - Wu-Tang Clan
And you hear Ironman on your - radio rapping
Your feet start the dancing and your - hands start the clapping
(Verse Two: Street)
Street's running through your dancehall gunning
Like Lee Harvey Oswald stunning slapping MC's with summons
For pumping - that watered down substance
Beef there's slugs finger creeping
Making moves like Crying Freeman
Prince of thieves, earth's third seed
Heavyweight like golden fleeces homicides stroll the street
If Luther preached it, look at the thugs holding heat
In the city beef got me plotting trilogy
To the smoke enemies sneak attacks I'm beyond and above that
Seen that done that, respect black
I catch a slug to your hardhat
Lounging in the everglades, surfing the airwave
Catch a buck fifty where the razorblades swiftly
Shaolin cats be shiesty, strictly
Drunk off the Irish whiskey
(Verse Three: Method Man)
Rest your headpiece on this one sun
Cough up a lung
Sleeping on my murderous type ones I get you done
I'm looking at these cuthroat kids and how they live
It's like we was partners in spades and you renege
Can't fuck with no nigga like that he get me jack
Or sent back, meaning whole life fade to black
I'm looking in the half of right and roll tight
Fool me once but can't fool me twice, I'm 25
To life on this mic device ain't nothing nice
A mixture of long wild rice and no spice
Inflicted, rap addicted, track I stick it, flip it
Daddy long dick-ed, slide
A little bit beyond twisted, mind in stitches
You thought weak but meant wicked
Niggas choke off my second hand smoke lifted
Everyday is like my birthday I'm mad gifted, dead calm
Hit me with the eighteen bronze, buddah palm
About to blow like Napalm, before your arm
Prepare for the warfare, or buy a share
Oh what the fuck we dealing with, yeah
Johnny about to go there
Need another year
Bust a shot for my sons that didn't make it here"

Take me across her lap, she used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad
Bad
Picture me snotty nose sittin' on my aunt's lap
The kid like 5 or 6 shit I will curse back
I got it from the older folks sittin' in the living room
Everybody had cups stylistic song boom
But then came Darryl Mack lightin' all the reefer up
Baby caught a contact I'm trying to tie my sneaker up
I'm missing all the loops strings going in the wrong holes
It feels like I'm wobbling, look at all these afros
Soon as I thought I was good the joke's on me
I heard a voice ""get in the room, I get angry""
Sting my feet catch a tantrum
Spit, scream, fuck that
Momma shake me real hard, then get the big gat
That's called the belt help me as I yelled
I'm in the room like (panting)""huh, huh, huh"" with mad welps
Ragged out, bad belt yes her presence was felt
Then get my black ass in the bed it's time crash out (crash out)
Despite the alcohol, I had a great old Mama
She famous for her slaps and to this day she's honored
But when I was a lil dude her son was a lil rude
I picked the peas off my plate and pour juice in her nigga food
Get beat, then I'd run and tell grandman ""mama hit me for no reason""
She whipped me hard when I finished eatin
And felt that belt stingin after I wet that bed
Hid my drawers and start cryin, when she felt that bed
Caught another when I told her those the fake pro-keds
In the corner weavin and screamin trying to block my head (ah!)
Nowadays kids don't get beat, they get big treats
Fresh pair of sneaks, punishments like have a ceas
Back then when friends and neighbors would bust that ass
And bring you back to your momma she got the switch in the stash
That's back to back beatings
Only went outside for free lunch with welts on my legs still leakin yo"

Yo bitch I fucked your friend, yeah you stank hoe
I seen her on the elevator, honey grabbed my Kangol
She put me on to mega-shit, bout to slap the bitch
She shot crazy verbal, I leaned back like I'm rich
It took place late night on February 17th
Hands flooded like ink, my face on her magazine
Just got back from Honolulu, pockets stackin boucoup cash
Girlfriend sipped the Yoo-hoo and laughed, yo
While I was on tour, whore, you went to work
Quick fast, had a nigga dick in the dirt
You couldn't wait just to kidnap the bait of my sperm
Where's you at, hoe? 'Pinky house, she put in my perm'
That's all you ever said to me, thought that could hold me
Remember when I long-dicked you and broke your ovary?
You crab bitch, chickenhead hoe, eatin' heroes
I'm the first nigga that had you watchin flicks by DeNiro
You gained crazy points, baby, just bein with God
Taught you how to eat the right foods, fast, and don't eat lard
I gave you earth lessons, I came to you as a blessin
You didn't do the knowledge what the God was manifestin
You sneaky fuck bitch, your ways and actions told it all
I fucked you while you was bleedin, held you down in malls
Sexually you worshipped my di-dick like a cross
I had you fiend out, broke out, for a month you fell off
You was my main shit, my peeps showed you love on the strength
You saw how I got down, the way I thought had you tranked
But you had to fuck this rasta-head ass nigga
I shoulda slapped ya but the Gods said chilllllllll
That's your wiz fault, god, handle that in the lab""
I'm wonderin how many times your hot ass got stabbed
You dumb bitch, horny hot fuck from out the mountains
Your clientele is low hoe, catch you next show, bro
I got jerked, gave away my pussy, that shit hurt
It feel like somebody died or shot your old Earth
But fuck it, I fucked you on a chair with three legs
Broken tables, had you screamin while you was bitin on my cables
Whistlin to the washing machine, I threw it on spin
If your pussy dry, spit on my dick and put it in
My dick's the bomb baby, marvelous hot steak
Plus I'm conceited Starks make the biggest so-called rape
I'm God, cipher divine love my pussy real fine
That means clean the FDS smell with a shine
Word up, respect that hoe"

Intro: Method Man
It's on...
(Where your sparkle at kid)
Ryzarector
Break: Raekwon the Chef
Yes the shit is raw, comin' at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)
Verse One: U-God
This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam, non-diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback, Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze, Buddha palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mean stream be the theme
Supreme team, America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome
And split the bone, wig blown off the ledge
By the alleged, full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc (ious) hand held trigger cuts
Acapella spitting shell paralysed when you get touched
And critical, mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, hand held tote
Break: (first two lines)
Verse Two: Ghostface Killer
More than thousand times one, snatch up, my styles get done
I hold a title, enhanced how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew, drew like an epic
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more games than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of, hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks like a vulture
Ghostface and Madison Square is on your poster
Break
Verse Three: Masta Killa
Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That throws more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy shows, it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learned how to
Fuck up your anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
They're hugging mics with the grips of a python
Break
Verse Four: Cappadonna (Cappachino)
You heard of the rasp before but kept waiting
For the sun of song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravaganza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap niggaz, beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, trying to get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me I cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dreams
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All upon the stage because y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappaccino on the wax
Pass it in your think, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you can long dick hip-hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son fuck what you heard
Niggaz still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire is U.S.S.R.
P.L.O. style got blown out the car
And run over, by the Method Man Jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Cut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
'Cause you ""weak in the knees"" like SWV
Trying to get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbot
Me and RZA riding name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound, and now we out like beers
And blunt power, born physically power speaking
The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching"

I think it happened on a Saturday
I heard the phone ring, ding, ding
Who this? 'Vine yo...
Wise guy killed last night by the Tracks,
It was the same who our niggas teeth up
Sent 'em back, we shoulda thrilled a long time ago
We went this recording, now we owe
The devil slit trough, without an intro
Yo 'Vine, it can't be!
Wise guest-starring me
Can it be, we both got hit
God legendary, he and General
He survived A-dog,
Hard to even picture god eaten by gray dogs
He stayed in his world
And he sidely sweard
To tell the truth, that DeVon was like
""Your out of cure boo""
Wisegod Allah, warrior
XY chromosome, sat heavy on the throne
Touched something for you
Ya stupid fail niggas fucked up
Becouse bitches is talking
They living, I'm twisting
You alleybag
You killed my man, you killed my man
And you sent him back
After this day, watch your hats
Slugs flying everywhere,
You could smell heaven in the air
You can never get the god, yeah
Now I'm cypher,
You've been driving off the same battery
We had, back in '91 that got you hyper
God been beautiful, god been great
God fed you, you died but we survived that day
You killed your king, Rakeem Allah
Gave him his life, he was your offspring
Camouflage dog, days was green
One righteous man fought for his right, gods pupil
Yo, that's my fam, we snatch me out of big head van
We tought you how to get gain, from sayin' ""peace god""
As long we translate Allah's tongue, spit the language hard
Alley thoughts, identical twin
My alias gasanate, the days close,
The days close, how'd you know!
(The Dramatics)
Once the sun comes out and the rain is gone...
I know I'm gonna see, a better day
I know I think I'm crying, because of you
I'm crying, don't want you to see me cry
Love you Wise, love you Wise, love you Wise!
I wanna go outside, in the rain...
It may sound crazy, it may sound crazy
But I wanna go outside, in the rain..."

Yo, too advanced, Digi' stance, made the CD enhanced
I move with the speed and strength of ants
Identical in form with the Beez they swarm
Hold up the cold current appear warm
My first verbal brawl, started on some yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all, break your windshield, your jeep stall
Mr. Traffic, dumbin shit, from ecclesiastic
Cashier, holdin' out, fine, cut off the plastic
See the logo? A monument in hip-hop
Carved out, in the giant landscape, of broken rocks
Whether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops
Uncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot
Spotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare
Heard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare
Walk a road the great length you find too long to measure
My Clan a make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure
No surprise, double disc touched five
Those elements, kept environments colonized
With the high flyin death-defyin flow like the Rebel
Right there, but you're one light year, from my level

Uh-huh... yeah... yo... check it... yo...

He pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat
Three condoms, two dice, one bag of dope
Ooh! Rev. ain't right, his church ain't right
Deacon is a pimp, tell by his eyes

Before you put ya hands on the wall, empty ya pockets
Fix ya face, this a robbery, nigga, respect the juks
Stop shaking, you making me nervous, I know that you shook
The fuck is that sticking out from under ya foot?
Move, turn ya head around, nigga, you better not look
Stacks, you hiding from Tone? I'll shake, rattle ya bones
You killed him! Nah, hit him with the back of the fucking chrome
In the dark, yo, I do this alone
That's the reason why I don't shake hands, in case I gave you a phone
That's a buck fifty, long hickey, when I strike I do it quickly
Creep up on my victims swiftly, make it hard for you to stick me
'Cause if we shoot it out, 'cause if I die tonight you coming with me
Bitch-ass nigga, eat through ya chest like some fucking whiskey

BOY! Gut him like a pig in the dark

Get to sticking niggaz for the right prices
BOY! Yeah, this is priceless... GET 'EM!

Black mags in lobbies, with red dots, to detach the body
If you a boss, why ya cash is sloppy?
This a Staten Island burglar gang, ock, not no Ave could stop me
I'm on the road, not no massive robbery
When it come to that dough, it over flow like paper bag tsunamis
I take shit, lumberjacks and Tommy's
Niggaz passing out bombs like Culpepper, so I pass behind 'em
My black glove, black mask, requirements
Sent the order to Trife Dies', and he gon' send 'em fast, they flying in
These cowards couldn't clash our lion's den
That forty-four mag'll twist ya aves and the cav you flying in

Empty 'cause my staff is hiring
Canine dogs with felonies duck fast when firing

Aiyo, we carry arms like a octopus
Shorty's strapped with the mac inside her pocket book
Blowing all lots of kush
Dark tints on the V so the D's can't spot the crooks
Just throw ya hands in the sky, don't try to stop the juks
Face down, lay on the ground, no sudden moves
Yo, then, take off his Timbs and get the work out his shoes
Rip off the pockets out his shoes, make sure he come out his used
I hear sirens, plus the cameras is watching, it's time to move
If you lolly-gagging, word to mama, I'll body bag 'im
Leave his frame riddled with holes, looking like Gotti had 'im
Bragging, juked, in the wagon, laughing
We slid a few blocks down, this kid was frozen
With stones so we decided to yapp 'im
I put the tool in his mouth, said ""You don't want the action
These ain't E pills, nigga, these is fuckin' aspirin

Tryin' to focus up and make progress
That's what I get for slingin' in them projects

Told her my story and like this I had her legs in the ceiling
Cookin' me fried fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits
While she doin' this, the bitch still slidin' on lipstick
Now I got the fat stomach on, she crackin' a dutch
I'm playin' with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck

Bustin' in here on the government shit
Got this chick screamin' grabbin the sheets tryin' to cover her tits
She's asthmatic and you laughin' son
I bump my toe on the nightstand just runnin' tryin' to grab the gun
Shit's real man, you spazzin' dun
There comes a time in a man's life, he gotta toss his pack and run
You know we family like Crack and Pun
But Mr. GFK, state your business after that be one
Now can it be that you hot lord?
You did some shit on the block that the cops tryin' to lock you for?
Can't believe you blowin' the spot lord
My chick is buggin', she trippin'
My dick keep slippin' out my boxer drawers
Now I'm caught up in the drug sting
Niggas is callin' my horn, police is hittin' every corner we on
Can't understand it, it's a thug thing
And in the moment of thought, I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon
(Raekwon)
I need my money Meth, gonna by them hundred birds
Tell Tone get at me, all them little clients want work
He know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter of fact beep me
Word to mother lord, son he got me hurt
You still fuckin' shorty? I knew it
The big mouth broad that be yolkin' my balls out
Her little brother wanted two bricks
You know the nigga licks, a Maybach on twenty-six
All he do is get money, hustle, he's a dick
He told me foul shit, wild shit
That nigga wear a lot of loud shit, no that Steve Rifkind style shit
Hit me with some other talk, him in New York
They robbed the Venezuelan niggas, stabbed his son with a fork
That was Jesus' rooster's little niece, little nooses
Father's homeboy, that's the kid who gave us a boost
He gave them things on the arm, said for us to be calm
And if some beef pop off, go ahead and ring the alarm"
261,You Know I'm No Good,2006,More Fish (2006),,Ghostface Killah,"(Amy Winehouse)
Meet you downstairs, in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull T-shirt
You say, why did you do it with him today?
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray.
(Ghostface Killah)
Yeah, yo, why you acting like you more trouble than Tony Starks and
You need to just 'walk away' like Kelly Clarkson
I know, we was free to sleep around town
But I figured you said that, that's how I get down
Nah of course, you was out there, messing around
I would of told you, once you go Ghost, you never go back
Try G'ing me, like I don't know how to mack
I'm a don, and, top of the line, I stay flying
Stop trying, to keep cuff analyzing
Using my credit cards to buy diamonds
We need to straighten this out, get to the bottom of it all
Let's crawl, before we start the war
Begin with two reasons why we need to talk
And stop popping up in my cribs all over New York
And, that's stalking, you such trouble and no good
Them fighting words in my block, when we in the hood
(Chorus: Amy Winehouse (Ghostface Killah))
I cheated myself, like I knew, I would...
I told you, I was trouble...
And know, that I'm no good
(Interlude: Ghostface Killah (scratched up))
You had to be a nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl, nasty girl, try to play me
(Ghostface Killah)
Aiyo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
He that lame, you love how I bring the pain
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name (Ghost!), that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we goin' toast
(Interlude: Ghostface Killah (scratched up))
You had to be nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl, girl...
You can't leave the kid... can't leave the kid...
Don't worry, I'ma be around forever, nasty girl...
Don't forget, I'ma be around forever, nasty...
Don't forget, I'ma be around forever...
(Amy Winehouse)
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we we're again
I'm in the tub, you're on the sink
Lick your lips, as I soak my feet
(Ghostface Killah)
Yo, get the bath and body works, pumping your spice creams
Together like Cheech and Chong, we make nice dreams
Fight scenes, I take the good with the bad
'Cause you give the best brains that I ever had and
Anything worth having is hard to keep
I love you like my coffee so hot and so sweet
So let's, stick it out, so we never regret it
I could forgive the past, but I never forget it
(Outro: Ghostface Killah (scratched up))
Got to forgive the past, but I never forget it
Nasty girl... nasty girl... try to play me
Nasty girl, you had to be a nasty and try to play me
Nasty girl... try to play me, try to play me
Nasty girl, got to forgive the past, but I never forget it..."
