If you niggas ain't ready for war, then what you got guns for,
If you niggas ain't ready to put 'em up, what the fuck you say you thug for,
An once more, I'd advise your ass, had to get caught in a scuffle, 'cause more than a couple of fellas they get rough or we step in a mud hole,

(Verse 1: Boss)
Big ballin bitch like Boss come through like it ain't no thang
Paper chase, hustlin nothin' changed
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
Don't hustle the fame nigga, most of the game
Put it down in the street for mine
24/7, stayin on the grind
For days and days I shell at the cops
Enough grenades to get at the block
I'm a drug smuggler
Part bitch, part thug, part hustla
You lift my crib and I'm touchin ya
No love for ya, draw blood from ya
Cause a nigga like you dreamin' to Boss
And you fiendin to floss, and who pounds is flown
We're bustin' motherfuckas with the black game
Holdin' them fiends and lovin' my crack, in the front got bud in the back
Who can get more thugga than that?
From hookers and jacks, put the house up, bitch
I'm bustin' the gat
(Krayzie)
Y'all niggaz always testing, gonna make me pull this weson
(Boss)
If money ain't the answer rephrase the question, dawg
(Krayzie)
Big Boss and Krayzie Bone is...
(Verse 2: Boss)
Runnin' up in your town with an uncountable amount of numbers of mongols
Y'all mad we the real number owners
Rollin' like big, Thugline nothin' but runners
Trouble Boss, a double cross
A nigga named Krray they good as dead
From the b-o-double, doin' double time
And these tricks comin' up to bread
(Chorus: repeat 2x)
We on some thugga shit
We on some other shit that you ain't fuckin' with
The thuggin' don't stop
And you can't touch the clique
You know you love this shit
Take it to what we spit
The thuggin' don't stop
(Verse 3: Krayzie)
I heard a silent motherfucka creepin' up from behind ya
Bet ya didn't think that I'd find ya, huh?
With a nine or pump (pump, pump, pump) your shit'll be fucked
And I ain't even popped the goddamn trunk (trunk)
I bet they never saw a nigga bring the heat and be so cool
Freeze everything, nigga don't move
You can choose to be a fool and try to get away
But never make it out the room when the pump go BOOM!
Fuckin' 'em up, scream ""fuck the world"" while I cuff my nuts
Real niggaz don't lie, hit 'em in the mind, every time goddamn we live
Send 'em to the graveyard, who gonna save y'all?
Matter of fact motherfucka who paid y'all
You runnnin up on them niggaz you know gonna bust back?
Take no more shorts fuck that (fuck that)
Pistol control, we roll streets of the all know
If they run up I'll pop get your hand out my pocket
For the glock, glock shot 'em all on the floor
You dealin' with some motherfuckin real niggaz
Thrill niggaz, we'll kill niggaz if they wanna kill me
Still runnin' with the AK-47 ain't shit changed
Still got the same artilary
Bust at them bastards (bastard)
Me and Boss steady breakin it off in they asses (in they ass)
Wanna see me get glasses (glass)
'Cause I be all in your face but you walk right past me (past me)
But that let a niggaz know they don't really wanna swang them thangs
Fuckin' wit them thugs, the thugs... nigga the thugs, what?
(Chorus: repeat 2x)
(Verse 4: Boss)
Bare witness to Mrs. Gangsta
We're gun-toaters, blunt smokers, big bank folders, and high rollers
Quick to burn off into toaster for fun, this bitch
Judges wanna post as gorilla
Pimps, killers, and soldiers roll
You don't slip and we thought that we told ya
Know what Thug Luv nigga to bone ya
They can run your shit and bend a corner, scatter and spread
Like mustard jam them buzzards up and leave 'em smothered
Quick friends gats find ya like bookie and they down with me like fo' flat
Y'all niggaz got nuts, our niggaz got nuts
So we can go nut for nut see who first to crack and split
Like ya down like wipers
'Fore the motherfuckin piper pay the bitch
(Verse 5: Krayzie)
You motherfuckas feelin' to feel it
Thugline put it down keepin' it the real it
And I ain't really trippin' of these niggaz
They say they gonna get me yet they miss me
(What?) 'Cause I've been here niggaz thuggin'
Waitin for you motherfuckas to come bring it to me
Fuck waitin I'ma mingle with it
The nine millimeter and plenty more haters
If any more niggaz roll up put the cut I'm fuckin' 'em up
When I hit 'em with the pump don't duck you gonna die
Fuck you, die, buck you, die
Reload, unload one more time
Hit him with the pump make sure he dead
He bled blood, we bail
Ask me if a nigga prepared for war hell yeah

2,All I'm Hearing,2005,Gemini: Good vs. Evil (2005),,Krayzie Bone,"All I'm hearing on the radio
Same thing
And all I'm seeing in the videos
Same thing
Same old song far from original
Gotta maintain
We'd just like a breath of fresh air so here we blow
You feel a cool breeze,
Prepare for the coming of the new breed, true g's
More than just irregular little different than ordinary
Whatever you want I got styles and you know they vary
Sick of hearing the same thing on the radio,
Sick of seeing the same scene in the video,
Everybody wanna be like somebody or look like somebody
You just need to be yourself (I'ma tell ya)
Half these niggas I'm payin'
They been bitin (bitin)
They just sit back watch and plot'cha and try to bite'cha (bite'cha)
They keep eatin my shit up so I guess they like it (like it)
Niggas try to hang wit Bone
So you hear the same songs (the same songs... the same song...)
Here we blow, here we blow,
See this is dedicated to the ones that run they rhyme
See time after time after time after time (hey!)
This is dedicated to the ones that run they rhyme
Say time after time after time after time (hey!)
You try a little bit of dis you won't want none of that
You really really wanna hit?
Nigga dis where it's at
They feel it anyway I bring it
Can sing it or rap
They try to follow my footsteps but get lost in my tracks
One and only, thuggish ruggish, Bone
Dogs just wanna see us but they clones
You don't really wanna see me nigga, go on
Man, when I turn on the radio today, you know what I'm sayin', it's like, it's like man, I'm hearin the same thing over and over again, you know what I'm sayin' constantly being drilled with the same style, with the same, with the same beat, with the same everything, you know? it's like a lot of things done changed about the music cause the music game ain't original no mo'. everybody's tryin' to ride the bandwagon, everybody's trying to do what this person's doing, you know what I'm saying, ain't nobody trying to take the time to be creative and go about it the hard way and really earn a hit. instead, everybody just wanna jump on the bandwagon on what's selling, or you know what I'm sayin'? ""this what's selling right now at the time, this what kinda song I'm gon' make"". you know what I'm sayin', with me, its totally different man, whatever it, whatever's going on out in the music business right now or on the radio, whatevers going on, or whatever style is poppin', that's what I try to stay away from. I try to be, I try to be a innovator and a creator, I try to lead, I try to be a leader, and I try to do my own thing, you know I'm not tryin' to nobody, 'cause I believe I got enough skill and enough style to hold my own, with anything..."

(Krayzie)
The Time has come
Let us unite, Mount!
(Thug Queen)
My heavenly father;s children
(My haevenly father)
The time has come for judgement
Armageddon
False prophets never blend in
For we are (we are)
Revelation angels descending (my lordy lord) from our sins
No need to pretend
Who provided me oxygen I loved since I began
Prayin' you wash away my sins
Babylon the great has fallen, offsprings of the Wicked One crawl
Fearin' that their lord is calling
Blessed be the sins of the Almighty
Destunation of any others: burn eternaly, and waste in heat
(Krayzie - 5X)
Oh look what we've been done
What have brung, brung, brung?
(Souljah Boy)
It's Armageddon pay attention
You better recognize the ends is coming
You'll be wishin' it wasn't time to die
'Cause I can see and I can feel it
It's all in my bone
And ain't no tellin' when you living
You're dead, you're gone for sure
We go through this war I thought you knew
It's time to recruit
And you, and you, you better be prepared to shoot
So look out, boy
(And you're runnin', and you're coming)
(Krayzie)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, no-no, not the evil system
Armageddon bring new kingdom
Hey tell me where you're runnin' to
'Cause when I find you you're marked by the beast, so you're not a survivor
So it's time to die, kiss ourselves goodbye
The whole world bites the dust, couldn't live while corrupted up
(Souljah Boy)
Enough get up, and get youselves together
Get your kids 'cause they're rebellion got to learn 'em with a lesson
It's taught
You're brought caught up in your web
And it's your fault got no pulse
Armaggedon will have you broke off
But still you don't wanna learn, learn
Standin' too close to that fire, get burned, burned
(Krayzie)
Muder is coming to ge us, believe me
It's seekin' to find your future
The feeling I get when it's creepin'
Now police have been killin' (?) us (?) to ger rid of us
What you want?
I'm sick of the world, putting us all in coffin'
But y'all don't feelin' me now
How silly can we be?
It's judgement day as we speak
And it ain't no other road, no
Death is the only way to go
So murder is comin' to get us, pin us, all within time
Armageddon, -geddon, -geddon
(Chorus - Felicia)
Armageddon
The end is coming
You better get ready for Armageddon
(Krayzie)
Armageddon
Destruction rollin' over us in murderous ways, killin' you everybody
See did anybody pray?
But it's much tool late
If you have not been told on Judgement Day
Bloddy fate and you can't say "" Wait!""
Could you imagine seeing life end and I mean your life just flashing
Poof, gonna do?, gonna do?
Do you wanna live the rest of your life?
Or do you wanna die with the rest of your life, life?
Somebody calling me telling me ""You better get up, the end is comin""
It's comin' they comin', and yes I believe it, I know it
I know it's near!
Look here, ha you ain't trying to be outside when the sun no longer shine
That's right, that's right, that's right
Now look at you burn
We're lost fallin' from the ground, law free we are
Freedom from po po, we don't need 'em no more
And I hope you catch the first blow
(Souljah Boy)
I'm flipping much praise to the lord above me
No one can change that
I know the difference between life and death
And while you lie back thinking your life your gonna live forever
Who put you on that level?
It was a lie would be nice
Souljah Boy'll treat you better
Never put anything before your children
Honor your mother and father
You're going to live forever in the Kingdom, peace
The Maker, he got somthing for us
He gave us life y'all
And he's gonna have to destroy us, gonna break us off
(Chorus Felicia)
Armageddon
The end is coming
You better ge ready for Armageddon
(Mo Hart)
An there shall be great earthquakes
And the sun becomes as black as sack cloth
And the moon as blood
And the stars of heaven shall fall unto the earth
Even as a fig tree cast her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind
And the heavens, the heavens will depart as a scroll
And it is the roller together
And every mountain and island will move out of their places
And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men
And the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bond man
And every free man, shall hide themselves in the dens
And in the rocks of the mountains
And shall say to the mountain and the rocks
""Fall on us, fall on us
And hise us fro the face of Him that sit upon the throne
And from the wrath of the lamb
For the great day of His (?) has come
And who shall be able to stand?
Who shall be able to stand?
Who shall be able to stand?"""

Hey yo, I'm tired of runnin' these streets, yo
I'm tired of hustlin
Y'all motherfuckers think this is all a game
This shit ain't easy, this is all I know
What am I supposed to do now? huh?
(Chorus: repeat 2x)
Do you know where you're goin' to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?
(Verse 1: LaReece)
It was you and me against the world
We switched the game up
Hustlin forever together before we came up
It changed our paths we went our separate ways
No more ridin' on them niggaz for me, how I miss those days
Swore up and down you was a super thug, so it's told
But had compassion for your foes wit'cha heart of gold
While I was rappin' and singing you started slangin and bangin'
But with money comes greed saw your heart it was changin
Niggaz out on the street, your peeps gettin' covered in sheets
You relied on heat to keep you from suffering defeat
And now you're different like these savages, you're soul golfed out
I know you're hurtin' every time I see your soul from you
You at your crossroads, whatcho gonna do?
Where you going, boo?
Street is watchin just to take your soul from you
Who will feed your seed if you're locked down, or better yet dead?
Did you live your life to the fullest when you take your last breath?
Do you know?
(Chorus: repeat 2x)
(Verse 2: Krayzie)
Come follow me into my life, my life, my life
I'm a young hustla
This is to get paid as I stay clean away from bustas
Strugglin is in my blood
Mentality thug, reality I'm fucked up
I gotta go get it my goddamn self, cause ain't nobody about to give me shit
Gotta go out and get the rent pay
So I'ma be out here on this block with these rocks and this glock
Until I profit could you stop it?
Mama used to say ""but until I see it better, it got to be this way""
And it don't look like I be going nowhere, nowhere
Looks like I'm stuck in this here ghetto
Even though I done got this dream of being famous
This is really short, and if I don't make it by the end of the year
Shit's feelin' to be changin I'ma be dangerous, bangin' nigga's brain
Nigga, I'ma start sharin my pain and bang
Hey, this shit we do for the dollar, dollar bill y'all
So, before I get killed y'all
I gotta make better ain't tryin' hustle forever, ever
(Chorus: repeat 2x)
(Verse 3: Young Dre)
God, please I know you see me livin' better that this
But, truthfully it's hard for Dre to comprehend 'cause it's cheddar to get
If I don't hustle I can't eat
So in these streets it's you and me
Takin' these fair penitentiary chances
Plus some real finances that'll (?) me and my fam to better circumstances
Rider quote ""man even though I know I know how this game go""
Got the green light for cash and I can't let time pass
Gotta grabs mines reality's a mutha
Tryin' to hold on to all my survivin thugs brothas
See, this life'll make you sharp and hard two clenched fists for the struggle
Ride for my thug nation that love to hustle hard
With slugs from berettas, doing dirty business
Some niggaz still can't get together collecting figgas
Make it impossible to hustle forever
But life's a struggle we gonna survive until something come along better
Riders!

Look at the fire way down to the wire
The ones who aspire we knowin' it's been written fo' sure
Steady descriptors and watch cause the signs of the times have arrived
That's been written it's been prophesied
Look at everyone runnin'
The end of the world is the commin better repeal or you love-us a money
We party overtime, no more evil paradise
Babylon fall down, can't cha feel the thunder in the sky?
And yes we all in time
See the revelation as as it starts to unwind
And yes we all will try to make it through the gate but some won't get by-ee-eye
Apocalypse is about to get raw we already made it through the war
Demons is lurkin' they schemein' steady workin'
There tryin' to cope my pistol before they won't breathe know more, mmm-more mmm-more
The bible already tells us not to put our trust in man
And those who take heed to that wise council will not be delusional
When the government fails to deliver on it's promises
Or when charismatic leaders fall from grace
They lookin' for a kingdom...
Who's better suited to fit the kingdom than that of our mighty lord and saviour Jesus Christ?

11,Don't Know Why,2005,Gemini: Good vs. Evil (2005),,Krayzie Bone,"I want to hurt you I don't know why (4X)
Woke up this morning in a cemetery kinda weary
Looked over my shoulder and I seen somebody just been freshly buried
Was kinda scary 'cause my shirt was soaked in blood man
Shovel in my hand so I had to be the one that dug that
But I had no knowledge
I don't remember even leavin' the house man
Can't explain how I got here
It's like I was walkin' but I was unconscious
But I had to be wallin
'Cause I seen the bloody machete ah
It was used on the victim to shred him up
Oh my god don't tell me I... Oh shit
Something's going wrong I don't know what's going on
All I know was I was home then I woke up here alone
Wondering who was in that hole I ain't stickin around to know
My mind is blank and I'm so cold and I don't know which way to go
Runnin' in the rain
I'm barely breathin more like wheezin
Runnin' in the rain
How could this be what I was heavin
I made it to my house I closed the blinds and shut the door
Somebody please tell me what's going on 'cause I don't fuckin' know
Jumped in the shower washed the blood from off my body
Rolled up a blunt I'm feeling psychotic mixed me up some ginentonic
But I'm nauseous feeling woozy like I'm in the twilight zone the movie
How did I do it how did I get through it
And I wondered if anyone knew what I was doing
Sat down and clicked on the tube
Flipped to the news I'm trying to find answers
Whos body is on my hands and how did the situation get so drastic
Its madness
And I just can't take no more I passed out
Couldn't help but crash out from last night I'm dashed out
Slept for a minute but I didn't sleep to long before
I was awakin by some heavy bangin' on my door
It was the popo 'cause inside they shined their flashlights
Gotta funny feeling this has something to do with last night
They tried to tell me that I'm wanted for kidnap and murder
Tellin' me they got proof that I murdered my ex-employer
Don't think my lawyer can help me with this one
I grabbed my pistol put the clip in
And I'm out the back window
I'm gone."

Like that since I was born. Yes, I can run, but I can't hide. Gon' be like that
Until I'm gone, gone. Drama always seems to find me, find me, find me.
Roll down-a my family tree with me. Keep flippin' the page to page--see nothin'
But strugglers. I never knew no hustlas like my daddy and mama. So I gotta drop
My Pz, but I think way back in the day now, when Moms and Pops had my back. They
Stayed down and gave us a place to lay down. But then, then when the wind blew
In, it threw in a crackpot. But lately, it's keepin' my people up off the
Hinges. Can I get a witness baby? And I'm out the door, gots to go make me some
Money on my own. Somebody tell me now where we went wrong. God, bring my family
Back because they long gone. It's on. Now Pops don't even come around, but I
Know Pop's got problems. That's why your little nigga's still down with ya. But
It hurts to see your family takin' a beatin'. My sisters keep sayin' they
Hungry--gotta come up on some way to feed 'em. Big Will, Rod J, take a ride,
Slide down '71, callin' welfare. When the check came, Mom, she hounds everyone.

Spit back flames. Front page article, all the police could find of them bitches
Was particles for fuckin' with me. And I'm down to stand on the frontline to get

Niggaz for they self, no love
And it ain't nothin' better than a gun in hand
(Verse 1: Krayzie)
I'm lookin' at all my niggaz on the corner still trying to come up on something
Like some paper, cash money
Two-double-o-zero, niggaz is desperate to make it
Battlin Satan, but the plate that he made us looks so tasty
Temptation over took my devils persuasion
Makin' me chase the paper while trying to break 'em, I blaze 'em
Then I raise up, nigga that's the way thugs do it
See it don't say nothin' just to find out we kinda stupid
In the streets we play for keeps
Niggaz ain't comin' back for revenge or whatever, loc
We havin' none of that, so scandalous
You better keep your protection
Cause the grass and the blunts ain't the only thing we wet up
(Verse 2: Krayzie)
See, I've been runnin' from the po-po ever since I was 11
Nigga bellin, ain't tryin' to get kept and slept in the cell, man
A lot like my daddy, but then again I'm like myself
Keep my nose in my business and worry about nobody else
Got a mind of my own aside from Bone
So nigga don't think that you can run up and test me when I'm alone
'Cause I got the chrome
Talk mo' shit I'm still a street thug, but I make mo' hits (mo' hits)
Platinum packin magnum never leave the house without it
And if he 'bout it don't sing about it nigga bring up out that shit
Thugline, frontline
Nigga it ain't scared, we done time
Leatherface is on the rampage, murder mangler, strangler
What you came with it just ain't enough
To tame the thug, we aim to drain the blood from your skull
Rappin' but we dangerous, dangerous

Now to my youngsters with they guns
Out on the corner perfomin tryna to be soldiers
Just remember that I told ya, slow down, down, down
I know you wanna be a thug, and do what we done
But if it ain't inside your blood then this ain't the game that you tryin' to
Play
Just like one of my niggaz tried to hang, and he died in a day
Awww, shame, shame, shame
Bullet hit him in the brain
And he was a thug nigga, you get the picture?
Picture niggaz in a single file line
All crying, upset because their niggaz died, nobody know why
It's so many dying cause too many trying to shine
We all trying to swang on the same godamned vine
It's about that time for the thugs to unite
And let this motherfucka burn tonight (tonight, night)
If you a thug get up and join this thug nation (thug nation)
We got guns waitin (guns waitin)

Mama been laid off
She ain't workin no mo'
Papa been laid off
He say things done got slow
My brother's been laid off
He been locked down for more than two years now
(Verse 1: Krayzie)
My world is crumblin, time is hard they were before, but oh my god!
Mama mad at pops 'cause he ain't workin
But today she lost her job
Now what in the fuck is we suppose to do?
We on our last loaf of bread
Got cereal, but no milk, Kool-Aid, no sugar, what the hell?
And here come Mr. Billcollector beatin' down our door for dough
Mama say when they come knockin'
Y'all don't say nothin' (shhh) get on the floor
Kind of hard to see att night in a house when it ain't got no lights and shit
No gas or water, had to borrow H20 from my relative
Man, it feels like I ain't even here
I'm ready to get up and get all my own, but I got three more fuckin' years
Nigga 15, with a big dream to make it on out this ghetto
But the devil won't settle, fuckin' up my levels he won't let go
I'm livin' to die it seems I just can't win
Now I'm high, but I'm stopin to realize I drunk this whole fifth of Gin
(Nigga damn!) I'm 17 and drinkin' like I'm grown up
I got some problems, plus I need some money
And it's really all because...
(Verse 2: Krayzie)
Juvenile nigga done strugglin, hustlin, strugglin like I want it
Then fuck school, right now I'm hungry, and I can't eat that damn diploma
But on this corner I can eat everyday, all I gotta do is slang this yay
Nigga, If business keep going this way me and my family is fin to be straight
I'm glad I took that fifty dollars that grandma gave me
Bought me a double up, now it's all about comin' up
I'ma pay ya back next week
Repeat, took my ass straight to the block with hand full of rocks, y'all
And it's my first time I'm lowin, watchin for cop cars
By the end of the night a nigga sold all the rocks
I'm trippin' out lookin' at all the dough I got
I shoulda been came a sold the block and locked it
Made me some profits, so nigga tonight my people gonna be eatin on lobster
Hate to say it, but I think these streets done really created a monster
Cause now that I see how quick I can come about breakin the law
Why in the hell is you steady tellin' me to go and get a job?
Fuck that, nigga this my thing right now I know
I'm walkin' home happy, smilin', and I ain't even thinkin' about...
(Chorus: repeat 2x)
(Verse 3: Krayzie)
Business was boomin so a nigga assuming I could do some improving
Like new jewels, clothes, shoes, Cadillac Coupe, I'm out here doin' it
Got me a cold ass broad, and that's something I never had
But I'm never mad 'cause I done snagged one bad one with my young ass
Once I turned 18 it was on
But my brother started writing home, tellin' me to leave this shit alone
I say, what? nigga, he don't know that I'm too deep in this
I'm livin' and breathin the street shit
And if I don't play the crook, you ain't gonna have shit on your books
Look, gimme a minute, I'll chill in a minute I promise I will
As soon as I finished this last load
I'ma drop the dice after this last roll
Little did he know, I got no intentions on leavin' this shit here
I'm feelin' to get rich here
When you get out, you'll have some shit here if you still care
Made enough money to move my moms and pops to a new pad
They was suspicious, but they ain't trippin'
Cause this more shit than we ever had
But shit went bad six in the morning crashing through my door was the Feds
And they want that bread we want you, and I'm like ooh! (shit)
Shoulda listened to my brother, huh?
But I'm like fuck it now
Mama got to buggin out when them po po got to cuffin pops
Now I'm in the courtroom when that asked me how I plea
I tell the judge straight up, I've been havin' problems and it's all because...

""Walk it, don't talk it"", I say this time after time
Have the same nerve and courage when we see you outside,
Online, all right
Let's get this party started, spark it
Thug style, showin' 'em love
But we stay heartless regardless
Hit 'em with bomb shit
Better ring the alarm
It's the thuggish ruggish niggas
Bustin' the gauge with one arm
Like Vietnam, the enemies expendable, so fuck 'em
First time we warn 'em
Second time we storm 'em
Nigga, you don't get no three shots
We not playin', and I know they understand
They tried to test the man
But the man was really a man
So it's the plan
Stay heated heavy and ready to die
If not then eat a magnum full of hollow point shots
I'm just tryin' to make my profit,
Get up out of this shit
But until then I gotta cock my shit (I cock my shit)"

Doesn't it feel good to see us makin' money?
Feel good like everyday's sunny
Feel good see us takin' off?
Doesn't it feel good to see us ball?
And they can't take it from us at all
And if you agree that we don't fall sing ""la da di da da di da di da di da""

Back at'cha, it's the thug with the most droppin' more Thuggish Ruggish on ya
Krayzie keepin' it flaming, so indeed it's fire for ya
Water, don't need none let it burn
Let it be known that it's my turn, let 'em turn
Be concerned with these words I got
Whatever they sayin' about the Line, we better kill 'em
'Cause I got up and I got mine don't mean I'm trippin'
Really left niggaz behind to handle business
They don't understand I'm in it to win it
Thug out with a crowd full of criminals and killers
So pump your fists if ya feel it, hear me
We in it to keep it the realest
With my remige, Thugline team, coming to kill something
Close to 30 million sold and still thuggin', still strugglin
Wassup with Bone? Gotta keep it real, so I tell them I don't know
Can't think no more excuses when niggaz don't show
We came up from poor, and I'm not going back to poor, no!
(Verse 2: Krayzie)
For The Love Of $, I keep it funky
Just thuggin' back down in the ghetto
Sleep in the PJ's they let me so I love 'em back
By keepin' it real, givin' 'em shit that they can feel, like hustlin need more than a mil
Like how to make it on these streets and not be killed â€˜fore you get grown
Let a nigga go on 'cause he chose to live his life wrong
All I know is life is already short
And you can bring your non-exsistance closer if you want
Trust me, you don't nigga, live on, get'cha thug on (thug on)
Make you some cheese, get some weed and go get your buzz on
But must of all you gotta stay sucka-free, them bustas out ya mix
That go for anything you do and they go all to jail, I don't trip
I share a hater to the side, devil ass nigga
Always fuckin' up my vibe, that's right now, nigga
You done meet Krayzie Bone, you ain't meet Leatherface
And I don't think you wanna though, no!

Niggaz in my business like they my bitches, got me hot (so hot, hot, hot, hot)
Run up, touch me, get burned, nigga
Said they saw me at the Source out on the floor, dropped (what?)
Chickenhead bitch from Miami said we was runnin' when the war popped
Hoe stop, you don't know none nigga rollin' with me
What shut you puff? My niggaz hold on the B
For most of them niggaz they want peace when we meet
Like we ain't be hearin what they be saying on the streets
So we gotta bring the heat
Speak if you want, but keep it to a mumble
Speak louder than a whisper, oh and we gonna get'cha
Y'all Don't Know Me, ain't that what I told 'em?
Hope they knowin' these pistols real's that we toat, jokin

So what I wanna do right here is dedicate this to y'all; my dawgs
Yo!
What up my nigga! It's been a minute since I saw ya
I hear your lawyer still tryin' to get that appeal for ya,
Wanted to holla and tell you what's poppin' but you probably
Already know we been going through problems, anyway I
Hear you been exercising and getting strong in tha mind,
I hear you been searching for god inside the Quran,
That's cool man I been prayed up myself;
I pray for my health and stress way less for wealth now
I'm still a soldier but I'm trying to be one for Johovah,
We in tha last days, and tha last days is almost over,
We all older now our minds much stronger now,
I can see in ya letters your vocabulary's broader now,
I wish we woulda been this smart before we let this game rip us apart
And we forgot that God was our heart,
But don't even sweat it, my nigga stay strong
And we gon' kick it when you come home, my nigga Flesh-N-Bone
I remember, remember back in the day, when we all used to hang,

Y'all remember, how we got in this game, we was all in tha same,
But then came the fame, and thangs changed
What up, Lay? Hope you and ya family ok,
I don't know where I should begin because I got so many things to say,
We been dogs since the 7th grade, the 7th grade, struggled together for a better way, and better days,
We was Kid-n-Play, Kriss Kross and all them niggas
They called you the light one and of course I was the dark skinned'd one hey!
Yyou was the human beat box, and I was the rapper, entered battles in between classes
Those days, it ain't the same no more
We don't even hang no more
We let the fame destroy,
Something that's worth way more
Cause friends
Kinda hard to come by
Ain't no telling these days
Shoulda seen it coming ain't no trusting these snakes
But all in all, we had a ball,
And even though we took a fall, it's not for long fa sho!
We'd be some damn fools if we let silly egos come between some damn trues and cause a fam fued
My nigga, my nigga
Wish! My nigga, I can clearly remember
See me and you go way back to that day and night in November (or was it December)
When we was mobbin trying to rob some niggas
And I was high put the slug in the pump and I cocked that nigga
But I had my finger still on the trigger
Oh my God, my nigga!
Screamin at me like ""you shot me nigga!""
And I was shocked my nigga
My ears started ringing I was tweakin
Blood was squirting
You was swerving on tha curb man word man
Rushed to emergency coppers came and arrested me,
Even though you told 'em I didn't do it they cuffin me
You told we was just chillin' and niggas hit us,
Half dead and ain't snitchin now that's tha realest (that was tha realest)
That's why we still down
Its really real now
Make you feel how
We in it to win it with our ill style
You suckas better recognize
Better check it
When Krayzie and Wish hit 'em with Thug Line records, nigga
I ain't forgot about you, Bizzy Bone, what's happenin'?
We was always in some action every night straight to bracklin (?)
Its crackin'
We walked the streets together
Starved and ain't eat together
Slept outside in zero below
Was gon freeze together
I remember I went to tha county
And when I got out, you went bustin' your pistol; nigga you rowdy
Now how did it all of a sudden get so cloudy?
They say Krayzie got problems with Bizzy that why they,
They breaking up
Only problem I had was you running out on the band
But you explained to me deeper and now I understand
So why is niggas beefin when there's cheese to get,
And bread to stack,
And heads to crack?
We got a daily rap
We get together we tha coldest
The realest East 99 soldiers
United we ball, divided we fall
When Bone come back we'll silence 'em all! (for real nigga)"

Keep it locked like you it's only on my mind
And when I'm rollin' in my Benz knowin' you on your grind

As the new world order takes us into the year 2000

As we transform day into night, darkness falls down upon us
We rise from the fog uncomparable to any other form of life
Together we ride by night, unidentified, unseen, unknown
Yes we are the pirates
Our missin' is to destroy enemies by any means necessary
And those who interfere with prosecution for execusion
Shall indeed be terminated any race be gone
For we are the Kneight Riduz

Bloody bodies stacked up in a pile and set the fire
It's the pirates behind all this violence it's not the devil
It's rebellin with my shovel, with my victims lifeless
Tossed over my shoulder as I showed him to his hell-hole
Dead foes to the bottom
Us pirates be heartless my conscious was fuckin' with me I shot him
And got 'em all believe me

We front the underland understand, understand?
We live to die so we fear no man not at all
Everytime we call stay outta the way and outta the dark
And just hope to god, that he'll just come and kill us all
We all gonna dies, it's the ways of life wildest new generation pirates

While momma and daddy got all day and never listen
Now you're drifting away
And blowing all your ambitions away
Don't throw it all away
You're not a name, you're just a number

Wanna hug ya
To stop ya from going under (ah ah)
I know sometimes that we praise this life
But I'm here to tell you that we all paid the price
So move on
And don't believe everything you be hearing on them songs
Cause sometimes the devil can get in there and steer you wrong
Now this is for my ghetto queens in the slammer
Convicted now as criminals
Caged up like animals
These real women
Stuck in this wicked prison system
Look how ya living
You should be home raising your children
But you messing with that sucka that got you hooked on rock
Hooked doing crime
Then he should blow ya mind
And they like come but you can't go home
And all over the world it's the same old song (same song)
Now this one is for my partners doin' they time in the pen
Doin' 5 with a 10 tail
A 25 with an L
Never comin' home no more
End of your life, your life, your life, your life
Finished, guess you paid the price
Can't hug your wife
You can't even kiss ya kids and tell 'em you love em
Want me to comfort em?
And nothing is worse then being nowhere for you loved ones

I gotta take the time to let you shine

So when you roll,
Don't get blowed away and stowed away,
In a box up under that dirt,
Nails in tha coffin just to be safe,
Watch how we play,
Down with the dirty every time we do it
I'm tha nigga rollin' with a gold tec and ill use it
So be choosy and don't be stupid,
Don't walk into it,
When you see the Line rollin' by y'all betta move it,
Now I said excuse me,
Don't make me bust a u-turn and come back with tha uzi,
Turn the scene into a movie,
And you the first nigga dead for the credits even roll up,
I play tha killer in the picture and you know I'm gon getcha 'cause it's my script, duh
Wrote and produced by me, the original t-h-u-g,
When you look in the dictionary for the meaning of thug, muthafuckas should see me
Now nigga did ya see me? (did ya see me?)
Nigga do ya feel it? (do ya feel it?)
If I'm rapping and I'm singin' 'bout a nigga gon kill 'im, gon kill 'im,
Light it and let me hit it,
I bust it at a fuckin' nigga right at him with a pistol or a lyric,
Now you caught up in the middle of the crossfire, and now ya life's in danger,
Get him wrap his neck with some barbwire,
Hang um watch'em dangle,
You can run and hide but we covered every angle,

Put him on the pave
And hey, that nigga that did it was wearin' a Leather Face
And not to be played with
Whatever you claim you better get paid
Shit
If you a pimp nigga, pimp them hoes
If you a thug, you better get ready for war
If you a hustla, make your dough
If you a gangsta, let your gun smoke
(MJG)
Who be I?
The nigga who pimpin'-a plenty of hoes
Look at the size of the bank that he hold
Natural born mind control
False niggas' gang blown away
It makes you wonder why niggas be hatin'
They jealous, they fellas be lookin' to take you under
It seems like the more that we get
You come with that shit
Lookin' for ways to drive us insane confusin' our brain
I'm settin' up traps for rats who snatch cheese
Fly like a trapeze artist
Tell 'em to bring it on I comes the hardest
MJG, pimp, runnin' with Bone dividin the throne
Regardless of niggas who stand in my path I'm bringin' it on
Recitin' the lyrical gift
The shit that give me the bitches, the money, the cars
How do you know when you're goin' too far
?
The further you get, the further you are
Shit, I breaks in half crook niggas
Don't make me laugh
Now, huh, which ones the head and, huh, which one's the ass
?
Where your bitch at
?
Collectin' my cash
Now who would've know that the bitch is a hood-rat
Increasin' my stash, leavin' you fast
You're thinkin' I'm slippin', I'm grippin' the Tech
Look at the bullets
They rippin' his vest open puttin' a hole in his chest
In piece is that nigga decide to rest
I'm leavin' you grievin', believin' in pimpin'
The shit that I got is the shit that I'm given
Constantly livin' that life of a thug
Drinkin' the Hen, smokin' the bud
If you a pimp nigga, pimp them hoes
If you a thug, you better get ready for war
If you a hustla, make your dough
If you a gangsta, let your gun smoke
(Layzie Bone)
Too many fake niggas done tried to contend
And then again, pinned that they couldn't win
Ken took it to the head with a fifth of Hen now I'm in the wind
500 Benzo, we roll, roll
Rod J came through with the Mack-10
Wish trippin' when I pulled out the glock
You know that all of my niggas be ready this pop-pop
Comin' with the heat cocked, 'cause it never did stop
Everybody I know out lookin' for a come up
We creep it's deeper than the way you perceive a thug, no love
Take a nigga through the mud every time I try him from my wordly grudge
What

Erasin' my poverty and I gotsta be that soldier claimin' Mo

Hell yeah, we can meet up at the district

But I'm bringin' the sense of an angel to the table
Watch me put it down for Mo
And them Suave House niggas
So, willin' and ready to make a few dollars and split a few wigs
If that's what it is
You better be mindin' your business or be beggin' forgiveness
You know all I'm sayin' is just don't fuck with me, man

If you a thug, you better get ready for war

Ain't bullshittin, seventeen I'm leavin' the house, I need my own Nigga done
Tried to be grown And fucked around Now I'm homeless on the streets With my

Plottin on shit Oh yes you know this I come from a long line of thugs Us
Strugglers hustle what we can rustle up It might not have been too much But we
Always got just enough, our hard times Kept niggas together through all the
Windy weather And nigga whenever you need somebody to roll I'm goin' to be there,
You know me A nigga stayed thug devoted in the streets When I didn't have a
Place to sleep or shit to eat My family goin' through some pains They struggle

A witness So you know I really can't comprehend it My mother and father told me:
Don't mess with drugs and why you smokin'? I was right or wrong? Can't understand

Jumped right out the car
Ran up in my face/ Before I could even do somethin', my nigga done rushed him
Took his ass to the floor/ Now here comes some more/ Now we got a war goin' on
Tryin' to get back out the door/ And we got our backs against the wall/ Naw, We

Bass from the D.J. went blank/ Everybody runnin' tryin' to get the fuck up out

56,Silence,1999,Thug Mentality 1999 (1999),,Krayzie Bone,"(Intro Repeated-Sin of Graveyard Shift)
Silence is necessary, don't tell them who you are
(Verse 1-Sin of Graveyard Shift)
Formulate a different tactic, let's sing anthems
No sterotypical categorizing, rising above all make shift realities
Fantasies misconstrued the thoughts of wicked men
They cough as lungs inhale, exhale poisonous gases
Oh well, I guess I'll just protect myself in good help
Done played out the wickedest hand man has ever dealt
I felt like dying just the other day 'cause Satan was trying
Walking too close by my side
Stay still, please don't move your soul you could lose
No crying, where's my blood?
You'll find out soon enough
All right I'll ride, in due time we'll get our chance to die
Hold on to my mind
No use for guns or drugs, need mo' love
But yet and still, slugs get fired off constantly
Immorally, destroying my holy oracle
But I just ignore it though
Keep a steady pace just movin slow... slow, just movin slow
(Chorus-Sin of Graveyard Shift)
Silence... silence... silence... silence
(Verse 2-Krayzie Bone)
As I sit in my livin' room, chillin' in my thug mood
I begin to hear noises comin' from the other room
So I pause my Nintendo, then I walk over to the window
Is it paranoia from the indo?
Then goes a thought, then another thought
Run and get the pump, 'who goes there?
What the fuck you want?'
'Cause I'm gone off that blunt and I will buck a motha fucka down
You on my grounds
Hope they got enough of the rounds
All of a sudden I heard a crash
My first instinct was to blast, but the Mauseburg didn't last
So I had to dash, ran upstairs I was franic in panic
But I managed to make it to the top, to my artillery shop
I was runnin', but I could hear the souljah's comin'
I don't they must think I have some money
AK-47 and a Mack-11
Jettin to the bedroom locked myself in, the clip is in
Teach 'em a lesson it ain't healthy to rob
They fit to slip on the job, soon as they twist on the knob
Just like I figured when they twisted it, the AK-47 was hot
I had to drop it but I emptied it
The Mack-11 would hit, hit the niggaz up from head to toe
Had to escape and I was out the window
Here I do, I hit the ground, uh
Then I looked around, shook the fall
Hopped in the Benz and hauled
Callin my niggaz let's get ready for war
I think I killed 'em all but I know that they'll be sendin some more
So when they come back around, I say we show 'em rappin' don't mean a thang
And this is a gun, and this is a grave
Rest in peace you're not feelin' me
Truly Mr. Leatherface, I dedicate thiiis...
(Chorus-Sin of Graveyard Shift)
Silence... silence... silence... silence
(Verse 3-Tombstone of Graveyard Shift)
Fight, movin in the night
Daylight, takin' slow paces might outrun the race
Never wanna rely on murda, enter my life
But life's so strange and hectic all backwards and shelled
The killin' factor in jail
The streets is hell, you can tell by the smell
Off with his head oh well
You know they don't give a damn if that make the weak mind feel the same
It's a shame how they watch you, stalk you
Pinnin every step I make, Knowin' every breath I take
Makin' it easy for the next man to get his hands on a .38
They be buckin on niggaz in these last days
But thanks for the fun
Can't stay focused, causin ruckus
The devil done play with the Earth like a puppet
Now we all in fucked shit
That's why silence is necessary don't tell 'em who you are by far
Don't you tell them... who you are

It's so hard to believe that I'm still living, I'm alive
My clock is still ticking, guessing that God is still with me (with me)

Murda Mo is chasing me I'm bearly escaping it
My instincts is tellin' me that I might not live long in my life (my life)
My life is a jungle I really don't love it it's really to crumble
I fight with these devils on daily basis
And I try to stay humble
Try not to fall, but what if I slip, trip?
Try to stay calm, but what if I flip?

I ran into that little nigga when I seen him in the video
He can tell that we the real ain't for really hoes
Just because you strike a pose
In some pretty clothes
Really don't mean you niggas automatic criminals
You can fool the average joe
They don't really know
How a real nigga let the mother fucking trigger go
We the thuggish ruggish niggas that'll get in ya mind
With the rough and rugged lyrics that'll spit like a nine
And no matter what we give 'em it's a hit every time
But you know that's Bone
That's that Bone

(Krayzie)
I told you nigga you dealing with a beast
From the streets of cleveland down with Eazy E
Niggas give me a reason to keep the heat in the seat
Right in my lap
So I'm in position to bust it back
(Wish)
Guess whos back to shut the lights down
Screaming out thug and no you ain't none
Gotta do something when we seem em
We gon run up on a nigga
Gotta tell me something (something)
(Krayzie)
Take a journey to me violent side
Where riots lie
Hit 'im with the silenced 9
And quiet minds
Its still fuck the law
And any other mother fucker wanna run
Come on
(Wish)
And its easy; it don't take much to make it blow
Before you hear it
You gon feel it
Stay locked and loaded
Thugs like us
They don't make it
Get it straight dog
We roll up
They don't like it when we roll off
(Krayzie)
Mista Sawed off
Creepin' the fog
All y'all niggas die
Competition try
To see me but I doubt they can really get with the lyrical killas from the 99
Spittin' when I ride by
(Wish)
Know what you doin' when step; you can fall off
Hands up
Thugs coming through when we raw dog
Everywhere we go yes it's like that
Everywhere we roll strapped to back
With thugs ready to go

Come, follow me now back in the day/ We still was thuggin', nothin' changed
Always into

Bad-ass niggas
Sneaky, a calm, collected slickster/ I might not have been on the scene, but you

The picture, in the mixture/ Sellin' yayo, scrappin', carjackin', gunpackin'
I'm lackin' everything you
Can imagine so I'm prayin', rappin' they'd get me outta this jam, damn just give
Me a chance
I'll keep 'em dancin' (dancin') all night (all night) When times get harder and
Harder, my dreams got
Further and further away/ And nigga, I chased 'em, but couldn't catch 'em to
Save my life/ So now
I'm thuggin' on this corner/ I gotta increase my financial status/ I chanced it,
Fuckin' with these rollers
When they roll up/ Yeah, don't wanna be locked in no cell, but I also can't take
Strippings
And be broke with no mail/ Oh, yes it's hell, and they say that gets easier
But to me it only got deeper and deeper...

Some money and made a stupid-ass mistake/ Could've been my niggas fate/ Fuckin'

Now he bleedin', I see blood/ Damn, get to the doctor/ Nigga, don't rest in
Peace/ Doctor's took him
To emergency/ Coppers came and arrested me/ Not knowin' if my nigga had made it
Alive and was
Well, I tossed and turned in my cell; annoyed and sweatin' like hell/ Praise to
The Lord, and I hope
You hear me, and I hope you feel me/ I didn't mean to, really, really/ I didn't
Mean it/ I know you seen
It/ I finally spoke to my nigga/ He lifted up, and recovered, and pressed no
Charges/ Wait, the state
Done picked it up, and I gotta trial in a month, fuck/ And the judge ain't
Tryin' to give me no love
'Cause it was my first offense, but he just thinkin' he lockin' up a thug (up a

So now I'm cuffed up on the bus (on the bus) and ridin' down '71/ Ain't no
Fun...

Now I'm locked inside this prison system, bitten, count days left on my
Sentence/ Now I can say
That I've been here, but I sure ain't gon' come back here, uh-uh/ The day they
Release me I'm goin'
Home/ I can cope, but I can't adjust/ These fuckin' steel doors drivin' me nuts
My last month
I'm ready to move out, I'm sure/ Stay on the low; I listen to thug stories and
Be trippin' on niggas
Love stories/ I'm fin to get out of this muthafucker/ Heard 'em call out my
Name; 2-50-2-2-58
""Pack up your shit. It's your day"" Jumped out my bunk/ Give all my shit to my
Niggas/ In fact,
I left everything that I had back in jail but my raps/ I'm on the streets now
Scene unchanged
Niggas still the same/ I ain't fuckin' with you bustas 'cause I'm tryin' to make a
Change/ I got with the real

Out of Cleveland

And that's cause these days you got to be raw out here on the streets
Tell 'em these days you can't be fucking with niggaz that's weak
And these days no telling when you'll meet your coffin
I seen it too often that's why fuck flossing; I take caution
Don't trip, shit if your rich your rich
'Cause if you slip somebody waiting to get
At you grab ya cash and split ya shit
These days stay in the low low and away from po-po
Unless you ready to pull your fo' fo' and blow (OH!)

They claim it but they never qualify for the job
These days we busting at motherfuckers quicker
Simply cause its 1999 nigga (nigga, nigga, nigga)

Get on your knees and pray nigga cause the son of the lord is coming

You know what came in time that's my frame of mind
Now I'm able to separate the deaf from the weak, dumb and the blind
Niggaz can't get none of mine, not even some of mine
Just cause you got on a watch nigga don't mean you know the time
You stagnating, you fags hating my motion
From ocean to ocean my magic potion is devotion
The nerve to hate what I deserve to do wasn't a curse it was a signal
That's why that ass crashed for got to put on your blinker
R-W-I: rolling while infatuated
I graduated, now I want my master
Y'all done agitated disaster
And at every ends I start I slip in the art with my heart and soul
And start to roll but dumb to come
Don't become the one I fold like the lawn chair
You shouldn't have gone there
What's the deal with the long stares?
What's the purpose? Jokers on earth surface to surface
And any problem is handled the same day as service (what what what what)
(Bam)
We run the blocks stop the clocks turning rocks and dice
Set trip it's our spot gave y'all shots and let the drama pop
Don't escalate the 4-5-9 just try me dead or alive
Point of survival let's get points with real niggaz lives
But you only see raw meat on streets; these niggaz love their heat
Nowadays all busters wanna thug like me you see it be
Wasn't way so simple execution style pull the gristle
From the chair heard 'em whistle for my nigga mental
It's money, murder, riding dumping heads back to all of y'all
Since every nigga's all hard and proving they got the bigger balls
Scared of the laws told what he saw and what it lookeded like
Broke him off in the midnight I spared his life I said this shit is tight"

Time after time, find I question my life
Where I went wrong, will it ever be right?
Will I rise? Will I fall? Stand tall
Continue asking, but I'm knowing only God know
(Verse One)
Growing up in the hood as a hard knock
I never knew nothing too much about young
My only concern was making my money and running these streets as a thug
Instead of the birds and bees, I always talk to murderers and the G's
That coldness inside me, but I ain't trying to hurt nobody
Temptation is keeping me steadily going under
And I wonder, if I could make it through the thunder
'Cause I done caused so much hurt and pain to some that ain't deserve a thang
If I could change that, it would all be rearranged
But what's done is done and I paid the price
And now I'm like, Help me Lord, to better my life, my life
Just give me the chance to prove the world that I can be the man that I am
And I plan, on keeping it realer, really slow and steady
(Verse Two)
So now I'm headed to the chapel and I'm fin' to try marriage
It's goin' down yeah, yeah, yeah, but what do ya know?
Who woulda knew that would make situations worse
And my curse, nothing I've tried seems to work
And I drop to my knees and I pray, yes I pray
And I wonder if I'll ever see a better day (I need a better day)
I've seen much in my time and I think it was too much for my eyes
The wickedness pulling me closer to failure every time I think I'm rising, yeah
But you live and you learn and try to make better, gotta get control
Then follow the Lord and who knows where you'll go, for sho'
I can see how I've been sinnin
I'm asking the Lord for a little bit of forgiving, 'giving

(E-40)
Krayzie Bone, E Feezie Fonzareezie
And Gangsta Boo, what
(Krayzie Bone and Gangsta Boo)
It's the endin' of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
(We can't get no)
It's the endin' of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
(Satisfaction)
It's the endin' of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
(We can't get no)
It's the endin' of the world
Motherfuckers ain't got no satisfaction
(Chorus: Krayzie Bone and Gangsta Boo)
We starvin' as we chase the paper
Ain't just a man, nigga, man, niggas hate 'cha
Fuck 'em, get 'cha guns, get 'cha cheese
We got, just a little time left (little time left)
If I'm not mistaken the year is '99
But we don't really know when we 'gone die
But shit, most niggas don't know how they still alive
On this, unmerciful wicked planet
If you can't pay for ya life, ya gonna vanish (vanish)
(E-40)
You're lookin' at livin' proof
Renovated, condemned, duplex, pots and pans, leaks in the roof
Dirty dishes, no dishwashing soap, no medical coverage
Bad case of strep throat
Mama's think she got arthiritis
My neighbor caught hepatitis from a simple yawn
They say it's airborne
We ain't got no street lights they all broken
Just take a trip through Vallejo, Richmond, and Oakland
Everyday it's a funeral
He was my numeral uno, but I can't bring him back
All I know is he was stressin', takin' anti-depressants
They found him dead in the trunk of his Cadillac
And I'm so thralled all I can think about is revenge
Always check up, always pullin' licks, doin' dirty works for dividends
He took the bullet for me
I'm the one that really robbed the place
Though I've been tryna to paper chase
(Gansgta Boo)
I done grew up in the game baby
Ain't nothin' changed, little money, little fame baby
I'm still the same baby
Lady gotta make it, I can't be takin' no losses
I'm the bomb at the party
Always askin' ""Where are the dollars?""
Now Iknow you hate me
'Cause I hooked up with Krayzie, baby
I'm with whatever they pay me
Gangsta Boo be with it, be winnin', so what the fuck
I'll see you at the end of the year, so good luck
(Krayzie Bone)
I made it, and I know it's almost over
Call in the soldiers
Gonna be ready to bomb back on 'em, know ya
Enemies position at all times
Where they at, and how much power they hold
And how many soldiers they got down to roll
But in the meantime,
You make your money, even if you strike it rich
You better hustle like you hungry for ya paper, paper, paper
These days only ways that pays can save you
Livin' your life is like a task if you ain't got the cash
Nigga mad at the world, as I put my mask over my face
And grabbed the magnum pistol, with the stash in the bag
I'm doin' a pop pop, so drop and take it as a loss, and chalk it
Now you can take your life and keep on walkin' (just keep on walkin')
Or be killed for tryna deny me a meal
I do what I gotta do, let's keep it real
For niggas in the hood up on the the block
Let 'em know they understood
Buckin' shots, nigga we livin' raw mentality war
So paranoia got me sleepin' on the floor, watchin' the door
This no win situation of tryin' to stay alive until we die
And anyway you go we won't make it
No way, to shake, fake it
Better take advantage of ya life while you can
Get rich, kick back, relax, spend ya money
I'm all about paper, sorry no party tonight
The year is 1999 last year to get your money, right
(E-40)
That's real
Ya undersmell me
Suckers do what they can
Players do what they want, dig it?
Charlie Hustle every time up in your talk
Yeah face it
Krayzie Bone, Gangsta Boo
Fuckin' they nose like this
That's how we fuckin' they nose up
Dig it nigga?
Yeah, paper chase nigga, paper route (paper route)
You undersmell me? We starvin'
You undersmell me nigga?
Don't let the mobbers control you
Chest high-up in the mobbers, nigga"
77,What Would You Do,2003,LeathaFace: The Legends Underground (Part I) (2003),,Krayzie Bone,"Tell me... What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?
Krayzie
I fell asleep 'n' had a dream that I fell off in the game, nigga no more glammer, no more fame no mo bitches or bank. I can't even buy me a 50 sack 'cause I'm broke. Been tryin' ta get me a rap deal but they don't love me no mo. Now its serious 'cause niggas are befriended me, now everybody my enemy. Could it really be niggas pretendin ta be my friends 'cause I had the dividends? As I really did I guess I'm not tha shit now, huh? I'm tellin' ya niggas ya better hope that I don't rebound, uh. I had money, quick fast money, the cash money, I flashed money, but I should'a been smart enough to stash money. Now I'm back on the black I'm marchin back ta square one, n I got a pocket full'a stones, damn I wish I'd wake up. But I kept dreamin' I was slangin rocks, while watchin for cops, n I kept my nine millimeter glock cocked, case it had ta be shot. I went from makin' platnum records ta stugglin back in the ghetto. Chasin paper like I'm crazy, but it ain't nuttin but tha devil. I don't care though, I was willin' ta risk it all, even my life, (that's right) I had already lost it all, even my wife. So I'm ready to die. Fuck my girl 'n' fuck the world. If I don't get some cash somebody's ass gunnin be deader than a mutha fucka n I ain't laughin'. I'm used ta livin' lavish, havin' fancy material. I used ta be a rapper, but shit now I'm a criminal. I'm livin' low, feels like I can die right here. This dream really dunn turned into a nightmare.
Krayzie
Now shit is serious, 'cause I gatta get some paper today. I'm thinkin' bout rollin' up on some bustas, pullin my gauge out 'n' spray. (buck buck buck) Better yet I'm thinkin' bout robbin a bank, before ya now it I'm at the safe with a gun at the back'a the bank tella. Hey fella, Imma need all ya chedda. LeathaFace down, so they won't get now description. Up in the safe now. If you got some children you'll listen. Look nigga just don't piss me off, 'cause I'm already tickin. N can roll with the menace, so chill with the conversation. So pop this combination, now.
Krayzie
Aww shit I'm back in the mix, he opened the safe, I'm finna be rich. I filled that sack with some chips. I'm thinkin' I'm bout to dip, this nigga done hit the switch. so, on reflex I shot him. Didn't want to, but I got him reight between the eyes. I droped him, as a murder case. Grabbed the money 'n' run out the door, tha po-po was waitin fa sho. So I did the only thing I know, let off. shot buck buck buck. Dipped ta the cut, ta the getaway car. Then I pumped the trunk incase I had drama. I'm havin' drama, they got me trapped in tha back'a tha alley. I'm runnn' behind a bucket, grabbin the pump n I'm ready ta buss' it. Helocopters was hoverin over me, real quick I got ta do somethin'. I start runnin', buckin tha gauge, refuse to be stuck in a cage. I'd rather be numb in a grave, then bein here fucked in the cage. to late to save me now LeathaFace comin' crazy now. Get out my way 'cause the gauge is cocked. I spit at two niggas flammin hot slug. Get up 'n' shoot 'n' move, let's do this, ready move, with nothin' ta lose. Done already lost it, if you was smart you'd back up off me coppers. Aw shit they let off shots 'n' got me dead in the chest. I knew they got me 'cause my t-shirt was wet. (pump...) I'm bearly breathin, I'm thinkin' I'd be dead soon, but I passed out 'n' woke up right back in my bedroom."

Man, what the fuck is we gonna do man? I'm tellin' you (Shit man, I can't
Believe this shit man
The muthafuckers done killed him and y'all niggas know we got ride for this
Nigga right here
On these ho-ass niggas) Yeah, I say we ride over there right now, nigga, what's
Happenin'?
Nigga that's what the fuck I'm talkin' bout, nigga. Let's roll.
Krayzie
As we delve throu the mud and rain, trey shots of Tanq. ease the pain/ As we put
To rest one of my
Niggas that got cut up and lost half his brain, shit ain't the same/ Niggas is
Dangerous buckin' like it's
The thang to bust/ When I looked at my nigga fucked up I couldn't help thinkin'
This could have been
Aimed for us/ Niggas do hate like that/ Nigga, you never know, he say a friend,
But I smell foe
I sit back and wait for the day niggas try to kick in my door, so I sleep with a
Big 4-4/ But what if
I fuck up and pull it to slow? You know what they say; Gotta go, gotta go/ What
If I be the one
Breathin' no more? Oh, well/ When I die I want all my muthafuckers to ride for
Me on the niggas
That did me, killed me, committed my homicide/ Gather up after the funeral
(Posse Up!) and pull out
All the big guns/ Go throu every hood poppin' till somebody takes some/ How in
The fuck
Can I rest in peace when I wasn't ready to die? Some I'm beggin' my niggas to
Get my revenge
And to do it the same night that they put me under/ Now I'm gone but this thug
Shit gon' live on
Just write on my tombstone; He was that Thuggish Ruggish Bone (He was that
Thuggish Ruggish Bone)
Murder mo, niggas gon' kill some more...
(Nigga you never know when you gon' die. Say, never know when it could be you...
...That leave your house and don't come back. This shit is real, and oh so true)
Fat Joe
Yeah, when I die I wanna see about a hundred niggas cryin', lyin', talkin' 'bout
They all love
Ryan and Joey too/ You should have seen me at the funeral sportin' the top hat,
Tuxedo was royal blue
Murder who? Nigga I died in the car chase/ Shot the place like the last scene in
Scarface
Now I'm in the far place chillin' in the whites of the sky/ Terror Squad to the
Day that died, What?
Big Punisher
I'm a thug, I'm a die high, O.D. off the la-la/ Niggas keep tellin' me get off
That weed/ Choke
I'm a keep smokin' on that thai-a/ Nigga, fuck that/ I'm a keep hittin' that
{Puffs} till my lung collapse
What's wrong with that, you hypocrite? Just a lil' bit, you know you down with
That/ It's all good
In your hood, havin' laughs, puff weed to clear my cataracts/ Never thought I'd
See the inside of an
Ambulance, but now I'm there/ Too many dead brain cells runnin' round inside my
Head
That's why when I die my eyes were bloodshot red
Cuban Link
Now picture me dead still gettin' head in the coffin'; Flossin'/ Bitches
Fightin', cryin', tryin' to get a
Bigger portion/ My niggas talkin' figurin' how to get my fortune while I'm lost
In space waitin' for
Satan and his horsemans/ Walkin' throu fire sparkin' my lighter, cloud the sky
Up
Rising higher and higher/ Eye to eye with my messiah/ Viya con dios/ As I cross
The gates of Hell
I face the Devil with a shovel and told him; ""Brace yourself""
Krayzie
Reporters steady ask; ""Why K.B. talk about murder on all the songs?"" I tell 'em;
""'Cause I can step out that door, somebody could pop, and I'm gone"" Then, they
Wanna know I pack
Chrome/ For one, I'm paranoid; Smokin' to much of that weed/ What's that? I just
Heard a noise
Get the 12 gauge, and I call my boys/ Muthafuckers is plottin' to get me/ I know
When I'm dreamin'
This, so that's the meaning of this/ 9 millimeter, heater, strapped with the
Infrared beams and shit
So nigga don't trip/ Watch out! The reaper, He seem to be gettin' closer, so I'm
Runnin' from that
Muthafucker (y'all come on!) Swervin' and duckin' murder/ Pistol-grip pump
Nigga protected by the
Gauge/ Mister Sawed-Off Leather Face/ Reload the clip and into the crowd I
Spray/ Murder, murder
Mo murder, murder/ Kill, kill, kill/ Shit it's sellin' but what they ain't
Tellin' niggas is that it's real
But they better realize before it be you in the casket, dropped/ Better get your
Ass a shotgun
And go get a plastic glock/ Nigga don't take murder for no joke that's like
Slittin' your own throat
But I can tell you what'll help for sure is if you bust back at them hoes..."

From ""The Warrior"" slash ""The Mad Rapper""
Makin' pushes, jump out the bushes, troopers attack/ And the heads of these
Adversaries/ Bring 'em back to me
If you scared, you the first nigga dead, and the field is gettin' deeper/ Drama
Gettin' thicker, so I pull my pistol quicker
Kill 'em all if they're not on your team/ But watch out for the spies tryin' to
Infiltrate the scene/ Know what I mean?
We headed for the justice center; free all the convicts, and let the killas ride
With us/ Yeah, let's fuck some shit up and let's get
Rid of the law, of course; Voluntarily or by force/ This shit just goes on and
On/ It don't stop until they

Got to keep my mental sharper than a pencil/ Got bullets in the clip thou, and
You endangered if you anger me, nigga
