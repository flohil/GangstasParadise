Aw shit I left the muthafucka with Poog

Hey, man I got some drums in the back
[M. C. Ren]
Yo does it look like we can play some fuckin' drums?
[Everyone except Yella]
Bullshit!
[Arguin']
[M. C. Ren]
Yo were two hard muthafuckaz
Takin' out any punk ass suckaz
Can you believe this or so be frightened
Were strong as fuck, with the power of a titan
Settin' a mark of destruction get it
So don't front, and say you ain't with it
You wanna rumble with us you can't hang
Cause were something like a two man gang
Start some shit is what we do best
Scared by the suckaz say fuck the rest
So yo Eazy bust it and shoot to kill
And tell these stupid muthafuckaz the deal
[Eazy-E & M. C. Ren]
I'm a hard muthafucka
2 Hard Muthafuckaz! [x4]
[Eazy-E:] ""they would get fucked up by a ruthless clan""
So it's simple we don't give a fuck right
So you and ya boys can get the fuck out my site
I'm on tilt with class gettin' ready to blast
'Cause I'm a hard muthafucka
2 Hard Muthafuckaz! [x4]
[M. C. Ren]
It's simple tell 'em what we mean
When the two baddest muthafuckaz step on the scene
[M. C. Ren]
Yo what are you sayin'
[M. C. Ren]
You heard what he said
It's the truth so what's up
So if you want me to go then I'mma bout to nut up
The 2 baddest muthafuckaz alive
So I don't think you and your boys can survive
You gotta girl, well if she's good to go
I bet me and E already fucked the hoe
A train was in effect and your bitch was rott
By a hell of a nigga that was hard to stop
[M. C. Ren]
Because everybody knows what where talkin' about"
1,24 Hrs To Live,2007,Featuring… Eazy‐E (2007),Hip Hop,Eazy-E,"24 hours to live...
24 hours to live...
Seven-thousand, four hundred, twenty three grains
Of sand drop from the hourglass
It's how much time I got left on this planet
Some motherfucker's gotta die
I'm an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I'm gonna put these things on you, and never let up
See, my momma... she was wrong when I was born
That a nigga like E should'a never been born
Too late, big mistake in '72
It's '92, now the year of code blue
15 hours... 11 minutes... 30 seconds
I'm a motherfuckin' wreck
Gonna pay back niggas who did me wrong in the past
My days ain't long
I'm comin' strong and fast
Lock up 8 niggs... kill up 10 pigs
??? And fuckas are ?altered? by a 2
Now what else can I do?
Fuck, fuck, fuck and plant my seeds
Leavin' kids in this world like me
The lunatic psycho mutherfucka Eazy-E
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
Sky diving, scuba diving
To Evil Kinevil stunt car drivin'
Bungee cord jumpin' off a bridge
It's hard to breathe with a fractured rib
I can't take this shit
Let me see how much more time I got to spend
Hit more skins
Back up in her pussy
Up in the back
I gotta let off
A few more nuts
I'm starting to panic
I'm starting to sweat
'Cause I don't really wanna die yet
Dizzy spells, flashbacks in my head
Niggas ain't want me to bein' happy when I'm dead
But I ain't goin' out unless 30 niggas die
I'm dying anyway so I'm thinking suicide
Run into a crowd of niggas dyin' by the pistol
Took the motheruckin' whistle
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
To sweep with the feet when he hit the concrete
Chop him up, dice him up and sacrifice his meat
Drag him by his ankles to the cemetery
(Screams)
Shut the fuck up nigga
'Cause you ain't seen shit
I'm 'bout to take this ???? and staight up grip
I'm holdin' the neck of the devil and drink his blood
Allowing my soul to be polluted by his evil root
And now I'm mad insane, red as ???? as I strain for my hearbeat
To thumpety-thump to pump, it might burst
False alarms, and no harm that will commit to the E
But now I'm down to an hour 23
Time is moving fast, but not that slow
I thought I had an hour, but it's seconds left the go
I ran into the office
No more time is left
I ran up to the doctor with a bomb to my (BOOM)
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
As time winds down to it's last 24 hours
In an earth that weighs 60 trillion tons
Travelling 1,037 1/3 mph, how do you define time?
What is a minute?
How important is an hour when 24 hours becomes a lifetime
Ooh, so define how do we define time?
Now you choose
How will you spend your last 24 hours?
C'mon... talk to me
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die"
2,8 Ball (Remix),1995,Eternal E (1995),Hip Hop,Eazy-E,"I don't drink brass monkey, like to be funky
Nickname Eazy-E your 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kickin', to show my shit
Rap a hole in my dick, boy I don't quit
Crowd rocking motherfucker from around the way
I got a six shooter yo mean hombre
Rolling through the hood to find the boys kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my drawers, I have to pause
40 ounce in my lap and it's freezing my balls
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself, They can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the east side south of Compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at the face, and the bitch was to the curb
Hoes on my tip for the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling
Riding on Slauson down towards Crenshaw
Turned down south, to dish the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
'Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off, put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on till 'cause I was drunk
See ya sissy as punk had to go in my trunk
Reached inside 'cause it's like that
Came back out with a silver Gat
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Put up the jam and, like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of Dodge
Sucker on me, 'cause the title I'm holdin'
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin'
Old E's 800 'cause that's my plan
Take it in a bottle, 40, quart, or can
Drink it like a madman, yes I do
Fuck the police, and a 5-0 too
Stepped at a party I was drunk as hell
Three bitches already said ""Eric yo breath smells""
40-ounce in hand, that's what I got
""Yo man, you see Eazy hurlin' in the parkin' lot?""
Stepped on yo foot, cold dissed yo ho
Asked her to dance and she said ""Hell, no""
Called her a bitch, 'cause that's the rule
Boys in the hood tryin' to keep me cool
Tell me, homeboy, you wanna kick my butt?
I walked in your face and we get 'em up
I start drivin' the dog, and watch you fold
Just dumb, full of cum, got num dot co
""Make you look sick, ya snotty-nose prick
Now your fly bitch is all over his dick""
Punk got dropped, 'cause the title I'm holdin'
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin'
Pass the broom, motherfucker, while I tear shit up
And y'all listen up close to roll-call
Eazy-E's in the place, I got money and juice
Rendezvous with me and we make the deuce
Dre makes the beat so god-damn funky
Do the 0-8, fuck the brass monkey
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
Hail to the niggas from CIA
Crazy D is down and in effect
We make hardcore jams, so fuck respect
Make a toast, pumpy pump to the title I'm holdin'
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin'"

6,Black Nigga Killa,2007,Featuring… Eazy‐E (2007),Hip Hop,Eazy-E,"Yeah!
Black niggaaaaaaaaaa
Yeah!
Killa killa killa killa
Black nigga killa hate brought death
Around the block as a hollow points bust though the punks back
Raised in gang, feel no pain, as I penetrate
Nigga five deep as I strike a quick pace
I got the evil of a dead nigga trapped in my mind
So my soul is a threat to my mankind
Born to kill I'm wicked by nature
Cause the streets of my neighborhood breath young hellrasiors
A 30 ot 6 witha scope
I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast
Motherfuckers catchin heat as I bring anger
And release more danger from my chamber
The evil in my blood is possessed
So I creep low from the back slow and push led in that nigga's flesh
Ain't no hope, when every nigga wants to be the nine milla on the trigga
The black nigga killa
Deep from the death as I crept
I can feel his glock in the back of my neck
I'm thinkin' to myself ""what the fuck"" as I pause
I can feel my heart thumpin from my balls
Up against his gun what the fuck could I do?
If I make a wrong move, the nigga might shoot
My pops always warned me when I was comin' up
If I play pussy, I'm bound to get fucked
Though bein broke as hell it be drivin' me crazy
Hooked up with my niggas start jackin niggas daily
Fat sacks of dirt, to Dayton's, I got em
Slang 'em dirt cheap cause everything was profit
Now I got his nine on the back of my mind
As I watch my life pass right before my eyes
The shit that I done, is all in my face
Reflections of death as I step with my 38
The black nigga killa
Which bitch made the statement?
About the nigga bustin' caps supportin all black Ben Davis
I'm out the doe
My pager's blowin' up I check my ghat twice
Cause niggas like to jack on a late night
And as I'm livin' like a criminal
I try my best to keep my gang tight and stay away from punk niggas
Strikin down Broadway
I caught some niggas out of bounds from the (pause) upper MLK
Slowly crept from the cut at a quick pace
Ain't no love in my heart all I feel is hate
So 25 with that L might be mando
Cause nigga I'm killin' for them gold things with that Zapco
I watch the terror in eyes as he backed up
Ease of the break pop that clutch and watch his chest bust
Wide open as I bounce in the night quicker
From the nine milla trigga
The black nigga killa"

Verse One:
Cruisin' down tha street in my '64
Jackin' tha freaks clocking tha dough
Went to tha park tah get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there come shootin' some hoop
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

Straight up, straight up, straight up gangsta wrong nigga tah fuck wit)
Verse Two:
Dotomy's in tha place tah give me the pace
He said my man JD is on free-base
Tha boy JD was a friend of mine
Till I caught him in my car trying tah steal a alpine
I chase him up tha street tah call a truce

Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge

Niggaz out there makin' that dolla'
I pulled up in my '64 Impala
They greet me wit a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from tha 8-ball my breath start stinkin'
Enough tah get my girl tah rock that body
Before I left I hit tha Bacardi
I went to her house tah get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed tha stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit what did ya know
Reached back like a pimp slapped tha hoe
Her father jumped up and he started tah shout
So I bombed on pops knocked his old ass out
(And if a brotha talks shit I give him a,

Verse Four:
Now I'm rollin' hard now under control
Them wrapped tha '64 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said,""Oh brother!""
Thrown in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin' home and I see tha G-ride

Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begin
Before my mother starts bitchin bout my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this:
Cruisin down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin the bitches, slappin the hos
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G

Chased him up the street to call a truce

Hey yo man, remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work (word)
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy! (Yo)
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit
(Eazy-E)
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begin
Before my mother starts bitchin bout my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this:
Cruisin down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin the bitches, slappin the hos
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
'Cause the boyz 'n' tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit
(Eazy-E)
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Till I caught him in my car tryin' to steal a Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
'Cause the boyz 'n' tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit
(Eazy-E)
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
'Cause the boyz 'n' tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit
(Eazy-E)
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' around a telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother""
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin' home and I see the G ride
Now Ket is drivin' Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Ket got beaten for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
For defence on the boy, he'll do some time
'Cause the boyz 'n' tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card

Niggaz all getting drunk, and smoking a bum bud
Oh wait here's a punk, pump the trunk
'Cause it's a gang of jackers in the front smoking
All the hump, some shit was said about blue and red
But I'm colour blind and I gotta nine
Threw up the sign I cock the 9, I cock the 9.
(Loco S.A.B)
Well nigga pop the 9and let it holla
Test drive wit a neighbourhood's scholar
Black Impaler, blue chucks on gettin' outta
Sucks on hip hop thugsta get the fuck on
Niggaz looking shifty, do they wanna diss me, lick me
Show me love or peel my cap quickly
My six sense won't let me slip don't puff wit the draggin em
I'm still toe taggin em, hit the spot wit a don still baggin em
It's the low call, S.A.B on the vocal, blast my way out eazy pay

Leavin' pumpin Eazy-E ""Boyz 'n' the Hood""
'Cause I'm a gangsta so I can relate, most of these
Niggaz is fake and tryin' to hate
I put a buster in his place, I put one in his face
Obey my first and give him the taste
That's how I duz it, that's how I do it
And the murder weapon that I use you know I threw it
He kept persuading so I had to do it, 'uh' play
For keeps that's the rule of the streets 'uh'.

Dick Tracy all on my nuttz like Cagny and Lacy
And don't faze me, Ruthless is the label that pays me
But this one H.K weighs a ton, words are yellow wit

Dick the niggas corps leave it on his momma's porch
Don't give a fuck about shit that's why I mellow
Or maybe it's the fact that I'm kin to the devil

Stoppin' at a light on the latenight
Fire up a Phillie Blunt to get my head right
See some niggas slippin at a burger stand
And in my mind all I'm thinkin' is a murder plan
Creepin' through the drive through kinda slow
I got my hot beams on the back of the .4
Yo, smokin' on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin' I'm about to lay their ass down
Reach for them fools make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the Gat to the nigga's dome now he's sleeps
One shot to the top body flopped on the seat
Peep, I dumped on the lil' skinny passenger
A bitch is screamin in a rage so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about 5 blocks
Before I got stopped by punk ass cops

Fuck you

Its time to put some niggaz in check
When you shoot a gun, hot shells eject
Catch'em they get used as evidence
Only when they get brushed for finger prints
You ask Why am I like this?
'Cause you wanna hear about shit like this
So I tell it, how I know it, Just hope the fuck I don't show it
Niggaz out frontn, lottering and looting.
Lets recreate a drive by shooting
More brothers in a car blocks away
Waiting to spray, shotgun, Mack10 and an AK
They roll through to a line of nigga's
It was 9 just like tha fuck they figured
Go around tha corner come back real slow
Lights off, cars in neutral, rolln at a snails pace and creepn
Hoping to catch all of them sleepn, a so called gang, drugs and sex (NWA)
Start busting a cap and all tha others jet, 3 of'em fall to their doom
Pronounced dead at the scence, with gun shot wounds
3 dead 'cause Compton is scanless.
I'd like to tell ya brother, Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust (Amen)

8 Ball sippin' the bitches are flippin'
Slow down, I hit a dippin' continue my trippin'
Hittin' my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feelin' good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets
And wit a homey like Dre just supplying the beats

Rolling through the hood, cold tearin' shit up
Stick my head out the window & I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumpin' the box
But you know that's an alibi for slangin' the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jockin' 24-7
Rolled them muthafukers ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a 10 a fo'
Was takin' niggas money and was itchin' for mo'
Laughin' in their faces and said your all making me rich
Then one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (gunshots), I shot (gunshots)
As you can see, I cold broke his ass
Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun

Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafucker
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starvin' 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yeah I went to jail but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of 9
Call my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the gankin' zone
All the things I did for her like keepin' her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The baliff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the hoe
Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun
Never leave the pad without packin' a gun
Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it

(Eazy E:)
Give me a funky ass bass line
What the fuck is up?
In the place to be
Comin' on the mic is Eazy muthafuckin' E
Dre is on the beat
Yella's on the cut
So listen right close while we rip shit up
(Eazy E:)
Well I'm Eazy E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper group comin' out to shoot
Eazy E, muthafuckers cold knockin' the boots
'Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster, I used to be a mugster
If you heard Compton, you think I own a drugstore
Gettin' stupid because I know how
And if a fucker talks shit, I give him a... (POW)
8 Ball sippin' the bitches are flippin'
Slow down, I hit a dippin' continue my trippin'
Hittin' my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feelin' good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets
And wit a homey like Dre just supplying the beats
Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun
Never leave the pad without packin' a gun
Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy Duz It
I was knocking muthafukers out
What's your name boy
Funky, fresh Eazy E
Kick, kick that shit
Where you from fool? Compton, yeah
Rolling through the hood, cold tearin' shit up
Stick my head out the window & I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumpin' the box
But you know that's an alibi for slangin' the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jockin' 24-7
Rolled them muthafukers ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a 10 a fo'
Was takin' niggas money and was itchin' for mo'
Laughin' in their faces and said your all making me rich
Then one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (gunshots), I shot (gunshots)
As you can see, I cold broke his ass
Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun
Never leave the pad without packin' a gun
Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy Duz It
Wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it?
Muthafuckin' Eazy Duz It
But how does he do it?
Eazy Duz It do it eazy
That's what I'm doin'
Stop
Man whatcha gonna do now
Now I'm a break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafucker
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starvin' 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yeah I went to jail but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of 9
Call my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the gankin' zone
All the things I did for her like keepin' her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The baliff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the hoe
Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun
Never leave the pad without packin' a gun
Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy Duz It
From around the way, born in '73
Harcore B-boy named Eazy E
It's '88 now, '73's obselete

Just pop your tape in and it's just like your there
With the E on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
'Cause I'm a destroyer

(You're a fat girl)
[Fat... fat... fat fat fat fat girl] (repeat 2X)
(It's funky fresh Eazy E) new kid on tha block
And already got a fat girl on my jock
Now my story's kinda simple so please take it simple
As I tell you a tale bout this big fat pimple
I was chillin' on the ave drinkin' some booze
Saw a fatty comin' my way so what was I to do?
I busted a U went tha other way again
But forgot that tha Avenue was a dead end
I turned around, here she came, stride for stride
Funky fat like that, bout two thirty-five
Stampede was rushin, I double looked
And she had more chins than a Chinese phonebook
Five four three ugly as can be, she said
(Ron-de-vu)
Hello Eazy E. Do you remember me? (I said no)
Huhu yes you do suga
My name is Bertha but you can call me booga
Remember the time when you were drunk at a party
We was slow dancin, give ya all this body
(Eazy-E)
When she said that she loved me, I was in shock
Oh my God got a fat girl on my jock
(I got a fat girl on my jock] [Fat girl] [Got a fat girl on my jock)
She gave me tha grin, I showed tha frown
And with a bare hug picked me off tha ground
Squeezion me tight, atttempted to bug me
Grabbed me by tha rear, said [Love me, hug me!]
I was hell, victim of a scandal
'Cause this girl's too much for E to handle
Broke tha bee's grip, started to run
Back to tha crib, grabbed tha elephant gun
She's grubbin, thighs rubbin in a hot pursuit
I loaded up tha gun bout ready to shoot
She kept on comin' because of addiction
Legs on fire because of friction
My gun broke, now I was doomed
Dropped tha double barrel, grabbed tha harpoon
As I swung, tha fat girl fell
Lyin' on tha ave just like a beach whale
That's tha story, it's quite ill
And all fat girls y'all besta chill
All overweight freaks stay off my block
'Cause it's eerie to have a fat girl on your jock"

But after I nut I might leave you
But first I must deceive you, because bitch I don't need you
And don't say that you love me too

You ready Eiht?
MC Eiht: Yeah, c'mon
Verse 1: Mack 10
I was born to ride, bangin', pack heat
Got turned out early by them scandliss freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pullin jewelry licks
Moms said, ""Mack, baby watch for danger""
I said, ""Momma don't you know I'm a real gangbanger?""
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twistin tripple gold with the all black eagle
Got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck
He said, ""Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip incase you might need it""
Get the eighty eight skate, ang get your slide on
Throw the Hoo-Bang plack in the back and your ride on
Ride for me, I'ma ride for you
You Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew
Get yo ride on, get yo slide on, who the best
Nobody rides like these killas from the west
Ride for me, I'ma ride for you
You Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew
Get yo slide on, get yo ride on, who the best
Nobody rides like these killas from the west

Eazy muthafuckin E with a chrome to your dome
Cruisin, in my 6-4 rag top
I got a lot of juice, a lot of fuckin' block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce and I'm clownin
Keep the gat in my lap 'cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps 'cause I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Peep, nigga I don't sleep
Bury muthafuckas in the concrete
You try to creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I'm peepin niggas out in my left window
So I blast, and I blast, so I blast no more
Yo, they call me motherfuckin John Doe
Verse 3: MC Eiht
Real thugs roll 'cause the Westside's sick
Which enemy depicts to catch the 9 clip
Slick, but not like Rick, the gang story
G's kill and ain't shit funny like Joe Corry
Don't make me laugh 'cause I""m on the wrong the path
Catch the blood bath, it's the aftermath
Slang strike to make money, now ain't that simple?
That silly nigga's wearin vest's but we aim for the temple
Watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo
Keep the calico with extra ammo
So and so gets blasted, to the casket
Never seen these westside G's face, we masked it
Y'all best be defeat and be discreet
Catch the hot heat from across the street
Take me in the dump schools that, wanna push me
Retaliation, straight better than hitten pussy
Ugh, MC Eiht in the muthafuckin house

My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
Takin' out profanity so they can play it though
Listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
Going to the record store say ya gonna buy
That the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
So that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits
Takin' my time of each line to make sure it fits
Push play on the instrumental that's recorded
Step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
Some sort of track appeared like a plaque
And some hell of a scream from the girls in the back
Takin' a bow 'cause I got style
Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
Yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short
Guarenteed to help when I walk on the court
So get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
Gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious Dre my sounds so quit playin' around
'Cause I'mma break it down
(Eazy-E)
Last time I was takin' my time with this
But other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
But they was rotten, I was gettin' riper
Ready to go, like never before
Givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
Helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin'
Curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
Balls havin' seasons, this is a doctrine
And I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
And I think I'm gonna rock then
You got beaches chill and I'mma push ya
To freeze after I'll cut ya 'cause I'mma butcher
And say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
Cause a percentage on point bellys are very low
Messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
Like a said before ya get rubbed in the dirt
I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man
M.C. Ren: ""But ya the dopest one I ever saw!""
I keep droppin' it pound for pound
And when I'm on the mic I always throw down
To keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
So listen 'cause I'mma break it down
(Eazy-E)
Now look at me and not the poster
And you could see right off I got the most of
The talent, experience or a trade
And complements for the rhyme that's made
Talks over today if this one so
Pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
'Cause I don't need water to clear my throat
Comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'
Nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
Wantin' to get wit me this routine
Keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean
Can ya dis this man I don't think so
Once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
Comin' out with songs like hit after hit
Cause this is legit and yours ain't shit
Makin' it sound so dope 'cause I'm a genius
But your amazed with ya happy to see this
Brother go crazy on wax
Flowin' away like if I was on a sax
Doin' a solo in the shade I'm a spotlight
Relax and chill while your up tight
Pumpin' up the funky sounds

Merry Christmas muthafucka!
Merry muthafuckin' Christmas and a ho ho ho!

Oh what fun it is to know
That I'm gonna get this pussy tonight
So ring them bells, ring them bells
She's takin' it all the way

Ho ho ho come sit on my face

A CD player

But all the fuckin' bullshit got played when I was five

Little kids don't cry

On the third day of Christmas my homeboys gave to me
Three pounds of indo
Two birds of cocaine
And a A muthafuckin' K bitch.

Sue the daddies for child support. Even though daddy is takin' care
Of the baby but the mother's just, you know, scandalous, not
Just like this hey)
Fuck my baby'z mama
The bitch got drama
Fuck my baby'z mama
'Cause she's the type o' bitch that wanna see me broke
Broker than a joke, bitch stole my role
And every time I see the bitch she needs cash
She make me wanna slap her ass
Triflin bitch always got me in a fit
The low-life-Compton-shoppin-swap-me trick
I wanna kill the ho
Then slam her in the trunc of my six fo'
'Cause yo, that ho made my dick grow
And now her lawyer's at every show
Waitin for me to kick in my dough
But before I go I'm on death row
'Cause the bitch had too much drama...
Fuck my baby'z mama!
FUCK MY BABY'Z MAMA! (7x)
(Trick bitch!)
Fuck my baby'z mama!
Fuck my baby'z mama
The bitch got drama
And I'm not the one
I should just knock her punk ass out
While I'm in court payin' child support
But then I gotta deal with the father and the steel
And he's the type o' nigga that a nigga's gotta kill
Make me kick up a grip, I don't like her
'Cause the bitch is buyin skirts instead of dipers
Beggin so much to hold hands it's startin to look like cuffs
I wish I never fucked
But now it's too late
How much you made?
'Cause accordin to your income
You might have to spend some
Time behind bars
Now ya find it hard
Never thought a bitch would pull a stunt like this
I can't do another day with Pamela
So I'm a pay ya, Anna
But I just like to say...
I think of all the money that I spent on a lawyer
I used to be an employer
But now I'm just an employee filin bankruptcy
But now the punk bitch can't touch me
Huh! I only call her to check up on my daughter
So now she's got a restraining order
Put me to the curb and had the nerve to axks a bower or dime
Bitch, you must be outcha rabid ass mind
Huh! Love for start will take much, you see, the bitch broke me
So now I need a crutch
But you gotta understand a judge don't give a fuck
About a young nigga that's down on his luck
So I gotta put the P down and be down for the calls
And give the bitch back her drawers
So if ya drivin' by and ya see her
Do me favor, give the bitch the finger
Fuck her!
You biiiiiiiiiitch!

Haha, that's fucked up!
Go to hell!

First up high on a roof top
Like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
A black hood covers my face
And death flows through my mind at it's own pace
Sometimes I feel like a super hero
Urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
Now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim, and then my thoughts fail
My minds still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms all wet
I put finger on the fit and then the side a check
I make the kill here's the deal
After the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
So it's the shots that sing out like a piper
Everyone's scared I'm the neighborhood sniper
(Eazy-E)
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head
And simply scared the bitch boo
Being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts
Take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot
His bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
Now the room is red
Now there's nothing left but a snitch
Here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish
One (*Shot*) two (*Shot*) three strikes your out
This nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window
I made my escape the cops chase
Duckin' to an alley so they don't recognize my face
The boy had to pay the piper
So they all stayin' fair of a neighborhood sniper
(Eazy-E)
I'm Doin' dirt as I continue my mission
Killin' all fools as an addiction
As a E lovin' the game leavin' a shame
And in my heart I feel no muthafuckin' pain
Because my heart is cold as I was told
And my A.K.47 I stand bold
Rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot
Pop pop pow as I watch the muthafucka drop
Lovin' the site as the blood spill
Take a photograph, to keep in my hard as I was sayin' calm
And never hyper as I succeed in my mission
I be a neighborhood sniper"

For a punk ass mark in the park
Blow his brains out, stuck him in the bushes
Take his gat, leave his ass for the rats
And let me hit that cisco, I got a 187 on my pistol
Warrant by the LAPD
Key for puttin' in work out my trade
Because the president never simp
One dumb dog to my residents

Believe that
(Female: How are you doing ?)
All right
(Female: So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster ?)
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin, I specialized in gankin
Whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangster havin' fun
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
Rollin', and runnin' from the police
Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
Or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping?
Hell no! Just trippin' off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
At anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
And if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn
Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" somebody?
Waitin' for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Looked in all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
Aasily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside I start takin'
Cause you know it's no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get, front and center
Or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shhh, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key, and I flee
Out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall don't fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
Gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a 211?
Yeah
There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
Were you slick?
Yeah, you gotta be cunnin
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
So he came out to test his stamina
Against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I run
Back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it""
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, 'cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
Is all that true?
I don't lie
You see I'm not mister nice guy
Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?
Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my shit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
Thought, and damn so what?

Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand

Pump his ass in the head, and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen

Lock the doors, and throw away the key
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers can see
And smile, you know, 'cause I'm controllin the shit

Take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin' floor
Don't make me have to set an example today

Takin' all you stupid motherfuckers' money
Peepin at a bitch cause my dick's on hard
Laughin' at the dumb ass security guard
Who's tied up for the moment, not sayin' a word
I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd
But back to the bitches I'm peepin
And then untie the hoe, so I can start creepin'
Took her to the backroom about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back
I said: ""Lay down, and unbutton your bra!""
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said: ""Damn"", then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind, was goin' up in her
The suspense was makin' me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick!
I said: ""Damn"", dropped the gat from my hand
(What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man)
Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt, so
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
I said get down. I want you all face-down on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot
Stackin up the money and there's more to collect
'Cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveler's checks
Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see
(Three motherfuckin police starin' at me; what to do now?)
Hurry up and get on
All right, tell me, who hit the motherfuckin alarm?
I'm a give ya a chance, and count to three
Or else five of y'all bitches are comin' with me
(Police: All right, All right, come on out niggaz, or we're coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in)
Fuck you! We got hostages, and plenty of loot
And don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot
We're sendin out the hostages, all except five
And if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive
We want a copter, so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along, if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave, and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
(Police: They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage!)
(MC Ren: You stupid motherfucker tryin' to run
Now you're dead as fuck tryin' to race a gun)
(Police: All right, this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast)
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin'
With screamin hostages, runnin' and chokin
Gettin' away, but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range, by a motherfuckin cop
And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work
So, y'all know what time it is
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
(Police: Well I'm giving you five seconds to let us through the gate or
I'm gonna shoot two of your guards)
They got me once, but they'll never get me again"
50,Nobody Move,1995,Eternal E (1995),Hip Hop,Eazy-E,"Yo Ren, you're ready to go get this move?
(Believe that, boy)
You're strapped?
(Yeah, you know it)
Let's go do this, man, I got it all planned out
(Yeah, shoot any motherfucker that moves)
All right everybody...
This is a stick-up, everybody get face-down
Ren, gag their mouths so they can't make a sound
Tie 'em up for the fact that I'm kickin ass
I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast
My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out
This ain't personal, but now I'm about
To commit a crime and go through with it
You know what, no need for shakin, because I'm used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah, he's wearin' a badge, but he's a ol ass man
Pump his ass in the head, and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know, so me and my gang just can't be seen
Lock the doors, and throw away the key
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers can see
And smile, you know, 'cause I'm controllin the shit
And no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs, and a Ruthless shirt
That means I'm ready to work, and rush a fool to the dirt, so
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
All right, anybody move and I'll blow your fuckin' head off
All right
Empty your pockets, but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin' floor
Don't make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
I'm in a bank and it's a little bit funny
Takin' all you stupid motherfuckers' money

That we chillin' in this motherfucker
Yo Playa, spit it
(Playa Hamm)
Break yourself hoes, you're in the presence of his Mackness
Ruthless/Priority is back with another platinum package
For the suckers who thought we wasn't coming just like this
Kiss my ass and watch a troop straight freak your bitch
And get a hoe back with a mac smooth controlling the mind and body
So giving the pussy a party
See busta-ass niggas getting paid, but it ain't shit though
Yeah you punk motherfuckers doing low but yo
Witness a mac with strong back attack with no pity
Getting fat off your bitch's titty
Los Angeles Players of the Penthouse are worldwide
Run but you can't hide, check your girl 'cause I'm sure to slide
Right up and between and give the hoe what she been asking for
Don't disrespect yourself or not so she come back for more
Never underestimate the power of a young troop
Checking a fat grip and ain't on no head trip
With suckers on the nut sack hanging from the hairs
And bitches on the dick like my BVD underwear
For a freak ain't jocking for any reason, so what?
I'ma still hit some guts, get a nut, and a proper cut, slut
(Eazy-E)
If you do nothing, say nothing, you'll never be nothing
And there's a sucker born every motherfuckin minute
Yo Quik, kick that shit

Now the suckers take a licking like a Timex
'Cause I'm a troop and I'm rolling like a Rolex
And I'm your host with the most, Mr. Quik, Eazy-E
And the P-E-N-T-H-O-U-S-E with something bumping for your stereo
But sucker-ass niggas don't hear me though
But funky is the password to make them fear me though
'Cause I'm platinum-bound with that west coast sound
And if you want to get down I got 17 rounds
Claiming you peel caps, nigga I pull naps
Of the next of the saps with that wack-ass cap
Like these South Bronx niggas, starving like rats
With songs more corny than Yo! MTV Raps
How would you figure that a nigga like the Quik would show you slack?
I'd rather put a fucking shank in your back
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll fuck your moms at gunpoint
Off of Genuine Draft and a bud joint
So if you're looking in a Source mag and don't see me
It's cause the fucking East Coast is the enemy
But I got something that'll serve you right
Nighty night motherfuckers, sleep tight

I'll rock the mic, the stage, the party, and the hoes and
Rolling suckers up in a zag like a spliff
Smoking 'em, like a new pimp cigarette
It's been said that I'm a get fucked
Or get fucked standing straight up
It's something bout your face, make me wanna slap it
Something bout your eye, make me wanna black it
Call me Earl Sheib, I'll dip you alive
Spraypaint your posse for 99.95
The track's stainless, the record of Tweed
Don't confuse me for your bitch or your homey
Yeah I'm talking shit, only God could kill me
Your rhymes don't thrill me, suck my sweet dick, willy
Yo, Larry Parker, where's my 3 million?
I want a bus and I ain't do fillin
The P the P the C, pimp or die low
Shake it up baby, it's coming back dope
I ain't from Compton, I dwell in Los Angeles
Heart of California, land of the scandalous
(Eazy-E)
Now there you have it, Penthouse, true motherfuckin' players
Kicking that pimp shit for '92
And if you don't like it, fuck you"

Eazy E rockin' non stop on the radio
With the funky fresh hip hop in stereo
Release some rhymes that you will find demandin'
With Dre's beats that are so outstandin'
I'm gettin' busy if you know what I mean
Always settin' me a mark in the hip hop scene
On the radio the greatest of all times
Like Mohammed Ali 'cause I punch rhymes
So tune your station, and clear all the static
And tell the truth: you didn't know that I had it
In me, to be easy about the situation
So just kick it and listen to the station
Playin' my music, it's hard to lose it

Your request is clear, that you're givin'

With me on a top 10, or a mix show
So hit your power button, and let's go
On vacation, with your station
That's playin' live in every location
Blowin' out ya speaker
It won't get weaker
I'll keep rockin' till I hit the peek
And your station is dope E-A-Z-Y
It's on the air, but you axe why
I took out the cursin', and took rehearsin'
I feel dry, you know that I'm thirstin'
To get busy; I don't quit it
And once you hear my cut, I know you're gonna get it

And I hope that ya fans understand when ya talk about sprayin' me

Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cuz I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E, and this is the season
To let the Real Muthaphuckkin G's in
You're like a kid: ya found a pup and now ya dapper
But tell me where the fuck ya found an anorexic rapper
Talkin' about who you gon' squabble with and who ya shoot
You're only 60 pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Gangsta Dresta: Damn, E, they tried to fade you on ""Dre Day!"")
But ""Dre Day"" only meant Eazy's pay day
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is a ""G Thang""

So nigga please, nigga please, don't step to deez

(Gangsta Dresta)
Everyday it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in ya life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga, and you'll capture
The fact that the master is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness to your fuccin' work?
See, ya never had no bidness, so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me knowin' that they pranksters
This is going out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I kinda hate ya
Cause I'm just tired of suburbian niggaz talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' ya ain't seen no parts of the streets, G
Think ya started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while ya rhyme
Little fag tryna sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And ya set don't accept ya
Scared to kicc it with ya homies 'cuz ya know they don't respect ya
So nigga please check nuts before you step to deez muthafuccin Real G's

Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition original baby gangsta
Approach me like you hard, muthafucca I'ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuccin' shank, if I hafta
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuccin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time ya dealin' with some real muthafuccas
Geez, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cuz if ya do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city, but Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real muthafuccin' G's
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre! ('Sup?) *bang*
(Eazy-E)
I never met a OG who never did shit wrong
Ya tried to diss the Eazy-E so now, nigga, 
You and ya Doggy Dogg think that yer all hogging shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make ya shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now ya think yer bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear yer gettin' treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your Sergeant's directions

The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? (why?)
'Cause I'm ruthless for life
Nigga ten years passed and we still up in that ass
Will I make it or continue and
Look at all the shit you in
Eazy does it like happy like the shit we used to do
5 niggaz comin' out the C-P-T so fuck you
Time changed for the good
Niggaz in the hood be comin' up feel it
Can you set it off, for again, you know you should
Yo let's that this shit back
To 1989
Where this nigga shoot and bust and niggaz know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers
Egyptian fan base
Feelin' on the scene, all the fools got erased
Threw a mothafuckin' monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't ever been the same
Opened up doors for the niggaz that be thinkin'
That your flows be on tizight
Bitin' what I wrizite
Jokin' when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts
When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me
Yo mothafuckin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright
You can floss for your b***h, but you know this shit is tight
'Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin', who'd you try and be?
I'ma slap you cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin'
Shoot the government before you niggaz started rappin'
Now its ? city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou
Try to block it out, but you never knew how
And when I walk through the crowd
I'm seeing mothafucka's bread
I hear their b***hes sayin' ask MC Ren
Makin' fools sway when I roll to King Tet's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
Y'all can kiss my black ass one more time
I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villian want that bomb so I get with L.T.
Ain't nothin' changed
We find 'em, fuck 'em, then flee
While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that b***h, she want me
Niggaz weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Invest in drug money, shit, still gettin' in
What it take for y'all quit
Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot
My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock
Full circle, all this shit gon' repeat
When this shit drop, niggaz clownin' in the streets
The saga continues right before your eyes
Who really gives a fuck?
Cause this is ruthless for life

But he's down for mine,
He was put on the streets to keep niggaz in line.
Never givin' a fuck,

Because I know that he's a nigga that you want to be.
He can't help it he's in shit,

I was 15... Well, the year after that, I killed this kid, Louie...

I knew this muthaphukka named Louie
Every day the nigga talk shit but today he tried to do me
He rolled down my block with a pistol and a stare
A black khaki suit and dooky brades in his hair
The muthaphukka think I'm slippin
But I got my gat and a bat and a 40 and I'm sippin
Waitin for the fool to get out the car
The stupid muthaphukka thinks I'm a star
But I'm not, I'm the type that kick the niggaz ass
Fast! Eazy E's a nigga that'll blast
Hold up, wait, the nigga started to load his gat
I grabbed my bat and ran around the back yo
He's at my window, thinkin' I'm playin' Nintendo
But the stupid nigga don't know I'm behind him so
He dropped the gat like a stupid muthaphukka
So I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger

She often want me to fuck her trampy ass on the beaches
But busta said yo peaches be fuckin' around with me
Instead o' fuckin' her man
She's butt-naked with my dick in her hand, yo
As soon as Peaches starts suckin, I saw this muthaphukkin
Nigga behind my car, and he was duckin
So I told the bitch to hold on (Hold on)
You stupid bitch, put yo muthaphukkin clothes on
I wonder if this nigga's tryin' ta jack me
'Cause I ain't got my gat with me, shit
The nigga started runnin' up fast
I thought he was gonna blast, so I hid behind her ass
She started howlin out ""wait"", I banked her in the face
But the punk nigga pulled out (?? mace ?)
He asked the stupid bitch did I mug her

I'm a muthaphukkin psycho and I don't give a fuck about'em
I kill the nigga and cut off his dick, so you know I got'em
Cut his vein ate his brain, left the nigga for dead
Now it's a gallon of blood, drippin from under his bed
(Oh, no! What happened to my lover ?)
Bitch I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger
Bitch tried to call the cops, fuck that
I gotta take the girl out with my muthaphukkin bat
'Cause I ain't doin' 10 in the pen
For a bitch and her dead-ass boyfriend
So... I gotta kill the ho
I'm reachin' for my weapon slow
That's when I notice some nigga standin by the door
The little nigga sayin' ""don't kill my mother"", so

Niggas ain't shit in the '90s, I don't trust 'em
And bitches on my dick like they ain't shit so motherfuck 'em
Eazy know what's up 'cause Eazy really don't give a fuck 
It don't concern me if it don't pertain to money or a nut
But then again I talk to a few of my friends
Nine times outta ten 'bout some ends or some skins
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that got to have it like a rabbit
Rappin' is my hustle, bustin' hoes is a habit
I stab it like a true no good nigga should
I do it the way a down OG nigga would
And now niggas know Eric Wright ain't no buster
Another platinum cut from the Compton thugster
My name is

Eazy motherfuckin' E, a real nigga, born and raised in motherfuckin' Compton
This one is dedicated to you buster-ass niggas 
You know who you are
Smoke a fat ass joint to this, bitch
I don't think I'm all this or that, but I'm all me
Original gangsta E-A-Z-Y-E
Down from the jump now I'm endin' with a bizzang
Still rollin' in my six-four on them thizzangs
Doin' wicked shit 'cause shit is wicked on the streets 
And from what my eyes see the wickedness will never cease
Bitches on my dick and you know I'm runnin' y'all
So you just sold your soul to the motherfuckin' devil's son-in-law
Wicked as could be, Eazy-E got the flow
Leavin' a smell of death on the row for sure
And a hoe can't make me or break me 
But she can take me to a motel and work a nigga's spell
'Cause I'm

Yeah, suck on these nuts, motherfuckers
Get with the real and quit fakin' the funk
And, oh yeah, stay off my dick 
Really though
I let my demons loose when I hit the 8 juice 
And I leave a trail of stiffs when I'm high off of spliffs
Niggas talk shit, so I talk a lot of shit too
Niggas wanna dis, fuck them and they whole crew
In fact, nigga, thank ya for stockin' a nigga's bank up
Yeah, I'm livin' square, but I'm a gangsta like Dresta
No, not the Doctor, physician, or the M.D.
Dresta's an OG, Doctor's a phony
Only the real real still can chill with me

Now that you got the album,
What the fuck are you gonna do with it,
BITCH BITCH Bitch bitch ...
Eazily I aproach, the microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it
And walk around the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and laugh
'Cause I'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the ho's are attracted
Because when I'm on hard my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old I was a nut
Now I need at least 3 ho's when I fuck
'Cause I do a check, nut 1 nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch
'Cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it I'm still talkin' shit
-=- CuT -=-
I told you that nigga was crazy
E boy, that's my boy, godamnit
-=- CuT -=-
I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One Sharon and the other one Shaun
I want to nut but which one do I want?
Shaun said Eazy let me fuck you blind
And Sharon said E I want to blow your mind
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the other pussy put it in the freezer
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Get out the ticket, I do it like that
So I told the ho's to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide and said
Here's what I'm gonna put inside
Grab it like a rabbit, grab it let's work it
But I won't love you,
When I'm done I'd still be talkin' shit ...
-=- CuT -=-
That boy'z good
Yeah that boy's good
That mothafucka'z talkin' all kinds of shit
I used to get pussy like eazy eric every day
You're mothafuckin' lyin'
How you know I'm mothafuckin' lyin'?
You're lyin', your dick can't get hard ...
Oh, suck my dick mothafucka
Nigga you lied
Who you're talkin' to..?
...
-=- CuT -=-
Dre : Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut that shit,
HEY YO YELLA BOY! wantcha REWIND IT!
-=- CuT -=-
Niggaz don't see I'm a 100% legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho'
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move, to skeaze me
Just to say ""I got fucked by Eazy""
So I slapped the ho' like a pimp
I might be a women-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about
All of y'all can just suck my dick
You can quote me now 'cause I'm still talkin' shit ...
-=- CuT -=-
The boy's good, I told you the boy's good
The nigga has talent
You don't know a damn thing
Yeah, I like that part, bring that shit back one more time, Maestro

But I break her cause the bitch is a faker
Or maybe she just don't know the formula of how to get rich quick without making happy dicks
That's all the bitch knows, how to be a mega hoe
I guess it just goes to show that she's to ignorant to know
That I won't be played or ganked or gaffled but I ain't perfect
I whip the dick out know and then and let 'em slurp it
But I'm careful bein aware of the bitches
That's torching niggas on purpose 'cause they think they deserve it
Yeah that's some cold shit, my experince oughta learn you
That if a nigga ain't tryin' to smoke you a bitch tryin' to burn you, so trust no bitch
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Let me hear it
(Playa Hamm)
I refuse to lose so I choose few and trust none
See my ladies I love, but to yous bitches I ain't the one
When I tell you to trust no bitch, it might not occur to you
Females ain't the only bitches that I'm referring to
See you can't help a bitch, let alone treat swell a bitch
Cause the bitch sold out, gonna sell out or the bitch gone snitch
Bitches wanna be and gonna always go be around
Watching what you're doing, tryin' to use you and keep you down
Playa Hamm ain't gonna bore you with a story you got your own
I'ma strengthen your conviction to get a dog a bone
And move on for the mothafucka'll fake you, fuck you
And make you take they punk bitch ass to the bank, fool
See bitches gets paid, see bitches got charm
I see 'em all at the mall, on TV and on my homies arm
Just some of my homies got bitches, but we breakin bitches, homie
So I come like this, bitch, act like you know
Trust no bitch
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
(Eazy-E)
Eazy-E, the muthafuckin maninpulator, when it comes to pussy holes
Just watch how my dick rolls
But since all hoes fall in that bitch category
Trustin no hooker ass bitches is mandatory
How much do you want bitch, how much can you take
Cause a nigga like the E you can't break
Put that skinny little ass in my face and I'll slap it
Whoop out my dick and let you lick before I tap it
My left hand's on your ass, my right hand's on your head
Cause bitches get the nut and niggas get the leg
Suckin my dick, lickin' my balls you make me come faster
Suckin my toes, lickin' my ass you know you are the master
Now you just won't stop
Suckin everybody's dick 'cause it's good to the last drop
But that shit won't phase me
I trust no car wreckin bitches, this one's for you Tracey
Trust no bitch
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
(AMG)
Pussy ain't nothin' but a hole that at nine do
So I'd rather make a mil while I'm sippin the cold brew
Bitches ain't shit, word to the dicky dicky dick
Eazy-E, PPC, AMG and Quik
Bitch I ain't Babyface so save your Whip Appeal
I never go on dates with broken bitches gets free meals
I'm supposed to pay the way to lucrative panty deals
Bitch please you better hit the knees or you can even touch your toes
'Cause I'm still playin' y'all punk hoes like dominoes
And if you suck the dick right and the pussy's tight
I might not beat you down till the second night
Once a dog always a dog bitch
You little trick tramp slut with the big butt
Cause you ain't shit bitch
I'd rather fuck you than love you
Cause bitch, I never trust you
Trust no bitch
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
(DJ Quik)

Hey yo Ren, let's do this...
(MC Ren)
People from everywhere gather around
Checkin' out the sound that Eazy is throwin' down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin' a way with dope styles
Yo Eazy, what ya gotta say?
(Eazy-e)
A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set
Hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal
Otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless
When I spot a sucka, I kill 'em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

Yeah 'cause this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just duz it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D
N.W.A., down with me
Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nothin' can avoid this shot 'cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckas on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

Yo, get this fool outta here!

Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it

Death row is looked upon as the studio gansters of the 90's
A joke hahahaha in a gamecalled 5 minutes of fame you wasted

Come one come all and let me ride nigga
Eazy-e cpt how the hell you figure
To be the best on the west hu ya
Fool loked down this is east side nigga
South comton and I put it on the map
So when a dog pound crip you wanna scrap
And that comin' straight from the ruthless gangster eazy-e
Now what would I do haha lets see
Now I would take on sugas locked down the row
Since Dre is a bitch pimp slap the hoe
Now I'm seeing doubles man two dogs in a huddle
Aa god dame now diggidi daze I biggidi blast
On right one and smoke that azz
Now kurupt don't even set trip
Yellin' long beach 60 blood and puppy pound
Crip really doe got my nuts on your chin
Whill I'm all in your philly hoe
So come with it fool and test your luck and
I'll beat that azz now call me kurupt
Now I'm kreepin threw the fog ya
Big dogg blue got my nine milla killa
Hunting a dogg named snoop
You can run nigga but you can't hide
Eazy-e straight creepin' on the east side 7
Tenlong beach south caught snoop free basin
In a rock house I kicks in da door
I said it befoe I never let no busta test me no more
Bang murder was the case that tey gave me
Murder waz the case that they gave me
I'll smoke all you fools even you boo boo and your baby
Murder was the case that they gave me watch out buddie boy
Watch your back
Yeah what would you do
What would you do if we rolled on you
(So don't even think about steppin in the god damn house)
What would you do what would you do if we rolled on you
What would you do what would you do if we rolled on you
What would you do what would you do dirty red
I comes on the snake hittin niggas low
With the cavey ass flow as I kreep through the street
Peeping niggas from death row bet you wanna know
Which one make the best hoe so
Let me break it down as I'm lost in the mist
And take word of advice and don't come fucking with this
Ain't a joke niggas choke from the smoke that I blaze
Purple haze you be dazed in a stun
I'll put you on your back nigga what?
I am the guess in a doggy dogg world
Never run with muss only nuts in their click
And dick in your mouth
The year is 95 and I'm runnin' the house
Now tell what can you do nigga what can you do
If me and a few of my homies came through
Dummpin real on you trickmade bitchmade niggas
What could you do what could you do if we rolled on you
Yaa so don't even think about stepin in the god damn house
Dr. Dre straight busta neva broke a law in his life
Besides beating up ricky harris's wife
Haha snoop dogg from a high top fade to sportin braids
Now he's laid fame no fourtune and getting played not paid
Played
Treated like a prostitute and we all know who's doin' the pimpin' daz don't
Be a followa be a leader and stay off the nexts man's nuts
Kurupt the king ping stick with the 60's

About to go up in ya but only you let um
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Death row really doe
Baby bang ah"
