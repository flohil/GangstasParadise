3,Another Day,1998,Kuruption! (1998),,Kurupt,"(Gangstas) let's spark up an idea, you know
(Gangstas) I don't know why you cats
(Gangstas) insist to get involved in our game man
I mean, drug money, thug money, it's all funny money to me
You know scared money don't make no money man, so you know
(Gangstas) if you scared stay out of the game, baby
Verse 1: kurupt
Another day, another dollar,
Another nigga jacked for his sack, jeans, and them collars
What the fuck makes life so complicated?
Why they playahatin, 'stead of congratulatin'
One of the homies just bought a new '64
And they mad about it, and talkin' bad about
Don't trip 'cause you smoke dubs and he smokes ounces
Your 'fo rolls and his 'fo bounces
Planted on the ground and this fool skyrockets
Got a nigga hot enough to want to shake his pockets (all that shit)
Roll like biggie, nigga, two glock nines
Any muthafucka whisperin about mine
All I got is, my twelve shottie
I'm a gangsta nigga, kurupt young gotti
Me and gonzoe and capone, with a chrome
And a bone with a zone fucked up gettin' blown (yeah)
(Don't it feel good to survive another day)
Scared money don't make no money, (hey)
Cause uh, drug money, thug money's funny money, (and uh)
(Don't it feel good to survive another day)
(Check it out) this fear money don't take no money
('Cause uh), scared money don't make no money ('cause uh)
Verse 2: capone
Now I was standin alone against the cold world outside
Without no place to hide, or no will to survive
Thinkin' who can I run to? basically
It was the big homie to go get the heat is what it come to
I look around, from the gate I've been down,
But I'm still broke as fuck, depressed and down
Sometimes I fuck around and wish I wasn't here today,
Now here to say sometimes it scares me to feel this way
Ain't there a name for this? ain't there a phrase that fits?
Ain't it called psycho, schizo, paranoia or some shit, trip?
With the mentality of a kid in the village of the damned
Walking through the hood with a gun in my hands
I had plans to be a superstar, rappin' the rock,
But all that stopped and dropped once the hammer was cocked
I had to get out of dodge, I ain't tryina hide
I'm just tryin' to find a way to stay alive and survive, right (right)
(Don't it feel good to survive another day)
Scared money don't make no money, (hey)
Cause uh, drug money, thug money's funny money, (and uh)
(Don't it feel good to survive another day)
(Check this out) this fear money don't take no money, (whu?)
('Cause uh), scared money don't make no money, ('cause uh)
Verse 3: gonzoe
Nigga gotta stay strong 'cause the weak die
Please God separate my life from the bad times, sufferin
Survivin ain't enough to cover it, 'cause I spend to much
Plus I'm scrapin the tops of my pies to make crusts
So kurupt, nigga tell me how I'm 'sposed to feel
Notice my attitude, drinkin', only smokin' the real
And it feels so good in the car with us
Lavishly, feel the extasy, bustin' a nut
Another day, a nigga worship his weed and alize,
And the pussy I'm fuckin' ? ? ? ?
And ain't no scars on my daytons, my shit intact
And that's real candy paint, all original lat'
It's so depressin, a thug with a hustle, no one messes,
And I'm destined I'm kissin' my gun so you can bless it, nigga
Another day another dollar
Yeah nigga, it's me, gonzoe
Don't act funny, haha
(Suprise) them promises didn't do nothing for me
(Suprise) it's time to set ourselves free
(Suprise) but as time marches on,
(Suprise) the races grow strong, stronger than ajax
(Suprise) and niggaz wanna be free, but they still watch TV
(Suprise), even though they can't see
(Suprise) and our Chinese brothers don't cop no pleas
(Suprise), for they're into unity isn't that
(Suprise) the way we want to be? but the man
(Suprise) watches the music, 'cause the black people are confused
(Suprise) conquered and divided, tricked and undecided
(Suprise), and the good guys are there
(Suprise), with slugs (hey) in the air but the rain still falls
(Suprise) and the (chorus) sun still rises and the man man
Man is still full of trickies (surprise niggas)"

5,Ask Yourself a Question,1998,Kuruption! (1998),,Kurupt,"Kurupt:
Check it out
Here's a penny for your thoughts, a nicklebag of bliss
An M-16 with eighteen clips
I'm all set to bust, treacherous
Illustrious, homie don't question us
Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question, nigga
How many niggaz can I blast on sight?
I'm ferocious, and you knows this nigga
Bitches wear skirts, shake ass and bump
I pop pistols, that's all I do
I pop one at him and pop two at you
I'm illusive, I'ma glutton
Pistol popping activist with the key to the bucket
I rip your pockets of the side of your pants
You glare to the side and you glance, I'm in my G-force stance
How the fuck you make it this far?
No matter where you at, or who you are
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
I hear ooh's and ah's when I jumps in my car
Just from last night you can tell
That I'm addicted to the fast life
Shouts out to my homeboys Mad and Quell
You go on and fuck Misty, while I fuck Michelle
Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question
How many niggaz can I blast on sight?
Just ask yourself the question
Is it cool to ride, or is it cool to fuck?
Just ask yourself the question
I don't know why these motherfuckers wanna fuck with us
What you wanna do, penetrate me?
Bump my crib? Bust and fuck my bitch, nigga?
I never thought a nigga would trip
Off a little piece of ass that he know he could get
Any day (any day) and any time (any time)
You'se a vegetarian (what?), I like beef, turkey and pork
Fish and chips, chips and dip
Fuck it, hand me my knife and my fork
I'm not too picky nigga, Kurupt young Gotti
A.K.A. Low Ricky nigga (what up momma?)
Substantialar, tyrannosaurus, gigantic titanic tarantula.
On a creep homie, wake up
Don't sleep homie, supposed to know it
Look, I'm hazardous to health, nigga, bitch, nigga
Don't ask me shit till you ask yourself
Chorus (Dre)
Dre:
What the fuck is up? Man life's a bitch
You gotta put your pistol to the sky,
Kill a million motherfuckers and get high in order to be cool
Man, you'se a motherfucking fool (speak to these niggaz)
I thought the same way, back in the days
Young, with a lack on daily things
Never thought too much, homie, never trip
I got drunk as fuck, the homies blaze sticks
Look out for them niggaz out to get you
So (???) forgetting to tank your pistol with you (your pistol nigga)
Niggaz get swallowed in the game
I cock and bust hollows to peer, duck and frame
Yo nigga, that shit sounds like I did it
Don't blaze the (???) without the (???)
Niggaz look like they're doped up like tired bitches
With the eyes wide gone you spit the hard boom
Wiping shit the fuck out like typhoons
With the little homeboys, T-bone and cartoons
Motherfucker don't ask me for shit
Fuck everything you believe in, little bitch
Kurupt:
What, what?"

8,"Bounce, Rock, Skate",2010,Streetlights (2010),,Kurupt,"(Snoop Dogg)
I took two nickels and made a dime out it
I took two words and made a rhyme out it
It's hard to explain it, but I did it while I'm tainted
Steady rippin' while I'm crippin', dip the shine out
I check my rear view
I tip it down a little, just to get a clear view
I got the pigs on me, I got the dips on em
So I slide, swerve, and try to dip on em
Make a smooth getaway, so clean
My windows smoke green, my endo super supreme
When the lights hit the bitch that shit turns green
But in the daytime, that motherfucker whip cream

So we can bounce, rock, rollerskate and
Dippin' down the shore on platinum Daytons
(Terrace Martin)
My eyes like a strobe light, won't stop blinking
Brain like a stop sign, can't stop thinking
Six shots of Patron
Fall back at the mouth, now you know it's on
Lex pass my cellphone, so I can hit Big Snoop and Quik
Stroll to the valley 'cause it's time to dip
And the DJ didn't already play our shit
(DJ Quik)
A little bit of Quik is worth all you've got
Life is like a pussy, you should your shot
My foot is in my pool behind my big ass crib
Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, no coke, Mr. Pibb
When there ain't a menage on the back of my spot
Bad bitches just lounging, only bottoms, no bra
Ponytail on my neck, who do I think I am?
Reggae music is blasting, eight is down to a gram
Now let's go to your hood, MTV playin' jams
Niggas wearin' your couch down, wishing they were I am
You're the colour of money, and your weed looks like Autumn
And the pockets on your jeans look like they did when you bought em
I feel you nigga, I hate me too
I wish you could make these bossy player moves that I do
I'm exotic, I'm eccentric, I'm erotic relentless
And if Snoop Dogg is the king then you know who the prince is
Now crown me the Quikness
Terrace Martin, Kurupt Young Gotti, now this is senseless
Who in the world would've thought that we would get this?
Know what I think?
I think your counterfeit rapper printer is all out of ink
You missed the glory days
Not to be told when the story's phased
Cut you in the days
Chickens open up their legs and give me all their eggs
Blame them and blame me
And fuck it for that sanctity and hopin' I done pull out when I came
(Terrace Martin)
My coup baby blue
Aye Snoop, what it do?
Aye Quik, where it's at?
Kurupt start the 'Lac
So we can bounce, rock, rollerskate and
Dippin' down the shore on platinum Daytons
(Kurupt)
You call that swag? I call that jag
Snatch off with a couple scuffles, chickens, and duffle bags
Mathematician calculating ounces and grams
Miami the Amityville, skittles and candymen
High off of all types; the vikes to the sands
Yeah, hunna stunna, demonish candyman
What up? The iron in any hand
Crush 'em like soda cans
Aroma or green the tan as the kush burns man
The bird in the hand and some urine in the bush
Fricking seeing these Vaseline bunny rappin' rabbits
It's a habbit
(Terrace Martin)
My coup baby blue
Aye Snoop, what it do?
Aye Quik, where it's at?
Kurupt start the 'Lac
So we can bounce, rock, rollerskate and
Dippin' down the shore on platinum Daytons"
9,Bring Back That G,2001,Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey (2001),,Kurupt,"Ride, ride, rough, ride on, ride on
Roll on, roll on, what, what, what?
Ride on, ride on, roll on
Nigga, what, what, what, what? Ride on
This is the game you wanna spit to a nigga
Let a nigga know it's all right, cascades
And G'z stompin' on niggas like parades
Escapades and charades played when the stampede stopped
And it continuously
Young Gotti seen so many bodies
Drop fours, hop classics and drastic measures
Principle's a pleasure and penal endeavors
Whatever the case, whatever case, it's caught on a chase
When a chase, it began in the facial of race
Me and Fred, he make beats, I make rhymes
And Snoop, he controls and calculates
Impervious moves, the Pound Pentagon
Wit a pistols, I holla where the gangstas' at
Daz poppin' his collar, nigga, sweet and sour
Pop Chucks and collars
Rollin' through the streets in my '84 Impala
Holla, holla, if you wanna, we gon' run it from the co'na
It's the killa California, ya see
I do it to ya 'cause I know ya screw it, you do up, tryna do us
But you can't because you lovin' this beat
We dump, dump to make you pump, pump
We comin' wit the heat to make ya trunk bump
Freddy said he had a whole a gritty down to go steady
And stick up Eddie for his fedy
And bring it all back to daddy
I want bread, cheese, now put it on the patty
Knick knack style, kick back and flip files
In the verge and now listen here, honey child
Bow wow, do ya now, how ya like it, doggystyle?
Smile and grinnin', sippin' on some gin'n
Roll wit a cap and y'all strapped in
Once ya back in, it's straight mackin', I keep it crackin'
This is how we all get down
Bring back that G shit fo' me
This is how we all get down
Bring back that G shit fo' me
This is how we all get down
Bring back that G shit fo' me
This is how we all get down
Bring back that G shit fo' me
I know I slept you, kept ya, finna fetch you
Snatch you back too, slapped you and rapped too
The vacuum sat 'chu and rat packed you, act two
Now what must I do?
To get you back to the way is used to see
DPG C'ology
I'm not talkin' 'bout chemistry or biology
This G-ology, you feelin' me?
Niggas be killin' me and willin' me
Silly, he thinkin' y'all gon' smash on me
Blast on me, the audacity
I'll take ya back to the ol' school
And let ya cut class wit me
Get some ass wit me
Then get us somethin' to drink
And let you sip out the same glass as me
And now you feelin' like a killa
And it was all over weed and a tall can of Miller
Illa, kill a nigga like a flea
Big Snoopy D O double gizzle
Way off tha hizzle, my nizzle
I hit niggas and bitches if you fuck wit my mental
'Cause I'm a killa and stick release ya pop like a pimple
If you don't got my money, I suggest you run
'Cause the Gold Loc, he do you like a 20 or done
Ain't no fun the way I play, nigga, I plays fo' keeps
No details, you've just been sweeped to sleep
Locations, directions, not even a trace
Bitch, I doubt it, if ya body get found like waste
In the alley, killa Cali 'cause Eastside is Crips
Never slip, set trip and smoke chronic dip, 'cause
This is how we all get down
Bring back that G shit fo' me
This is how we all get down
Bring back that G shit fo' me
This is how we all get down
Bring back that G shit fo' me
This is how we all get down
Bring back that G shit fo' me
Snoop Doggy Dogg is gonna do ya
Fredwreck got the reefers bumpin' through ya
Goldie Loc can put the G and the C

Heh-heh

I ain't mad at 'cha (I ain't mad at 'cha)
You ain't mad at me (you ain't mad at me)
After all this bullshit, it's nonsense, no time for that
(Spider)
Niggaz upset me from buckin, they ride in Rolls
While these bitch niggaz tucked in, hidin rolls
Don't speak on it nigga, collide in blows
But be careful, the fo' can hide and close
In an instant, your chest can divide in holes
It's cruicial, but that's how this ridin' goes
Ain't a nigga out here Eastsidin knows
It's a no-no, must not confide in hoes
I roll low-lows, love how it glide and glows
Provided by the fact I supply them O's
I'm the coldest in the streets, that's why they chose
What MC live and dies by they flows?
I grew, fought hard for the line I drew in the yard
And all must regard I'm true
Till I'm through, I push it from my point of view
High off cush and the tires on the two
Hood gospel, from the in hood apostle
Paintin pictures, lyrical Picasso
In and out of Wasco for packin a rosco
Plus I'm pushin more products than CostCo
Guard your grill, your jaw hard to heal
And my hands will leave you scarred with skill
Got my feelings pushed down too far to feel
And I never spit rounds out the car to kill
Talk is cheap, I'ma stalk and creep
Like a hawk, leave chalk when I walk the street
Talk is cheap, I'ma stalk and creep
Like a hawk, leave chalk when I walk the street
(Repeat 4X)
I am, al-ways, there
You are, ne-ver, there
(Eastwood)
Baby I'm all about my scrilla and seein figures paintin the perfect picture
With my mind on this crazy life, workin what I was given
Two sisters, three brothers, no father loved my mother
Cause my daddy wasn't there for the times that I struggled
Yeah I lost my G-moms and it hurt so bad
But rest in peace and let your soul fly free I ain't sad
I got this thug shit runnin' through my veins, Lord watch me
So many they try to copy a natural kamikaze
You can never walk the shoes of 'Wood, I'm a natural born leader
And plus I been discovered by Suge
So please believe it homey, I ain't gon' change for shit
It's Death Row, the millennium clique, self-made nigga

I am, al-ways, there
You are, ne-ver, there"

Verse 1: Kurupt
Saggin, nigga g'd up, sippin

Cash gettin', hash hitten
Gang bang afiliate

And in a minute start killin' shit real quick
Ima million dollar motherfuckin nigga (million dollar motherfuckin nigga)

Get cha' boogie on youngsta, c-walk homie
Get cha' walk on, c-walk homie, c-walk homie
Get cha' walk on, c-walk homie
Verse 2: Tray Deee
Yeah ima tell you like this Kurupt, you know how it was for me
Been regarded as the hardest since I hit the set
Young nigga with a rep, kept that gangsta step
Crocka sacs of blue cordiroy with house shoes on
Flawssin for the hoodrats gettin' my groove on
Hangin' in the park till all hours of dark
Tryna catch a mark slippin wit this thang that bark
Cry baby on the swamp got the exit locked
And ain't no doubt comin' out he gone wreck ya not
Pass me the satin locs so I can wet my throat
While I sag the blue khakiswit tha raoder coat
All the hoes really want is gangstaz just like us
Ruff and don't give a fuck ain't that right Kurupt (thas right)
Stay bangin' on these niggaz on a regular basis
Big paper chasin, facin felony cases
Made it to be famous, livin' hard and dangerous
Steppin on these bustaz wit my blue chuck taylors
Verse 3: Slip Capone
You know that ganstaz rock, gangstaz roll
Heres the gangsta shit, we on a gangsta stroll
Its gangstaz ride, gangstaz slide
Then the gangstaz rob with the gangsta glide
'Cause gangstaz move, and gangstaz groove
And most gangstaz got nothin' ta lose
Gangstaz live, and gangstaz die
Gangstaz form a gang and the gang multiply
Gangstaz give a fuck a g, don't ask why
Gangstaz don't snitch, and gangstaz don't cry
Gangstaz boogie, gangstaz don't dance
Gangsta pull the strap out cha' pants and blast
Gangstaz don't run, and gangstaz don't hide
Ima gangsta ass nigga from the sick southside
That's how I know exactly what a gangsta do
Ya love the gangsta shit ain't you a gangsta too?
Then c-walk homie

Metropolis crumble, apocalypse mo' lines surround and dine
Let loose in at least a Nam, calculate keep time
Finish the World War I've been a star
The knock quiminitar (?), strange and restrain
Retired and rewired, melodically molecules
Strategy and logic enables our positions then points us missiles
All sided equal... deeper than pistols
For instance... unknown the science of forensics
Get your backpacked like ten sticks
Hit like ten sticks hit with the effect of tense ticks inglow (?) sticks
(Kurupt) Baby this is it
(Daz)
It's on tonight
We came in here to fuck it up with a shootout or fight...
Boop boop hap hap, nigga it's on tonight
We came in here to fuck it up with a shootout or fight
(Kurupt)
Nigga you want war? Yeah right, I'm mic sky like stiletto
Holocaust to high school, roscoe to Vasco
Impossible lives the hospitalized
Franchise strip niggas is broke for ranches mansions avalanches
Alarms ring cause harm in court
Like platinum and gold
I've sold a whole, explosions hit explode implode
Popped out bodies dropped off on Rider's road
I've seen and foreseen the unseen
And able hardly able to separate the myths from fables
I'ma buy a Baltic while you purchase fireplaces
Poisonous supply and occupy in space
The midnight I could hide the dark until the spark
Light up the night nothing everything in sight
I'ma cross the finish line with both legs broken
Flow coke broken both toke smokin' (wha?)
Daz dilly machine dean two shottie
The life of a party is a live scene
Gastra... neo kung-fu niastra
Monsoons swarm en route like harpoons
Young black Sinatra analytical ANTRA
A million percent proof bound to found the youth
Uncrude uncoil bubble and boil turmoil
Don't specialize and ill crack your bones
Now fuck with that (automatic cardiac attack)
Forced to front in your chest back, (?) no raptor arab (?)
Kuruption! Yeah that's me!
New word to the dome, cyclone stallone
Stainless steel momomamamarron (?)
Get done cloned and choke in stone

Yeah and that's how we doin' this shit

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Kurupt:
G'd up, we're back, that's what I keep hearing
We ain't never went nowhere fool (what?)
Better ask your folks about the D-O-double G's
How long could the war last on a warpath?
We're still heat nigga, still signing autographs
Still hitting the stash, and pulling pistols out to dash
The poetical poltergeist, verbal Jerry Weiss
Fuck the ice, give me a mic and let's see who's the nicest
I fuck around and call it crisis
With preciseness, and precisely this
See we make the shit that precisely hits.
So how soon could you pump up the volume
Hand you your ends and pump up my album
Get yours, I call the fucking holocaust
I'm out to get mine, get yours, snatching anything yours
Cocking back your name, blasting anything
Yo, Tha Dogg Pound gang, where all the G's hang
It's impossible not for that ass to end up in a hospital
G-R, Gang Related, and we are
We are (fresh) (repeat)
I spit poison, poisonous darts
I aim, bomb and charge
One rhyme will hold your pose and stop your heart
Stop to talk, start to walk, and never walk again
Legs broken, just played loc, zoning broke and crushed
Touched, bust open, get hit like the four winds
Up against four assassins, the four horsemen of rapping
I gotta pinch my self to make sure I ain't dreaming
'Cause I just saw the homie bring an M-16 in (booya!)
I fade in to see how Baby sparks
No ifs, ands or maybe's, Baby barks
Turn on the daylight, pitch black thoughts
I pitch back sparks when the get back starts
This is it, we're 'bout to show you how to do shit
DPG completely, running through shit
We are (fresh) (repeat)
Break it down

Come on, sing it)
It's just a gangsta party
Kurupt:
Supa dupa, said you was seductive, psycho psychotic, psycho somatic
Psycho's with automatics, the aftermath with the poetical psychopath
And I might go slow, and I might go fast, and I might go burst
Then I might go last, thinking I might not bust
And I just might just blast
Or I might just whoop the skin of your ass, if you cross or pass
You know I'm the rawest MC with it
Fuck jiggy nigga, I'm DP with it
I've been the bombstrike, like the motherfucking pentagon
Napalm verses disperses to all the mental gone
Mack 10-ing dunn, separate and lick a mind
Tear them in the zone in his leg, ain't bust his head
Keep busting till he's dead
D-A-Z with the bombest in the country, taking lead on the street
What you got, flame or some heat?
Do you incinerate, or make it hot, he got (???)
Powerful, strong or weak?

Where your rivals always wanna make it seem

You know exactly what it is (you know!)
You know exactly how it's gonna be (ha) haha (you'll never catch me fool)
What, five lessons, five chapters, I'ma start
How you gonna make a couple dollars
When you roam in zones filled with cowards
Ain't no way to make no real cash nigga
Conceal your canning, all you do is flash nigga (motherfucker)
I can tell, fool, you'll never get paid
'Cause niggaz like you ain't got no real game
With all them niggaz that you got by your side
You learned by yourself that the only way to ride
I'ma put you up on (game)
This whole world revolves around (game)
Pure indeed game, and let it obtain
I roll with my girl and weeds
All oversees with loot like I'm flipping keys
I heard niggaz gonna catch me on a slipping tip
Come through with the auto's, cock, flip and shit (hell no)
But I knew from the giddy-up, like EST
And got rid off my fo'-fifty and my G.S.3
I got...
(Game) This whole world revolves around
(Game) Pure indeed game, and let it obtain
Once you realize you'll never live without (game)
Get paid without, no moves made without (game)
It's the force, the call of the holocaust
Go against the source, end up lost
The portrait of a wild puma
Silent penetration like poison, pinpointing
Isolating hearts, poetical poisonous darts
Puncture like needles, I always take care of my peoples
Verbals vital, no rivals, there's no equals, no sequels
With no one to help us
I'll leave you crying for help and helpless and healthless, wealthless
Oversellers envious and jealous
Bitches and sneaks, pants and muscles
I saw a view through the eyes
Fake ass, bitch ass niggaz in disguise
Keep calm, release the neutron napalm bomb on young hawks
Splitting wigs like logs, cloudy visions like fogs
When the pump gets to pumping,
Niggaz get to jumping like frogs, smoke like bungs
Get to stepping, stepping with your weapon
Pause, creep crapped and left in the puddle in seconds
Fuck 'em with veterans, with game...
One time, on time
Give it to me all, 'cause I want it all
Give it to me all, 'cause I love to brawl
Give it to me all, 'cause I want it all
One time, yeah I love to brawl
One time (give it up), one time (give it up)
Check it out
It's hard to sustain and maintain through life
With these motherfuckers throwing niggaz three strikes
The homie big Lou got a fo' on deez
That's the word, came up from flipping birds
Words travel like black talents
The homie's loud at silence, real G's move in silence
How you gonna make it to the next stage
If one second you're broke, the next minute paid
Now you got the police planning
Niggaz on the street scanning, loading up cannons
If it was me, I'd move silently
Prepare warfare, react violently
Lou is too flashy, new clothes
(???) With hoes, and got penetrated
He had too many hoes knowing where he resides
Soon as he got home niggaz was waiting in sight, no game
Shh...
Know what?"

Mack milli's, mack 11's and four-four's
Me and my nigga Shawn
What you got weight on your shoulders
The freons gettin' colder
Me and my nigga Deion's hittin corners
I got a beam on you chest-high
Fuck around and get your fuckin' chest right
I spreads like bad news
Bitches get played like the blues
Blowin' dicks like whistles
Launch like missles
Pop like pistols
And confuse, misuse, enthuse, abuse, buy the twos
'Cause I refuse to chill like EP
I prefer to get high live with the DP
You ain't raw nigga You more like subtle
Fuck you and your rebuttal You laid in a puddle
It's a storm, form reform your label form
Keep calm or keep drippin in the twist of the swarm
Kurupt, young Gotti
West Coast, East Coast nigga
Raw doggs

24,Hate on Me,2001,Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey (2001),,Kurupt,"(Verse 1: Soopafly)
Eh yo, if rappin' was a bitch you'd have no pussy
Maybe tongue kissin', but still no pussy
Lookin' at me dumb I'll slap you so dizzy
Suppa so busy cockin' the 4 fizzy
Mad 'cause I'm too fly, and I pumped your ho
Crushed your flow you got jealous club me for
I sensed the hate, I used my optical
You was too close around when I pocket doe
First came the wishin', then came the bitchin'
Wanna know the secrets comin' from the kitchen
I was fine dinin', you was eatin' chicken
I'll bust a bad ho, nigger take your pickin'
Like a slut callin' bitches on my cell phone
But my bitches, try to take my fly bitches
I ain't just trippin', I can't trust niggas who ain't us
Bringin' niggas who can't bust
I'm A+ wid it, I'm anxious to crush ya
Half tustla mixed with you just a busta
Bitch ass niggas get me rich fast quicka
Now don't tricka this Supa ass kicka
Why do you hate on me
'Cause I don't be trippin' off you
My image is stuck on ""G""
Try to fuck with me this year...""Get the 'beep' outta here!""
I'm so up on my shit
These bitches ain't gettin' my grip
So I still remain a ""G""
But why do you hate on me
(Verse 2: Damani)
How you gone hate on me
And I'm that nigga that ride beats smoother than Ron Isley
Talkin' bout fuck Damani but steady eyein' me
Steady tryin' to see how good sex with me could be
""Why won't you let me fuck?""
And I'm the best thing goin', and you the best thing hoin'
Plus we got you on tape givin' head in slow motion
Undercover ho's be real soft spoken
""Why would you slash my tire?""
And I got stock in Goodyear, bitch I'm all good year
Tryin' to fuck up my clutch so I'm forced to change gears
Darkskin, go-tee with no beard
I change ho's like I change clothes
Young devil in the city o' angels
Keep it ghetto like cups with staples
Live from L.A. gettin' head from Rachel. Now...
(Verse 3: Kurupt)
Why do bitches blow dicks?
I don't know that but I can tell you dis, you simple trick
""Now you get it all you want.""
We roll joints we don't fuck with blunts, fuck a blunt now
""Some niggas is worse than ho's""
Holdin' somethin' on your chest let it go
I'll make a bitch blow balls like a ball and sing that song (echoes)...but naked
Most o' y'all niggas be break and hatin' records
The most hatin' done in 8.5 seconds
Why you hatin' Snoopy, you hate Nate and hate me
Why you hatin' stupid and hatin' on Warren G
Why you hatin' Rasco, why you hate Damani
'Cause he wanna fuck Armani and don't wear Armani
Hatin' Gondee and hatin' Tre-dee, Tre-dee is like fuck'em if they hatin' the ""G""
Fuck y'all"

Chorus: Kurupt
Now this this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a hoe that he like
But you can't make a hoe a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what you found you a hoe that you like
But you can't make a hoe a housewife (wife)
(Dr. Dre)
I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she bout to trip
(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty
You pimpin' strong, but comin' home, to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy, I take advantage
All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin' Spanish
I'm mannish - get yo' nails out my back
Slut I'm bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat
Learn the player rules, this is how I play a dude
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin' shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin' to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick huh, got her turnin' tricks huh
Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin
I left her up in Dallas, Texas - assed-out
(Hittman)
Naw hoe is short for honey, almost had her Wailin like Bunny
Tellin' tales of bein pregnant, catchin Norstrom sales with abortion money
I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her
Now we got beef, he caught up in the hoe's erotica
Exotic - she's psychotic, rockin' his Nautica
Soon he'll need antibiotics (sucka bitch)
Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody
You be like, ""Damn how could she hit me off with chlamydia?""
Fool I pity ya
We live in the city off, ballers
With more bouncin' than a Zapp, she will doo-wah-diddy-ya
Prettier to grittier, the wittier can get her
To the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like, Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post hoe, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico
(Kurupt)
At the ho-tel, mo-tel, or the Holiday Inn (say what nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin' up (beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggaz need to stop fuckin' with O.J.
Some niggaz bang blood, some niggaz bang crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had to dream of hoes, I had to scream at hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
If you blew my balls, right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin', I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The hoe started callin when I started boss ballin
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (what?)
I knew you would, you wish you could

Suckers!

How many real homeboys y'all got out there?
Can y'all count on one hand? I can
Straight up, Dogg Pound Gangstas
Funky fresh in the flesh
Yeah
That's what I'm talking about
Yo Kurupt, kick that!
(Kurupt)
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Although at times it seems
Trying to make it to different stages, lights and dreams
Different mistakes that was made during the time of the struggle
Two pits unleashed, but held by one muzzle
It's complicated like a puzzle
Puzzle pieces and money double
????????? Really in trouble
I'ma hit the spot and snatch all the knots and pots
Then get ghost by the most of y'all get ?gostic?
Get the fuck out of here!
Ain't no body else I can call (who dat?)
Besides my motherfucking doggs
I ain't shit without my homeboyz
(Daz)
When there's trouble who the fuck can you rely on to die on
On sight, me and my niggas do it wrong or right
I ignite, the fire, marijuana get's me higher
Always drinking and smoking Philly's
Getting a nigga wild
Gettin' paid, that's my only desire
Big Style, Lil' Floss, Tray Dee and me
K-U-R-U-P-T, Soopafly and Crooked Eye
Until then
I hope God don't pass me by
Every day I work harder to try
Never to fall
But I often rise!
Every day before I open my eyes
To my cousin Big Flip locked down in the pen
To my other homeboyz I won't ever see again
Like gone in the wind
Like a lottery spin
When it comes down to it
Nigga, who's your foes and your friends?
I ain't shit without my homeboyz
(Crooked Eye)
So what could make a crook stay down for his troop
Could it be the gunshots we ducked as a youth huh?
What about the cops we hid from on the roof
Or the shootouts we survived without wearing a bulletproof
We fruits from a tree that was rotten to the root
We wasn't supposed to make it our survival don't compute
I had to chase the paper cause the loot would run from me
We had navigator dreams and only bust money
We rise and we fall together, all together
We brawl and we ball together
Doggs forever
Like Uh (lots of people) And you don't stop!
Fuck around with one of the homies
Watch the glock pop!
One love and keep hollering back
We could split my last dollar in fact
Pop your collar to that
Crooked Eye need a whole click
And like ""folls and giblets""
That's some cold shit. my nigga, some cold shit
(Soopafly)
Cold shit when you elevate and get into some more shit
When we ride together niggas be like ""Oh Shit!""
Dogg Pound in the house, rockin' the party
(Lots of people) All night long!
Gettin' high till the break of dawn
Chipped up like a cellular phone
Back up, watch it shine like chrome
And division when you in this shit
But together we can't be fucked with, crush shit
Never settle for less then the plush shit
But still don't forget when we was broke
About nine or ten lokes, with only one joint to smoke
Man, I can count on both hands
The different stands and planes
Niggaz took to make it better for the fam
We made our first five grand, was like god damn
New khakis and cortese
We learned the essential meaning of what a whore is
Still clockin more biz
Always looking up, 'cause if you look down your fucked
Soopafly ????? and chucks, but I ain't shit without my homeboyz
(Overlapping last line, sung)
Please believe I ain't shit without my homeboyz (and that's real shit)
I ain't nothing without my homeboyz (I ain't shit without my homeboyz)
(Slip Capone)
Shit, not Capone
Real niggaz I knew before I was grown
A lot of motherfuckers died
But I'ma still ride
And represent the evil motherfuckin westside
It ain't nothing but trues
Real niggaz that paid the dues
Picture me rollin' with gay dudes
Nigga please, we g's and dress like we serve keys
On the block where we chopped rocks, we copped and made g's
Down to die for each other
Cause you and I for each other
In a gangster matrimony we brothers
Can't nothing separate gang
We ganged from intiation to marks
Fuck around and catch she sparks
Cause see no gangsta gang

Slow down down here, don't make too much noise
You know who runs the blocks round here

Psychosomatic, automatic static
Catatonic, supersonic, bubonic chronic addict
Astrononimcal in the Thunderdome center
In the depths of the dungeon, dangerous, dastardly
Catastrophes, metamorphosize into a pit
Tyranno-Don, crackin' the bricks on the walls
Camouflage, on the side of livest
Bout to put somethin' up in that could ride
It's time for, world war three motherfucker
You know me, Young Got-ti motherfucker
I holds the microphone like a grudge
In the 'llac laid back, so back the fuck up
This might give you a heart attack
It's real simple, can't get mo' simple than that
Than that...
(Kurupt)
The tactical acrobatical automatic
Automatically psychosomatics that got it verbally guided
Visually you ride it Super like the Sonics
Potent like gin and tonic being injected through the veins
With double dosage of liquid chronic (WHAT?)
Columbian flake, the top rate
Irate lost mental state
Stallion I'm want about a million or more
Of y'all fools to come back and get some more
You can tell the gangs as soon as he come in the door
He don't wear Calvin Klein, he won't wear valour
He got some Gortex or some Converse on
All-Stars, G'd from the hat to the floor
You can miss me, I'm probably chillin' up in Mississippi
Or Poughkeepsie or Baton Rouge guzzlin whiskey
I'm a walkin' franchise and I wanna get paid
Get dropped, mopped and stomped like a parade
Persuasion, phase three of the invasion
I gots to break loose 'cause I'm feelin' caged in
Loose in the jungle, blaze a botanical garden up
Nowadays, niggaz ain't hard enough
To bombard and bogart, spots like these
Renegade revolutionary infantries
I'll bet a thousand to one, you're never gonna make it
You're never gonna get it, y'all can't fuck wit us
Put it together, our squad 1999 Mod Squad
Universal Soldiers, I thought I told ya
(Roscoe)
I'm a chart smasher, the youngest gangster rapper
Spectacular, chrome thirty-eight packer
Money stacker, t-shirt cakalaka
Verbal predator, fake rap attacker
Gotti jawbreaker, Roscoe the back cracker
Money makin', we smart like computer hackers
I came in this game with plans to get it maxed
And my enemies, feel the wrath of my rapture
No escapin without, instantaneous capture
Don't be upset, when me and the homies jack ya
'Cause we straight jackin, if I say it's on it's crackin'
Young thugs, from Y.A., we make it happen
Swearin y'all can see me but that's just like seein Elvis
I grab to crick a back and crack a nigga 'cross the pelvis
My rhymes is dangerous, hazardous to health
I make a nigga murder twenty kids and cap his own self
Who am I? The incorrigible lyrical miracle
Is horrible yet hysterical the way I'll embarrass you
See me on the streets, walk by and I just stare at you
Tough talk, when there's bullets flyin through the air at you
Test your chest nigga? One less nigga
Me and Kurupt share two gats and one vest nigga
We astronomical, phenomenal, magical, mathematical
Taking your first-born as collateral!

Mic accurate, trade darts TL
Slight tint DL, quick flash
Smooth as a baby's ass,
Lyrical addicts, murder mics like a savage
And MO30, bullet proof tuxedos
Transactions, C-notes for the kilos
'Bout our money, killa bees love the honey
Puttin' a sting, on warriors in the ring
Get mashed out initiation face slashed out
Block dropper, drama action like I won an Oscar
Eye on me, feds spy on me
It's them cops in the choppers that play the roof
Ready to snipe, stay bulletproof
Ease up on the over proof
Level head the liable and leave ya for dead
Fill fulla lead
Incidents, classified accidents
No evidence, po-po innocent crime pays
I guess it's the American ways
Far from slaves,
Yet behind bars and cage
Fair exchange clicked ya bow wid ya 12-gauge
(Verse 2: Baby S)
It's time for me to do this shit for all my years hurtin'
See these other niggas bustin' raps that ain't workin'
I'm jerkin' the game, heavyweight pocket exchange
Touch my niggas that's broke and hope them niggas do the same
Pause, squeeze ya balls wid no draws
Down for the cause and hoes takin' off they draws
Y'all, niggas, ain't knowin' the half
Everywhere I go feel like I'm runnin' from crash
My intention to smash fast plex on elevators
Sacked a hell a haters crime raider on the fader
I'm major now, women hit me on my pager
While I'm puffin' on the bombay,
The vietnam way... pimpin' in a calm way
And rule one, never let a bitch know where your baby mom's stay
Now if you see me creepin' thorugh SC
Just walk on by, nigga, just walk on by
Before you fuck up my high

Escort physicians to the spot you and I met rep for combat
Where the bomb at, chop up on that

Holla when you've perfected ya aimin'
Ready for a taming

Motherfuckin' small cat, beat wid pipes poles and bats

And the board and the paper and paint a picture

Yo, yo, verbal seizures
Coming from the black Johnny Fever
You bought your heater turn like Tina when Ike beat her
We kidnapped ya girl and ain't feed her she's a heavy bleeder,
At this point you realise that you ain't really need her
Cats that get it betta stand on they pivot
Life is rigid from the business and pleasure, when you miss it
Oh well forget it wipe my pinkie ring when you kissed it
Couldn't keep ya distance, so things was done deliberate
A G-thing, this cost cash is not a free thing
When we sing that's when they bring the jealousy thing
But that alerts me, the low and dirty wanna hurt me
They equal to the numbers on Robert Paris jersey
Blood thirsty ten O.Gs in black derbys
We throw things, I got a arm like Testa Verdy
It's Drex Andretti the live lyrical compulsive
Betta contact ya physician for over dosage
You lost ya focus, realise what you get
A little bit of good shit
And alot of bullshit,
Now you wounded,
So you got exactly what you earned
You gon' fool wid the Drex it's like a tax return
When I'm in the 2-F-I-V-E
Just walk on by, just walk on by
Before you fuck up my high
Before you fuck up my high
Before you fuck up my high
Before you fuck up my high
If you see me in the NYC
Just walk on by, nigga, just walk on by
Before you fuck up my high
Before you fuck up my high
Before you fuck up my high
Before you fuck up my high
Before you fuck up my high
Fuck up my high
(Alot of mixed up talkin' and shoutin')
All I wanna say,
Fuck these niggas man!
Yo, first of all,
After all this is over,
We still all go to sleep,
And we still wake up in the morning,
So give thanks to God,
'Cause he loves us

Look... I'm shitting on niggas
Magma, rock hot lava Prada attire
Fire starter from barter carve a live wire
Fly-er, all fire, sire, murder for hire
I'm smashing on niggas
Castrate, eliminate, obliviate, interrogate
Assassinate, .38 blasting on niggas
Four blocks flipping spazing on niggas
I'm like fuck y'all niggas
Slow motion coasting ocean water flow
So out of the ordinary, canary diamond exquisite listen
The wizardry of a wizard, extensive pimping
I'm sick of this shit
Time to get another whip and get another bitch
Time to flip another gig and flip another bitch
So the bitches friend make them both suck a niggas dick
(Xzibit)
King pin Kurupt
The federal reserve, In Gotti We Trust
We hit them up like (bird call like whistle)
What's cracking
You get no love. No passes. No action
That's what popping. What it is. What's happening
Ganstas smash for respect. Fuck asking
The last man laughing. The last man standing
Kurupt Young Gotti with a cannon
God dammit let's get it!
(Kurupt)
Look... You can line 'em all up
Remind them all what the fuck Kurupt done
Arsonist terroristic mental lyrical past time
Spitting darts at your heart
What y'all spitting's asinine
Yeah, ayo its no doubt
Your ho'll scream and shout I turn this motherfucker out
I'm chromed up and ready, I'm bullet proof and heavy artillery
My chevy I'm steady rocking, I'm ready baby
Ain't nobody gon stop this feeling
Dumping thunder bumping common suits and villains
They got me under surveillance
Cadence interchanging, radiating and vaguing
Pussy poetry rating, electrifying I'm slept on
Stepped on, creeping, crept on but I'm ready
Nice advice ya ice is nice I slash and slice
I paid the price, I'll take your life
Motherfucker!"
40,Intro,2010,Streetlights (2010),,Kurupt,"This is ridiculous, man, you know
I told-hey, this that sober flow, yo
This that shit, man, that just make you sit and say ""Damn... Kurupt!""
Hey, enjoy yourself
This is a party, and it's in the West Coast!
That's the shocker, right?
Hey, look, I ain't gonna tell you again
Hahaha, look...
Born and bred it, I stay breaded
Let it be, spin it on the needles, inject it
Intravenous, affect them like Lennon in The Beatles Project it like projectiles in loaded weapons
Like my mind's my Gatling gun
I inject the mike, I consider it a favor if you save it
The bullshit, I stay churching in the pulpit
Akhi watch me like white folks watch hockey
I'm in Hawaii sipping sake with Chris and Maki
Talking bout stocks and bonds, and cheddar and broccoli
Famous? I'd rather be broke
With nothing to lose, under the radar
Hoping to be like these niggas I see on TV
I got dollars, fuck the fame, I learnt the game from Eazy
The rhetoric, we get rid of it, I consider it
A great compliment to see you imitate the West and shit
It shows me just what the West did
And plus the fact that I was involved in it, we evolved
And it's a great day for Californ-I-A
I love the new New York anthem, I fucks with Jay
But now it's time for mines
No disrespect for anybody in mine
Sip a little champ', heavyweight champ
Modern day vamp-pire, I'm a live wire
Gotti esquire, empire lava lop fire
Don't try us, we 'pires, call the quagmire
Intelligence's always been underrated
Kurupt, he's always been underrated
Underrated, never faded, ain't afraid to say it
I call your name out, bitch nigga, I ain't afraid to say it
I don't use the regular slang that I used to
And this type of honesty you ain't used to
And this type of nigga winning I ain't used to
But I guess it's something that I gotta get used to
Gotta listen to it even when I refuse to
I don't sell a lot of records 'cause people don't like me
I ain't mad at them 'cause I don't like me neither
Either way, I'mma keep breathing, receiving these blessings
Heaven-bound, a hell hound retrieving these lessons
Murder sessions, aggressions
Some sections, the essence, effervescence, progression
Every second's a lesson
I progress every second, always making my quota
I done had so many cars I feel like General Motors And now I got a house the same size as Pomona Want some prolific vocals? Then tell your local promoter
This Gotti!
(Terrace Martin)
What's happening, y'all? It's Terrence Martin and Kurupt
Well actually, it's Kurupt and Terrence Martin
So, I guess they call these things...
These first presentations on an album the intro
I'm gonna call it the beginning of the moment of truth, ya dig?
'Cause the truth will set you free
And Streetlights will set you free too
Don't run from it..."

Show you how to pack heat, drop and 6 4 hop
Cut it up, chop, my homie got it, Tray don't stop
Had them bitches dope fiending like I'm slangin them rocks
Straight from the L we don't take no shit
We off in the cut waitin for y'all niggas to trip
We the last mothafuckas you want to fuck with
When you in close range you best to duck quick
Or get smashed your last chance to forfeit
Game over
I knock a nigga from drunk to sober
I hope I don't have to maneuver the choker
If you wanna dance I do the polka
Stickin fuck bitch made Soop look like a switchblade
Can I ride in your car?
Girl I've gone too far
Can I smoke on your weed?
Nah, that ain't what you need
Can I borrow a dollar?
No, but you can eat this dick
While I smash my shit and I pop in my car
Can I give you my number?
Yeah, next summer
But I'm hungry baby
Sh, me too, that's crazy
So open up the door 'cause I'm ready to go
Aight then, but I ain't got no money
Ain't you treatin baby?
Hell no
Bitch take another route, you ain't even what this song's about
Bitch, I'm on a ride, dip and glidin through the hood
Smokin' until the sun come out
Bitch please
Got her speakin' in Chinese
They like please
Yeah, just pluck 'em off
Mothafuck all you hoes
Fuck 'em all
This is nothing but true game
This stainless thing got stained
The bitch gobble the best
She won a contest for the best jaws in the west
The homie said, ""Watch my head""
But instead, I got a 45 caliber lead spitta
A nigga feelin' bitter
Shitty as some kitty litter
Take off, got a Adolf Hitler
Center of attraction
Multiplications then subtractions
From the blast then the smash and the cash and the credit
The bitch on my dick
I'm like bitch, forget it
Let it loose bitch, won't you let it
For ????? I get a bad bitch from Connecticut
A typical hoe
I'm only in it for the blow
The bitch was only in it for the blow
I gave her some blow then let her blow
Then she turned blue
On the speed I grabbed the heater and then flew
Can I ride in your car?
Bitch I'm gone too far
Can I smoke on your weed?
Nah, this ain't what you need
Can I borrow a dollar?
Nah, but you can eat this dick

So open up the door 'cause I'm ready to go
Aight, but uh, I ain't got no money
Ain't you treatin baby?
Hell no
Bitch take another route, you ain't even what this song is about
I'm on a ride, dip and glidin through the hood
Smokin' until the sun come out
Now all salute the supreme general that got style
And watch how I rock and lock the block down
Tightly to fight me will cause disaster
No chance to surpass the vocab I master
As the sun rotate, took my guns off safe
Been a thug since 8, always drug my weight
I state the facts, mothafuck a platinum plaque
Always got my stack jackin off from havin' a sack
Niggas act as if they back is stiff and can't put work in
Shake the turf then get to tuckin they shirts in
But I'ma stay bangin'
The game that I'm claimin
Gold chain swangin
While the six trey hangin'
Back bumpa
Impact the dumpa in the stash spot mash out
Knock it locked up with the ass drop
Can I ride in your car?
Bitch I'm gone too far
Can I smoke on your weed?
Nah, this ain't what you need
Can I borrow a dollar?c
Nah, but you can eat this dick
While I dip in my shit and uh, pop my cop off

Get at me next summer

When she get on the mic she say what she gotta say

From East coast to West the unforgettable skills
Bust from head to head (c'mon) sippin on Remy Red

Ready to rock spots, fours and drop tops

Government's corrupt
Police force corrupt
Education's corrupt
It's all fucked up

Step two paces...
Turn and entrapped in the middle of the frontline where the action's at
Head straight to the scope, it's like hangin' on the edge, of a ledge
I play my part, piece to the puzzle
Heat's with a muzzle, a YG always in trouble
'Cause of what he know, 'cause of what he knew
How he grew, up and, what he grew up to
And what he gon' grow up to be
It's nuttin wrong but homie don't grow up to be like me
Temptation to touch, a terrible thing
A placement in your palm an unbearable thing
The street has many wars, infiltries, many ways
Lives lost, many K's, full size and mini K's
Comin' in many arrays
Many shapes, sizes, and shades
'Cause boys in blue they just might get you
(Chorus X2-Whitey Ford of Everlast)
Government's corrupt
Police force corrupt
Education's corrupt
It's all fucked up
(Verse 2-Whitey Ford of Everlast)
Now Bobby and Susy were unhappily wed
So Bobby shot Susy in the back of the head
Bobby got taken to the county jail
He put up his house and he walked on bail
Now Bobby's on the streets he's free as the breeze
He saved up his loot for his legal fees
He spent his whole bank quote on attorneys
Who got the case dropped on technicalities
(Chorus X2-Whitey Ford of Everlast)
Government's corrupt
Police force corrupt
Education's corrupt
It's all fucked up
(Verse 3-Kurupt)
Through the good and bad times, times bad and good
Missin' all the things that we used to have in the hood
Things makin' me happy, used to make me sad
It feels like the war of the world, fire in hand
Spread, head to head like legions of germs
Wrapped like pearls and shells make 'em wriggle like worms
We everlastin, Kurupt and Everlast
Lashin, ever ready sounds, spreadin like rashes
Life is complicated, Kurupt, Everlast, and Soopafly made it
For traded, supposedly stay shaded
They may lurk, but we lurk too
They create the war, that we fight for
There's only one life and only one way to be
God fear gotta give love to the G-O-D 'cause I can see
Everythang's corrupted, I'm corrupted
TV corrupted the public, niggaz yellin' out ?fuck it'

Yeah, gangsta's make the world go 'round
I heard that's true
Make things go up and down
I heard that's true
(Verse 1-Kurupt)
I been through the full-court pressure stage
The homies gave me a nine
The first time I saw a gauge
The first time I put my feet...
Down solid mashin on top of concrete
Before all the ways of war
House and car doors felt the rays of war
When life was simple as shit
And we didn't give a fuck about a bitch, 1986
It's all about lic's, heat in the streets
Trucks with the beats
Bitches with biker shorts worn all tight
Tryin' to get a pussy just worn all night
Plus you had to be a baller to get the baddest ho's
Back in the days, 6-4 six trays
Back in the days, Elco's, S-S's
The best is where the west is niggaz don't test us
(Chorus X4-DJ Lethal)
Just lay it on back (Hey)
Do you wanna ride?
(Verse 2-Fred Durst and Kurupt)
(Fred Durst)
Back in the days where them laces were thick
I was concerned with break dancin and layin some dick
For whatever it's worth, I'm still doin' the smurf
And I'm walkin' on this Earth, like I don't give a fuck
And now I'm rollin' up in third gear
With 3 dollar bills, 3 more minutes to kill
3 more seconds to snap, 3 more bottles of beer
And corrupt's my lifestyle, so shut the fuck up
And back the fuck up with that buck free style
(Kurupt)
Nigga what freestyle, nigga

Walkin' on a razor blade

Comin' through I got it made, posted up in the shade
Comin' through to get paid
Sunny California baby

I got dubbs in my trunk and it's bound to bump
Straight smashin, hollerin out what's up Kurupt?

Wassup, I'm fillin in my right mind, one to the head
And I'm on the smash hollerin out 'what's up Fred?'

Just lay it on back (Hey)
Do you wanna ride?
(Verse 3-Nate Dogg)
I don't give a fuck so fuck what they say
Nigga won't you pass, say pass the bombay
Niggaz they decide to ride and they ride
Niggaz they decide to lie and they die
I can bust a fleet of ho's with my skills
I can make them ho's bow down pay my bills
Can't think I can make them ho's convert to my will
Wanna bet I'll turn them ho's to my scrill'
If you love a bitch a bitch can drive you crazy
Anything a hooker do it won't amaze me
You better be up on your game homie 'cause they be
They may talk a lot of shit but they can't fade me
If you hang around with suckaz then you may be...
Anotha type of brotha I don't want with me
When you compensate with bustaz you confuse me
'Cause I'm tryin' to stay out the penitentiary

Then again I noticed that everybody
Think they can fuck with us
But luckily I noticed
Everybody want to be close to us
Tryin' to bust when they bust
I seen them they ain't treacherous and they ain't fuckin' with us

They know exactly what I do, I run through crew for crew
KRS, it's on you, baby

And all you broads, I wanna see you shake something
I want do something, rub you leg, your back, your stomach

There ain't nothing that she can't do to make her ass shake
More than a handful'll make that ass shake
Pussy popping back and forth, look at that ass shake
Fine, seductive, bad than a motherfucker
Just the kind of girl I like to cuddle in this motherfucker
She said anything got pleasured in this motherfucker
I have to admit she said treasured in this motherfucker
I know all she wants to do is get paid
That pussy popped all up and down on me
Make it pop, make it pop, make it pop!
Take it off, take it off, take it off!
Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up!

Nigga, bang how you want to bang, on who and when, what nigga
And all you broads, I wanna see you shake something
I want do something, rub you leg, your back, your stomach
She looked me in my face, then she told me to my face
There ain't nothing that she can't do to make her ass shake
More than a handful'll make that ass shake
Pussy popping back and forth, look at that ass shake
All I know is life's a bitch
Let me hit you with some G shit
Look, busters won't leave me alone
I'm being attacked by imitations, man, like ? and clones
I ain't out to get you
Want to party? I'ma party with you
Which one of these flips you want to party with you?
But if you want to play, we could play it homie
Kick back and let the toy speak and say it for me
I've been a fool before, I know the feeling
Getting in the game, nigga? I know the feeling
But them k's and the bananas that's pilling
Make us go bananas, blood pressure to the ceiling
I've got a funny feeling
Money to the ceiling
Make a nigga like feeling impenetrable
I feel a strange awe, if I hit the store
I might have to chip, one, two, three or four
Niggers, in the front door, nigga on the floor
Niggers [?] and hit the register drawer
You can live how you want to live, I don't give a fuck
Nigga, bang how you want to bang, on who and when, what nigga
And all you broads, I wanna see you shake something
I want do something, rub you leg, your back, your stomach
She looked me in my face, then she told me to my face
There ain't nothing that she can't do to make her ass shake
More than a handful'll make that ass shake
Pussy popping back and forth, look at that ass shake"

Don't fuck, wid the masta,
If I have to, the I'll blast ya
Then go to church to see my pastor
Why ya have to be like this

This year my son turned six,
Yo style's wack and you need to get that shit fixed
Representin' Jersey my raps hittin' harder than bricks

Hopin' my baby rhyme grows up to be a triple platinum album

Speedin' like car racin',

Burned out my Playstation while cats be scar facin',

Get peeled, skills in the fields
Raw dog raw deals,
Niggas either ill, fake or real
Penetrates I only heard ah tens and thirty eights
Ride as the niggas turnin' states and flippin' crates
Get lift like weights,
Bust and radiate spreadin' infections
Murderous mafia connections
I wanna feel touched like feelings
Start drillin' start ampin' out,
Hittin' wid autos campin' out,
Wid autos innovative calculative creative
Touched nigga, hectic, wid a couple seconds
A bust nigga, from a distance I can peep a fuck up
You on the Ave wid nothin' but cash to get stuck up
Man them diamonds y'all got is nice, hot
Never seen cowards wid so much ice
I got blocks to get all that's got behind the scenes
Sellin' glocks, tech nines, sixteens and magazines

Home sweet home nigga where the hoodstas roam
In gangstaville where we shoot to kill
Pop the pill, pop then drop the three-wheel
The tale of tales, fly high as a gazelle
The hell-hound came through and drown the whale
Pronounce, denounce, stripped in set sail
Soak in a could of smoke then inhale
Hold it in never exhale
Smoke whoever nigga's zone I'm in, oh well
Fuck you and ya mama

Smashed on, genked and shanked and blast on him

I had so much beef I should've fucked in my colon
But I sent them off deprived, with both their fucking eyes swollen
Everything stolen, and it still risked rolling
Niggas can't see me 'cause I kill shit blowing
I let loose like ain't no tomorrow with bomb beats
A K 47 street
Quick to get ya, my lyrics like missiles to hit Hitler
Mother fucker stay up out my Kool-Aid pitcher
You don't wanna see my style like click click pow
Make you bow to my wicked style, make you my child
The enemy wanna diss nigga but how could he?
With hookers and hoodies with a bag full of goodies (what what what what?)
What? Now take that for what it's worth
I terrorize your territory and take over your turf
All these niggas is rob, but they was soft as a nerf
Nasty as after birth they say ooh after the verse
(Snoop Dogg)
I'm commercial, universal with no rehearsal
And when I'm in the hood I'm just so controversial
Niggas know me homey, the O G
West Coast Don I smash on anyone
On my daughter and my two sons, the set and my two guns
I move the dubs and let D move the 2 1's
Not to mention all my No Limit niggas now
We do it G style like big C Style

So to kick a style you gotta kick me down
Every nigga from the pound getting paid now
Hey now, big bow wow honey child

Hold up (Wait A Minute!)
All my niggas get (Gangster With It!)
Tick tock (Crip Walk)
And prepare to get ill when the gangsters talk (hey hey)
Sagging and flagging with the 7 tray rag
Smoking like a dragon with the 4 - 4 cannon
Be the last man standing whipping niggas at random
Gray and Blue bandanna's who riding is standard
So what y'all wanna say? (Huh, huh?)
What y'all wanna do? (Huh, what?)
(Butch)
You niggas tripping, while I'm steady dipping
Throw your clip in, since y'all all flipping
Rolling capers, while I'm getting papers
Tried to shake us, you know they caught the vapors

Keep hanging 'round and you'll believe

Take over conversations nigga stop acting like a bitch
Stand up just like a man get your game together
Before a nigga gotta teach you some table manners
Like Kokane said 'To all you suckers get your motherfucking
Knuckles off the table motherfuckers?

Just came up with some other knew thoughts
Like people get paid when we smashing on our own
Doing what we want I smash them on my own
Get the black and the brownie few
Put K's and 9's in the hood
Put crack and crash in the same area
So we can make it look no good
Blame it on hip-hop and gangsta rap
All why these streets keep polluting
All off the murders and all the shootings
All off the hood niggaz trapped and stuck
Fucked nigga blame it on Kurupt
Or how Tha Dogg Pound is broken up
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
C. Delores Tucker use to burn our records
Rivernal shockers use to burn our records
Now niggaz making money off other rappers
So beat a dick and eat it or eat a dick and beat it
Back in the days you were professional clappers
Clappers turn rapper, rappers turn actors

She's stalkin stalkin stalkin me {*repeat 4X*}
(Bridge #1: female)
I love him, I need him
I wanna have his baby
My friends think I'm crazy
I know he don't care
I blew his young
I'm never gonna leave him
His baby momma hates me
I would never deceive him
(Chorus: Kurupt)
She's stalkin stalkin stalkin me {*repeat 10X*}
I'm in the house
Quiet as a hungry church mouse
I'm ready to dip, ready to bounce
Bouncin' ounce for ounce and ounces
I'ma show you how to break these ounces
I think that's where I fucked up
I think I showed the little bitch to much
The bitch wouldn't let go of the throttle
Instead she tried to suck and hit on the clutch
Girl, beat it, Oh, No You Can't Eat It
Dip, eat somebody else dick
You can't go where I go girl
Young Gotti on Roscoe World
Dip outta town and bring it on something
Now you can sit down now sucka spit something
(Bridge #2: female)
Outside I'm waiting, I'm tired, it's raining
I'm playing his CD
I wonder if he see's me, I'll break all laws
Don't ever talk about him
I always feel so empty
When I'm not around him
5'5 brown eyes, caramel complexion
Dippin through the city
Hide through the intersection
Stalk a bitch, talkin' shit
Your always outside my apartment bitch
Everything is cool, late night function
I'm tryna keep it cool 'cause I'm alwayz into something
Talkin' to this other bitch about to light up
And the bitch came up
And beat the bitch up (bitch)
Bitch you must got me fucked up
With the liquor in your system and your all fucked up
You must not know about young Kurupt
He gave you the number and you blew the bitch up
(Bridge #3: female)
Whenever, he's in town
I'm always at the hotel
I'm waiting, I'm patient
And I know all of his homies
I hope he calls
I know he got my letters
I know he read each one of them
And I bought him a new sweater
(Female)
Yeah ahhha, yeah ahha
Yeah ahhha, yeah ahha
Yeah ahhha, yeah ahha
Yeah ahhha, yeah ahha

Aw yeah!
Right about now it's time to get busy
Huh, straight out the box, nonstop
Kurupt the Kingpin, Xzibit, Crooked I
(Wait a minute, um)
Crooked I:
This is the art of, manslaughter
When I'm rockin' I'm more shockin' than droppin' a boom box in bath water
You entered the wrong scuffle
You catchin' a chrome buckle
I uppercut niggas hard enough to break my own knuckles
Deliver the sick verbals
My shotty spit a round, before you hit the ground,
Your body spin around, in six circles
Diminishin' infamous menaces
I'm waitin' to get dicced, if not, I'm a start finishin' innocents
Lyrics (lyrics), I'm breezin the region
Freezin g's in your legion
Freakin' ancient techniques when I'm speakin' phoenician
It's all about Crooked
These bitches shout Crooked
I'll make you say the West Coast ain't shit without Crooked
I own a vicious label, niggas'll get disabled
When I'm spittin' rhymes written on project kitchen tables
I load this 4-5 and let slugs dive at ya
Now that's for Crooked I, the scrap happy, mic snatcha
Daz:
Motherfuccers can you dig that, huh?
Can you fucc with this?
Let's get Kurupt the Kingpin to fucc y'all niggas up
Y'all don't wanna see none of this west coast MC shit
Yeah, how you like me now motherfucker!?!
Kurupt:
Terror starts, in the midst of your heart, starts
The storm, my vocals float like arts
In the mystic state of mind, when I create a rhyme
My microphone massacres every year the same time
With audio amputations, vocal thoughts of a loud talker
Up against the microphone night stalker
With a tendency of bashing MCs, like ten of me
As you can see I continue mashin' MCs
Caboom, the room gets cleared as my views get clearer
Extra-terrestrial microphone terror
In effect, get infected
Tell me what the fucc you expected
These venomous injections
I leave whole sections, and sections full of injections
From these poisenous melodies and selections
I select the methods of slow anguish
I mangle shit with my language
Tell me, have you ever seen one elope
With the microphone
In a scandal like abilities to make MCs explode
Baboom, alone in my own zone
So don't compare me to none
Not one's nearly
Severe, 'cause I severely, impare MCs
Near me, oppose and fear me, I got plots and theories
Sincerely, I could have the spot locked
Niggas get stoned for touching microphones
With no knowledge on how to rock
Daz:
Yeah, back in effect, it don't stop
Turn your speakers up, DJ Battlecat on the table
We fuckin' it up like this and like that, yeah
Got my homeboy Xzibit in the motherfuccin' house
Alkaholiks!
Xzibit:
When I was enlisted
I came to the table double fisted
Sadistic, heavy artillery, for all my enemies
Bust shots up in the sky screamin' obsenities
Make niggas sport cackies and chucks from hear to Italy
It'll be, a cold day in Hell when you see Xzibit fail
Act like a bitch on bail, tuck tail, and run
See we do it how it can't be done
I'm the rough cut, plus how the west was won
Or direct descendant of the gatling gun
Don't test me son, you fucc around and catch you one
That ain't a threat, that's a promise I can definitely keep
You can't compete wit' 25 niggas wit' heat in the street
Ready to repeat, round after after round at you
All hell break lose when the whole Pound come through
I found that you and yours, can never fucc wit' mine
I own shit but gimme some more like Busta Rhymes
Cross the line, now you gotta pay the piper
I'm The Alkaholik sniper, that be keepin' the crowds hyper
It's ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Can't stop till me and my niggas is platinum plus
My Dogg Kurupt
Daz:
Yeah, no shit
Yeah, y'all can't fucc wit' that
That's what I'm talkin' about
West coast, we been doin' this shit for years
Ain't nothin' happenin' wit' that
Battlecat
(Don't step up)
Right, right
(Don't step up, unles you wanna get hurt)
Huh, huh, huh
(Get get get get hurt)
Whatcha say
Motherfuccas that be hangin' in the battle
(Get hurt, get get get get hurt)
That's what I'm talkin' about
Daz Dillinger
(Don't step up, unless you wanna get hurt)
Break it down, break it down

I'm always in the mood to get cheese like freeze make them stop
Where they at
Like freeze it's the police relax like at ease I'm a terrorist
Like forget America blue collar bossing like corporate America
Trying to block my thoughts I hushed a fool my moneys all grown
Up like Rudy Huxtable
Everybody wants to be the next boss everybody wants to be a gangsta a mobster
A monster when I was young I was the monster who used to dump out in a smoked grey Mazda
My future seemed dim there no light at the end of the tunnel less of the stress to pressure
This tunnel it's my thoughts my intuition and my vision is tunneled and my anger and resentment
For existence is funneled through the streets
The streetlights keep calling I can see the mirrors falling in front of
My face I see hands reaching out for me
The wind blows so sad whistles
In the streets like chatter I couldn't take this chance
Fame may not come around again
The willy lind syndrome west indy system this is the
Syndrome the system we live in we gave up we give in and stuck in reliving
It only takes a millisecond just to listen now how's this existing
I'm looking in the mirror at the vision of resistance my eyes
Start to tear 'cause the visions are consistent constantly I'm faced with the product
Corporate system that I need to get on my job 'cause jobs don't existing
The only jobs are robbing jerking and twisting
The profit don't add up to what I'm risking the anger and resentment of existence
Existing in the streets
(x2)
The streetlights keep calling I can see the mirrors falling in front of
My face I see hands reaching out for me
The wind blows so sad whistles
In the streets like chatter I couldn't take this chance
Fame may not come around again
Again (again)
Might not come again
Sitting at the house and I step outside my garage and I'm just like damn you know seems like the world's missing a lil somethin' 'cause I know I am I remember back in the day out posting with jay Dillon and they man in Detroit working on they first dun Dillinger album doin' it real Big and you know I recollect on all of those things when I was making this album and its just like I felt like hey you know I gots to come With something similar to what I already hit 'em with but a lil different
When I got back with snoop he introduced me to this young man named Terrence Martin and uh with time I found out that where not that much Different we have the same goals and aspirations and we have the same mind state and it just so turned out also that uh he was from my Neighborhood and he was on the same that I was you know growth so as we put our heads together man you know we made this classic album That we call streetlights and it was just like damn you know I want something different but I want something the same I want it all Intertwined into one"

In an 8 second spread she's all in ya head
Your about to touch the ground and damn near beg
'Cause she's the one, like Lisa Left Eye Lopez
Get trapped up, I'm a post up
Get yacked up, and then act up
Like what up girl?, ya done done it again
I'm trapped again, I want it again
Pretty short cuts or, hair to the middle of ya back
Looking just like that
I like short shorts and the tight jeans
And the summer dresses and the small feet, all petite
See that's what little bomb mamas is made of
But most of y'all suckas like cluckas that's made up
Treat her, however ya run into or meat her
I hope she got a head on her shoulders like miss Cita

Better let 'em know (Tell 'em who's it is)
Ooh girl 'cause you are mine
You are mine you are mine you are mine

I'm fresh off the up in smoke, dr. dre and snoop tour
Bomb in your short skirt, girl make that skirt work
What you want a G like, need a G in your life
Ever wonder what the DPG are like
Ever wonder what being with a DP is like
One night, I like 'em just like you
Me and Jon B, in Venace by the beach
Try to see what we can see
I got a (?) a new Bonaville
I got a house on the hill, where me and you could chill
See the party starts at 8, but you don't come till 10
'Cause ain't nothing cracking, and that's when it begins
I like Carona's by the car load, Henn' by the cases
Save the Coca-Cola I don't get down with the chasers
It's a secret location, I don't want no skirts popping up trying to chase us
Mad 'cause y'all switched places
Bouncing with my cutie pie
While everyone staring at ya shining so fine
The summertime heat got ya feeling so right
When she comes out like sunshine

Way up in the sky
Once in a lifetime
You only get one chance, one chance
(You like that shit)
One chance to dance
And then it's over
Kurupt:
Check it, from catchin buses and cabs
Pen and pads in the lav
Sippin genuine drafts and no cash
I ain't the first and I'll be damned if I'm the last
Roosevelt drive, clay courts from Cliffs to AZ
El Drex:
Aiyyo wassup how you feel Me I'm chill
But I'm still tryin' to make a mill Inside Sharon Hill
>From where I stand I see it's time to expand
To foreign lands for hundreds of grands and white sands
Kurupt:
You know it's about that time
Niggaz set and prepare your rhymes
Start off and a little after nine, bump 'n' grind
Sexual, young intellectual
With a whole lot of life to live, just a child
El Drex:
It's 2-5-2-5 little town of shit
You can call a Sharon Hill and a dogg be town shit
I wouldn't break bad if you come from out of town
'Cause I'm down by law and I'm from Tha Deuce Pound
Having to survive living in the life
Got to stay alive living in the life
Have to survive
Living in the life
El Drex:
Yo, so how you want it, you want silence or violence
Plus, me and my crew shine like the N on New Balance
The most talent where girls fly
They hopin champagne gets pop and it don't stop
These jealous cat cut G's keroodle with top
We can cruise the city block like yachts
Y'all niggaz worse than the cops
Kurupt:
Before I smoke, I tote my first tote
A fool or here sneakin young bulls red bulls
Me K-I-D, the elite MC
>From the hill, got my top chopped by a tree
On the hill, too young to flare one
It's all about rhymes and fair ones
Show me the mic and bust like a flair gun
Don't shove me or push me, I give sucka punches
Now what's the deal
El Drex:
You sucka cats be wildin and wanna fool now
And pull the tool now Why can't we keep it on the cool now
I make a new route to get my crew out My peeps no doubt
And then when school out, it probably when the album's due out
And when you see me, the cream from my pocket ooze out
Forever player and winner and never lose out
Kurupt (El Drex):
Tell me do you remember (Yeah, I remember back when)
When Conway Park (Yeah, I remember back then)
Sneakin in the firehouse, the fun begins (Next week, instead of then)
And I'm be sneakin again
See back in the day, it was all about flows
Coolin out the T-la rock and mic stroll
I go next door to see my nigga Man Bang
Sneak in the basement, couple sips of Ing Bing
I feel all right, I could rock all night
No plots and schemes, just million dollar dreams
Money like a mothafucka Homie gimme mine's paid
I come stompin like a parade, the escapade
Psychotic anolyisis as I consume a whole carton of mushrooms
We clear sight, the day lights like the night
A closet full of Franklin's, a G's paradise
A nice 40 ounce of O-E on ice
Precise poetical poltergeist on mics
El Drex:
Well, it's the El baby, baby The El baby baby
The one that rocks you so well baby baby
Many brains I feed, another thought conceive
Yes indeed Drex ya heed will make yo body bleed
The intellectual seed, knowledge be growin' like weeds
Money stash from crack, you can't determine the speed
I'm a rap fiend, they gleams like the head of Carene
I'm extreme but never fade like acid jeans, I mean
I see more green than builders, feel this dilga enthrill ya
Stay tough like armadilgas and that's on the for real-a
Pop dukes will call me killer casualties with ease
The world will spend a million G's savin' dyin' MC's
Now you got mad love for Shahi Raffi
I'm in knee deep and peace the bull and meet me
Kurupt: To my nigga Kel El, Escoball, what all up in this piece
Chorus: (to end with Kurupt talking)
El Drex: 2-5-2-5 little town of shit
You can call a Sharon Hill and a dogg be town shit
I wouldn't break bad if you come from out of town
'Cause I'm down by law and I'm from Tha Deuce Pound
Deuce Pound Deuce Pound Deuce Pound Deuce Pound
A town with no recreation
And when we grab the mic We formally rock the nation"

Rainstorm the back of the bank, bustin' loose like Muggsy
Typhoons, Kurupt Calhoun
With a platoon of backwards ass buffoons
Ready to shoot anything that moves
Load to tunes from ""The Blue Lagoon""
Mask on, khakis, ounced on house shoes
So I'ma start it off skitzin on the first nigga
Saul hit the stack, heard me, hear me?
Heard that, word don't pass the front do'
Before you gotta show 'em your heart and soul and Desert Eagle fo'
Explode then watch 'em fold, the other niggaz froze
He knew better, mask in an all blue sweater
Two pumps ready for a riot
Full Baretta, six hostages with a loss of oxygen
Wet as a river, sixteen bricks to flip
After I flip these bitch niggaz for they shit
I been down with the twist since eighty-six
Hyperactive with a automatic, snappin reaction
I'm sick of waitin, a thirty-eight, I'm jackin for Daytons
Kick the door in for sure, double four's rammin
Hollow bandit, ready to knock him off if he standin
Position the cannons, telegraph the whole parameter
Paralyze anything that walks through perimeter
Cervical veins lacerated lost to missiles
Interrogated and I paraded posted with pistols
Time for war this is when the heart's exposed
Change up the game, cockin and sparks explode
I'm a marksman, touch of death, ten steps to draw
And that's all, end to anything before
In a world war, off like a Concorde jet
But fool, D.P.G.'s the set
In a world war, this is when the heart's exposed
Change up the game, cock, sparks explode
Manic-depressive panic and then start skitzin
Not givin' a fuck while all y'all bitchin
Dis is for all my G's, my ho-mies
Flippin birds and servin' ki's

Crystallized coke and limes, I don't give a fuck!"

Verse 1: Noreaga/Kurupt
You gone thug it out, gangsta style
Nigga check it out
Ayyo my baby moms, hunny let me see my child
Niggaz see me in the streets, ask why I don't smile
That's why nigga, because my life is a mess
And I'm sellin records now, but I still feel stress
Neva had a legal job, all I sold was drugs
And I still got my moms and the rest of my thugs
But my pops he ain't here, does that seem so foul
And I'm drinkin' everyday, on the wrong route
And can't wait for the day when Capone come out
No doubt, my ??? niggaz, thuggin' it out
To wut wut, all my niggaz just funk wit Kurupt
Tell then niggaz where they stand at, where they end up wut

Drinkin' Don from the bottle, fuck the glass
My niggaz peep it
Sit back and hold a secret
Funk wit Kurupt, nigga wut
Yeah we can freak it
Freak sumthin, get sumthin, strip sumthin
Rip a sic sumthin, my dick a stick sumthin
Just try me, see the new millineum came
I'm invincible wit my abdominium frame
Daminican, ten are gone, poetical pentagon
Nuttin silenced, they all are violenced
The law story, wars over territory
The masses, only left Kurupt and Nore
Known to spit brimstone, fire and magma
Wit magnums, and mosts many and mostly semi's
I pays no rent, cars wit no lease
Got eight killas wit badges I pay police
It's a freak fest, east to west, no more wars
Bomb girls feastless, nude beaches and nude shores
Baby soft as peaches, soft as a plum
Ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Bitch Bitch...
No matter what you think
You can't see me, If you wanna freak wit me, Now do you wanna freak wit me
And you ain't got the skills, to freak with me
Now do you wanna freak wit me, do you wanna freak wit me
Verse 2: Kurupt/Noreaga

Ima separate yo soldiers an fire yo dome

Precision, Man I'm so precise, I'm tha universe, everythang lies in I
Give respect off a technicality, airtakin like germs an allergies
Effervescent pure poetry, cataclysmic, I stay in yo system
Cold virus, fumming occu vitis, effective like malaria an laryngitis
Turn dat bitch ass nigga throw shit bias
Most a dese poetry observers biased or most schools like UCLA an Titus
Egmen, I got problems Gotti peshy, one to da middle an one to da top

88,Yessir,2010,Streetlights (2010),,Kurupt,"(Pity the child... pity the child)
Now, why should I play around?
Lay it down like most of y'all and lay around?
I'd rather gather hollow heads and lay ya' down
But I'm a little too old to play around
You still bangin' Dr. Dre and Dogg Pound
Snoop is still the hottest motherfucker out
Yessir! We still around
Yessir! We still world renowned
I caught silence, I silence sound
I'm under the radar, stuff silent sound
I'm here, my dude, I am born again
We saber-toothed tigers, y'all Cornish hens
Y'all cornball ballas, we presidents
With presidential-acquired hidden residents
Yessir! We residents
And controllers of secret soldiers and regiments
Yessir! We ball out
Yessir! Till we fall out
We get high [get high], we don't have to try
We don't have to look and we don't have to buy
We don't have to make ends meet to get by
We don't have to try, I am that guy
Yessir! I am that guy
Yessir! I am that fly
I can't help it and I can't stop
And I won't stop and I don't stop
I'mma take the top and put it where the bottom drop
Then I'mma reverse it and make the bottom hit top
See this is what they all call the top spot
Then I'mma show the top where the bottom stop
I am everything that is anything
I can't sing a note so I let the semi sing
Send 'em out on a mission, see what the semi bring
Back home to your selected and newly-elected king
Now that's gangsta {x5}
See that's gangsta
Now that's gangsta
(Keepin' it gangsta wit'chall)
Now that's gangsta [gangsta]
Gangsta {x11} [gangsta]
Yessir! I am that guy
Yessir! I am that high
Rollercoaster, this whole movement's over
Givin' ya west coasters, the cold shoulder
I am ready, yes, I am here
I am back, Jack, the spinner of the year
Let's get one thing here real crystal clear
We reappear, their hopes disappear
Evaporate, dissipate, your folks disappear
And if you were smart you wouldn't be here
Now that's what I call a double whammy
I don't need the white folks, I get ghetto Grammys
Yessir! I get ghetto Grammys
Yessir! My women's eye candy
I can't help it and I can't stop
And I won't stop, that's why I don't stop
I'm similar to Biggie, similar to Pac
Similar to Snoop, similar to Doc
Similar because they all taught me something, ock
Firsthand, like cock and pop before a nigga talk
I'm airborne, you're grounded
Like you hid your report card and your mama found it
Yessir! I found it
My drrr-ream to go far as God allows me
The sky's the limit
It's in my arm's reach
So I'mma reach as far as my arms reach
Gangsta {x15}
(Now that's... gangsta)

The all-mighty, ball-blowing, like jaws a lil lower.
You hit the spot?
Perfect bitch,
Ever seen your bitch when she slurp on dicks?
With that birth mark right on her upper thigh,
With a mouth like that I don't sympathize,
She do things with her mouth you gotta see wit your own two eyes bitch nigga
Actin' surprised,
See Daz beat the cock,
But you love the bitch,
See be eatin dicks and you kissin' the bitch,

Magnum and chromes,
Put it, strap it on,
Don't take it off more than 3 days it'll (??)
Get the whole tip of your dick burned off,
Fuck around with that bitch of yours,
She's no different from the rest of the whores.
Might be nasty, unclassy, sassy, untrustworthy plastic bitch.
And you got the nerve to fall in love with the bitch,
And actin' like your ballin Captain Fall In Love With a Bitch,
Now you know about the girl that you chose to love,
Chillin' with the homies, buyin' sacks from K-Dubb.
Smokin' up, chokin' up, payin' for the smokin' up.
In the cut, take this game and start soakin up.
Hookin' up with Jesus what I see,
While Daz takin' your bitch upstairs I be,
Waitin' to fuck the bitch my goddam self,
With 18 rubbers, cause your bitch is hazardes to my health.
And you know, like I know, that your trick ass, skanky ass bitch is a hoe
(Daz)
Any Nigga can get the pussie, (Nah I don't think so)
All it takes is some time, (yeah that's right!)
You can hit it like you want it, (UHhhh)
Hit up or from behind.
(Girl)
You ain't stickin that big dick up in my ass uh-uh, that shit looks ferousis.
Oh I'm straight nigga. Pelase Be-weave-it
(Kurupt)
Shut the fuck up bitch,
Eat a dick bitch,
Eat a bowl of shit bitch,
Munch on a mouthful of balls, in halls and malls
Just shut the fuck up bitch and work your jaws.
Take a pill bitch, chill bitch.
Jerk your jaws,
Eat the pussy in then work the walls.
I seen that nigga last week it's like this,
What a hoe ass nigga, he still in love wit the bitch.
BEITCH! (Fuck You)"
