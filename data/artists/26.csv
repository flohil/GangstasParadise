0,A Day of Sooperman Lover,1992,Whut? Thee Album (1992),,Redman,"-Look! Up in the sky!
-It's a bird...
-It's a plane!
-Hee hee hee hee, naw! It's Sooperman Lover, baby!
-Daddy, Daddy!
-Would you please read us a story?
-All right, get over here and sit yo big ass down,
Lemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover...
Ayo, I was out to lunch and shit
Puffin' on a blunt to get my head read (y)
Boogie'n to my walkman
With an ""S"" on my chest
(Bust a move!)
Yes I'm a Superhero, don't forget
I smoke mad niggas
So to hell with cigarettes
But anyway,
Let's get back to this skit
You know who the fuck I am
So git off that ol' bull-SHUCKS
Lunchtime was up, (F**K!)
Let me jet, Or I'll collect unemployment bucks
On the way back, black,
I spotted this object, a stray cat
Stuck in a tree
With a tag that says that:
""If found,
Please return to this address""
(How did you see it)?
Nigga! Wit my X-Ray eye set!
Like ""Pchoooooooww""!
I jetted to the closest phone-booth
Quick fast,
I dipped into my Sooperlover suit...
(I can leap,
Tall buildings
In a single bound...)
Booom!
Right through the fuckin' phone-booth ceiling!
(It's a plane!)
Naw, Sooperman Lover's the name
I can slam King-Kong
And pick up freight trains
On a mission,
To save this cat/that was wishin'
He was in his litter
Watchin' Fritz on channel 6'n
Relaxin'
Feet cocked-up/ just a little
With a cod cocktail
And a bowl, of tender vittles
I snatched, him
Took off through the air like a pigeon
Quick so he won't start
Meowin' and bitchin'
The letter in cat's tag address (?)
Said THE PROJECTS
(Elevator's broke!)
So I had to take the back steps
(Knock, Knock)
The door opened
Then my eyes swole
From this BADASS DAME (Damn!)
Sippin' a quart of ""Old Gold""
-""Yo, is this your cat?""
-""Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?""
-""He was stuck in a tree,
Around Uptown Manhattan""
-""Well how the hell did you save him?
Are you Police/Undercover?""
-""Naw baby,
The ""S"" on my chest stands for:""
Chorus: Sooperman Lover (Yeah!)
Baby call him the Sooperman Lover
Something wrong...
Something wrong, indeed
Something wrong. Yes, yes indeed...
She was grateful
Lookin' for ways to repay me
No money,
A donut, and some... uhm coffee maybe?
Of course
What kind of sauce (?) did I take?
Make my donut Jelly
And my coffee Sanka
We sat,
Unhooked the cape from the back
She felt my arms
'Cause my pythons looked stacked
""Goddamn, Sooperlover!
Yo shit looks thick
Tell me, how strong are you
With muscles like this? (you bad motherfucker!)""
(I'm stronger than a locomotive)
I'll keep hittin ya like Rocky
She ran to the room
And came back with a (?)
Negligee, high-heeled shoes,
Wit' a blunt in her mouth
Ready to roll up,
Hey hold up/ she had the dollar fold (ed) up
To mix the coke with the smoke
Yo, she was no joke
She took a sniff,
Some got on her top lip
That bitch stuck out her tongue
And gave her top lip a lick
And said: -""Here baby, hit it.""
-""Naw baby, I ain't wit' it
You'd need more than a body
To make me wanna hit that shit!""
But I'll hit the blunt
So she took out her fronts
Cracked the philly
Opened the bag and laid out the skunk
Then I took a long pull
It was hype/ outtasite
We ran into the bedroom
So I cracked my pants for head room
Later, tossed the covers
And oh, brother! I was wit' it
Ready to hit it
Asked my dick, ""YO, WHASSUP GEE?""
""Yo man, shit's thick""
Licked her down her belly
And kissed her on her back
Stuck my hands betewwn the legs
And I felt the bozack (!)
As big as mine (YO!)
This bitch must be craze,
So I threw my suit on
And I was Swayze...
'Cause I'm the:"
1,A Million and 1 Buddah Spots,1994,Dare Iz a Darkside (1994),,Redman,"Still walkin' down the streets with my hand on my black tec
My brain is high like Newark New Jersey do car thefts
I'm high, when I sag my 2 Black Guys
I would be brief but my Karl Kani's didn't dry
I smoke the blunt for all you underground chumps
My smoke bangs like it's freshly picked from the swamps
So nigga how you roll a blunt? Aiyyo, how you roll a blunt
Flip the script on some other shit like how you roll a cunt
Now, I smoke the Maui, wow-wee
Then I'll be back for me, I'm Sure, like Al B.
Go Uptown, smoke quarter-pounds at the Dungeon
Keith Murray meets me at the spot with the Bom-Ba
Go back to Jerz and smoke with Diezel Don
Huh, pick up a bag from my block, two-oh's the number
Who can get swift with the microphone mist
Plus I'm crisp like CD's on LP's in 3D
My funk respect it, cosmic injected
That cause me to Set It Off just like that club record
Hit it from the back, stay strapped like two packs of lubricants
It's gonna hurt -- no it's not a gat experience
The funk dweller, creeps through your cellar
And if your moms don't know your ass better tell her, like this y'all
There's a million and one blunt spots all over the world
That got good herb for all you boys and girls
Which one do you go to? *many shouts*
Which one do you go to? *many shouts*
I'm packin buddha by the pounds and pull my Phillies from knapsacks
Hey yo I didn't know your nickel bags come that fat
Yo check it, my lyrics strip the track butt-naked
Catch the Local to the A to the buddha to my vocals
And I, set the world on fire
Get a billion people higher, from just one blunt in my cypher
You swore to God you was mixed in bom-ba-zee
The rhymer Bombs Squads and MC's like Hank Shocklee
I spend a knot at all the buddha spots
From fifteen to fifty-fifth I ran all through the blocks
I set it off jock, I light a blunt for my nigga D
That's doin' three pack, now where I get the hash at
You can't fuck with my funk cause my funk is kinda abstract
Past that, I'm rough like McGruff on dust
There's a million and one blunt spots in America
Yeah I'm tellin' ya
Now just throw your blunts up in the motherfuckin air
Smoked out with niggaz from North Newark to Montclair
I rip the nouns from antonyms to synonyms
'Cause I got soul like James Brown and rock M&M
One of the America's Most Blunted
Smoked out with MC Eiht and Compton Most Wanted
Ninety degrees, smoke with L.O.D. on the Island
Then back to Stat, to smoke more packs with the Shaolin
I showed the women how to roll a blunt stronger
But it didn't work, because they Lee nails got longer
But the weed is good for when you're mackin
And girls can front it off like they don't know shit that happened
I know what happened, I told her, BACK, NICK that motherfucker
So check!
My stamina, your ass couldn't snap with cameras
Leave you on your back like Godzill did Gamera
Props on blocks smokin' the choc and what-nots
I might catch a nickel bag sale from bus stops *needle rips record*"

Cause only real niggas gonna bump my shit)
I don't give a fuck nigga, you already know what it is
(All you emcees must get dissed
Cause only real...)
Check it out, yo
Like OJ let me take a stab at it
Inhale like asthmatics
The chiropractor Redman, I'm back at it
My sawed off by the bed, it's a craft-matic
The size of a Subway sandwich, ask Jared
Big foot givin' input
Every rhyme like Lisa Ray homie, fuck with it it's a good luck
I'm a lieutenant, the new school respect Red Menance
My society raised a winner
I set any bitch straight to restore order
Lift my pimp hand up like ""Why I oughta""
I don't tolerate the nonsense
I tell my bitch be easy like you straight outta Compton
South by Southwest out in Austin
Tour the place down, Twitter went wild
Def Jam raised their eyebrow, we independent now
You should've took care of the cash cow
Moooove out my way bitch, Captain Courageous
Fuck you and your iPod if I ain't in your playlist
Bravehearted, I'm Nas in '94
You could say I'm your favorite rapper's favorite
I'm like Penny on the floor wasted
Pump your brakes, divorce me if you can't relate
I get brain when I text, I'm typin' LOL
Chick on her knees like SMH
Get it? Too slow, listen faster cause my time's a factor
You freestylin' dnd I ain't asked ya
Weak link niggas, Red'll think bigger
This flow hit your chick, she cry me a river
And you Simba lyin' like you carrying around the iron
Like I'm a supervisor and I'm firin'
(All you emcees must get dissed
Cause only real niggas gonna bump my shit)
Bars, okay nigga
Bars, I got 'em homie
Bars, all day nigga
Bars, you can count on me
I'm like a cat for my life, I got nine of me
You think this song done, I got another round on me
Bars, okay nigga
Bars, I got 'em homie
Bars, all day nigga
Bars, wait a minute
(All you emcees must get dissed
Cause only real niggas gonna bump my shit)
Check it out, yo
Yo, I'm a 90s nigga so of course I think my era the best
Untouchable, fucker we Eliot Ness
Mitchell-N-Ness it's all Jersey
Hoes send my while DMs, I feel I'm related to X
I don't be up in the trap tryna write raps
Just to say I'm in the trap and made it off rap
As the world turns, I let my L burn
And watch you little fish swim up in my well urn
Even gay bitches love me like the L word
And bitch niggas get a clip from a spell bird
I mean the Mossberg
The same thing, my weed got a case of gangrene when it's angry
I act like Scarface up in your project hallway
Make sure you're all covered by AllState
Me and them beats in your ear like Andre
And what I think of y'all motherfuckers, strange
Fuck y'all, I'm addicted like a menthal
I was born from the days of ""yes, yes y'all""
My boy carrying a tech, rep call
So take your bitch ass home, [?]
I don't talk a lot, I just rap a lot
On this verse, I got tips from a astronaut
Check the forensics, we in this
I'll end this with Red is the best in the motherfuckin' business"

Whoo, hah... ohhah, wooooh
Aww shit!
Hey dudes my interludes more fatter than most niggaz LP's
So don't sell me to stale cheese
I'm more nicer than Little Red Robin Hood's grandmama
Puffin on ganja, sippin on a, Cherry Bianca
My grand finale's like an alley when it's rowdy
Kick more bars than the penile G
And let my nine clap loudly
Click click, bee-yow, bang, booyaka!
What am I do to ya? It's somethin' new to ya
Like screwin ya, all over my studi-ah
Ride on my MP-60 and let the S-950 squeeze your titties
That quickly I hooked you, now fix me with your lips
B... otch, unloosen my belt thinkin' to grab the crotch
But before you do move my glock before it shoot my cock
And see basically them trick bitches get no dap (word)
And see basically Redman album is no joke (word)
And see basically I don't get caught up at my label (word)
'Cause I kill when they fuck with food on my dinner table (word)
I drop a punchline at lunchtime
'Cause I'm a Close Encounter of the None Kind
With dumb rhymes
I battle allay'all at one time
So fuck all you fools out there with the large vocabulary
In your sentence, I don't need that shit to pay my rent with, huh
And to the nosey snake-ass hoes I ask you
Why you be acting all fly
When your monkey-ass work at fast food?
And why is it every time that a multiplatinum artist
Always use the underground to make a comeback?
Is it fair to the hardcore niggaz that rap?
That don't give a fuck about the radio
Plus the next bitch at that?
And being hardcore and mad about wearing high-tech boots
And black skelly hats?
And making fake-ass frowns because your best buddy packs?
Think about it
Sip on a chocolate thai, and let your brain fall out of focus
This is another episode, coming live from the Funkadelic man himself
Yeah
Ah
Huh"

Ah, with the slang
Get you coughed up from the weed it'll bust your brain

I'm catchin applause when I rock the micraphone from the heart
My style's foul, so look into the eyes of Lorimars
As you can see, I drop funk bars from here to Mars
Still rollin' down the highway wit my forty between my lap bitch
Crossin DTW, coming into my lap and
Boy my skills are stacks, I love to do it from the back
My style swarms over ghettoes like crack
Blow in any hood and puff a blunt with any nigga
As long as we both got, it don't matter who's gun bigger
But I bet you you can't do that, cause the multiplatinums
Can't save your ass on the block, and you're fucked if it ain't pop
The funk is blowin' wattage out your fuckin' trunks
Like peak Puma, I known to give a whole lots of lumps
Props I got, coming through your block nine cocked
My socks, even got three-eighty-nine shots
Don't press it, I hang 'em like them niggaz do in Texas
You don't have no heart you chestless, 'cause your heart's on my necklace
I give props to real MC's like KRS-One
Kool G Rap, Buckshot, Busta me and I'm from
The East coast! Where a nigga like you get that fat?
And since you came out gassed, well I'm closin your gas cap
The creature, from the deeper, ultimate funk freaker
Represent New Jersey, keep your eyes up on the bleacher
A menace like Dennis, I got game like Ennis
I can French-kiss my lyrics, then I run trains with sentence
Lord have mercy! It's too much funk to cope with
Droppin' dope shit after dope shit, we're atrocious
That's from the lungs, that rings from here to kingdom come
And I don't have to be a Special Ed to get dumb!"

With one leg, Kirby style, for thirty miles
Shut the Fawcett to Farah
Drain the Panama Canal up, that'll run like mascara

Before Mr. T my jewels was too gaudy
My foul mouth turn a New York crowd out
Reach out and touch and use nine to dial out
So Brick City are ya ready, ready
So D.C. are ya ready...
Yo cheers to the undaground, Doc's Da Name

Hey man, hey man, yeah go 'head with that man
Just rhymin over here man
Hey go 'head, go get drunk nigga
Ay, go smoke yo' weed nigga
Yo, go drink yo' forty motherfuckaaaah
It's Brick City dawgs over here
We gon' take it down like this, yo, D-Don, Don...
(D-Don)
It's bone-afficial my nizzle
D-Don got issues, and a type team that dismiss you
Oh boy! I gets more +Chips+ than +Ahoy!+
I got toys that deploy, I just aim and destroy
I keeps it gully in a bonafide skully
I ain't never had a hit but still get props like Nelly
I'm platinum in streets I got, love in the streets
And I'm more underground than your, basement concrete
Braids in my hair, gold still in my teeth
Still, bringin' the beef if you're, bringin' me grief
I, rat-a-tat-tat it like one-two one-two
Cock my shit back and let off on your whole crew
I'm Brick City baby twenty-fo'/seven
A project nigga that's, tryin' to see heaven
I done ran through hell with gasoline drawers on (AOWW!)
I'm the portrait of a hustler, and once again it's on
I still got money buried in my back yard
I'm Bumpy like Johnson, they call me D-Don
My shit's so dope when you smoke you nod
And I spit that shit that leave you holy like the song
(Pacewon)
Yo... we from the place where they pump out D and steal cars
Kids wild wave at you and smile you feel large
Like they cut, and you got the power to heal scars
Never down cause the underground crown is still large
See I rap for a livin', probably rap till I die
If you dope, where you been at? Your raps is a lie
I'm all real, the one, the raw deal
Do tour, come home, do a flick for four mill'
What the hardcore heads on the block would call ill
Never catch me at the ball-out spot with small bills
Innovative rapper, rhyme in new ways
When I spit niggaz cough up blood for two days
Never catch me with material girls, they fugaz'
Rather bounce with a short chickenhead in blue shades
Till the day I'm rich like Bruce Wayne
I'ma kick raps like pimps blew game
Ridin' through your block with six new chains on
Pullin over droppin' H-bombs
No doubt I got it locked Sanford Ave. to Penn Station
Chancellor to Central a thousand men waitin
(Chorus - 2X w/ minor variations)
Jersey that's whassup (whassup yo?)
You heard me light the Dutch (smokin' weed)
Rock on like what the fuck (what the fuck?)
Jersey that's whassup, Brick City
(Roz)
Fuckin' with me is a close call out of my crew
Don't try it I fuckin' roast y'all, you and your co-stars
Next up to bat, I done had enough of cats
Blast tracks like what the fuck was that?
Roz spit rawness
State to state, hood streets and block corners
Rhymes hold so much weight, the feds on us
Lot of niggaz didn't wanna see me last
But I won't stop just slow down like Easy Pass
Back up and give the R room
Or we gon' brawl worse than cartoons in bar rooms
In my city they don't pop they collar
Cats that do, get shot drop and holla
I'm from the B-R-I, C-K-S
And my, squad is hot, any beef they bless
Any, squad that test gon' meet they death
Ask yourself, do you really need that stress?
(Shooga Bear)
Aiyyo, I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door, no bitin allowed
Plus the blows that I throw bring a light in the sound
So whoever want the drama I'm invitin them now
Phenomenal shit, spit till my abdominal split
Plus combined lines so minds demolish a click
Still burn MC's like Everclear, never fear
With razor sharp skills so ill they, sever ears
Hard to the roots a hundred proof with no chaser
Scarves and some boots a hundred troops with chrome bangers
Now rock with me, I spray blocks with glock fifties
Still when I spit I flip like Spock sent me
And never gave a fuck what a rapper grossed
But if they, brag and boast I'ma clap the toast
Y'all can analyze this, watch me paralyze clicks
And sabotage y'all, I ain't a fan of y'all shit
(Double O)
I'm a nasty ass disease, and now I got ya mouth celibate
I'm a direct descendant of Hannibal's elephants
That's word to mother, them damn jokes is over
You gon' run your mouth like a motor till I fuck up the rotor
It's Double O again, still runnin', still gunnin
It's like I got a cast-iron dick, I'm still cummin
Talkin' that killer shit like you blood raw
And ain't even did ten minutes in the back of a squad car
Be big niggaz to they weak, I'm true to the streets
Y'all niggaz is half-assed like one booty cheek
I'm (??), y'all is Swiss Miss
My camp'll make your army pull back like a slipped disc
It be the Bricks again, with me with them steel rods
It ain't right unless Shane, Tariq, and Raouf Nayim is involved
I did ery'thang from robberies to dope
And y'all just lie about it, like it's a big-ass joke
Playin' like kids, I think you want me to spank you
Ninety-nine on the charts with a ship anchor on your ankle
And if you niggaz don't like what I say
I'm in Newark on Market and Hasley e'ry fuckin' day

Brick City muh'fucka, that's the way it go down nigga, slow down nigga
Brick City muh'fucka, that's the way it go down nigga, sip yo' liquor

I'm like RRRAHHH RRRAHHHH, like I had cerebral palsy
My flows be's wet like all you girls drawers be
Crack the Phils, spread the buddha then the hidash
Roll it up and then ask, who chipped in for the ten bag?
Et cetera, I roll my blunts with two textures
Pick up fifty bags and then I smoke all the extras
It's the truth, like vod-ka one-eighty proof
Don't drop your drawers, I'll fuck through your daisy dukes (true!)
Put your fingers up in the air if you're high (hiiigh)
I walk by (by) so eff a drive (dry)
I swing up in it bout an average as half as
Good as Reggie Jackson's that's why you talk backwards
Enough; chumps be on some Bogart shit like Humphrey
You couldn't beat me if you ran with 21 Jump Streets
Or 90210, fuck it yo
In the movies I'm the nigga puffin buddha in the back row
(Chorus: Repeat 8X)
I can't wait to get it on
(Verse Two)
I'm just a smokey boy, I'm from the Land of the Lost
You can't see me, like Charlie Angels' boss; I'm often
Coolin 'round the blid-docks, I rock round the clid-dock
My glid-dock cocked, from here to 16th and Len-nox
Ask Roger Thomas if I'm gettin' scopic
I was milk like two tits, now I'm butter like Blue Bonnet
Now who got the funk? (We got the funk!)
Ay ay aiyyo well I got the weed! (We got the blunts!)
I never sniffed; I used to puff woolies in a jam
Back in eighty-eight, when it was twenties to the gram
Bizzail, you couldn't feel me in braille, hell
I write my names on walls in smoke spots when I'm buyin L
The fly guy with the Force like Luke Sky'
Down for a funk see twa bitch if you're fly
The Funkadelic, been rockin' mics since the fourth grade
I Terminate like X and I Terminate like Schwarzeneg
Dum-de-dum, rock like Buju Banton
Soup like won ton, funk by the tons, to rumps
PLEASE! My whole crew is makin' cheese
Tonight's the night baby, so suck up on these - and it's on
(Verse Three)
I said I, catch the A-train, to the left
Smoke the choc', I set shit off like Boba Fett
Big up to all my niggaz in the housin projects
I'm runnin' up in ya continue to split your guts
GRAB THE RAIL, if you get scared of my lines when I rock well
Got Whit's like Pernell, shit's the bomb like Ak'nel
Rickety rocket, mind deep as the Loch Ness
Waste niggaz like toxic, wet like galoshes
Can I handle my biz? (Yes you can!)
I cause Chaos, and bring a lot of Def-to-Jams
Yes I can; now act stupid I'll pop the trunk
Ka-KLUNK, now give me a ba-bump, BA-BUMP
Ooh cool, smooth like two blue suede shoes
Y'all faggots slept on my Hoffman and Kools
Word to Dan, Tan, Pillow and Cool B
Switchin speeds like Bruce Lee ridin' up Fuji in a movie
I drop it on the one, fuck the two-three
Funky like a box of coochies on loose leaf
Yo yo, I said...
Switchin up speeds, like Bruce Lee, ridin' up Fuji, in a movie
Heh, I be sayin' some shit!

Yo! Amazing grace how sweet the sound is of the fo' pound
To blast all these sound men that got the po' sound
Yippie-yi-yay, motherfuckers here's the show down
But since we're broke now with dope sounds now here we go now
Check the motion while I be puffin the pot-enent
Blow spots and urban networks with other experts
Plus this thing between my ear thinks clear
And the only thing it fears is the man upstairs
So fuck your bulletproof gear
If I decide to get your ass you better believe it's more than a blast
(Boo-ya) More like rough paragraphs out Alcatraz
And ash, your staff, let the grime our your ass
Everybody's hustling with sons toting guns
When Reggie Noble's sprung we stick nuns that got funds
Bomb niggaz like they did in Oklahoma
Freez, you're froze, Def Squad UHH, case closed

I be the, sneaky, second dimension, creepin' through your sector
Have nectar, leaking out you wack rhyme stressers
Extra deez disease leave rashes on rappers
Makin' MC's so feel the breeze of the Grandmaster
Packed with swift solid style structure
Simonizing MC's with the degree of street ruckus
Aiyyo who got guns? I split precise, spleen splitter
Return my physical presence to the borough of the hard hitters
I devour, night sun shower, menace last hour, weak man's last power
Body, the six four mind shotty
The one you handle, second dimension mind vandal
Laceratin your retina for tryin' to see this
As I'm flowin through the prism of the X-3-D
See at forty belows I freak flows that burn your nose
When you inhale the verbal blows, case closed
Chorus: Redman, Crossbreed

Aiyyo, why the fuck you tryin' to get funky on me nigga?

They're my niggaz!
Verse Three: da otha Crossbreed MC
Things ain't easy, 'cause we be, strugglin day to day
A bunch of stressed black men with not really much to say
Twistin up some brown paper that we struggle just to get
With the deaf dumb and blind become mentally equipped
As I extend my pen to wreak havoc on paper
I execute and burn MC's like Absolut with no chaser
Strong as chemical the general with rhymes
Past wreckin mics, I make the earth shatter like the 7th sign
My drama bringer bring about a new order
I'm sending a plague through your town like God to Sodom and Gomorrah
Your deacon, my vocals actions got you speechless
Make gangsta niggaz wanna go home and talk the cheapest
No man alive could bend on we, beatin' on rappers literally
X3D beez up on the streets dimensional trilogy
Got no love for foes, no respect for grimy hoes
Nuff said, X-3-D blowin' up, case closed"

That hustler from A.C.
(Gov-Matic)
I'm steady shittin on hoes, Grand Royal like the Green Eyed Bandit
Jump straight in the Lex offa New Jersey transit

And you dead gone when my squad come around
We hella illa from Isabella to Downtown"

Intro: Keith Murray
Yeah, bout to fly that knot
Redman, Keith Murray, Erick Sermon with the, Cosmic Slop
And we all pack glocks
Word is Bond, word is bond
Fuck around and get shot
Verse One: E Double
As I flip, skip to the beat, on wax, and tax
I react with tons of macs, a ball, and some jumping jacks
Flyin expert, puttin' in work
No question, cosmic funk and weed session
Like GangStarr, step up, it's Hard to Earn
But I change up the mode, and blow up the globe
The bandit, spittin' dialect umm (UMMM)
Catchin wreck umm (UMMM)
One two micraphone check (UMMM)
Attention passenger's we're on a non-central journey
To Hell and beyond
Funkadelic drop the bomb!
Verse Two: Redman
Boo-yaa!
I'm that type of nigga to give it to ya
My Cosmic Slop rules all blocks with funk maneuvers
My flow freeze the Nile, The Funk Child splits the river
Then I crush, like the bom-ba-zee was rushed, through my verbal lust
I'm spaced out, I LOST MY MIND ON CLOUD 19
VISINE FOR EYES, when I blow Alpines
Dial 9, 0-0, For the hero of the weirdos
I hope my brain don't bust
Transform into a 7-11 Slurpie Slush
IT'S THE FLY, My music will burn eyes
Twice the chemical of Clorox
Then I do an autopse on four cops
When my jaws drop, ock, I fidget my nuts alot
Got the two glocks, with oowops then bodies trace the chalk
I'm like an eclipse on a Friday, the 13th
With black cats and Haley's Comet, blazin' blunts in my driveway
Nostradamus predicted, for you funk fiends
That Def Squad will get the fuckin' cream like Noxem... geyeah
For those that remember pics and afros (it's on like that)
Platform shoes and bell-bottoms some got em
Spaced out, way out, is what I'm talkin' about
In the Cosmic Slop of the Ghetto
Zuzuzuzuzu, zuzuzu, zuzu zuzu zuzu
Zu zuzu, zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu
Verse Three: Keith Murray
With amazing manifestations, I dictate to nations
More Cosmic Funk innovations in my creation
This Cosmic sick mic cylcicyst
Mega segments, be Sega, like Genesis
I orbits the solar system, listenin
Guzzlin, never sippin, or slippin and sympin when the track is rippin
I gotcha brain cells bendin and twistin
Man listen, I give your whole crew a ass drenchin
Just for mentionin, goin' that route, runnin' yo mouth
You get your head smacked off towards down South
And your crew too will be spaced out
Way out, no doubt, y'all niggaz need to stop
And get with this Cosmic Slop
(Cosmic Slop, Cosmic Slop)
And now, we program, we program
Pop in the disk and who the hell is this?"
22,Creepin',1996,Muddy Waters (1996),,Redman,"All my country, funky, brother, motherfuckers
Verse One:
To my, no good niggaz, and my, no good bitches
Sorry if I left somebody leavin' out with stitches
Seems y'all too bold for ya britches
Enslaved your mind like cotton pickers for runnin' wit some rotten niggaz
I get raw to the core with hardcore metaphors
Resevoir Dog style, truly yours
Yes, I be the slug up in your chest
Then you wonder why you can't feel the full strength of ciggarettes
My nationality is, brutality
I got the gun up under your leather nigga so walk casually
You'd be surprised how much info you can get
For a bottle of crack to find yo' punk ass and yo' kinfolks
Plus, that crew you run with is butt
I was dusted one day when I made your man choke up
Rappers comin' to New Jersey and be gettin' fucked up
Talkin' about where they from and shit when dem sons ain't runnin' shit
And go off a BIT if you do a show in da Bricks
You'd swear you was fly and how we bring so much turbulence
I keep your nervous level high nigga
You better kiss your son and daughter, tell 'em bye nigga
When we creep
Verse Two:
I give respect to all my woolly niggaz with the Rolex
Shinin briquettes, flashin cash and dumpin Moets
Especially when my royalty check is late, I don't hesitate
I scoop up Keith, and see who's flashin at the Palla-
-Dium, hide your weed niggaz cause here I come
Lookin' bummy for low profile, so loud MC's overlook me
I slip the bartender some more
Just to tell me (how much cash and Dom P you pour)
Huh, I should start robbin rappers in the industry
If we ain't clickin then I'm engineerin your injuries
Forty-eight tracks of automatics and facts
Lyrically splat-datted till your mentality blacks
And I don't give a FUCK if you did thirty bids
Still I bring Ecstasy like I'm the rapper Jaleel
Blaow blaow blaow, lickin' shots for your fuckin'
Mind, I got you niggaz duckin out like I'm one-time
Or five-oh, po-po, I drive hoes nutty
Like I be doin' security at my live shows
Your A&R is a punk, he got you gassed
When I brutally smash any contender in my weight class
Aiyyo Twinz yo this nigga got jewels
(Hold that nigga while I rob this fool)
When we creep"
23,D.O.G.S.,2000,Doc's da Name 2000 (1998),,Redman,"Ha ha ha
Tokin on my indo...
Smokin' on a indo...
Lookin' through your window... (chi-chi, blaow!)
Doin' what I win doe, ha ha, ha... it goes
Who that tokin on my indo? Pow!
Fragile niggaz get mashed out
(Who dat?) The Funk D-O-C Spock hash mouth rhymer
The Prime Timer, sharper than barber shop liners
Look at my chin - ninety degree bent
When I spit I make devils come out East St. Loren (gin!)
I spend so much money on chalk and the indo
My weed supplier need to build a drive through window
My form of art rock, jewels with Clarks
When my bass sparks for fiends it disturbs the NARCs
Freak pattern after pattern to leave Angeles Los
The roughest rapper a DJ needle came across
Knock it in your Hummer; if it's too hot dial 9-1-1
Hook off on you like I Know What You Did Last Summer
Your dog is my dog, we dogs when it's thug time
When the fuckin' hoes keep that drow in your bloodline
Yo, I send this to all my DOG
To my real niggaz that are true DOG
Niggaz who will bust guns for they DOG
Niggaz who will spit ones for they DOG
Niggaz who be rollin' deep with they DOG
Niggaz who blaze blunts with they DOG
Niggaz who would do time for they DOG
Niggaz who would diss a bitch for they DOG
Yo I'm a dog
I piss on the wall in airport bathroom stalls
Grab the intercom and yell, ""Fuck you!"" in the mall
I drop it with the holocaust force, I got balls
I get my pants fitted twelve inches bigger than y'alls
I went to college, rockin' tie one below outfits
Dropped out, but stuck my friends for college deposits
Nigga, get a country nigga gun bustin'
Like they saw Tupac with two glocks still thuggin'
Fuckin' with a dog like me, I call your name out
While you pussy niggaz Call ID, when I blaze
You step life your wifee got a baby on the way
The way I flex son you think I'm made out of clay
I'm illin, my lyrics on the blocks make the killings
I string your moms out until diapers take to chillin'
I don't like to toot my own horn but I'm the shit
And if you hearin me I see you paid that twelve cent
So peace to homey $hort DOG
Peace to that funky nigga Snoop DOG
Peace to that old nigga Dirt DOG
Pour some beer out on the curb for your dead DOG
...
You can call a female a dog too (true)
You can feed they stinkin ass u-canu-bu, DOG
They fuck your enemies and bring the beef to you
You got me, I left a couple in your Fubu
A real raw dog never get jealous
They keep they shit cocked if niggaz try to dead em
So ask 'Face, keep your mind on your money
I keep the stinkin ass hoes doin' laundry DOG
'Cause I'm a dog"

Yo, yo, you motherfuckers gon' learn
When it come to this shit, I ain't about takin' turns
'Cause Doc's in the place
The cold nigga, I'm too late to thaw
Doc unfold niggas till they ribs is raw
Whether you up the ball or ride the bitch
My pens write with a vengeance and Viagra in
Stay hard like the biceps when it's stacked
I'm gritty, I wouldn't love in a tennis match
I don't like to sign autographs half the time
I scribble my name and draw a jackass design
Calvin Kleins spalled on the floor
You just got, dogged on the tour, so, send some new whores HO
I got a food table to warm, a new neighbor to warn
And people at the label I'm on
Crunch time, what you think the forty-four is for
When I grub I want the whole smorgasboard
Gotta clean my act up and, get my thoughts straight
Stop smashin the five and appear in the court dates
I won't ride the bike unless it's C B R
Wit no tricks but a bitch it'll be on next
I'm still wheel handlin, you die in a ambulance
Block prime scramblin, glock nine handlin
Duckin the flows of mind travelin
You heard it before, you ain't Sunshine Anderson
Got a bomb plantin and I'm ready fo' mo'
Bitches gettin' in my party givin' head at the do'
All my niggas and my shorty's and get high in the audience
I carry a gaudy gun, you'll die in the audience
That's the bullshit, the bullshit (We are that bullshit)
We walk up in the club we on the bullshit
That's the bullshit, the bullshit (We are that bullshit)
Fondlin your bitch ass off the bullshit

That's the bullshit, that's the bullshit (We are that bullshit)
That's the- nah, nah, nah, nah, chill nigga, that's the bullshit
(Redman)
Yo, I put the pressure on a man without a gun in my hand
His limpin lenny turn around and then I pump from the pants
One nine in each arm, I get hot as I squeeze from it
Now he's a cheap ornament, died in a street tournament
Peep the clues, not deep wit dudes
My Benz don't carry shoes 'cause I'm cheap as Jews
But I let off this cannon bet your fleet would move
After that I tell you and what the beat to do
Fuck the Visine, duck when I lean out the window
Wit a shottie wit me and myself and Irene and my team
Fuck your mainstream dry off feet
I'm explosive as Simon in Die Hard 3
Now you wavin six flags like you at GA
'Cause my gun on standby like a flight delay
Sprayin water on all those whoever's hot
Take they mic, take they jewels, then them Bezell, Doc...
(Icarus)
Stop Ic-Don, get gone, nigga I'm here
Sippin a beer, 5th with the clip in the rear
That'll lift him off his feet, make him flip in the air
I pull big guns out, like I'm hittin a deer
You don't really know when trouble come
When you open your door and somebody in yo house chewin bubble gum
With double guns, cocked in each hand
Nigga you about to be buried in beach sand
I don't care if you broke or not
I don't care if you sell weed, dope, coke or not
Nigga I still smoke the glock
Give your face polka dots, y'all better hope I stop
Man doom, I kidnap a classroom
Hide 'em in the left wing of my bathroom
Do you think you could survive all that we bring ya
Bullets, comin' at ya just as long as your finger
And every, morning I linger on the corner just drinkin'
Borin and thinkin', how I'm bout to score with this ink pen
You better hope we blow on this rappin' shit
You don't want us to go under the mattresses
Shorty lookin' at me funny like I don't get bank
My house is hot bitch, I swim in my fish tank
Every car got a bar, the whole clique drink
I'm a dirty nigga, nuts sweaty, dick stink
After we fuck, I'm takin' you to S and D's
That's a lie bitch I am on ecstasy
I won't remember none of this when the X in me
So if you want sex for free, check for me, Ic-Don..."

Haha, ha ha ha!
Everybody light your blunts, get your smoke on
Hahah
All you bitches drop your drawers... witcha stinkin ass (stinkin ass)
Just roll that weed (roll that weed) just roll that weed (roll that weed)
Verse One:
Aiyyo, yes it's me the MC Grand Royal
Spittin' that Newcleus I suggest you Jams On It
I'm not a role model I cracks the Beck's bottle
Smoke blunts, play pretty MC's as sex models
So inhale exhale what you smell?
Derail the frail blind MC off my trail
If he use braille, see I never been touched
Regulate the street tactics then parlay in the cut
Uhhah, lay back and hit this while I shit this
Flip this, get some ass flow at long distance
And plus I pack nine inches in my britches
And keep an instant lit for the funky ass bitches
Newark, New Jersey's on the map, ?comprende?
And confrontations start from the blunts and the Reme
And if an-y, MC out there wanna test
Call my boy Poppa C to put a slug in your vest
Chorus: (from Whut? Thee Album ; ""Tonight's Tha Night"")
Check, I walk around the street with the black tec nine
By the waistline, kickin the hype shit
So turn the volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bump, ba-bump, make your speakers pop
(Repeat 2X)
Verse Two:
Owwww, shit I'm just one hip nigga
Shit is off the hook when my crew is in the mixture
What I deliver, over tracks and rivers
Is making your lungs collapse and quiver, it's the
PPP foundation in your ass
We be the bomb like that Oklahoma blast
Then outlast, a few clowns, sounds
Raps, stay bein the mack like Dru Down
Ask me what I smoke and I say, ""It's the method!""
Funk off the hook I leave shit disconnected!
What's the name of that town rollin' up trees?
(Jersey smokin' up the bom ba zee!)
It don't stop, you better move slowly
I make that chest wet and cosy
Then dip lowkey like OG's
Then inject that antidote to make you OD
You know a better flower get the dough G and show me
I bet you I make 'em more pussy than Jonsy *meow*
And show 'em How High I am just from the nosebleed (How High)
I keep it Naughty By Nature
Kick that rugged shit that Maybelline could make-up, lace up
(Yeah Funk Doctor, represent one time for all the blunt smokers)
Smokin' weed

Let me hear you go ooh! (ooh!)
Smoke lalala (smoke lalala)
Let me hear you go ooh! (ooh!)
Smoke lalala (smoke lalala)
Verse Three:
Funk Doctor, got your ass locked down proper
Let me next blast derelicts, binaca
I'ma Star at War, smoke blunts, don't Chew-bacca
The head banger boogie for the marijuana shoppers
Lace the tracks with stacks of artifacts
Make the police arrest me for givin' the cardiac
'Cause I'm the shitter, headbanger non-quitter
Twenty blunt a day nigga, Landcruise whipper
I represent, commence to beat an instrument
Who's next to get that ass bent ten percent
I make you boo pass off your jewels you lose cause

React opponent, I Got Five On It
Met some hoochie, now I got fifty-five on it

That ol' P funk cut?
Yeah, make my funk the P funk
Yeah, yeah, that's it
Well, what we gonna do is we gonna reminisce on that ol' shit

I wanna know is my niggaz in the house?
Hell yeah!
I said is my motherfuckin niggaz in the house?
Hell yeah!
So everybody just light your spliffs up
Yeah
Get your skunk weed and light that shit up
And let the funk be your guiding light
You heard it comin' from the lungs of the funkadelic brother himself
More funk than a bag of skunk
Twice the funk that James Brown's socks
Hit me
Hittin you straight across your notch
Wit a tune
Yo, Redman, drop it
Make my funk, the P funk
I wants to get funked up
Make my funk the P funk, we thump
Lyrics that bounce the brain, make emcees jump
Sky high
Can't touch the level so why try?
Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy
Rough and rugged, and brother it takes ten to conquer
That's why I'm on probation
Ever since three, I cut throats of emcees
Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of two-ten
Not from an oven, but mac ten
A mac twenty maybe if I didn't subtract ten
My background straight from a black man's culture
Want more, buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle, damn you
Too hard to handle
E Double slam once, and Redman slam two
Break hooks, earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay, bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power
Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor
Make mines the P funk
Chorus, Repeat 2X
I'm back with the funk, chump
You want funk, how many lumps?
I got spunk
I'm well known like Donald Trump

Choose the date, today you hallucinate
Smokin' me out without war, torn, ghettoes
Opposite of Goodfellows, Dinero
Go to any borough who rock the mic thorough
Got your wife sayin', ""Not tonight, hello!""
Money talk, bullshit walk, ask Kris
The baptist, roll Garcia's with hashish
You need classes for practice to tap this
Jurassic crab shaft nasty ass bitch
Hot potato, drop the data
Guard your Emancipation Proclimator
Lock shit down, cock the pound - no doubt
As a juvenile, brought Cazals off canal
Brick City be the pros at wildin out
Off at the mouth, get dressed like Thousand Isle
Got a degree, on the hash and the leaky
Crash in the V while we Master the P

Spit somethin' to you then turn your eyes cockeyed

Fuck such and such, I roll tight like handcuffs
Rock that ass to sleep with discrete techniques
I beez that, freak of the week like I made Knee Deep
Hold up! Rotate around the solar, badder than Cobra
Composure never sleeps, my stream pumps Folgers
I'm sauteein MC's with fried rice up in the wok
Without the MSG and chopped celery
See, I made it, my flavor situated
From the nickel plated mic that's hot, to leave your brain inflated
Plus, I'm thick like Quakers on papers
Bodacious MC's get turned to lower cases
Lettering, and the medicine, that I'm swallowin
Get you hollerin, like Marvin Gaye when his father shot him
In the chest, I roll with two stacks of Tecs
And mad niggaz and sess that I roll up in your rest
UHH! Mister Fantastic's crafted, with no 52nd ass kick
When I'm blasted, my Method magics get drastic
That you can't see with bifocals
Watchin MC's go up and down like stock brokers
I leave your brains on tilt, with ill skills that's milk
That's rougher than jeans that Gloria Vander-bilt
I'm poppin' mad shit, plus I can back it
Your man'll be like ""Yo, get that dust off yo' jacket""

It ain't a test or quiz that my Squad can't win
Those who know the biz, know we wreck kids get biz
Y'all digest, multiple stab wounds to the chest
And I copycat kill the rest, with no Method to my madness
Plus the apparatus with the baddest
Determined to be the last man, standin on the planet
Y'all get attached, like a blood-suckin leech
When you fall into my rhythm of speech
Your hands get embraced with a touch of the bass
Head get wrapped up neck get thrown in a neck brace
Rough rhyme mechanical, lyrical at it who?
Will ironically chronically murder you and your crew
My directive, through where I live, is kinda primitive
See I get to the bottom of the problem, and make shit give
Step in the jam, hooded and high, plastered the master
Cast to the masses grabs the mic
Ten dollar rappers, is what L.O.D. goes after
To my Squad, there's no matches, we bashes
Do photo flashes on all flavor S-classes
Bomb attack on wax, lyrical mini mac to your back
Tie you up, throw you in the act

Drunk slow funk flow for Reggie Noble
Fuck with me doe, Mally G doe it's not logic

Around and round, avoidin the time to put it down
Now's the time here yeah

'Cause I'm crazy off that chronic from my man grandson
I shoot to kill, puff blunts in Hooterville
I be murderin MC's from up here to Urbantown
I sweat dark, when I get off my shit ock
Yoyoyo that's that's E and them!
Yo word up? Yo what's going on?
Yo chill chill chill chill
*Car squeels, bullets fire and ricochet*
*Tires squeel and car crashes*"
30,Da da DaHHH,2000,Doc's da Name 2000 (1998),,Redman,"Yo, I gotta back ache, stomach ache, diahrea, vomiting
Cold feet, runny nose, head ache, insomnia
Cranky, moody, burpin' while I'm cursin'
Baby chair tied in a suburban drinkin' burban
I'm only 3, and gotta chip motorola
A hoochie babysitter with snitches by the stroller
Lyin', cryin, whinin', teasin'
Suckin' tities like I had years of breast feedin'
In the beginning I was sinning
Kept my mama back and forth
To the hospital for the constant kickin'
Kept them ass whippin', I'm gettin' them all
Show off like Fodolo so fuck all y'all
Do you get your ass whipped with your mom's bad luck
Like AHUH YEU YEU get hit by a truck
Playin' catch a girl, fuck a girl
Throw her in a sandwich
Just a young boy doing grown man shit
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
Like kickin' your ass
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
Smokin' weed
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
All day check it out
I'm only 13 puttin' in work
Rockin' Chinese shoes with high top converse but first
We was all gas watchin' game of def with Bruce
Walkin' home from the movies (* Red makes karate movie noises *)
I thought about the sex often
I even kept a heartland for them white girls on magic garden
Light skin, chubby and shit
Ran my mama's phone bill for callin' Biggs Biggs Biggs
The old hands used to make them little niggaz fight
The lead patch was the shit if you snatch it right
And everybody knew the pattern of pac man
Rams was 15 and that then was happenin'
Niggaz used to get robbed at twin city
I was cuttin' on SL's glue with a penny
When EPMD dropped It's My Thing
I said damn I gotta get up in this rap game
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
Like touchin' your tities
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
Like Stealin' my mama's car
I used to tell my Sis I'm gonna make it bitch
So close to gettin' on I could taste the shit
In a hot ass room cuttin' smooth operator
In my last year at West Side High I barley made it
Flippin eightballs, going to Montclair State
I passed one class and still owe their ass cake
For quick cash, Doc hit up 13th ave
Sell white boys oregano dash then we laughed
That was the days now the times switched up
Son either walk them dogs, sunff it or get snuffed
Them ho's got triflin' but much thicker
My weed got better so easily I fucked shit up
I test y'all with my def squad cam
And I don't stage show dive unless y'all amp
To all my fans, arivaderchi to ya
And any ho that didn't blow Doc, I NEVER KNEW YA!
Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit
Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit
Like still sqeezin' your titties
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
With a big ass car
Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit
Rollin' better credit
Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit
Yo yo shit is crazy
Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit
Like smackin' your ass
Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit
Like shaving my beard
Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit
I got hair on my chest!"

Guerillas out the jungle get gritty now WHAT?
I'm walkin' barefooted over the loads of hot coal
Cuts from the snot nose keep your barbershop closed
When it goes, Flex don't have to drop the bomb on it
I keep my speech, bleek, and my right mind on it
So when it's my time, I'm heard in the streets
My mammal animal skin, excitin all the birds in your Jeep
I'm crazy nigga, when I was young
I spread and shaved both legs to my babysitter
Ran into BeBe's kids in a baby pickup
Shot up Toys R us and robbed Kay-Bee nigga
This is Def poetry far beyond my control
Fuck your teflon, be body armed like the toll
Unload from my Girbauds and make it hot for Homie

Sounds of the motherfuckin' men
Tryin' to get your chain, tryin' to get your chain
Flush this down the drain

Be an influence

I'm ET zooted, way out there
You got weed? Then roll with the Sonny and Cher
Suffering succotash, I leave you suckers sufferin'
Huffin', puffin', at last

Where they hate cops, on every block there's a weed spot
This is Brick City, hear the gun jam
If you don't run family with a suntan
This is Brick City, hear the gun spit
Niggas jump ship when we spit, 'cause we run shit
Play pussy wit' us and get fucked quick
Who got the duchess?
Yo, I keep the ghetto in me, I love the sweet taste of revenge
I'm focused, my soul's been cleansed
Now I know who the enemy and who the friend
But still, with my eyes closed they both blend
I'm not a follower, I start the trend
Y'all can follow that dummy, I'mma follow this money
Now I'm at the age, where I need to get paid
If a nickel bag gets sold in the park, hey
Did I stutter? I got the guns and butter
My craftwork be movin' the numbers
I keep a Roscoe like Kurupt brother
Hang out my window, blaow, what up, fucker?
Violence sells, but I ain't a violent male
But if you violate, I'll play the violin well

Don't be like Zoolander waitin' for that Blue Steel

Verse One: Method Man, Redman
Who wanna flip with the acrobatic
From ground zero all the way to attic, what we be smokin', Tical
The reservoir is now open
I swim the English Channel backstrokin, you don't know me or my style
We hold court and blow trial
You catch 'cal when you browse through my X-Files, who be next now
Man's down, hands down
Foreground by your side when it go down, I dedicate this next dart
To my fucking heart
Little Meth he the best part, now walk with that one, word
Time Time 4 Sum Aksion
Dreamin' bout Toni Braxton, blowin' her back out like Bob Baglin
I'm throwin' wrestling holds
Tag team with Funk Doc, we in funk mode, take yo' best shot
If it don't hip it don't hop
If it don't quit it don't stop, that's the life
I be the super-lyrical individual I be splittin through
That Teflon material to knock Big Ben off of schedule
Better move with a set of tools
I be doin' it to mics when I'm a, heterosexual
I load the mic then cock, drop it like three-quarters
When I slaughter don't get caught in the water
Cause the Brick's got it's own World Order
Leave your bitch in shock like the third rail caught her
Styles stay deeper than orca, I float the seven seas with ease
Did more drugs than pharmacies
So call me that lyrical Genovese, you can't compare
Get you steppin like stairs, frats, sororities
Don't make me bring it on back I fuck up the majority
Of niggaz lookin' hard at me, I Port 'em like Authority
And when my nigga Meth shine
Out the inner How High mobile rollin' three dimes at a time

Get hit from the bottom to your head when you enter
Word...
Just do what ya feel and I'ma follow (3X)
Funk Doc break it down
Verse Two: Redman, Method Man
Yo, suck my dick out of animosity
The velocity will fly that head and freeze your camps like pottery
To give lobotomies to all you rap colonies
And shunt your million dollar investment, to economy
Impossibly might be the one in black leather
Name tag sayin' 'caution when wet by the track wetter'
The hash spreader, I love the grimy shit
Even my girl did grimy shit to me and I went back with her
Three years for carrying a loaded handgun
But it's forever when a nigga (chik-chik BLAAAOW) and he lands one
To your cranium
That red dot on your forehead it's not cause you Arabian
(Yo watch you say to him!)
You caught up in a tight situation
I should start erasin your whole organization for makin'
Wack tunes while my whole platoon rock the basement
You couldn't come close if I gave you my bookin agent
Or producer, royalty points twelve shot loaded Luger
Even a crowd to get you souped up, you're still wack
I peel caps, on the regular
Destroy MC's et cetera, creep like The Predator
Fuck you, your label moms and your editor
Give you two to the jugular, blood be spreadin
All on my shirt, the king of the flirt shittin
Bitches hit me off more than New Edition
(Tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet)
I make them pigs heart skip a beat from the steel physique
So Iron Lung (born to wonder)
Get on the mic and break 'em off a sumthin sumthin
We moonshine and grow crops
Purchasin the handhelds with the sure shots, it got me spittin'
These slugs at my competition, in rap sessions
U-A-P ain't got no weapon, you lip professin
Next in, line, parental discretion advised
These explicit, street linguistics
Better than yo' momma biscuits, we bomb shellin
I might know but ain't tellin', too bad you missed it
Johnny, Dangerously Blaze another enemy made another due paid
Color-safe bleach so I don't fade
Scar your mental with my double edged blade, razor sharp
Get yo' bandaids hold that
Like E said, Get the Bozack, show them wack niggaz where the do's at
On the case like I'm Kojak
Kissin' the grits on that Flo bitch, flip scripts take LOOONG shits
Raider Ruckus

Balls of Steel, clappin those with rap deals
Fuck hot, I'm lukewarm and still perform like a champ
Battle bout, airing your ass out
So who's dropping shit on what day? My click's the greatest
Chill, or feel the effect of hi-atus
Shit shuts down when the Squad's around
It gets Thinner, it's hexed like white man from town
Three the hard way can't be touched
My style's too faraway, to capture, even with help from NASA
I'm what they call, a living legend, sha-POW

Yo dial funk if you're mo' stiff than Riker's Isle bunks
Get out your seat, E, spit out the beat
The tracks plow underground concrete out the streets
From baldies to fades, when I rock MC's wave
More flags than Puerto Rican Day parade
And give up, I got the rare footage, of fiends walkin'
Barefooted off my rhyme don't dare cook it
You might fall in to intervene
And New Jacks and they girl become Pookie and that, PROM QUEEN
That bodybag won't fit you tonight
You wanna blow up? Drop the mic, stick to the pipe
Hand to hand my crew'll cripple your click in a fight
Take my tapes way Down South and triple the price

Of antagonizing anxiety attacks

Niggaz be like, ""OH NO NOT THEM!"" Yeah we back
With rhythmatic articulation, God-forsaken
Sick manifestations, PUMP PUMP in your face then
The lyrical force that I put in a rhyme
Will hit you with more power than a molecule enzyme
No matter who what when where how I'll lay you down
With a sick illed out fictitious style
Yo, we all represent the hood -- the only difference
Between us is that we make the shit look good!
Programmable annual slammable
You Lyte as a Rock and I Cram to Understand You

Hey piece of shit, pass me the scalpel

I said, Piece of Shit, check his vitals
Yes, master
The vitals are dead, sir (Aww)
Oh wait, he's got a pulse (Yes)
I think you have to give him mouth to mouth, sir
Shit, that nigga'd died if I have to give him mouth to mouth
There's only one thing for us to do, Piece of Shit
We gonna have to hit this motherfucker with everything we got
Everything, master?
Yes
But that could kill him
I know but fuck it

Please stay seated, yeah, and hold on even FUCKIN' tighter now
Cause this next section's, as big as the
FUCKIN' BLEEDIN Ti-FUCKIN-tanic!
And it's called the Heart Attack Mountain;
Which we feel is self-explanatory (""Stop stop stop stop!"")
(Streetlife)
Yo, I know the streets is watchin'
Dirty date niggas cock-blockin' and plottin'
Waitin' for my downfall, Street got options
Fuck y'all, y'all can ball, I'ma stay rockin'
All emcee's paused when they heard the album's droppin'
Nuttin but the hottest hip-hop rap concoction
Rap's in a state of emergency, it's shockin'
I produce, joints that loosen up the socket
Crowd surf through the mosh pit on some rock shit
Bang your head to this, pump your fist if you feelin' it
Wild the fuck out, bust a clip for the fuck of it
This is as good as it get, who you rollin' with? (You)
Who the ultimate? (Wu)
Stay committed, sold my soul to this rap shit (nigga)
Slow your roll, strike a bowl, you get clapped quick
I roll with, ghetto bastard with biscuits
And grab my dick and flick it, get the picture

Yo, yo, yo
I cop a new Benz, crash the front
So hard the airbags use nasal pumps
Jump out, cock the shottie (raise 'em up!)
I stomp holes like the ground ain't paved enough
Inform the former the first step was a warm-up
The next step'll bomb on where your car alarm was
Chikens that'll run in, burn the barn up
Shots'll tear ya Sean John and Phat Farm up (nev-ah!)
I never got a Soul Train award (nev-ah!)
Never lost to emcee's as lame as y'all (nev-ah!)
Trick a bitch car payment off
I'm a orangutang when the chain is off nigga
I set-trip, and I slowly blas
With a axe, and a pump, and a goalie mask
Leavin', stains of blood on your Roley glass
When I'm, in your hood nigga throw me bags
Hold on...

Let's trip the night fantastic
I'm flexible, they used to call me plastic
These big butt bitches get they ass kicked
It is what it is, shittin' on y'all kids
Couldn't live where we live
I can't be defeated like ""Nobody Beats the Wiz""
Like, when daddy's home can't nobody beat the kids
Right? You know the Clan and you know the fuckin' man
Meth rock a mic without a kickstand
Two blunts, and razors in his wristband
Slap you and your bitch man
Lookin' in your lobby, call me stick-man
When it's goin' down, call me quicksand
Zero to sixty in a second, pack a Smith and Weston
And if the price is right, you can be the next contestant
For this aggression, no question, M-E to the F
And be flexin as hard as my erection
Kid learn your lesson 'cause what if I decide to start testin
Your joint - end the motherfuckin session

Yo, yo - let a nigga get into it
Lubricate y'all veins with this ""Do-It"" fluid
I Einstein the rymes, spit them thangs to prove it
Cross with the Mack, in fact, my game's the truest
Now I'm on the highway, doin' it my way
With Street, Illegal, Meth, Roc, and Doc Friday
Performin like the weather was warm
And drop heat on the streets through zero degree storms
And keep the ghetto, pop your metal
Smoke it like a cigarette till ya optic yellow
The addiction, ain't no friction
I got them rap heads fillin out a prescription, with diciton
Gettin' thick when I put fire to the steaks
And burn the odds, like a iron to your face
These long hard years spent Oxy-Cleanin
Make it clear - look out, Big 'Sauks is here, nigga what?

Cause my flow's so dope you can put it in your veins
Put this in your brain, I'll leave this bitch cookin
Blind to the fact but I still see you lookin'

(Redman)
Yo, yo
Muscle my way in, old fathers mine
Tattooed Gilla, feelin' in my prime
Pull up a Coupe a color niggaz can't find
Plasma TV on the mirror outside
I overdo it strong, got chicks that buck ya down
From Vietnam that look like Nia Long
I'm hot, my collar stand up like The Fonz
To hold my guns you need wet and karma bombs
You got chubby? I got chubby too
Me starve in the park, nigga you on ComicView
You funny, I flood the area tsunami
Wash out the weak niggaz, then I tag 'em Dry Me
I'm married to the game, the brass my music
When Brick's in the house, there's a problem Houston!
I guzzle Crunk Juice to the neck
So when I walk in the party ain't nobody gon' do shurrr
Redman is shurrr, it's the principality
Oven like wurrrm for the lyrics I burrrn
Nigga wait your turrrn, we can battle in a second
So I can bankrupt ya like, Chapter 11
I'm the shit like Janet Jackson undressin
Believe it, when I quarterback you receive it
Same crib on MTV Cribs mine
I ain't lyin' cause my eyes redder than iodine
I'm back muh'fucker, so up your chain
I'ma leave the same way I came, that's thorough
I run up in your hood like 80 deep
Have it sound like Drumlines at A&T, muh'fucker
(Chorus: Redman)
Gilla House - check, Def Squad - check
White tee - check, Goretex - check
When we said we number one - we lied
We number one two three four AND five
Gilla House - check, Brick City - check
89 - check, cash yo - check
""They don't give a fuck about what y'all niggaz doin""
{*Scratch: ""Holla at your b-boy-boy!*}
(Redman)
If you find a bag of weed on the floor, pick it up
And if you find it I got 10 on the dub
I'm hard to find like pickin' weed out a rug
I'm worldwide fool, I don't care about a buzz
Dawn of the Red, goin' for the bread
I got pitbulls hooked on to a sled
My block'll riot like they shot Cornbread
The Pres'll find a missile with a foreign head
KABOOM! Guess who stepped in the room?
Streetsweeper out, ready to vacumn
Then all of a sudden, you get it in the end
Like Kane from Marlena cousin, I'm a menace
I was broke as hell, first time I made it
Now e'rything I own is voice activated
Boy I'm lyin', I'm just tryin' to make cheddar
Cause my doorbell is rubbin two wires together
(Chorus: Redman)
Gilla House - check, Wu-Tang - check
White tee - check, Nike Air - check
When we said we number one - we lied
We number one two three four AND five
Gilla House - check, Uptown - check
Purple haze - check, cash yo - check
""They don't give a fuck about what y'all niggaz doin""

Yo, Redman 'Back in Business' like EPM -
D whips I drive, I gotta TV'em
I tour New York down, so B.B. King'em
Found my way back home like E.T. finger
I rock the arena, you know the drill
Get high, get drunk, grab a hoe and chill
Eat a meal, then back to the hood for more action
Promotin' Red Gone Wild with no backin
Doc get five on the mic like Joe Jackson
Foreign bitches feelin' me for my accent
Talk like a boss, I can't complain
When I do it, it's big like Fulton in St. James
I got Brick City, even D.C. bitches
They all steal for me outta P.C. Riches
I move like a pimp, but I'm far from one
Like Lil Weez, I got army guns
Gimmie one, nigga
1, and here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4
And here comes the 3 to the 2 and 1 (Gimmie one, nigga)
And here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4
And here comes the 3 to the 2 and 1 (Gimmie one, nigga)
And here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4
And here comes the 3 to the 2 and 1 (Gimmie one, nigga)
And here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4
Yo, If you don't like me, fuck you, I flex one muscle
Doc got more effects than kung fu hustle
I'm uptown, buyin the perk
Lookin' cut clean, jeans, [?] designer shirt
Redman fell off, what the talks about?
I wasn't lettin y'all swim when the shark was out
Rollin' red carpet out, it's Jersey
Me and them together is like Lil' Seymour and Big Percy
I knew women from high school that picked on me
Now I see them, they all wanna lick on me
I hood down homie, rock like Bon Jovi
I can work the nightshift like he Brian Mobley
Brick City, boy, my flow is on fire
Disagree, I go in your mouth like botox
Pick up Pete Rock, nigga, we all cool
Hit the highway and ask, ""Is the CL smooth?"" nigga
Your style might be parkay, but mine butter
That bitch can't break no bread, then why fuck her
I'm kinda cocky, homeboy, did I stutter?
I pop the umbilical cord on my mother
I jumped out the womb, I became a whale
That's hard to harpoon, I need more room
The hood love me, so I keep it real gully
I got handsome, but my flow is still ugly
Turn the treble out the track and I'll jet
I lines in my rhyme are longer than Ikea
I stay on my grind, but when I come up with an Idea
The year, is party over here
It's 5 years I disappeared, but I'm back
And tell Nino Brown and them that I'm crack
Grab my bozack, middle finger is up
I got your grandma givin' it up
Gimmie one, nigga!"

There's no second time around like Shalamar
Hit the New York bar, high on the broccoli
Then hit Queens for a queen like King Jaffe
Sixteens I go off like Biz Markie
Sixteen rounds, I buck like Milwaukee
Come on ride, it sounds like homicide
All you marks will know it's the other guys
Gettin' fly while rap is in danger
Six guns, one man, thirty six chambers
Brick city on board like a campaign
And we ain't drinkin' 'less Don is the champagne
Got flows more looser than your spare change
Look dummy, we ain't never in the same lane
Either go hard or go home
You know a nigga like me keeping that chrome
[?] hittin' my phone
You know a nigga like me'll go hard
I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard
I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard
Hey, the same chick I tell you you pop lockin'
That's the same chick you take to go shopping
Young niggas [?]
Leave 'em talkin' through the box like Troutman
That's why nigga act so hood
I roll up looking at you like ""what""
I can't lie but I like to floss
(?)
New Eras on, [?] in motion
Hot chicks love it how I kick it and coach 'em
They'll do whatever, I'm richer than both of 'em
Vegas, I may get eleven on a ocean
Whoa, can't do it then allow me
I show y'all a real cannon, body
I yell ""Action"" no [?]
And [?]
Yo, how you gonna find another nigga like me
Even my inner-like me doesn't like me
I'm so cocky wanna mock me
But their styles sloppy like als in ta swap meet
Your barbershops' gettin' faded
Finally the weakest links get eliminated
All you young boys that yellin' out ""We made it""
How you gonna create what I [?]
I'm going hard"

So check the, manuscript, man you flipped
Put it down if you can't handle it

You can bet bitch you couldn't get fly if you were FedEx
Can I, drop the funk on ya, run it on ya
Strong as ammonia, smell it from here to California
Cause Reggie Noble dropped that cock named Noble at Sunoco
I'm better than rice and beans when I rock you ocho to ocho
My music more underground than a kid at 300 XL
Convertible, fuel-injected, that's why my style's well-respected
I'm dope on the ridealz, so fidealz, on my didealz
And chumps are wondering what two niggaz dropped the funk funk
Verbally you never heard of me I smoke you third degrees
And cause surgery for emergency
Cause Reggie Noble's known like burglary
I get hot busted when I dip my nuggets
Hey, if it take a million niggaz to stop it just like Chuck did
'Cause we run around Newark with the nine cock
Keep it heated for the brothers that's not off my block
And if ya don't know the flavor, be a tough guy and enter
So go show you more nigga events than Jacob Jaffrey center
I'm genuine, to the rhyme, get your canines
Cops that got the hot glock stocked for when it's playtime
I rock around the Robin TWEET TWEET on the calendar
Cause you couldn't pull my number if your class major was Algebra
I make bitches moan to my Stallone without Sylvester
'Cause I'm more deadlier than a whole school system of investors
So check us, I always smoke mad blunts before breakfast
'Cause I, Get Around like 2Pac with Poetic in my Justic
Hold tight, hold tight, everybody hold tight
I'm sooper like my man cat, 'cause I keep my styles jam packed

Them bones, them bones, them bones will have you fucked up
I blaze blunts with my nigga Mellow, yo say hello
(Yo whattup dogg?)
Really, now pass the second blunt to Quilly
Now sit your big ass down 'cause I don't know about this rap stuff

Y'all y'all whippersnappers, with the caps on backwards
Man, y'all fuck around with Quilly I kick a bone out yo' ass quick
Watch out now, I ain't bullshittin

And if you keep on with that dirty mistreatin
I'm gonna whoop your ass, till your heart stop beating
And yo, chronic bubonic the funky bionic
You find it I'll have to rewind it where minds are blinded
Time 4 Sum Aksion so time to find it
I smoked out like a cookout, look out my dick's out
That was last album when I was bouncin' on trains like Malcolm
I was hiiiiigh, I thought I wouldn't survive
That's why I quit my nine to five and got live
Because this hip-to-the-hop shit fills my pockets
And I'm Audi for ninety-four because I already got my props

Some say it's chill, New York throw chairs
The punk funk sound to make a sane man flip
Girls rush the stage, faggots cold dip
Low to avoid the caps and blows
By the gangbanners at the B-boy shows
Wit the cops trying to control the crowd
But they can't, systems crank ""So What'cha
Saying""'s pumping loud
Blows are thrown, heads are flown like Pan Am
Brothers licking off like the son of Sam and
The bass continues to thump
Some brothers hit the parking lot to go pop trunks
Hoes are slapped, jewels are snatched
Brothers are caught in the cross fire without no
Caps
And on my way out, I heard a sucker scream and shout
""Niggas, Niggas"", yeah, cold turn the party out

Rap combat squares sat and I attack
Any crab MC that's down wit the wack
And I wreck and if I can not snap a neck
Throw a knock, I'll blow and look for a tech

I can't be beat, I'm too sweet plus clever
I'm smart, yes, I'm a so called genius
I'm equip wit the thinking cap they call

Yo, wit that, I can break fool
Especially when the posse is thick and got tools
Make me feel good 'cause they got steel
No blasters or cap guns son, the real deal

Check it out
Yo, 1992 begins the new wave for the blunt rollers
You know what I'm sayin'?
The saga of the philly blunt continues
The flava's the P-Funk y'all, get wit it
Check it out...
Check out a new type of gimmick which is splendid
Since you're down with other shit, let's see if you're down with this
It's about... strictly trying to roll a blunt
When you get the hang of it, you'll catch more blunts than Archie Bunk
First of all you get a fat bag of ism
From uptown, any local store sells the shit friend
Purchase a philly, not the city of Philly
Silly punk, I'm talking 'bout the shit called the Philly blunt
Lick the blunt and then the Philly blunt middle you split
Don't have a razor blade, use ya fuckin' fingertips
Crack the bag and then you pour the whole bag in
Spread the ism around until the ism reach each end
Take your finger and your thumb from tip to tip
Roll it in a motion then the top piece you lick
Seal it, dry it wit ya lighter if ya gotta
The results, mmmmmmmm... proper
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt
...And get fucked up (yeah)
(Repeats again)
The second paragraph might makes you laugh
When a brotha rolls a blunt and his breath smells like gr-ass
That's when you know you gotta take the blunt from him
'Cause his breath has the dragon in the dungeon
(Yo, yo, yo, light the blunt. uh yo, here's the lighter)
I would if this shit would stop drippin' wit saliva
And if you gonna lick it, don't drown it with ya spit, shit
I dunno what dick or last puss you licked quick
And how 'bout the non-blunt rollin' females
That always fucks it up 'cause they don't wanna break their Lee nails
(Hee hee hee hee hee, sorry Red for spilling it)
You better pickup every seed of it
Because I paid 10 bills for the get ill...
And for spilling it you better get lost or get grilled
Bo know everything from sports to other stuff
But I bet you Bo dunno know to roll a blunt
(Hey nigga pass the gotdamn blunt. shit! what you holding it all day for?
Sit yo big ass down...)
Yo, yo, check this out
I want all the real niggas out there and the females too
If you got a fat blunt in ya mouth and you feeling high as hell

I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up...)
I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell)
I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell) Yeah
Last but not least, Redman would like to say peace
To all the blunt rollers from the Tri-State to the Middle East
And gimme a blunt when I kick the bucket
Devil or no devil when I am the wrong to be fucked with
So everybody put they blunt up in the air
Take a puff, blow the smoke out like ya just don't care
So..(pump up the volume)...so it's heard through the next block
I'm out, peace to Red Foxx, I'm off to the cess spot...

Watch the formula pour sucka absorb it up
And while you foamin up from the two in your Nautica

Lick a shot, BLAOW, think the Doc is goin' pop?
Eat a cock, BLAOW, ready for real hip-hop to
Rock you block, BLAOW, all chicks I turn 'em out
Send they boyfriends back home, takin' the garbage out
Ha ha, yo, I'ma sewer rat the tracks
With gats bigger than Will Smith gat in Men in Black
And if it's Friday, you better double your lap
I hit you on the floor sayin', ""My neck and my back!""
Yo, let's settle it out of court for ten dollars smoke
Two-fifty in Jawbreakers, dollar in envelopes

Take the Shanks out of Shaw Redemption and hold it to your jaw
Climb aboard, jump out the ninety-ninth floor
That bitch on the salt box, know when I rain I pour
Shoot up the Mardi Gras with double chrome forty-fours
Full up plates, cause someone I'm ready to take yours!
Jungle music got my mind and body stimulatin
Hyperventilatin, you're talk of the town like date raping
Call me the Doc-casian Spot, The Beatles
Malfunction in the SL Board without the EQ
Fuck fuck fuck bitch I'll bust a nut all over that gut
Buck buck buck souflee you lay you then I'm hittin that clutch
It's where the blacks rub, what, fuck your back up
My dubs be filled with dust when I bust you definitely feel
The rapture... ha ha... HA HAH... HA HAH!
Aiyyo! Feel what I feel, see what I see son
Break your neck -- secretly blown, talico style Doc
Trace the sketch -- according to verbal recording hot
Bricks underground detox fuck up farm crops
Yo beautiful! Cut the cabbage and sell it as pharmeceuticals
I react - the baddest juvenile bite off his cuticles
I'm stone, to the bone, flip poems that roam further
I serve the murder then beef it to ham-burger
* Redman skats, I can't follow it * but I'm only kidding
Knowin' god damn well that's hard to spit
Fans call me mix tape arsonist, marvelous, in the hood
Everyday, wanna star? Check an astrologist
Fuck fuck fuck bitch I'll bust a nut all over that gut
Buck buck buck souflee you lay you then I'm hittin that clutch
You know, papi chulo with the fucked up grammar
So much Spanish ass, niggaz think I own Copa Cabana
Shot up Santa, got more tools than, Hanna Barbera, check it
The clues I left was hard for cops to Etch-a-Sketch it
Serial killer that tracks pussy in every borough
Kidnap ya, tie ya down, drug ya, kiss the girls
Klack automatics no matter the pressure the static (KLACK)
I blow you by two miles, cut my lights and hit the hazards
Fatal, duckin from pussy police in LeSables
Biggest thing since getting earrings pierced in your navel
High, Funk Doc, Roni Size keep the herb twistin
And now get the Ampegs real hot like jerk chicken
Ha ha... all right one more time...

Negro, funkin it with the style in your ear bro
To make you Fear me like Cape without Robert DeNiro
You big pussy, so funky that you have to douche me
You can't hear me then my record label didn't push me
I know I'm sayin' fuck too many times in my rhymes
But if I wasn't bad, I wouldn't freak it in the line
But it don't seems to matter cause my shit get fatter and fatter
I'll do the funk in your face and it slaps ya
How does it feel with the face full of funk
With the bass in your trunk, weed laced with the blunt
I puff, I never got snuffed, bust while I dust your monkey
Ass off then I just crush on the hush hush
So if you want a taste of the funk from the gutter
Ask the brothers (why?) 'Cause I'm bad (word to mothers)

Reggie Noble's stinkin ass will not be performing with us tonight

K to M Keith Murray keep keep it on
Keep keep on, ya don't stop
Keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
Keep keep it on, and ya don't stop

K-Solo, Redman, ya don't stop
Erick Sermon, Keith Murray ya don't stop
I X'd ya amateur, damage ya, have fools jumpin' off
Cliffs grabbin their ass cheeks yellin' GERONIMO
It ain't a problem at all when K solve
Three-hundred and sixty degrees rhymes or boulevards
Are charged, by my entourage,
Who put the Ram in Dodge, rasclaat and bumba claat
Maintain, few remain in the game
So I remain focused, hip hop's the main aim
Well it's the Funk Doctor Spock, the pon cock lyricist
My mentality's so def yo I ain't even hearin this shit
Biscuits be cockin' back when I be comin'
I guess they heard how I be takin' MC's out by the hundreds
Wanted, for two million and a body alone
And use the microphone as my accomplice
Scientist, field-trippin', thinkin'
What the fuck is this funky fungus that growed amongst us
Sprayed a few, shank a few, rap crews say they shamed too
But can't hang two, like we do
Fuck them, they better bow slow
This rhyme'll cold hit em, real quick 'cause I'm K-Solo
Battle any dude, this retifuge I'm in cruise
See what the better vet, could do, to you undouche
You three groups, four punkses at a time
I box two and knock 'em out at the drop of a dime
The long faced murderer
Servin' over two billion motherfuckers a day like Mickey D's circular
Workin a shifty hour like a burgular
My crew herbin ya, like we never even heard of ya
Odds are evens, that I'ma be the one creepin'
Minute niggaz check the flows of the major deacon
The bazaar, the rap non-superstar
When I step up I pump volume like rah
My afro blows in three-hundred sixty degrees
So this makes me, the light skinned Richard Roundtree
Vocabularies very loquacious
And gregarious, pump that too, go grab the dictionary
Fly word that we flip on the M-I-K-E mike
My crew be like, this style's hype
Wrong's the opposite forget the bullshhhh
To rhyme like the K-Solo, you need more than a soul kid
Come closer, while I lock it down like I'm supposed ta
You battle me, you won? You might have, but then you woke up
My turbulence will make peanut butter choka
Call me tha Brick City, Stock Cock Broker
Y'all niggaz is fools, playin' with hood moves
You couldn't total my amount if you sung I Missed You
Dissed you, dismissed you, yeah, I fixed you
Let your girl suck on the shit that I piss through

Drunk enough to start a campaign on ass kickin
With my nigga Keith who give assists like Scott Pippen
For MC derelict whippin, cap or cock twistin
Drop your money in the slot if your block don't got
A real representer cocked for action like my block got
Rhyme skills three and a quarter for them drop tops
Your caliber, straight up pussy who pop glocks
While I kick facts react on funky tracks
Give me room like the Hyatt while I run this jungle habitat
And if I snap get that monkey off my back
Me and mikes together roll tighter than Slick and Vance Wright
Toast to the real MC's that can feel me
And if your bitch ain't jumpin' now then later on she will be
All these weak punk MC's kill me
They don't feel me, come to Jersey get jacked like Jill G

But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks

It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now...
... On your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O.
Whiz with the bends I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket

Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut

Ask Toni Braxton who got seven days of action
Black stars or moons eclipse the volume
Bang zoom I'm sendin honies on the moon with ten bags of boom
Ridiculously I will pimp an MC
To degrees I leave spots like chicken pox, check the synopsis
I grow confusing just like Rubik's cube boxes
Float like the butter, fly so what if I
Blow your lenses, tear the fuckin' hinges
Did I mention that my lyrical format gets more ahs than a dentist
When I'm in this, the knotty-headed era causes terror
Y'all gimmick motherfuckers better get y'all shit together
One for the money and two for my peeps
Nynex can't even reach my technique or rap sheets
For the Squad I lick two shots word to God
Then take y'all dreams and imaginations
To the darkside"
71,Keep on '99,2000,Doc's da Name 2000 (1998),,Redman,"Intro: Dave Rockin' Reel
It's about 40 degrees out there
I know all you out there listenin to these sounds
Humpin and a bumpin out in your Jeeps
Well, ah... you tell 'em Moe (*fart sound*)
That's right, and right now, we're gonna hit you off
With one from Redman, and uh, it's about uh
Well... Ooh Ooh Ah Ah, he's gon', LET THE MONKEY OUT
(Redman)
Ha, Chi-Town in it
Yo, yo-y-yo-yo
Now first of all I be the Doc smokin' blocks of hash
Alert your fag ass commissioner when I harass because
Hood regulation is, no infiltration
If it's hot to your crew, then it's hot to the next patient
I'm in The Bricks like backspins on the mix
I'm not a playa, but y'all hatin' me like I'm a pimp
These cars y'all talk about, the Doc already whipped
You bout to go downtown bitch, like Tha Shiznit
Overseas bangin' cot in the parkin lot
I'm overdosin in a Amsterdam coffee shop
And when you lust for hardcore music to bust
Trust that nigga who bubble mo' than Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus
Static, niggaz actin' all dramatic
I'd rather smoke cabbage, in the chair gettin' tatted
My P.O. tried to violate me for the habit
Because I walked in the office rockin' straight karats"

Wanna take e'rybody wit'chu
Forget one, lemme get two
(Redman)
Yeah! Yo, hey
I love travellin and seein people
Showin the ignorant my color skin is equal
I like tryin' different thai food and seafood
Makin' my episode of life another sequel
I like flyin on Delta and Continental
First class, playin' them elevator instrumentals
I'm in the window, got on my headphones
Listenin to Big Pun and Wyclef Jean
It's like Exxon, I get gassed up
I shuffle 'round the board like Cassius
That's us when the plane land, hey man
It ain't hard 'cause I can do it like a caveman
Fix my Ray-Bans, I hit the hotel
Do my show, get my money, hit the hotel
Sittin' at the hotel like ""Oh well!""
I call shorty that I met today at Modell's
Go girl, it's like we in The Matrix
I'm in a new city, with suitcases
I'm overseas with bills with new faces
And if you're not about that you need a facelift
Yup!

Lemme get two, lemme get two [3X]
Lemme get two, bartender lemme get two
Yo
If it's a high life you seekin' then you say it
Cause how the hell you gonna win the game if you ain't playin'?
I'm in Monaco, swimmin in the deep end with 3 dimes, this ain't dominos
Well maybe it was, I set 'em up to knock 'em down and go
The skeletons in the closet, I'm makin' a new deposit
She was never so erotic till we got to the ex-o-tic
-Tic, now I'm thinkin'
That this time bomb is about to explode
Got me wishin that it was different than money, contradiction is funny
I just told y'all to play the game if y'all wan' eat
The truth is it's what you make it
That's why I got my baby girl naked
Long before I bought them tickets to Turks and Caicos
We love each other, beyond under covers
That's why I'm feelin' so high like them Wright brothers
Fly, I hope it never take material
For you to get yo' Applejax cereal, here we go

Blunts rolled and your girl with a big ole butt
Now let it go, now let it go, now let it go
And I'ma go head smoke somethin'
I hustle hard for I try to get a quick meal
I throw my hood up like I'm on one wheel
I let it go, middle finger in the air when I'm riding in my truck
When I see your bitch, done deal
That's why I'm going hard like Garnett
I say when it's over, until then all net
I ain't had a chance to shut down the mall yet
Ellis let's get this money, I'm on it
I'm jeans and hoodie maybe a little Louis
My family got it, think like little Stewie
That's why we fly to Miami just to get groupies
I said ""Mommy, let's make a movie""
She said ""Stop, no don't"" I said ""No, don't stop""
Look at me, I got my niggas and my city on top

Strip the dirty clothes, hit a 118 cookout
I woof out, son you better buckle in
I write the madness, got ink foamin at the pen
I tear a ligament when I spit it in the wind
I got so much game I can Con Edison
Yeah chicken stand by for exposure
Shut your house down foreclosure ya in cold blood
(Yo 'cause) Shut the power out in your house

If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P.
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black when I'm makin' the moves
Similar to the new Playstation 2
I can't help it if the club only packin a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down in 3
And you ballin ass niggaz, whose dressed to kill
For the hoes showin the toes with extra heels (man!)
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a carLOAD of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggaz hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500, through the door of the bitch

Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed Doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out
I'm outside of the line and I'm actin' a fool
Like a three o'clock bully, waitin after school
(Punks!) I've been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helpin my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pidgeon with her wig in
Jump, move, crash, smoke, drink
Shake that ass stank, the fuck you think?
Poppa Bear at the table, and the porridge is pourin
Since +Def+ is the label I belong in a morgue!
I'm walkin' half-dead, actin' senile
With bigga niggaz from jail than the one on ""Green Mile""

Gilla! Get cream like, Ben and Jerry's
Too fly to mail me, C.O.D.
Opened up my mind and let my ego free
Now the world know my government, and I'm lovin' it

You get a three minute glimpse of the icon
Your best rapper two-steppin to my song
When he don't know, he ask I write for him

Sky's not the limit, I'm on a quest
To bring back originality, style and concept
Show you how to write 16's with context
Mix it with a little Lil Wayne and KRS
That's fresh! Dummy, study the art
Study how it all began and see the part
Study how Kool Herc became King of Bronx
Learn, how to rock Wallabees and Clarks
I think I found hip-hop dawg, she right here
Listen up homey it might help your career
I'm goin' to the top 'cause I'm ready for action
Then disappear again like LaToya jackson, it's

Walls start to bleedin when my jaws is leakin'

Kick your door, shoot up the ceiling
Snatch the coke, kidnap the children
Don't start lying about your tire being flat
Or catching a allergy attack
I'll axe the battle and the bat
Saddling them ho's like yeehaw!
Bitch enjoy the tour when you're fuckin'

And smash the hardest artist regardless his steez
I'm heartless with these (you ready) cock it and squeeze
With precise precision you better listen
Guaranteed to blow your vision if we engage in collision
Talk slick and be laid out in chalk

If you need to get high, there's a mask and shit in the overhead compartment
I can't tell y'all what the weather's like 'cause my radio's fucked up
And if we should experience any type of motor difficulty
Don't panic, take one more hit off the oxygen mask
Calmly put your hands between your legs
And kiss your black ass goodbye!
I'm swift like a motherfuckin gift for Christmas
When I send my vapors off like Halls menthalyptus
My verbs and nouns shatter walls of underground
Let me be blunt: I like crackin' brews with bitches
The ninety-four era I cause terror, whatEVER
Rainin on you punks with the funk, so get your umbrellas
My guns cruise, tennis shoes, what's happenin'
I got clapped on, now I'm the one doin' the clappin
I'm Flexi Wit Da Tec like Artifacts make Memorex
Blow tape decks when I'm more strapped than latex
Felt like menopause, I make niggaz act like beatches
Yo yo that nigga Red be frontin -- with they ass full of stitches
Woo! I just don't give a FUCK
I bite your whole nipple off, sick like sickle-cell anemia
Travel around my curse universe
I'm droppin' 98.7 degrees down to Red Alert
Droppin' the slang, I'll bust your brains with the real shit
Come hit my blunt so I can make y'all feel it
Abuse niggaz verbally so call Dyfus
I'm a warrior, to the heart, but I didn't kill Cyrus
Noorotic, my style format rocks the project
I get as ill as chief of police on narcotic
Give me a time and I'll free your mind and lick your
Funky emotions, to blow your veins up with funk overdosing
Now who's that nigga that got your crew bellin?
Not with guns with funk when I rock tracks like Van Halen
I'm in the world, with Jacob's Ladder
I'm seein a lot of happy copycat rappers actin' like they got asthma
They attackin me, they slowin they rhymes down actually
They got factories with little dolls named after me
But it's no question my funk segment leave the whole atmosphere
Pressed-in, I take advantage of niggaz like I was molesterin
Newark New Jersey's what I represent
Iiiiiiiyiiiih
My brain be zoned and I phoned home to ET's home
And to hook me up with stash spots to put my chrome in
Whattup to Prince Street, Avon Ave I roll a spliff with
Fat to be passed through Bedrock and Diamond District
So what the fuck I got clapped on for my truck
Then I laughed cause fuck the cash I just wanted my tape bag
Fantastic fabulous my shit is fat shit
The bomb like Elway throw bombs on John Madden
Fuck that, let's get to the point, my shit's the joint, I roast
Motherfuckers from the East coast to the West coast to your breakfast
Voltage, I got funk for days by the buckets
PPP packs a bunch of wild motherfuckers
Hold hold hold, wait wait wait
Let me school this bitch
Yo bitch my shit is tight, can any MC do this
*Sounds of sex*
And come back on the mic?
I think not, my paper make pen leave nuff ink spots
On blocks where your punk ass still bustin' off slingshots
Talkin' shit about me when I'm drivin' by slowly
Sayin' I'm this and that when half y'all punks don't even know me
Now just for that I let your girl suck my dick from the back

Give me forty-eight bars, and I go out like gays at Billy Bear
Wear and tear, I'm wreckin for the Bricks is where
Jump in my way and get your body splattered everywhere
Conjunction junction what's your function
It's that nigga who's so swift I could lose a compass
Step into jams, with seven niggaz in a Land
And forty motherfuckers in some fucked up caravan
Drop the farenheight back down to zero
Bring Heat to the streets like I'm Pacino and DeNiro
Raw dog material, grand imperial
Talk to my shotty nigga, my ears ain't hearin you
So take heed to what I'm saying
Cause tonight's the night, and me and my nuccas ain't playing
Now do I look crazy? Deranged, maybe?
You shot first, your glock burst, but it graze me
Now time for lyrics, put up your guns
And watch me get this shit hoppin like the West was won
Got that lyrical chicken feed, for all chicken heads
Crowd your Rap City committee, like I'm (Big Leads)
Most bigger than them Melendez brothers
You need Cochran when you're fuckin' with Judge Red
Put your fingers up if you love hash and cash
I been that way since Ike Turner was kickin Tina ass
Hookers ridin' dick, like I'm a motorcycle
You wanna shine bitch? Let me simonize you
I make sure your vision blur, till you don't know what occurred
Until I black out every nerver
Foul women get served as chicken head hors d'ouerves
I drop your tops like your heads was convertibles!
Hah, if you still look up in the sky I'm still high
All the way live like Lakeside
Wann die? E (whattup son), you got this beat pumpin
The way I feel niggaz ain't leave until they up in somethin'
Pack my dutch like the niggaz in the county
Dayrooms, stay tuned, for Doc Illuminati
Up around them big butt freaks is where you find me

Cause tonight's the night, and me and my nuccas ain't playing
To my people in the back, if you're not the wack, say
Don't stop, the body rock
To my people in the front, if you're tokin on blunts, say
Don't stop, the body rock... aoowwwwwowwwww
I'm too strong for you to listen
I started spittin', that's why the brick niggaz be lickin'
They stay on magazine written equipments
And lyrics I got 'em by the shipment, where your bitch went
I'm smokin' leaky out the Lec-y, fatal
My Squad steps with the ultimatum, true dat
My muzak, move crowds, like down the hill moved crack
For those who stepped on toes, I want my shoes back
Buddy, bringin' money to your girl
For your little daughter like I'm Cutty
Twenty dollars a pop to dub me, I bug G, quote it
I see you notice how I leave microphones corroded
Hahahahaha, your staff not up to par

The double-S vest nigga wreck the discotheque
Sit back relax and while my Squad kick tacks
Then tap your man back and be like ""Did you see that??""
Ah yes, comin' from the North South East West
Hold your nose and take a deep breath, recess
We bless, mics, three times a day
Three times a night, it all equals subliminal sequels
Strictly laughing at MC's
Lyrics for years that run more than ten deep
Niggaz be like ""Ah he changed his style up""
Shut the fuck up, ya still a dick-ridah

Peep that back-in-the-day shit when that other Squad was Hit-tin

Back through Patterson, J.C. and Hacken-sack
Step uncorrect and get blackened
The assassin, find da MC's by the jazz men
I don't tote guns I tote funds
While you still puzzled how my antidote runs
Your whole vocabulary's played out, admit it
Still wack if it came out my mouth and I spit it
You remind me of school on a Sunday
No class, beatin' all King's down
Doin' over seventy, in a Hyundai, blast
Give 'em a good reason to open Alcatraz
Back, nobody got the Red shook
Been a weirdo everysince the doctor said PUSH

Sippin on Cristal with fingers up your bitch dress
Don't play close cause jealousy make folks act loc
Another nigga smoked from impression
Second guessin my verbal weapon, you're lettin
Spit, sixteen bits, come equipped
And I still walk around with the hooked up
Motorola flip on my hip, fuck the government
Drop shit, it's a microscopic topic
How I stay mo' big than McDonald arches
And uptown got the la-la spots
And bad ass hoes with 54-11 Reeboks
But still, I walk around with the grill
Cause niggaz be blinded by this hip-hop shit for real
I ain't havin' that, I'm clappin shit
Fuck this rappin' shit, I cause accidents

When our TV satellite van was stolen
We managed to get around best way possible
We had chances to see spots like
Hawthorne Ave, Hayes Homes, South Orange Ave
Avon Ave, 19th Ave, Chancellor and Bergen
19th and One-Duke; hey if you look closely right now
There's someone about to go for their drugs
Or as they would say, stash
Hey, hey buddy, you about to sell some drugs?

Aiyyo man get the fuck out! *blam blam blam*

I'm that nice
Nigga you know Red, I be at the party
Like drinking Bacardi
With somebody
Had to smack a chick for touching my face
I'm like, ""Bitch don't you know there's a gun in my waist?""
Now you don't have to ask nigga who got the bomb
I shotgun like the arm
Or Roger moms
When I pull it ya ask, ""What's Happening?""
We ain't talking, we doin' the gavelin'
It's Reggie Noble on the scene
Call me Mr Green
I got my P.O. thinking that my system clean
Before I seen her, I gargle with the Listerine
So she can turn my felony to a misdemean'
I'm like, ""Bitch don't you know who I be?""
I could go cash a check without no ID
I'm a East Coast legend, you should know 'bout me
This is for my 'hood bitches and real OG's
If you're really unaware
That we insane then tell us
I'm in my underwear
Like Damon Wayans in Colors
White tee, Air Force got 'em different colors
550 S Benz make a nigga jealous

94,Rated 'R',1992,Whut? Thee Album (1992),,Redman,"Nah nah nah, fuck that!
Don't hold me back, the Funkadelic Devil just snapped
With a rap, that's shittin on the story of Jack Sprat
So put your money where your mouth is, watch Redman house shit
And if it's beef I'll punch you in your mouth kid ('Damn!')
I got a heart but my heart is made out of nails
Word to ?Jamel?, my heart pumps nails in my blood rails
I'm not a warrior or Bavarian type of nigga
I'm just quick to smoke your family then fuck your sister
That's what type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Been thinkin' about playin' that nice guy role?
Cause every since I was an infrant I was different
Paid no attention to my moms when she ripped it
I was a hardheaded mother-eff, but had to step
'Cause she hit me with a left, then another left
That's why my brain is out of order
Because it just a quarter to manslaughter your little daughter
And do a driveby, fuck that, I walk by and I spray shit
Then carve my name in your pavement
I was Rated 'X' but I flexed
I beat up the devil with a shovel so he dropped me a level
Ain't that ill? That I could just stand and watch a bloodspill
From a known rapper, but now the rapper's no frill
Just because I made a record I'm a star, that's bullshit
What's the flavor ?Tim? (Fuck what you heard, this rated R)
Chorus: repeat 4X
""I'm rated R, this is a warning"" --> Rakim
""Boy you can't fuck with me!"" --> Ice Cube
Back to part two of the segment, the Red bend
Mics of all types, pour beer out for my dead friends
And if I didn't know ya, to hell witcha punk
And tell the devil I'll be in town for lunch (heh heh heh heh)
Got Naughty in my Nature plus I'm down with O.P.P.
The best part about it, I got AIDS, bitch!
Psych, I'm only kiddin, only do it to ugly women
Cause the pretty one's puss smell like they went fishin
I grab my dick with a tight grip, 'cause I might flip
(Yo Red, kick that hype shit on who you had a fight with!)
I had a fight with Chuck, the punk motherfuck
Tried to stab me in the gut, so I dazed him with a uppercut (BING!)
Snapped the neck on Michael Myers then I freaked it; cause it was August
And he was talkin' this trick or treat shit (Trick or treat!)
Jason my man slangs rocks like up the block
143rd and Amsterdam by the smoke shop
Norman Bates work the night shift late
Since he dresses like his momma, I pimp him and his hoecake
Bust a maneuver Freddy Kruger, dreamed about
Me havin' him scooped, he woke up with his zooks up
That caused me to cut the hands off the man with the chainsaw
Plus I got his brain pickled in a jar
So let's get down with the funk break, 'cause they tailgate
My rap style, so to cut 'em off I truncate
And rough 'em up, tough 'em up, like bust 'em up
With the one-two punch, like servin' a customer
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I know, from me, THE original P-Funk
See ya next LP chump!"

Fuck who's standin around them get close up and down and

Then leave your boxin shorts full of shit stains
You're bitch-made, you ain't a gangsta you a sucker ass
These niggaz scared of your bark {*barkin*} but bitch I touch ass
And bust back, what's that? It's Face-mob in effect
With Icarus, Reggie, Jamal and Treach
I told you that talkin' wasn't shit to me
So bitch be more specific when you spit for me
""It ain't shit to me,"" you a hoe in fifth degree
A discharge from a dick disease
You lil' maggot, part time thug for a faggot
Plastic-ass chump, you don't want no static

Real niggaz - yo

My tape is off safety, tongue the gun
Mouth to barrel, I spit, it numbs the front
""SO WHAT 'CHA WHAT 'CHA WANNNT?"" Yo, my Boys is Beastie
We grew up untamed, unemployed and eatin
You sharks in the water, avoid the deep end
We only fuck chicks that enjoys the beatings
Young Ike Turners, disco infern-ers
Concentratio camp, nobody turn up
I roll up a 'X' that came with kits
Leave you with ""Nightmares"" Dana Dane was with (niiight-marrres)
I can train yo' bitch, with a chain and whip
It, blow the block down while I change the clip
(Icarus)
Yo, don't approach me wrong, little kids call me Smokey-mon
Cause the blunts that I light set off smoke alarms {*beep beep*}
And I stand on the corner till my coke is gone
Niggaz wanna get they ice picks, poke the don
But they know I got a gun big as Oprah's arm
And I know a old lady that'll choke they moms
A attitude, that's what I don't walk without
Nigga I'ma time for it, you just talk about
Ic' is the man, and I never been to Japan
Got a Japanese bitch with my dick in her hand
This is the plan, I'm about to get in the van
Go and get rid of the man, I done did it again
Skunk I blow, then off to the trunk I go
Pull the pump out slow, dump out fo'
I'm the nigga that the streets raised
I'm the nigga that'll make 3-ways outta nigga PJ's
The nigga, that'll smack the shit out the DJ
If he don't give Icarus shit a replay
Poker flush, y'all niggaz joke too much
And my gun got cancer, it smoke too much, we
(Jamal)
First of all you gotta have balls unlike some who act hard
I was real ever since I shot out my pops black balls
I'm real, I can sense danger and tap calls
I'm real, I feel when haters wanna clap 'Mal
I look a nigga eye to eye when I speak
I'm transparent, I can see if you a killer or a freak
Or a bitch that'll do anything to get rich
Or a snitch that'll drop dime on the click
Or a fake, that'll rather see me at my wake
Or a Jake tryin' to infiltrate, give me a case
I'm real like, BITCH, get the fuck out my face
I'm real like let me stick my dick in ya mouth, give you a taste
I'm a real nigga if I don't get no bigger
I'm five-five, still knockin' out tall niggaz
We real niggaz plottin on dummies with tall figures
Real niggaz hands on forty caliber triggers
Bullets hummin, real like Redman's fifth comin'...

Bastards blunts, buddhas bullets black gats is the lingo!
Fuck a jolly jingle, old bitches break for Bingo
Christmas time I crack yak and Kris with Kringle
Gettin' funk from nymphos and scratch my nuts witcho' single
Who's the game scratcher minus the rap masters
Name is HEYYY, with the gay (?) G after
My thugs on the street with the heat, listen to me
See them diamond D.M. medallions, SNATCH! You give 'em to me
Mally G's a part of me, Icky slips his ownself mickies
In crowded armories, FUCK with Redman you're a dead man at the robbery
You'll be (?) Adebisi greasy put him on to me, FUCK THAT

Yo, where at?
Smack dab across your lips, can you talk?
Ahm ah ill uh ahm no 'em no menna no vat
Yo-ye-yo Redman, what the fuck was that?

Don't crack jokes, and pop shit
Just get it off my top lip

Oah-OK be still chill, I'm gettin' it off your grill
Wha-what was it?
Some of that pussy you ate this mornin from that bitch Jill

But c'mon, check it
Motherfuckin right
Let's get busy on this record
So we can make the dough
Shit
And make girls like Kiki Shepard get naked
On the strength!
Party with Machine and Oprah Winfr'
First class tickets, hotel bitches puffin mad blunts
Blunts?
Blunts
Blunts don't don't rhyme with Oprah Winfr' troop
Who cares what rhymes with it long as the funk pump through my Benz truck
Now you know you don't own a Benz
Yes I do and chrome's the trim
Black with a system when it's hittin I'm pullin mad skins
With Olde E sittin' in between my lap
And when brothers act up, a gun machine I pack
The original P-Funk, got the jewels trunk, a funker
When I'm sexin, my bad is bigger than any buster's
Like Max and...
Wait wait wait, could we get on with the tape?
Lights, camera, hah, action
Welcome to Red's tape, may I take your order?
It's a slaughter if you order the hit without the water
And then swallow without the damn water to follow
You might be doin' the stupid dance and win a grand at the Apollo
Whatchu know?
I'm rough, snap necks, drink Olde E, but crack Beck's
That ain't what you told me last week
Wreck anything that's wet, when I have sex
For instance, I mix with, a style that make you shit bricks
Tsk tsk, I'm musically gifted, to rip it
That's bullshit yo
Um-shat-lot, Red got crazy knots
And knots in the pots, got props from here to George Washington Bridge
I get biz, I use hats, so no kids
Fuck, I took out more suckers, than a...
HOLD UP! I don't think I can freak the funk like that
I might have to nap, because my afro is like Shaft
Puffy, fade it quite lovely and to snuff me
Get your gang, 'cause I'm Fightin with more Power than Chuck D
Chuck D from Public Enemy?
Yeah he's a friend of me
The one that say ""Brothers and sisters?""
Yeah but he's no kin to me
I'm strictly negro, I freak the style and there it goes
BOOM!
If a stitch in time saves nine, then I got shit sewed
Put pins in needles, and needles in pins
A happy man is a happy man, that, when I'm hittin skins
Fuck skins, I'm hittin puss when it's gush
Then eat it when the puss is well cooked
LOOK!
Up in the air?
No the cab
Who's in the cab? Whut Thee??!
It's Superman! WHY?
Because it's hot as a MOTHERFUCKER out here
Oh word, you bet I'm gettin' the fuck out of here man

Nahnah, aiyyo, aiyyo
Damn
I'm the bomb, ringin' off all types alarms
My palms, be swift with the pen like Lynn Swann's
Aggravated assault, against an MC
Beat him down with the mic and all types of pedigrees
It's mad real in Da Bricks, plus I roll thick
You can quote this, I'm the Moby Dick of dopeness
Bitch, walk the walk if you talk the talk
I DK New Jerz, and DK-New York
I don't push a lot of vehicles, but I push a used one
With a tape deck, if it's feasible
Tell the truth, I don't own a Lex Coupe
But I get you souped when I rock respect due
I'sa nice nigga that wanna get diced
Slice the mic device like the body of Christ twice
E Double if you feel me hit me once
(A breaker one, a breaker two)
Cause trouble to you family and friends
Let me cut the bullshit, just hand me yo ends
Got caught out there cause you a Mack without 10
Punch you in your chin
The rucker, bringer, live from Hell, but stay
Cooler than a double L
Turn a felony to a misdemeanor
Now the court subpeonaed me to get my act cleaner
Fuck that, still walk out holdin' my strap
Blunt, grabbin my weiner
Now first of all I go for broke
Check the third quarter note, I make you feel like your water broke
Can't tell whether male or female
I fucked up your frame well, the monogram can't tell
All aboard my balls, cause my dick don't got a lot of room
For the rest of y'all
Grab on my pubics, let my music take flight
Rock indo and out-do, dick run in and out yo'
Bitch, about nine inch up the clit
Can you feel me comin', yeah I usually make 'em shit
I shines MC's up for auction
So I can sell 'em on Saturday, Keith put the bat away
Let's lay in the cut, so we can break his whole anatomy down
And turn into an ass-kicking holiday
Word, I rolls with the Funklord
With more flavors than them motherfuckers on
Them Benetton billboards
He's bleeding get the gauze
He shoulda knew Def Squad crew is who I kill for
Push the clip in, slide the top back
Make sure it's off safety, in case he wanna counteract
Shit like that get me vexed
So I crack your ass like corn while your bitch crack my Beck's
Hah-hah
One deuce! One deuce
Aiyyo, catch this picture, of me in the mixture
So you won't forget the, black Jack the Ripper
Sorceror offin y'all with techniques
A universal lingo, with the odd speaks
Control more blacks than Harlem week, freak
Smokin' that leak at full peak
Peace to Greg Street, and underground radio technique
College radio, no I mack shit like Maceo
Yeah, the East coast West coast dick giver
I oughta be an alkie, the way I hit liver
Deliver, the milk to your door, real raw
Shit you never seen before
So when you come inside, and do the front
Watch the double-pump shotgun and please don't run
Relax your minds, let your conscious be free
And get money, and G's and roll these trees

Can't you smell it trick?
Wanna copy-cat my whole format
So you get funk tracks, punch lines and skull hats
Hoo! Got a little Redman in town
Who's that effin clown soundin wack with the frown??
I don't know man, but you better wonder what I would do
While loud on this staff like birds one and two

Catch the cargo, funky like a bag of Bravos
Way back, with a pump 92 K-T-U in car loads
Huuh! I just stay funky like that
Make you wanna (sssss) my style like a junkie on crack
Trick, you better back the freak up, for real now

Verse Three:
Yoo-hoo watch the birdie! While Red wreck your brains early
If rap was B-Ball, I'd have assists like James Worthy
Dribble the rock if you got the hots to get your knot rocked
Twice my device, Run-D.MC's from my Rock Box
Hey you, better Come Clean like Jeru
Before I take phase two and do another pay-per-view
To your crew, I give a boom bip to Q-tip
Standin tall like Shaq, honey I'm back, this ain't Blue Chips
The new stuff, creamin brothas like Breyer's
He's heating up -- nah, brotha, I'm on fire!
Dribble dribble shootin three pointers to the drum trick
Try to take my style, BLAOW, end one
DJ Twinz in the house for the nine-square
My man Shaft, you don't know you better ask
That bomb Chocolate City coming to you live
From the ninety-fo' era
Aiyyo you better pass that blunt, aiyyo check this out
We gonna take it to you live
Where Newark New Jersey drops that chocolate funk for ya
Everyday and all day, how we do it word is bond, word is day
Def Squad's in the house for the nine-fo', word is bond, word is day
The sad Hawthorne Ave. got the good smoke, word is bond, word is day
Knotty-head niggaz in the house for nine-fo', word is bond, word is day
Brick City brigade in the house for nine-fo', word is bond, word is day
Redman rocks on and on for the nine-fo', word is bond, word is day

Sat down and opened my mind and said it's time
For me to design the right lines
Make you one of a kind boy rough and tough and all that stuff
Sure enough I'll make the brother's change their minds
Then you understand my only principle
No need to fuck with the born invincible
I'm rated X like a porno feature
Leaving MC's dazed, and catching anesthesias
Even females get rocked when they try to cock  
Block the man from doing this hip-hop
Techniques unique and that's my word is bond
Rockafella's the name but the screaming I'll rock on"

Geah... yo
You now rockin' with the best, I'm blessed
I deliver well, that's why I'm up in the S
UPS, through rain sleet or snow
I never break down, my skin made of Goretex
Heard Reggie went left, 'cause when I do right
Punk niggaz out of spite only give me a few mics
Three best emcees, time for new light
Let the streets decide on how nice! (Let's rock the house)
You see to be an emcee is not money in the bank, or
Blowin' niggaz off like ""Homey we are late!""
A million dollar boss dictatin what I think, shit
His shooter's gettin' real nervous in the paint
Five star when I rank, like Le Armitage
Girls lookin' like Nicki Minaj, Reggie
Hip-Hop I rock steady, just check my clout
When Jersey in the building, I (rock the house!)
(Chorus: Redman (Kool Moe Dee))
Yo, you now rockin' with the best, one of the best
Best believe boy I look so FRESSSH!
Just tellin' you how I feel
(We gon' get a lil' somethin' straight here in the place to be)
(Redman (Kool Moe Dee))
Heheh, hey, they asked me how I maintain
The rap game and the streets I can picture in the same frame
You ain't raw? You don't ball
So lose yourself, tryin' to keep UP when I change lanes
My weed game green, clientele is swell
It's Cool like LL
DeBarge look alike brother, time will reveal
That I'm doin' it, and doin' it well! (Let's rock the house)
Even if you read braille you can feel my swag
I'm your seein eye dog with the pen and the pad
Blue collar, when I talk, you can touch
So FUCK how much money you can fit in the bag!
My gift is the gab, the street's the truth
They got a lil' lost when down South came through
I stayed in the booth and began to trip
Cause (can't nobody rock like me, hah, remember this!)
(Redman (Kool Moe Dee))
Yo, what you consider the best, what you invest
A half a mill' around your neck? Let me guess
Punchlines after punchline for a check
I did that, when GangStarr had to ""Get a Rep""
My city in debt, that's why I sound hongry
My flow dumb as fuck like Al Bun-dy
Ask Treach, I do it for my lonely
All y'all come and get it if you want me (let's rock the house)
Man, I'm a funny ass nigga
And haters gon' say ""He a funny ass nigga!""
But I'm a asset, good barbershop talk
The game without me is Wu-Tang without RZA
Pour out a little liquor how I murder it
Beef; my boys Fatburger it
Gilla - never heard of it? Shut your mouth
When Jersey in the building, I (rock the house!)"

Test the crew with the guns and let's get this shit on
Why, must I be like that? Why, must I pack the gat?
On my left, niggaz be rollin' with the ruckus
Ready to get deep bust rounds upon some suckaz
Heard PPP and LOD is a bunch of crazy motherfuckers
Journey to the land is on
The winner of the spittin' bomb marathon
The fuck you up lyrathon, whatever you choose
Prepare to lose that title
Turnin' vital situations suicidal, my idols, is my Uncles

Bring your craziest nigga, I'll give stitches
Whateva, go crew for crew, blow for blow
Bang your headpiece and sniff the snow off your hoe
I keep it rollin'...
Ask yourself man
How ugly do you have to be to be a hardcore MC?
Niggaz be fooled by my plaques and my light skin complexture
My whole texture is bombin, destroyin da schools of the wack
From the Land of the Lost, you get tossed
Listen to my veloc (ity), my crew's comin' off
Yeah, more sneaky than casino switches
Diggin ditches for all Moskino bitches
Clockin decimal figures, I'm gettin' out diggers
Now my choice of truck is a Land
Cause a Landcruise much bigger
It pack two to three more niggaz
Damn I hate a golddigger
Yeah, gimme that microphone
I make opponents shit bricks like Tyson's home
I keep the jacked cellular phone blown in three zones
Love seafood and keep my nine millimis chrome
So it can shine up your dome
When I proceed to give you what you need and clear spots like Sea Breeze
Wreckin your ass armaggedeon style
Twenty four seven while
My crew chin check your profile

I'm the master of disaster, super rhyme maker
Grimy by nature, database maker
Play 'em out like Sega, Saturn
Blow your blocks in patterns for about nine acres
Testes, crew wearin bulletproof and double S's
Karl Kani down, camoflouge can't hide the sounds
Of a fo' pound (boo-yaa)
Givin' you Six Flags, bustin' merry go rounds
But my crew stay ill with that unreal appeal
I be the raw water, my cheek bones outta have gills
Below like the opera
Smooth on the trigger for all you block cockers
I be the key to criminology
Blast and rotate enemies at three buck sixty
Pick me, as your Senator
Take the dove from your battlefield son, fuck Pat Benatar
Run, head for the hills
Back in the day, these niggaz rolled up on me with
The trunk filled with Bomber Brooklyns, sheeps and quartervilles
Aiyyo take that shit, aiyyo Money snap the grill
Body caught chills as he ate this nine mil
Mine kills two but my nine was sign sealed
And ready to deliver, but Money had me too close
To reach for toast, soon as that nigga blink I broke ghost
Dash back to South Orange Ave with dollar bill to smoke dope
I keep 'em rollin'...
This is DJ SAY WHAT?? on this motherfucker
Sayin' the dick is long, but my time is short
Before I go, just remember

This week on NIN, Niggers In Newark
We're gonna take you through some glorious weed spots
That my camera crew and I had a chance to visit
During our stay in Da Bricks
Although we suffered minor setback this week
When our TV satellite van was stolen
We managed to get around best way possible
We had chances to see spots like
Hawthorne Ave, Hayes Homes, South Orange Ave
Avon Ave, 19th Ave, Chancellor and Bergen
19th and One-Duke; hey if you look closely right now
There's someone about to go for their drugs
Or as they would say, stash
Hey, hey buddy, you about to sell some drugs?
(Redman)
Aiyyo man get the fuck out! *blam blam blam*

This here, is the telephone line
Of one of the many top notch weed sellers out of Newark
Ladies and gentlemen, what I will try to do
Is tap into the line, and hear an actual drug deal in progress

Verse One:
Rock on, rock on, yo here comes that Funkadelic
I come wtter than Purple Rain, I bust brains, the funk Doctor
Spock, got the glock, now I'm smokin' out your sess spot
I rock from here to Bedstuy, I hit the spot like XY
Who is that nigga that's comin' six billion feet
I roll my funk and find tone even smoke up blues with 18th Street
I cut massively with sneaky styles like Dick Dastardly
Look at the letter-coated afro like my man Shaft would be
The new vroom, crisp like chicken and Chinese food
I'm just like The Whispers here to put you in the mood
(Jumpin' Jersey) Yeah you heard me, got more family than the Partridge
Roll the red carpet for Red from here to corner markey
You're tryin' me, I'm a menace of society, right

Droppin' the verbs and nouns, antonyms and homonyms
Covering my dick, plus I'm diesel like all of them

Verse Two:
My momma used to tell me turn that shit the fuck off
So I had to play like Foxy and get off (get off)
My shit was thick I bought a clip then cocked my own grip at honeydips
Cause moms made enough loot just to pay the bills with, beeitch
Selling bags from uptowwwwn
Me and Lester put our money together now we got the block locked down
31 to local A-Train's, Hoboken
I took the back way, New Jersey transit cops were open
I'm hopin, that they don't go inside my boots
'Cause we had everything, from jewelry to thai-one suits
And ClienTEL, I'm drinkin' Ballentine L in hell
So Redman rock well before our record sell
Then my moms crib was jacked by the jealous
(And if ya ain't come back) Is what the base-head used to tell us
(Yo fellaz!) Our whole scheme sinkin like boats
Cause Les mixed biz with pleasure when we shoulda stuck to lactose
But every good thing comes to a end
With no ends, on the block, sellin weed again
My moms tried to make me go to school, I just didn't listen
Got locked up, now I'm all in the system, listen
Verse Three:
Whassup! I tickle your putty-cars with my loonie raps
On groovy tracks, I make new jacks catch convulsions like groupie acts
From my city I spread it all like Jiffy
It's a mystery, my spliff be live like 145th be
I mold like clay, and roll dice just like Andrew
I stay strapped just like bamboo, my crewsa got mad handle
Whatever, the weather be, I got mental telepathy
So throw your bombest rapper and watch me intercept MC's
I keep my car underground just like the Lords
Even though I'm known, like all the four wheels on the course
So let me pull up to your bumper like Grace Jones
Cause my shit be WAY off the hook like pay phonesssah! *dial tone*"

Hung your shoes from a telephone wire

I squat up, 'cause I'mma set up this kid, carryin loot out
From Burger King and what I'mma do is...
Run up on him, SNATCH the bag of money, then bust the dummy!
Cause my man when I think of a plan there's no shorts take
'Cause I pack jammies inside of my Nordface, coat
Had the black brother on scope
No joke's what I am cause the man's a pure pro
(Yo my man you got a light?
Yeah give me the effin money too G!) Yo STOP STOP STOP!
Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well so I got down to the business
Opened up the bag it was filled with paper
I thought I freaked the funk but now starts the caper
'Cause I was set up, now I have to go head up with the cops
What they carryin? Black Glocks (shit's thick!)
What's the next move? My life's on the line
Bullets in their clips and none in mine

So I kicked it, upped the digits, terrific
Not knowin' she was scopin me 'cause I was MAD splifted
Later on that week honeydip freaked the funk
Playin' Redman and Erick out like two chumps
Callin him weekdays, callin me weeknights

Things got cozy one night like dynamite
We stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts
No hats? Went Funkadelic
Took a splash, you know how that go fellas
Two months later (see you later alligator)
She was pissed and, I ended up seein my physician
She took a blood test, she took a head check
Looked at me thinkin', ""Why the hell he isn't dead yet?""
Then I asked her, ""Why you lookin' at me?!""
She said, ""Redman because you have the HIV""
Called Erick and his set, that girl, don't mess around!
Too late, cause Erick already had his drawers down

To all my brothers wear your hats wear your hats
You can either get with this or you can either catch the claps
And to my sisters, make 'em wear they prophyl-lastic
'Cause it's drastic, havin' another ghetto bastard
Think I'm vyin for a piece of butt? Honey you must be nuts
You better settle for a wet kiss so pucker up
Cause you end up messin around catchin the heebie jeebies
Lookin' like WHODUNNIT? Witcha face up on the TV

Every week, check stubs to show the judge I got a job
Damn this; Soopaman used to stack them chips
Now I'm broke cause little kids riding Batman dick

And I'll let off before I push broom on HBO for Mr. Show

Police is lookin' for me, call the mayor he'a hang up
Nowhere to run to and Brownstone even know it
So I pack the fo'-fifth, and the ice on your wrist, forfeit
No game; slappin all hoes who got the fame
Then I rob 'em with chickens who got phone bills in they mama name

Zip my zipper down bitch and start suckin
Get your anus wet for long dick fuckin""
""Ooh, I like the way you talk, just Put It In My Mouth""
""Yeah, and I'ma keep that shit in when I'm comin""
Fucked for thirty-six minutes and twelve seconds
""Hit it from the back yo"" oh yeah bitch no question
Turn that ass around, she had tattoos of names on her back
She said, ""I keep track""
I started readin her back I couldn't believe
I read one name it said EPMD
I turned her ass around I said no it couldn't be
It was the J-to-tha-A-to-tha-N-to-tha-E
Her pussy walls grabbed my dick so I'm stuck
So I burnt that ass from that blunt hash that I lit up
""Owwwww!"" She jumped up, puffed up, started yellin'
I smacked her, cracked her, put her in a full nelson
""Okay, okay, okay, okay, I give up
Besides Soopaman Luva, I think I hear my nigga""
Aiyyo car pulls up, he steps up *skreech* and stick his keys in
The door opened, I snatched him up for no reason
Gave him a two piece with a biscuit, laid him out

111,Soopaman Luva 5 (Part I),2001,Malpractice (2001),,Redman,"Somebody stole my mojo! Yo, once again...
Soopaman Luva flyin through the fuckin' sky
I'm lookin' for my mojo, I'm fried chinky-eyed
My cape is still tore up, but I make a lil' money
I'm like Ace Ventura, duckin my landlord
The land of the poor, where I handle my biz
I got a weed spot on the block Hannibal live
Pokemon on the pipe, Rudolph the deer Red-Nose
Glow in the night, when his nose gettin' right
I pimp Snow and Vanna White on the hoe stroll
Dr. Ruth on E, sippin Old Gold
Mr. T on crack, mohawk cornrow
In South Park with the Chef, in the stolen Ford
I'm lookin' for my mojo, where it at?
Got a APB on it dawg, where it at?
I ran into Cita, from BET
She said, ""Man is a nigga, that's fast on the trigger
I thought he was you, when we had the party for two
My girlfriend said the same, majority rules""
Damn! Who takin' my women?
Who takin' my chickens around Thanksgiving? Now that's pimpin'!
Called my man Meth and Bishop Don Juan
He smokin' a blunt, other sippin Sean Don
He said it ain't the game, but how you play it
So I can't hate the game, so I'm dyin' to play it
Now I'm back in the air, ready to put my smack down
I'm searchin for the impostor to pat down
I'm urgin to put the glock up and clap rounds
It's curtains like Jimmy Hoffa, he not found
So ride on me, try homey
Your plan'll fail like the Acme Kit from Coyote
Now I'ma find the bastard that stole my juice
Soopaman Part Five, in your archives
(Singers)
I'm yo Soopaman baby, that's who I am
Flyin through the air, without a care
I'm high as hell blazin', that Cali weed (Kryptonite for life)
That Kryptonite bud, that sticky green
I'm yo' Soopaman (he's yo' Soopaman) I'm yo' Soopaman
I'm yo' Soopaman (whoa yeah yeah yeah yeah) I'm yo' Soopaman

Aiyyo yo fuck that!
Aiyyo I gotta find my motherfuckin mojo
Aiyyo Reggie Noble, aiyyo Reggie Noble c'mere nigga!
Aiyyo start it off while I tell you how it went down
Yo, yo
Put the drop down, get your smoke on
Get your feel on, are you feeling?
Get your girl on, get your squeeze on
Get your bus on, are you chilling?
Are you wheeling, are you feeling?
How you feeling? And we gon' hoo-ooh-ooh
(Tell me what you doin')
C'mon, yo yo-yo yo, yo yo
I had to put the mash down, throw the cash around
Stay focused, on the case put the hash down
Jetted through the air about five miles per hour
My mojo gone I can't fly like I wanna
But this case is easy, find that motherfucker that
Couldn't wait to be me, put his face on TV
From the tec blow, I asked my ex-hoes
Pass off some info for a pair of X.O.'s
Write the check low, I don't do that
I told you that shit before when I boned your back
Now I'm back to square one, and everybody hatin'
So I popped the flare gun, now they all escapin
Ran into Gator, from Jungle Fever
He's my people and my neighbor, I said I need a favor
He said for ten dollars, and for ten Whoppers
From Burger King, I'll tell you the nigga who gotcha
Gave him what he wanted plus the extra large fry
He said blue eyes, blonde hair, a white guy
I said... what the fuck goin' on?
A white guy interruptin my fuck flowin on?
So I copped some new ammo, reloaded my flare gun
Stalkin like Rambo, mixed with Commando
Gator pushed the ten-speed bike, I'm on the handle
Crashed into somethin' 'cause he high off my man blow
I jumped up and backtracked myself
Who's the last hoe I fucked or throat I cut?
I said wait a minute, yo, that bitch Jane on the prowl again
I bet she up to no good, actin' foul again
Yeah, yeah, it ain't nuttin, I get her if I want her
Matter of fact I'm gonna 'cause she live around the corner
I walked up scared with my hands on my flares and my armor
'Cause she bring drama like Jeffrey Dahmer
But I heard fuckin' all the way from the bottom
I'm like, damn she yellin'! Kinda made me jealous
Knocked on the door enraged
Like a broke-ass rapper, at a label that ain't toured in days
Do it clown, before I count to four now
'Cause if I hit five them flares'll blow your door down
I heard the zipper zip up, and they was tryin' to run
So I re-clipped the clip up, and blew it before one
FREEZE MOTHERF**KERS, I jumped on Jane back
I WANT THE CHEESE MOTHERF**KERS, and my name back
We tusslin, fightin, bitin skin and rustlin
Slaps in the face, chokes with the belt buckle and
Her knees bucklin, I thought to myself
""Where's that motherfuckin white guy she was fuckin'?"" then
Right out the blue {*CLANG!*} Owww! {*birds chirpin*}

Hit four chicks, then avenge like folk brothers
Then rob a bank teller
I'm sorta like old yella, call me for trouble
I got chop for bullets that spread out the umbrella
I'm advanced boy, da doc bigalow, the man whore
Got Ms. Incredible and cat women on amcord
When neighborhood or city in a drought
Fuck a boat I could fly there, 300 an ounce
Reup my account, wear and durag and I ain't got waves
I only got haze pumpin out the bat cave
So when I'm flyin through ya hood it's a hit nigga

They tryin' to do me like kim, throw me behind bars
What am I gonna do?
Fuck that I'm comin'
With a gun like willis so you could feel drummin
I creep in when the lights out, sneak in to get you out
Lo jacks on my ears to tell me where your where abouts
'Cause I air 'em out, sneak in though the West wing
Laundromat, duffle bag thinking of the next thing
[G:] But I'm in the East wing
[R:] Damn my shit broke
[G:] Hurry up nigga, this water look piss cold
Hold tight for me, I'm already in
I'm in the kitchen corridor, climbin up the vent
I'm hot so hurricane so it might take me awhile
So when I get ya we gonna roll like mickey and loud
Here we go, Yo, Yo the Soopaman Luv
Crawlin through the vent like that dude in breakfast club
I made a pit stop, seen a freak in the shower
So I gotta quick pop, pimp slapped her with powder
And told her if somebody asks you, you seen nada
And every week I come fuck you with marijuana
[G:] Okay if you looking for Hurricane over there
[R:] Oh shit, Hurricane
[G:] Hey yo get me outta here
Hey yo C.O.'s watchin
Gotta move like grown men
Cause a distraction
Like the food gave you stomach pain

I rush in with rubber gloves off the ambulance
Gun in one hand, the other palm around the nurse mouth
On the count of three this is how it's gonna work out

Verse One: Redman
Well it's the Soopaman Lovah in your motherfuckin town
Get down go round and round like shocks on your G-spot
Honeydip, now all of y'all up in that funny shit
But I ain't switched, still a honeydip is a honeybitch
In the mix! So bitches be lookin' fly and I'll run in em
With they toes and nails done, hair wrapped up with pins in em
Fifty-four eleven Reebox bitch which you need not
To do is get fly, 'cause where I'm from, bitches get speed knots
Slow your monkey ass down and hold your horses
Don't wanna know your name don't wanna know none of your sources
Just fix me, with a quickie, I swear more Lake's than Ricki
So bad I use my X-Ray vision to give y'all clits a hickie
And plus the weed I puff is from the planet of Cheech and Chong
Where the earth is chronic, and How To Roll a Blunt is the theme song
Ooh you makin' me horny! Well uh, let me wipe that wetness for ya
Slurped and burped, got that bitch more open than my door do
Let's take a journey up in the stars where I live at
Where I fuck Jane, Judy Jetson, and that robot bitch-ah
Grab onto the cape and uh... I said before I took her
Don't choke me! And it's up up and away I took the hooker
And it's on
Verse Two: Redman
We landed on my planet, we smoked out like a fuck up
Bought a dime from Jabba the Hut and some uncut for the hooker
She said, ""I don't sniff blow I just smoke weed to get me horny.
So I'm nothin' like that bitch in your last Soopaman Lovah story.""
You go girl! But I didn't believe her, had to make sure
Where you from, the projects? ""Yeah, but I'm single.
You needed a quickie and I'm just that bitch to break you off, shit
My pussy's so good, it tickle my legs when I walk!""
Oh really, just show me a couple of ways how you'll thrill me
She lifted up her dress and the whole area got chilly
""So what you think of that?"" I threw that bitch back on my back
Shit I live ten miles away, but I made it fo' seconds flat
I lived in the same building with Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk
Got R2D2 and Mork from Ork puttin' in work
See I got the block sewn ""Ooh baby let's get it on!""
About time, I opened the door she had her ass and tits showin
She rushed me to the room and stripped me out of my attire
She tied me to the bedposts then she lit the room on fire
She took out a scarf wrapped it around my eyes till I was blind
But with my X-Ray vision I saw the icepick from behind
So I broke out the ropes, smacked the hoe, then suplexed her
She pulled out a Tec and wet my chest with the S1's
""Oh shit I'm shot!"" There was blood all over my finger!
I think I left my other bulletproof suit in the cleaner
She gave a whistle, they came in crews, word is bond
It was a bunch of Martian bitches with bodysuits and Platforms
""Damn, I gotta think of a plan, whatamIdo?
Did Superman have a gun?"" Nah, but the Soopaman Lovah do!
So I pulled out the fo'-fifth, left the bitches open
Had another clip in case some mo' bitches want mo' shit
And I saw that trick Bewitched flying on her broomstick
Pa-dow! Shot her down because I leave no witness
Job well done I cleaned myself in a hurry
Oops! Gotta catch this blunt session

The rap criminal, my artifact is hard to tame
Bitch wanna complain, no use in barkin'
'Cause we can go neck-to-neck like Pam and Martin
And smoke like a carton of Newports nigga
On my New Jersey shit, and New York nigga
Check out the nigga flow
I knock out the mic like Buster Douglas, bitch leave a nigga broke
And Jigga know when I clutch the pen it's fuck them hens, I'm puttin' paragraphs in the figure 4
Fuck tryin' to take a pack of protein, 'cause when I brawl Ima' be strapped like four [?]
Blow smoke rings in the meetin'
If I ain't gettin' half of what I sell you ain't eatin' niether
Our leader won't take no shorts, I know betta'
This D-O-C, MVP for Vendetta
I'm always on point, never skip of slip
My bitch stay tryin' to kill me like Mrs. Smith
If I carry two cannons, no time to pull out
I bust through the side of my jeans like Bruce Banner
My dogs do it on camera, and to them
I'm Big Brother on my [?] for Gammafide Gamma
I ride like a rider should
And when a bitch blow Doc she be famous like Monica
Hardcore in the blood, get the best in line
Put the eye into yo' watch 'cause I'm pressed for time, nigga"

Give them a punch of the funk, knock all of their gold tooth loose
(Poo pow)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on
You can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of 10
Then 1, 2, 3 You're pinned
I get action, so everybody jump wit your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk

To do what I wanna do, to do it like dynamite
The work perfected, when the funk been ejected
I roughen up the rough draft to like make your head split
Punk! Pass the 40 and the blunt and don't front
On the block, 'cause when you do front, brothers are gettin' stomped
I'm not a addict, more like Puff than Magic
Then pass it when I'm through cause my crew gots to have it
I don't claim to be a big rap star
Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar
So listen up and take heed to what I'm sayin'
Cause tonight's the night and me and my niggaz ain't playin'

You wanna see me get cool, please, save it for the breeze
Cause the lyrics and tracks, make me funky like cottage cheese
Fuck the smoov shit, I get down wit the boom bip
Like Q-Tip, I kick more styles than Bruce shoe's kick
But tonight's the night what I write tonight
This type of funk with the flavor like Mike'n'Ike's
Hanging out wit my niggaz, my niggaz
The {Pack Pistol Posse} keep they fingers on the triggers
I keep the 40 between my lap, coolin, rollin' down the highway
Blunt system pumps 'cause it's Friday
Roll over to pick my boys up, we raise a lot of noise
Cause, we can do that black, so get the bozack jack
Remember, I do the type of evil that men do
Like cursin out my window at a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch
And watch the ba-BUMP, ba-BUMP, make ya speakers pop
That's the funk, when it pumps it makes your rump
Jump, jump, jump... jump, jump, jump
But if you want to see a fly but frantic
Cool romantic, more Slick=er than my man Rick
You better check the Yellow Pages under smoov shit
Cause Red ain't down for the bullshit
Niggaz fucked up by letting me make an album (How come rude bwoy?)
To get on the mic and let my fuckin' style run

All my shorties skippin school watch truant
Hit the college dorm, make freaks out the students

And hoes come in all colors, I'm fingerpainting

I'm 360 but not your label deal
I get all my bread, I ain't splittin' a dime
I'm too tight like that leather that's fittin' the Fonz
I ain't grippin' a nine
Boy I'm a motivator, motivatin' the jungle, gettin' that crack gator
You irrelevant bater, Gilla House the hardest
The vampires of the game, start wearing your garlic
I ain't a alcoholic but say damn
He took it back to the afro and the Ray Bans
It's Gilla House we breaking all the rules
And every thing we drop is undeniable

I'm too grown to bullshit with you broke ass niggas
Half on a nickel bag, I smoke ass niggas
Forty years old on the block still hustling
Head need Rogaine, bed need Just for Men
Bitch niggas full of estrogen
Dog I'm a boss but I still work hard as a Mexican
Grimey as hell, slimey it smells
Check my rap sheet, I spent most the 90s in jail
Off pills, I feel like George ""the Animal"" Steele bananas
With the blammer get your cantaloupe peeled
For the cake I push pies, my block the bakery
Boy I put you to work like a temp agency
Plus the rhymes you be writing is wack
I know white chicks that write shit tighter than that
We robbing you for the valuables
This the Gilla House grind, undeniable

Look, let me list a few reasons they call me the beast
Cause anytime I see rappers, I think of a feast
And I ain't talking chicken shack, I'm thinking [?]
So anytime you think of Red, you think of the East Coast
No disrespect, I'ma rep for mine
And I ain't saying I'm the best but I'm the next in line
That's why my nickname ready 'cause I'm stretched for time
Nigga lock it down is on the dotted line
When I rhyme, it's sort of like a violent crime
So if you get caught with my verse, you do a 3 to 9
Hard minutes of ass whippin', I'm passed different
I play the front like the lead vocals you ad-libbin'
See I'm a giant who, more than liable
To bring the riot through and turn all beef into lion food
Now what I gotta prove, I passed all obstacles
So when it comes down to my talent, it's undeniable"

Flavor like Flav, plus I'm well paid
Own a maid with a plaid, mack daddy of the decade
At a slow rate, I sparkly like Colgate
My dick's name machete, I stab much hoe-cake
I don't have a car, but own a pair of Reeboks
It gets me where I'm going, until my damn feet stops
On and on like a switch, bust the mix

To make me boom to zoom with the tune
To make the cow jump back over the moon
It's Reggie Noble, yeah, I'm feelin' kinda so-so
I dog you like Toto, make Rudolph nose blow
Funk out of site with the type of hype
To make you say umm, a dy-no-mite!

Verse One: Hurricane G, Redman
The Hurricane G is the ultimate funk, pop the trunk

Representin, comin' out of Brooklyn, Flatbush
You wuss, you can't push push in the bush
Well uh, let's take a journey to hell and beyond
Where the bomb grows on palms, and bags labelled Cheech and Chong
The Jimi Hendrix of rap, I got an afro and
Bandanna, then I rock jams like Santana

Red and Hurricane G, SO HOW YOU LIKE US NOW?!?!
Chorus: repeat 4X
(KRS) Watch out! We run New York

Verse Two: Hurricane G

On the rhyme since eighty-nine
It's all in your mind, but what's yours is mine
Your dough and your hoes Bump N Grind to my rhymes

And uh, fuck any bitch who can't hang

Latin Queens in the house!
So nigga swing it over here on these big fat tits!
(Titties, hahahahahaa)
Verse Three: Redman
The Funk Doctor Spock, blast up on your block
I'm walkin' through the sewer with manure on my socks
Your style, I freaked it when I was a child
So you talkin' that baby talk like, Who's Talkin' Now?
Verbally I crush, brains erupt
Blow your focus, like you sniffin angel dust
Run of the mill I'm not, watch me kill a cock-sucker
And cause ruckus, like them L.O.D. motherfuckers
Every verse every word I preach
Represents the East, long as the human eyes can see
Gimme that funk funk funk funk funk funk funk funk beat!
I light a blunt for niggaz up in Sing-Sing
I do it to death, style is funk that's fresh
Remove your vest, you just won the wet t-shirt contest
And I'm hotter, than the Globetrotters in the Bahamas
I got a pair of pajamas made out of ganjah and almonds and I'm as
Eager, as nigga wantin my shit to dub
Cause my shit be BANGIN' like the Crips and Bloods
Troop, I flew the coop like Big Bird in Timb boots
I Skywalk the planet like my code name was Luke
From the darkside, I'm from the darkside Pah
I'm Above the Law like Steven Segall
Motherfucker!
Outro: Dr. Trevis

Indubitably, I'm Jersey down to Mitentry
Officer, you're hawkin the, ninety-three Landcruise
When it's real criminals, you should be watchin for
Get off my dick for what you don't got
Plus you probably never licked a shot on your block
Walkin' to my car witcha nine out the holster
Put your hands on the steering wheel like ya sposed ta
I cooperate don't give the redneck no hassle
Because too many mistakes be happening to black folk
I said what the fuck are you lookin' 4?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Hah hah, leave ya butt naked...
I said what the fuck are you lookin' 4?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Aiyyo stash that weed up while me and the cop is riffin
Damn I knew I shoulda got that stash box built-in
But it's all right cause me and my niggaz roll tight
We all think alike, we jump out whoever packin pipe
Don't they know who's the freak from the East?
I get faded like Chong and Cheech without bleach
And started spittin' game 'fore these cops start to reach
On these creeps, showin mentality from the streets
Even though we had a half a pound by the seats
My peeps never tweek, we handle shit when there's heat
Since one cop was white the otha was a brotha
I pulled out my tape and front page of the cover
Of The Source, told him me and Janet's on tour
Broke it down to who's my boss and who I rap for
Plus them niggaz, EPMD
Put me D, now I'm runnin' with the Green Eyed B
A-N-D-I-T, and Def Squad camp
Here's your Def Jam tickets and your autograph
Now haul ass, I got a meetin bout seven
Basically I'm saying bye bye like Guy
My license, been suspended, for about five years
The system got my ass in the jam
Can't even ride to see my fam in Alabam'
I get petrified every time I see the man throw the lights on (woop woop)
The mic's on so I stress it
Shit I'm haulin ass before I start undressin
Niggaz on they knees with they hands on the top of the
Heads while the Feds crack jokes with the glock in ya
Don't get me wrong I know a lot of cool cops
That'd let me go if I had two glocks and oowops
But, I don't, so, I keeps it, real
The five hundred series with deep dish peels
Quick, my bitch, stash, two clips, between two her tits
Before the cops fuck with the Rrr-ah
I'm a nigga of today a nigga of tomorrow, beyotch!
To my people in Kentucky rock rock on word is bond
Newark New Jersey rock rock on word is bond
Atlanta Georgia rock rock on word is bond

To my people up in Queens rock rock on word is bond

A STUD six-two, I'm huntin down hoes with
No drawers on and, buttoned down clothes
Don't brownnose just join it
Ecstasy pills, with Buddha Man signs stamped on it
Jam on it, the +Blair Witch+ wouldn't camp on it
I block and shine like suntan ointment
You do a dance when I layer this clip in
Only dude with a bike with air conditionin
Fuck the Feds your door, Red'll kicked in
So prepare to wear SCUBA gear equipment
I wet it, my tape underground leakage
It hit the air and you'll swear you found Jesus
The man who turned out the Summer Jam
Not with a mic, I brrrrrrrrrrrr, tuck it in
The noise keep the helicopter hoverin
Your boys is dead weight when I muscle in
I need a +Hot Girl+, a +Ryde or Die+ chick
Mainly a hot chick ridin' Funk Doc dick
Smell it, when the odor airs in
The gorilla shit, hoes in polar bear skin
The chronic stink up the overhead bin
When I... yo, Redman struck again!

I'm, on the roof, guns under the armpit
Yellin' out, ""Yo sawed off, hand on the pump
And I'll pump a cannon first man that jump"" {*clik-clik, BLAM!*}
I got a punch that'll cut your beard up
Doc is like warm when you touch my earmuffs
I wild out, throw blows
Somethin' about Mary rode me in a Ford Explorer
The pressure at time five remind me
That y'all can't eat like it's Ramadan week
My mascot was built for kamikaze
If it fails, L.O.D. right behind me

Yeah yeah put metaphors inside a bracket
Def Squad's in the house AND MOTHERFUCKER WE CAN BACK IT
Come test your skills for real with a bomb bang boom bang
The sound makes your brains wet
With The Color Purple on a freight train
The devil's the conductor
Then take a trip to the darkside motherfuckers
My funky pattern takes interludes around Saturn
I'm more diesel than evil meant evil like Sebastian
Don't try this at home kids, I zone with ET's
And other alien type of MC's
So throw your shit up in the sky, cause Redman's about to get live
Like one-two-five
I smoke High Times magazines when I lounge
And broken mics and cords is left, winicumuhround motherfucker"

This is WKYA
Funky [?] is on the mike right now
We taking all callers that been to the West coast
That smoked that West coast bomb out there
Call us up: 1-800-MONEY11 that's 1-800-MONEY11
We are WKYA
(Redman)
When you need that bomb, holla, bud lava
Shit to lift you up, Impala, roll that Obama
Redman stick like commas
Did I smoke the club out?
Yeah, your honor
Three strikes, my lawyer won't budge
Me doing time? I'm a cannabis judge
What up quick? When we flash the cannon
I clear static like rapping near antennas
Bananas, ape shit, bomb
Triggered the White House alarm
From inside the bracelet
Wordplay, it's like Thursday
'Cause Friday you get paid and your pockets thirsty
Chicks barefooted, they love to do
They know I can't wait on them for new shoes
Unless they in two, erotic nuns
Brainiacs raising they college funds
(Redman)
And the highs may come and go
But the weed gon' stay around
As long as I keep a blunt (long as I keep a blunt)
Won't be fiendin' (be fiendin')
WKAY nigga
And the bitches may come and go
But the weed gon' stay around
As long as smoke that bomb (ay call us up!)
Won't be fiendin' (be fiendin')
(Redman)
Yo, I'm Muhammad Ali with the mike
With a little Ike, Turner
Roll with Tina, my burner
International earner
Plug in anywhere I'm a
Worldwide converter
Massive to the masses
Take a class on longevity
I'll play you the track list
Each song like a seminar
So you get your snap back
Like epsom vinegar
Trunk shit, to break your neck to
Redman to the rescue
My attitude, soul food, a little bipolar
Boy, I'm a test tube of Dr. Jekyll
That's why niggas me'll last
Strut through the hood
Where you need a pass
I'm doing 140 on the needle dash
And my car, hub, like the Martin cast, nigga
(Redman)
(And as long as I keep a blunt, won't be fiendin')
We taking all callers that been to the west coast
That smoked that West coast bomb
(And as long as I keep a blunt, won't be fiendin')
Yeah, call us up
WKYA
(Redman)
And the bitches may come and go
But the weed gon' stay around
As long as smoke that bomb (ay call us up!)
Won't be fiendin' (be fiendin')
And the bitches may come and go
But the weed gon' stay around
As long as smoke that bomb (ay call us up!)
Won't be fiendin' (be fiendin')

This is WKYA, We Kickin Yo' Ass radio
All you motherfuckers out there that wanna get down with the pound
Put your motherfuckin pounds up, and start bustin' the motherfuckers
Am I too loud for this motherfucker? Turn me down a little bit
Yeah yeah yeah
Yo, first of all I'm a grown-ass man, pay my own bills
Stated own real, haters gon' feel
Direct Syndrome, mouth with cold tongue
You bounty hunters be on the chase for Joe Young
I won't slip, keep pink slips to my car
I'm raw like sushi bars on bougie broads
I retrieve the money, dawg labrador
Ray Charles can see it, and Stacy Lattisaw
You get mashed out, cause your bird is peckin
Don't be the next vinyl cut to Urban Legend
I can feel where you at, when I pound you up
You out of town coke rhymes, oh you clowns is up
My crew stay in the truck, can't fit in the Porsche
If you bitches ain't happy, then get a divorce
I'ma do what I want, cause my time is now
Grab the whole rap game, and divide it down
If I wanna roll a Jeep with a seat out the back
Bitch feet out the back, system beat out the track
Am I wrong for dat? (If that's what you like)
Dawg, am I wrong for dat? (Hey, I guess not)
Yo yo, if I walk into the club with my hand on my snub
Beatin' down security 'cause I don't give a fuck
Am I wrong for dat? (Mmm mmm)
Dawg, am I wrong for dat? (Say WHAAAAT?!)
Yo Keith, yo yo Keith
{*Sound of jail door opening*}
(Keith Murray)
I copped the whole box, went half with Reginald
Hollow tips infrareds and (?) clips came free
And you ain't gotta believe me, fuck bein nervous
Far as I'm concerned they're at your funeral service
What do we have here? Snitch in despair, shoot off his ear
Have his whole body shakin in fear
Stormtrooper fires throwin' lashin out flames
A few ashes, when they analyze your remains
I live in the streets, reside with the toolie
I kill you like it's part of my religious duty
Street sweeper thug keeper sweepin thugs under the rug
Even females who think they thugs
Trigger the release of adrenaline
When I'm gangsta-trippin' like the Bloods'n'Crips'n'them
Unleash the matter of energy, killin' 'em
Why'd you do it? Because I wasn't feelin' them!
(Redman)
If I ride through the hood, smokin' a ounce of haze (uh-huh)
With a shabby haircut, pants I wore for days
Am I wrong for dat? (I don't think so)
C'mon bitch, am I wrong for dat? (Say WHAAAAT?!)
Yo, if I want a fat chick that keep her toes done (uh-huh)
When they playin' my song ass spill out the thong
Am I wrong for dat? (Got that big ass)
Am I wrong for dat? (Tchk, no)
I gotta, bang the boogie to that bang bang pussy
To that bang to the pussy the beat, beat
And if yo', bitch ain't sippin that Cristal shit
Then she might be leavin' with D, D
I got a hairy-ass chest, like Austin Powers
That bitch that ""Stan"" drowned, I fucked around with her
Act like a man, stand on your own two
Doc takin' it all, fuck who it belong to"
142,Wuditlooklike,1994,Dare Iz a Darkside (1994),,Redman,"Eeeyeah
Wuditlooklike, to all you trick bitches
And you punk ass niggaz out there
I'm talkin' to you live from WFDS
We're From the DarkSide radio
It's about two thousand degrees down this motherfucker
But the funk just don't stop
As we take y'all fat roly-poly asses on another journey
To the darkside...
Verse One:
Wuditlooklike? When I wipe off my sweat
Verbally I'm Untouchable like Elliot Ness
To the best of my ability I rock any facility
And fuck the yellow cabs I smoke buddha out deliveries
I'm just as high as the fuckin' friendly skies
When I'm, open, you can't even see my chinky eyes
Cause the buddha I smoke, is no joke, when I'm loc'ed
Then I wet it, then you be like -- that shit be soaked!
I'm saggin my... Karl Kani...
And Two Black Guys when I get busy like the L.I.
Well I, swing it back and forth like a leaf
Without traffic I flow like the B.Q.E.
But I can pass niggaz straight out of first-class
Then leave 'em huffin and puffin like first day at Lemans class
PPP, got the glocks and techs
And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck
Chorus: repeat 4X
I said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)
Wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)
Verse Two:
A-hem...
The Funk Doctor Spock blow the watt through your box
I come hotter than Treach, you bet about callin the cops
Because (this type of funk you don't hear on the regular)
Rock six seven eight nine ten (to eleven ta)
Knew my style got more powers than Cocoon
Zoom your focus, I drop the mic and leave it smokin'
When I'm vexed, my concepts Wreck like Effect
Verbal communications blow to the next ep
I'm robbin your brains with antilogical, phenomical
Suicidal with lethal type funk spread your nodules
Straight up the weight up plus I max like a Beta
Boy I fuck your head up like a blunt that's laced up
The boogie verbalist, vocalist
I get open with, puttin' scannings on the fake soloist
My style reachin' down like Ike, switch up like dykes and
You'll be tellin' your psychologist wuditlooklike
Verse Three:
Wuditlooklike suckers, punk motherfuckers
Bitches be actin' funny, don't wanna show me no love 'cause
They think I'm crazy and like mentally sick
Ah, give 'em the dick then they quiver like fish, then I
Smoke a pound of herb a day, and yo
Some bitches say, I'm the Mack like Maceo
I don't be that I just beez the funk disease
That leave MC's, recognizing like Sam Sneed
The funkindominal, I bring drama to any rendezvous
Rock three-sixty-five, twenty-four, Monday through
That other shit, makes them other ship, flip
Funk ridiculous, inconspicous with lyrics
A-uhhm, oh-seven-one-oh-three's where I from
Been gettin' dumb, every since Harlem World used to jump
And that's for all them hardrock niggaz that's comin' in flocks
I bust off the glock for the hood and the block"
143,Wus Really Hood,2015,Mudface (2015),,Redman,"Redman in the building, everything smokey
Shades on, got the Ray Bans and the Oakleys
Hit the strip club and nobody knows me
I start throwing cake around like Steve Aoki
Now they approach me, saying I'm vicious
But I'm like Shaft coat, I been in the trenches
When I do a show, when it's over, bitches
And when you do a show, when it's over, crickets
Get a quick drill then I'm back on the oven
Cooking food for thought, metaphor McNuggets
SuperBad bad and y'all McLovin
I don't wrestle but even hacksaw Jim Duggets
It's flow after flow I keep punchlines
Blow after blow, I rock socks with the gold at the toe
I don't like to brag but my horsepower
What makes Samuel say ""Who dat nigga on that nag""
Never sell out, remain true to my era
Masta Ace letter to the better
When Special Ed jumped out the Jetta
With Eazy-E hung with Jerry Eller
Before OJ said ""I'm a killer""
I was murderin' cats and they ain't have a clue
Even now I turn cats to Chinese food
Redman on blast, my piss excellence
The bud I got greener than the Grinch
Let's get it
Roll your blunts and light the bud
And keep your gun on you just because
Because everybody wanna be rich as fuck
But when it's your time, you ain't sayin' much
Quiet on the set, what's really hood nigga
You ain't riding with a tech, what's really hood nigga
Nigga I'm brick city, either die or fuck with me
Sign me a check what's really hood"

Gilla (yo) Gilla
Yo, Brick City, when it comes to grabbin steel
You could post me down low like Shaq O'Neil
You'll be spittin' what I spit when the day is over
Tryin' to be me in the mirror, sayin' it over
Yeah, he's all right, but you not real
I'm a dog, shit I eat the food I steal
Floors ain't dirty enough
My game is like carryin shotguns and 21 rough
Doctor, I'm like the war on drugs
I don't stop, I'm all night vampire blood
Underground {?}, since a kid
I finger-painted in the mud, with dirty work gloves
I'm in yo' college campus corridor
You should call me Uno the way I +Draw Four+
Brick City law, strip to your drawers
Boy now I can pick up two pair from the mall
It's time for Doc to check yo' ass nigga
It ain't hard, it's an EZ Pass nigga
For the paper, I'm offendin neighbors
Runnin' my label out an old Winnebago nigga!

Ooh, shoulda knewwwww

Yo, uh-oh, Redman back in your town
You'll get drug nigga like wedding gowns
After 12, whattup to Dogg Pound
I roll out, like my earrings got ball bearings
Give me a Grammy to show my mammy
How I smash these Raggedy Ann and Andy's
I prove that I never left the street
I just knew I had to come back, with extra heat for y'all
B-More, are ya ready? (ready ready)
Colorado, are ya ready? (ready ready)
I'm at your neck like a Doberman mouth
With like 40 muh'fuckers out the covenant house - ya heard?
Gilla House in the circuit
And how we do it on purpose, only way to surface
Def Squad is the foundation
Three dawgs attached to 98 dalmations
(Yeah, where them Gilla niggaz out at night, at night)
You better run till you see the light, light
Yo, I know I had you waitin
But Death was chasin me and my eight friends for +Final Destination+

Okay now, take off your shirt, and relax
Let all your tensions out, just relax (Gilla)
Just relax (Gilla, Gilla, Gilla)
Just relax (Gilla, Gilla, Gilla, Gilla!)
Yo, I keep my ears to the street cause that's my job
But even the streets can steer you wrong
I'm walkin' with one man above me
Nuttin on my waist, but if it's on you hearin the palm
You forgot I'm ten years deep, and out them ten years
I got two weeks of sleep, and caffeine free
Amazin right? I got a street team
That'll get paid to snipe, yeah by any means
I'm behind the curtain, my Betty Shabazz
Hope I make it home; I invade alone
Catch you in the truck, babblin on the phone
I miss you, I stick up your chaperones
It's a dirty dog world, say it louder
Every +Friday+ I'm bein chased by Craig's father
That's why I'm on the low like pro
And my file is too hi-tech to call next
I got a heart the size of John Q's son
And on the mic, I'm him times two of 'em
Y'all niggaz get your shit together
Cause Gilla House niggaz, prepare for whatever
(Chorus: Melanie Rutherford (Redman))
Youuuuu, you shoulda knewwwww (yeah)

I G off C 4 lyrics to blow off them Lex door
My tex-ture be the kind that explore
MC's then blow 'em out, metaphor after metaphor
I'm more wetter than your boy bigger
So how you figure you can fuck with this rap unemploy nigga
I should own a fly bitch house and a Benz
But I got chickenheads criminals and broke friends
That love to get in, keep the seventeen spinnin
Pull out from my jaw linin, commence to split end
Brains and body parts that motion couldn't picture
'Cause when I'm shittin niggaz hit mo decks than a skipper
Mr and Mrs Howe, MaryAnne and Ginger
Gilligan, you need the Professor to take the rigger
Waters out I got orders to kill 'em softly
I wouldn't leave a trace if I died and police chalked me
Who's the Boss G you better radio the walkie talkie
For the Fatal Attract MC's that stalk me
Got a big dick and your bitch click
When I flip this I got more work than a olympic gymnast
Bust it, I cut the mustard, on any track
Milkier than Similak when I'm next up to bat

Fuck the talk I walk whatever I claim to do
Knock a mule on her ass and turn her pussy black and blue
You couldn't run up if your Fighter was Virtua
I'm a round-the-clock lyricist, I sleep in my work boots
It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
It's a thin line between the trigger and the finger of a thirty-eight
Deaths by far, my rap repatoire
Be the art of murderin makin' it hard for you to spar
We can chill and puff the ganja, but don't be mad when the
Funk Doctor Spock smoke it with your baby mama
Get off my dick and tell your bitch to come here
Male groupies gettin' shaky when I come from the rear
Hah, that get on your nerve neighbor that play the
Music loud as fuck three in the mornin off a paper
With mad Zul in the L-S-C
In the downtown area, scannin the perimeter
All my boos with the open toed shoes
If you ain't gettin' that pussy eaten right, let me show you
Then let you taste these, this Brown Fox said
Ain't No Nigga like the -- Funk Doctor Spock G
(Yesh yesh y'all, and you don't stop -- Sermon 4X)
As I dive into the crowd
I wanna see who the fuck gettin' loud
Who da fuck runnin' off at dey mouf?
I let my nigga Fifty Cent knock that ass out
Word bond, bitches talkin' bout pourin out Cristal
And Dom P they better stick to Sade
Blackin out whylin, smackin out weaves
Break niggaz cheap ass chains and medallions
You're just a part time sucker in the game
Shit is real motherfucker start namin names
And if you name my name I whoop ass like Steven Seagal
Give you Under Siege 2 without the fuckin' train
Let your brains hang from the 808 bang
And if I wrecked your cipher then my Squad is to blame
(Yesh yesh y'all, and you don't stop -- Erick Sermon 12X then fades)
We'll be right back with some more funk shit
For all you stankin asses after we pay these bills"
